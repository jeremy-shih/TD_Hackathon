All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question and answer session at the end of the conference. I would like to remind you that this call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Patrick Flanigan, Vice President, Investor Relations at Celgene. Please go ahead.","Patrick Flanigan ","Thanks, Nicole, and welcome everyone to our second quarter earnings conference call. The press release reporting our financial results in addition to the presentation for today\u2019s webcast can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the corporate website at www.celgene.com.","Joining me in the room today with prepared remarks are Bob Hugin, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jacquie Fouse, our Chief Financial Officer; Mark Alles, who is Global Head of our Hematology and Oncology franchise; and the Global Head of our Inflammation and Immunology franchise, Scott Smith.","As a reminder, during today\u2019s call we will be making forward-looking statements regarding our financial outlook in addition to regulatory and product development plans. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those forecasted. A description of these risks can be found in our most recent 10-Q on file with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today\u2019s date and we undertake no duty to update or revise them. Finally, a reconciliation of the adjusted financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available as part of the earnings release.","I would now like to turn the call over to Bob.","Robert Hugin","","Thanks Patrick, and thank you everyone for joining us this morning. I appreciate the opportunity to update you on the excellent results of the quarter and the significant progress achieved advancing strategic corporate initiatives. Operational excellence is the foundation of our business model. Outstanding results produce the resources that allow us to invest in the discovery and development of tomorrow\u2019s transformational therapies, and our teams across the globe are delivering. Our businesses across functions and geographies have outstanding momentum. The strong revenue and earnings growth reported this morning reflect the excellent operating performance of our teams. Increased Revlimid duration of therapy and accelerating global launches of pomalidomide and Abraxane in pancreatic cancer fueled substantial volume and revenue growth. This strong performance supports raising our full-year financial guidance. Jacquie and Mark will discuss the results and our outlook in greater depth in a few minutes.","Capturing the full value of our franchises is the highest order of corporate priority. We\u2019re making exceptional progress in building for the future. During the quarter, we strengthened our hematology product portfolio with important new clinical data in MDS, AML, and mantle cell lymphoma. The future of our hematology franchise was further enhanced through meaningful progress on strategic collaborations, including ACE-011 and ACE-536 in beta thalassemia, and exciting data in targeted relapse refractory AML with AG-221. We\u2019re aggressively moving these programs forward with our partners, Acceleron and Agios.","During the first half of the year, our oncology programs were advanced by the initiation of Phase III studies testing Abraxane as an adjutant treatment in patients with surgically resected pancreatic cancer and as maintenance therapy in patients with squamous non-small cell lung cancer. In the second half of the year, collaborations are positioned to evaluate Abraxane, Revlimid, CC-486 and other pipeline assets in combination regimens with emerging immuno-oncology therapies. Mark will outline some of the key studies that are accelerating our impact in the hematology oncology field. Over the next few quarters, we expect significant increased visibility on our next generation of registration track studies. ","Building a market-leading inflammation and immunology franchise is also a key corporate initiative. Our U.S. team launched Otezla for psoriatic arthritis in April and are making outstanding progress in building the foundation of a first-class launch. Scott will detail many of the metrics that give us the confidence that our team is fully capitalizing on the opportunity of building a new market for this innovative oral compound. We look forward to launching the psoriasis indication later this quarter following FDA action. We could not be more excited about the progress and potential of Otezla.","Expanding and accelerating the development of our pipeline is essential to sustaining long-term growth. We are making outstanding progress in building and advancing one of the highest potential pipelines in the industry. During the quarter, we expanded our late-stage pipeline with the acquisition of GED-301, a potentially transformational product for the treatment of Crohn\u2019s disease. Scott will outline the significant second half milestones in this promising program.","We also accelerated our internal and mid-stage research programs. Among the four novel development candidates named last year, we expect to advance at least two to IND by year-end, including our novel anti-CD47 antibody from Inhibrx targeting innate immunity. Our CC-122 inhib program is advancing in novel combination trials in CLL and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, showing activity in settings of high unmet medical need. We\u2019re also initiating clinical programs with our next-generation JNK inhibitor in fibrotic disease, and in scleroderma with our INI inhib, CC-220. Our research teams have identified novel biologic targets providing new insights to advance our existing and emerging programs in protein homeostasis. ","Dynamic companies proactively evolve to best capitalize on market opportunities and to maximize the potential of their assets. During the quarter, we announced organizational changes designed to position us for maximum success in the years ahead. These changes provide Mark and Jacquie, outstanding leaders, the opportunity to have an even greater impact on our organization. In Mark\u2019s new role as President and Chief Operating Officer, he will work with our franchise leaders to drive operational excellence across our functions and franchises. Jacquie was promoted to President, Hematology\/Oncology to leverage her strong leadership, outstanding business expertise, and strategic perspective.","We also significantly enhanced our leadership team with the addition of Peter Kellogg. Peter is now on board and is in fact in the room with us today and will become our Chief Financial Officer on August 1. Peter brings a wealth of industry knowledge and expertise to our leadership team. Welcome, Peter. The energy generated by these leadership changes is already positively impacting the organization. ","This morning, we announced another important leadership addition with Dr. Rob Hershberg joining Tom Daniels\u2019 team to lead our immuno-oncology research and early development initiatives and to establish our immuno-oncology center of excellence in Seattle, Washington. Dr. Hershberg joins us from one of our collaboration partners, VentiRx, where he served as CEO. We welcome Rob to the Celgene team.","Midway through the year, we have achieved a number of important objectives. Our exceptional operation momentum has us well positioned to deliver on key milestones in the second half of the year. It\u2019s a very exciting time at Celgene.","Let me now turn the call over to Jacquie.","Jacqualyn Fouse","Thank you, Bob. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us on our second quarter call. We were extremely pleased with our second quarter performance and the momentum we have in the business across all of our major drivers as we move into the second half of the year. The underlying trends we built coming out of Q1 drove our Q2 results, and we feel great about the start we see already for Q3. Our teams are delivering strong execution today while strategically we also continue to add to our investments in the future. You saw examples of this in Q2 with our acquisition of GED-301 and our opt-in to the Agios AG-221 program.","Our total net product sales growth reached 18% and accelerated in Q2 for the year-over-year comparison versus the prior two years. We are very close to reaching the $2 billion per quarter level for our global product sales, and I\u2019ll look forward to celebrating that milestone with you and our team. Of the 18% product sales growth, 14 percentage points, or about 80% was volume driven. Price in the quarter contributed 3 percentage points. We expect the full-year global net impact of price across our portfolio to be close to neutral. ","Our P&L performance remains robust and adjusted earnings per share grew 18%, slightly faster than total revenue growth of 17%. Our team produced earnings growth that exceeded revenue growth even while we invested in our inflammation and immunology franchise and important launches across the hematology oncology business, and while we absorbed the impact of generic azacitidine in the U.S. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.02 lower in the quarter than it otherwise would have been as a result of our $2.5 billion May bond offering and expensing the premium we paid on the additional equity stake we bought in Acceleron. This 18% growth in adjusted earnings per share came entirely from operating income growth. The net impact of all financial drivers together was neutral. ","Revlimid\u2019s sequential growth in the U.S. in Q2 was impressive at 12%. The demand trends we saw at the end of Q1 produced the strong quarterly result. Growth and demand trends outside the U.S. were also very solid with about 2% sequential growth in Europe off of a very strong Q1 for that region, and the rest of the world is in good shape, though we saw some impact from distributor buying patterns in places like Latin America.","Branded Vidaza\u2019s solid growth continues outside the U.S. at 6% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. The U.S. continues to be impacted by the entry of generic azacitidine that began at the beginning of Q4 last year. Abraxane\u2019s momentum is strong, fueled by the ongoing rollout of the pancreatic indication in the U.S. as well as the launch of that indication in Europe. The product grew globally 17% sequentially and 39% year-over-year. The product\u2019s performance in both lung and breast is also quite solid and contributing nicely to overall sales. Pomalyst\/Imnovid\u2019s growth trajectory has been and remains outstanding. The product delivered 19% sequential and 143% year-over-year growth globally. The same positive drivers we saw with the U.S. launch are now playing out across Europe and contributing to an excellent launch there.","As Scott will discuss in a moment, the commercial metrics we are seeing around Otezla\u2019s launch are very positive and will drive strong growth in the second half of the year. Q2 revenues of $5 million reflect the impact of the sample product in titration packs and additional non-revenue generating product from bridging packs provided to patients while they waited for script authorizations to come through. We are highly confident in our forecast for Otezla sales for the second half of this year and beyond.","Our P&L dynamic is excellent. Our revenue growth and attention to operational excellence drove our adjusted operating profit margin to 50.3% for the quarter and 50.4% year-to-date. All key P&L line items are within our range of expectations. SG&A expense year-to-date reflects the ongoing impact of investments in our INI franchise as well as launches within the hematology oncology global franchise. This number should trend downward as a percentage of revenue over the second half of the year. R&D expense year-to-date reflects the mix of a large portfolio of evolving clinical trials, some leverage of fixed costs, and the impact of our business development activities, including milestones that can be unpredictable quarter to quarter and year to year.","Our cash from operations generation remains strong and growing in line with our earnings growth. We continued our share repurchase program in Q2, albeit at a slower rate than Q1 as we try to be opportunistic on the timing of our purchases within our clear ongoing strategy for repurchases being our preferred way of returning funds to shareholders. We further supported our capital structure management strategy with a $2.5 billion bond offering during Q2.","Our return on invested capital performance and trends are robust. We are focused on generating improved ROIC over time while investing appropriately for the long-term health of the business. The way we have chosen to show ROIC on this chart is conservative as the earnings base reflects U.S. GAAP earnings, and we show you both gross ROIC including cash balances, which are now just over $6 billion, and net ROIC where the invested capital base excludes cash and investments. As a reminder, the 2014 ROIC calculation is done on a trailing 12-month basis in this slide.","Completing our Q2 financial picture, I am pleased to update our guidance by raising product revenues to over $7.5 billion for the full year, up from a range of $7.3 billion to $7.4 billion. We are also raising total revenues to approximately $7.6 billion from $7.5 billion. We are raising the lower end of the Revlimid sales guidance and tightening the number to about $4.95 billion from a previous range of $4.9 billion to $5 billion. The revenue increase drives an increase in our adjusted earnings per share guidance to a new and tighter range of $3.60 to $3.65, post the stock split. This EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted weighted average share count for the year of 835 million. The other specifics of our guidance remain the same.","To summarize my last quarterly earnings call as Celgene\u2019s CFO, I\u2019m extremely happy with and proud of the performance and results that our teams around the world and across all functions have delivered in the past and this quarter, and what I expect they will deliver in the future. We are strong across all of our major metrics and are investing in the future in a way that is positioning us with a unique profile to generate strong top and bottom line growth for a very long time into the future. The best is yet to come.","Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Alles","Thanks Jacquie. Good morning everyone. As you heard already from Bob and Jacquie, our global commercial group produced outstanding quarterly sales results and our clinical and regulatory teams made significant progress on a number of high-value development programs. Let me briefly share what we have achieved and where we are headed.","In the second quarter, hematology and oncology product sales growth was impressive. Sales were up 18% year-on-year and 8% quarter-on-quarter to $1.840 billion. Driven by increased treatment duration and sustained leadership of the global multiple myeloma market, Revlimid continued to demonstrate very positive demand growth. Pomalyst\/Imnovid is rapidly becoming global standard of care for patients with relapsed and refractory myeloma who have received two prior lines of therapy, and Abraxane\u2019s second quarter results benefited from greater U.S. demand in pancreatic cancer and lung cancer, and the rapid and significant uptake for metastatic pancreatic cancer in those European markets in which local reimbursement has been achieved.","During the second quarter, a total of more than 200 abstracts, posters and presentations featuring new and clinically meaningful data were presented at AASCO, EHA, and the ESMO 16th World Congress on gastrointestinal cancer. This concentration of clinical information provided additional evidence supporting our cornerstone therapies \u2013 Revlimid, Pomalyst\/Imnovid, and Vidaza in hematological malignancies, and Abraxane in pancreatic, breast and lung cancers. Also during the quarter, we advanced key programs that could lead to one of our next new therapies in hematology.","We are excited about the data from the ongoing Phase I study of AG-221, a small molecule oral inhibitor of the mutant form of IDH-2 discovered by our partner, Agios Pharmaceuticals, that was presented at EHA. These results summarized the activity and safety of AG-221 in 35 patients homogenously defined with the IDH-2 mutation positive relapsed and refractory AML. Treatment with AG-221 demonstrated a very high objective response rate with a very manageable safety profile. Given these early but promising Phase I data, we exercised our option to an exclusive worldwide license to AG-221 in June. This is now a high priority program and we are rapidly advancing plans to conduct global registration trials. ","Investigators at EHA also presented important and encouraging data from two Phase II trials of sotatercept and ACE-536 in patients with transfusion-dependent and non-transfusion dependent beta thalassemia. In conjunction with our partner, Acceleron, we are on track to select one of these agents to enter a pivotal Phase III study in beta thalassemia by the end of this year. ","I think we are just now beginning to realize the full clinical and commercial potential of Revlimid. In the second quarter, our global commercial teams generated record quarterly sales of $1.214 billion, growth of 15% year-on-year and 6% quarter-on-quarter, and we are preparing for the future. We are making significant progress advancing our global newly diagnosed multiple myeloma strategy. Our marketing application is under active review in Europe and in the U.S. the PDUFA date is February 22, 2015. ","We now have the final positive results of two important Revlimid randomized studies in MDS and mantle cell lymphoma. Let me briefly review the top line results with you. As you know, MDS 005 is a randomized Phase III study testing Revlimid in patients with low risk red blood cell transfusion dependent non-deletion 5q MDS. This placebo-controlled study met its primary endpoint \u2013 Revlimid demonstrated statistically significant improvement in red blood cell transfusion independence. Treatment with Revlimid was also generally well tolerated. These data have the potential to establish the value proposition for Revlimid in all classifications of transfusion dependent lower risk MDS. ","We are preparing the review the MDS 005 study results with global regulatory authorities. The MDS 005 results have the potential to further strengthen our leadership position in MDS and AML. As you know, Revlimid and Vidaza are already established global standards of care for well identified subsets of patients with MDS and AML. ","We are now seeing the encouraging but still emerging profile of AG-221 in AML. We intend to use the results of Vidaza Phase III AML 001 study to pursue regulatory approval in AML for Vidaza outside of the United States, and we are advancing two Phase III placebo-controlled studies evaluating CC-486 oral azacitidine in low risk MDS and as maintenance therapy in AML. We believe that this important disease franchise is very well positioned for significant future growth.","Beyond myeloma and MDS, we are working diligently to validate the potential for Revlimid to become a standard of care in lymphoma. We are pleased that patient enrollment is complete in the Remarc study of Revlimid maintenance therapy in newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. By the end of this year, we expect to complete enrollment in the Phase III relevant study testing Revlimid plus Rituximab in first-line follicular lymphoma. ","Other important studies of Revlimid in combination with Rituximab, particularly a Phase III registration study in patients with newly diagnosed activated B-cell type diffuse large B-cell lymphoma will be initiated over the next several months. At the same time, we are preparing to engage with regulatory authorities to review the results of MCL-002. You will recall that MCL-002 is a large randomized Phase II study testing Revlimid in a broad population of patients with relapse and refractory mantle cell lymphoma. Relative to an active control arm consisting of investigator\u2019s choice of therapy, treatment with Revlimid demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of progression-free survival, and the safety data were consistent with the known profile of Revlimid in this population.","The global Pomalyst\/Imnovid launch continues to exceed our expectations. Second quarter sales were $161 million, representing year-on-year growth of 143% and quarter-on-quarter growth of 19%. In the United States, sales were up 17% quarter-on-quarter driven by increasing duration gains and third-line market share trending above 30%. In Q2, international sales grew 21% driven almost exclusively by Europe. The Imnovid launch in Europe is now supported by early access in Germany and the United Kingdom and positive reimbursement decisions and market access in key countries, including France and Spain. We expect sales to accelerate further as other major markets gain reimbursement during the second half of 2014 and in 2015.","Turning to Abraxane, year-on-year sales increased 39% to $215 million. In the United States, the ongoing launch of Abraxane plus gemcitabine for metastatic pancreatic cancer and steady growth in non-small cell lung cancer combined to grow quarter-on-quarter sales 13%. Market share in metastatic pancreatic cancer is approaching 40% and we continue to expect peak share to reach approximately 55%. Led by Europe, quarter-on-quarter international sales of Abraxane grew by 28%. We expect to receive additional reimbursement decision in key markets, including Spain and Italy, throughout the second half of this year and in 2015. We continue to receive global marketing approvals. The latest approval was in Canada just last week. ","For more than 15 years, we have been focused on deeply understanding and modulating the immune system. This expertise and the scientific advances we have made present Celgene with unique opportunities to develop new immuno-oncology clinical development strategies. For example, Revlimid is currently being studied for the treatment of various hematological malignancies in combination with the anti-CS1 antibody elotuzumab, the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab, anti-CD38 antibodies, and anti-PD1 antibodies. Each of these combinations represents the potential to significantly improve disease outcomes and to achieve blockbuster commercial status.","Our internal and alliance-based research and development programs are advancing a number of innovative agents targeting high unmet medical needs. Some of our top priorities include the development of the anti-DLL4 humanized monoclonal antibody, demcizumab, in multiple solid tumors with our partner OncoMed, CC-122 and other next generation small molecule immuno-modulatory agents, our oral macrophage checkpoint inhibitor anti-CD47, AG-221 for AML, our CAR T program in selected malignancies with our partners Bluebird Bio and Baylor College of Medicine, and there are many others. We think each of these early-stage products has the potential to disrupt existing treatment paradigms. At the same time, we are rapidly advancing multiple complementary and potentially synergistic development strategies with our in-line and pipeline agents in combination with the various T-cell checkpoint inhibitors. ","Our second quarter results and the significant operating momentum generated by a number of high-value growth drivers make us extremely confident in our outlook for the rest of 2014. The success of our ongoing global commercial launches, the multiple catalysts for Revlimid growth, and the promise of our innovative pipeline make us equally confident in our longer term outlook.","Thanks very much, and I\u2019m pleased to welcome Scott Smith to the call.","Scott Smith","Thank you very much, Mark, and good morning to everybody on the call. Q2 was a transformational quarter for Celgene I&I, highlighted by a series of major milestones, including the encouraging commercial launch of Otezla for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis in the United States, significant advancements in moving Otezla forward in a number of important indications, including psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, Behcet\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis and possibly AS, as well as the acquisition of potentially transformational (indiscernible) for the treatment of Crohn\u2019s disease, GED-301.","First, I\u2019d like to talk about the Otezla launch. Critical to any launch is the ability for patients to access medication when prescribed. To date, our formulary coverage is better than expected with 80% of patients being able to start Otezla without having to fail a biologic. Additionally, a number of plans are allowing access to Otezla without requirement to fail methotrexate or other DMARDs during this early launch period. We are pleased with the reception Otezla has received this far within the payor community, and we will work to continuously improve our access footprint over the course of this year.","We are very encouraged by the launch trajectory of Otezla over the first 15 weeks. There are already over 4,000 patients on Otezla and the IMS data shows the strongest initial prescription performance of any recent single indication launch in this therapeutic space. Additionally, sales are accelerating and we expect revenues in July to meet or exceed total revenues from Q2.","Initial sales force execution has been excellent. Over 8,000 unique physicians have received Otezla presentations, and to date over 1,000 physicians have prescribed Otezla with the majority of those prescribers generating multiple prescriptions. Otezla brand recognition has jumped to 96% amongst dermatologists in just the first few months.","Looking specifically to the PSA market, based on syndicated market research of high prescribers completed in June, Otezla tied Humira for the number one branded product for new treatment starts in PSA, ahead of all other brands after only three months. I believe this shows the potential of Otezla to transform the PSA treatment paradigm. When we look at product switches within this category, Otezla was the number one product switched to when patients are discounting current therapy. Being the number one in both new patient initiations and patient switches bodes well for future growth.","While we\u2019re pleased with the initial uptake transfer of Otezla in PSA, we are also working diligently to prepare for the anticipated launch of Otezla in psoriasis. The PDUFA date is September 23, but we will have the dermatology sales force hired, trained and operational by August 1. We believe there is a tremendous opportunity for an oral product with the profile we see for Otezla in this large important and underserved market.","We will have lots of impactful data being presented at medical meetings in the second half of 2014. These data include nine abstracts and two oral presentations of the Esteem psoriasis pivotal data focusing mainly on the 52-week data at EADV in October. EADV is the largest European dermatology meeting. We have submitted 19 abstracts to ACR, the American College of Rheumatology meeting in November. These abstracts again focus on the longer term data, including a 104-week update of the Palace 1 trial. We\u2019re very excited about the potential presentation of this two-year data as we continue to see improvements in efficacy beyond the strong observed data seen previously in week 52, with no new safety findings during this period.","It has also been confirmed the GED-301 Phase II data will have an oral presentation at the next major GI meeting, UEGW in Vienna on October 21. Additionally, we anticipate publication of the Phase II data in a leading medical journal by the end of the year.","Q2 was a transformational quarter full of significant milestones for Celgene I&I , and there will continue to be important events and milestones throughout the remainder of 2014. The early launch metrics for Otezla were strong with a solid base of access and demand being built. We are moving forward to expand the Otezla opportunity on many fronts, including the anticipated approvals in psoriasis in the U.S. and PSA and psoriasis in the EU in coming months, and we are looking to expand our footprint to other geographies in 2015 and beyond. We are also actively investigating Otezla in four other new indications.","At the same time, we are expanding the overall footprint for the I&I franchise with the acquisition of GED-301 and the advancement of important molecules from the internal pipeline focused on areas of high unmet medical need. These certainly are exciting times for Celgene I&I.","I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Bob.","Robert Hugin","Thank you, Scott. As I hope you can tell, we\u2019re extremely energized by the momentum generated in the first half of the year and the prospects for the remainder of the year and beyond. We have significant milestones supporting key corporate priorities over the coming months. We\u2019re committed to capitalizing on the progress achieved to date and capturing the full potential of our extensive product portfolio and pipeline. ","Thank you everyone for joining this morning, and Operator, we\u2019ll now open the call to questions.","Question and Answer Session","","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Our first question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Josh Schimmer \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Thanks for taking my questions. Just curious \u2013 you\u2019ve given us guidance through 2017, but beyond 2017 how do we think about which of these products, which of these indications that are from the currently approved offering or those in the pipeline are going to be the key drivers of growth towards the end of the decade?","Jacqualyn Fouse","Hi Josh, it\u2019s Jacquie. Thanks for the question. Generally, and I think you\u2019ve heard us talk about this a little bit before, when we think about most of the contribution that could come from Revlimid\u2019s future growth on the non-Hodgkins lymphoma indications or others beyond multiple myeloma particularly, all of that growth would be coming beyond 2017. So as we have a little bit more visibility over time to\u2014timelines to how those trials are going, we\u2019ve had a track record in the past of giving you updates on the long-term guidance and when we see inflection points in the business, so that\u2019s one area. Obviously the Crohn\u2019s asset that is now in the I&I portfolio is a product that has significant revenue potential, and that would come into the mix after 2017 as well. Those are only two.","Mark spoke in a fair amount of detail about all of the things going on in the combined AML MDS platform indications there, and that is a franchise within the hematology franchise that has significant growth potential to go from the roughly billion dollar base that it has today, growing nicely over the next few years; and then you get beyond 2017 and that one is even stronger as well. So those are just a few things that I would highlight, and there\u2019s a lot of other things in the pipeline that would come in as well.","So again, I would say that as we have more visibility to those things, we will try to build those into a model that we could talk about where it would be clear for investors in terms of how to evaluate the risk-reward profile of those things in the model at their appropriate inflection points.","Robert Hugin","I think just to add to that, I do think over the next few quarters there will be increasing visibility to the late-stage pipeline in terms of registration timelines and availability to patient timelines, and that clarity over the next couple of quarters will give you and us the ability to really articulate more clearly what is the incredible opportunity for us that we see, say, in 2020, et cetera.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges of Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey Porges \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Thanks very much and appreciate you taking the question. Jacquie, just a quick question on AG-221 and GED-301. Could you clarify for us what payments were made during the quarter for those, or if not during the quarter, what future payments are due to be made, and how they will be accounted for in your P&L (indiscernible) and also in your ROIC calculation, because they seem to be pretty swing factors. And then could you also just give us a little bit of an update on the Revlimid duration trends in the U.S. and Europe? Thank you.","Jacqualyn Fouse","Hi Geoff \u2013 thanks for the question. So just with respect to the impact on the quarter from those two things, for AG-221 there is nothing specifically associated with the opt-in on the program. Now that the product comes into Celgene\u2019s hands, the development costs will start to shift to us as well. As always, they\u2019re built into the projections. This will happen with essentially all of our partnered projects as we take them on over time, and that is the case already, for example, for Acceleron and some others we have cost sharing as well. ","For the GED-301 asset, we made the upfront payment of $710 million \u2013 that was a cash payment. The accounting for that is purchase accounting, so acquisition accounting that you\u2019ll see highlighted in the 10-Q filing where we will have amounts going into the in-process research and development that then will be in the balance sheet, and then some of the contingent liabilities associated with the future milestones as well, so you\u2019ll see all of those highlighted in the Q.","So with respect to the ROIC calculation, we like to show it on a U.S. GAAP basis because that\u2019s the most conservative way of showing it, and then those of you who want to think about different things in other ways and make adjustments if you like, that\u2019s okay. So everything would be included in the earnings numbers that are assumed in that calculation.","Mark Alles","On duration\u2014Geoff, hi. It\u2019s Mark. Just a quick comment. Recall that we typically talk about the intent to treat to progression, and how we measure physicians\u2019 intent historically, that\u2019s been right about half of the market in U.S. and Europe that prescribers said, we will treat to progression in myeloma, MDS, et cetera. What we\u2019ve seen in the last six months is a very sharp increase in the proportion of physicians who say they want to and are treating to progression, which is a very nice change after a pretty stable period. So we see that flowing through with accelerating duration now. As you know, we don\u2019t comment specifically on what duration months are, but we have seen some acceleration recently. I think that\u2019s going to continue in large part because when we get to ASH and we get into the first half of next year, as you know, there are multiple Phase III readouts with combinations therapy from triplets with carfilzomib rev\/dex, especially elotuzumab rev\/dex, and I think these will be additional sets of data supporting the treat to progression paradigm and then a flow-through to duration. ","Geoffrey Porges \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Right. Thanks very much, Mark and Jacquie.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Terence Flynn \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two pipeline ones from me. First on\u2014I noticed on Slide 23, you highlighted a number of PD1 combos that you were planning on running. Just wondering who you\u2019re planning to partner with on those, and then on your CD38 program for multiple myeloma, I was wondering if it\u2019s possible for you to narrow the lead, maybe, in any way that competitors have over you guys here. Thank you.","Mark Alles","Thanks for the question. On the PD1 side, I appreciate the question. We\u2019re very, very collaborative across the landscape. A lot of interest is coming from the other companies with respect to different combinations, different subsets of patients, and the collaborations are extremely broad and, I think, compelling, so more to come on that. But a very open, strong collaboration across the landscape.","With respect to CD38 in the myeloma space, the answer is yes \u2013 there are so many subsets, as you well know, of multiple myeloma that are being defined and redefined, so the view we have is that as we advance our CD38 antibody, more 202, we should be able to find an appropriate category and subset of patients such that our ability to run research in multiple myeloma would close gaps, and mostly it would be in a subset of patients to be defined.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya of Nomura. Your line is now open.","Ian Somaiya \u2013 Nomura","Sure. Just a question maybe on 2015. You\u2019ve highlighted many catalysts, upcoming catalysts as they relate to Revlimid, and I was just hoping to get your thoughts on how we should think about finally getting European approval for Revlimid front line; and then beyond that, the potential impact of the non-5q minus MDS data and the diffusion large B-cell lymphoma data.","Jacqualyn Fouse","Hi Ian, thanks for the questions. So you\u2019ve seen now the PDUFA date in the U.S. for the newly diagnosed filing, and things are moving along as we would have expected in Europe what that process, so we\u2019ve got those included in our model for 2015 essentially in the U.S., assuming a launch that basically for all practical purposes would start toward the end of Q1 or beginning of Q2, then in Europe, we\u2019ve assumed a Q2 approval, and then obviously the normal process of going for the reimbursement country by country. So it will, as with all things in Europe, be a staggered situation there, so the contribution to growth really starts to kick in even more in 2016 and \u201917, though we expect quite positive momentum for Revlimid because of all of that in 2015, but that\u2019s just how we\u2019ve modeled it. ","In terms of the non-del 5q, that\u2019s what you\u2019d hear us express some excitement about. The potential there is that would open Revlimid up more broadly in that indication, and that and the other things that we see going on, we think give us reason to believe that MDS AML together will grow significantly faster in the future than what we had built into the base case scenario.","So with that, I\u2019ll let Mark\u2014","Mark Alles","I agree with Jacquie. Maybe, Ian, just to add a little bit of color, I think the expansion of Revlimid, assuming we get positive regulatory review of 05 and MCL-002, is incremental several hundred million dollars. Now that said, we\u2019re evaluating the data, we\u2019re going through right now regulatory strategies, and I think the more important near-term view is this confidence that Revlimid lenalidomide is not niched, for example, in the del-5q subset. And in fact, when we can talk about what the MCL-002 data represents, recall these are active controls so we set up a market basket of drugs for the investigators to choose from in the study, and we\u2019re quite, quite confident that the single-agent profile of Revlimid in lymphoma will get a boost because people will realize it was superior to some very well established salvage drugs in the treatment of lymphoma. ","So more to come, but there\u2019s sort of an early, mid and later stage view of how this would play out for our lymphoma franchise and then our MDS franchise, so stay tuned.","Ian Somaiya \u2013 Nomura","Mark, I was really hoping you\u2019d comment on maybe the Remarc study and how we should think about the impact of that study for\u2014","Mark Alles","Well this is your second question, so I guess I will comment anyway. Ian, it\u2019s event-driven, so what I think about when we have positive data \u2013 and of course, we intend for these results to be presented later this year at ASH; we\u2019ll see, but that\u2019s our intent. I think studies that are ongoing that are still accruing, and we mentioned relevance for example, this profile does help investigators realize there\u2019s a lot of value, and the studies should in fact accrue faster. We should see some other effects of the positive profile.","So I think all these things are considerations, but remember on interim for any of our ongoing Phase III trials with Revlimid, they are event-driven. There is an interim analysis built into the stats plan, but unless or if we get those events, we don\u2019t know. ","Robert Hugin","But I do think it\u2019s very important to recognize that until we have the data, we have to be conservative and cautious about estimating what we think the impact is going to be. On the other hand, should we get positive data in Remarc or relevance, it is very, very different from the incremental data we have in MDS and other things, which are very important to us and give us great growth prospects. But this would really provide a transformation boost to Revlimid in the coming years if we were to get positive data\u2014","Mark Alles","Absolutely, and that peak is either early depending on the results, earlier versus as Jacquie talked about on the previous question, our base case which has most of that improved outlook beyond \u201917. ","Ian Somaiya \u2013 Nomura","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Robyn Karnauskas \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi, thanks for taking my question \u2013 and Jacquie, is this your last CFO call? If so, I\u2019m getting kind of sentimental.","I just wanted to ask about actually Otezla. So I know it\u2019s really early days of launch. You said that 80% of current plans have no set that it\u2019s through biologics, and how far along are you in the formulary coverage conversations so we can put it into context, and have you had any discussions about stuff that is in place for you ahead of biologics, and do you still think that that\u2019s a 2015 event?","Jacqualyn Fouse","Robyn, I\u2019ll pass it over to Scott. I\u2019m sitting here with tears in my eyes because it\u2019s my last\u2014","Robert Hugin","No, no. It may be her last call as CFO, but it won\u2019t be her last call, so she\u2019ll be accountable right here.","Scott Smith","So I would say a proportion of discussions we\u2019ve had, probably 60% of the total plans but representing more like 70 or 80% of the lives out there. As you can see from the footprint, a lot of those discussions have been very positive. We\u2019re pleased with the access footprint we have. We are getting plans right now that are adjudicating patients even without failing methotrexate and other DMARDs, so it\u2019s a very nice position for us to be in. Preferred positions over biologics and things like that are something for the longer term. We\u2019re interested in making sure we don\u2019t have a disadvantaged position when we come to market initially and the patients have what we would call relatively open access to access our drug.","Generally you see that. I think it\u2019s very positive when you see that 80% don\u2019t require a step through biologic, because it does emphasize that pre-biologic positioning and the fact that there\u2019s an opportunity even in that space.","Robert Hugin","I think just as a company, our strategy, philosophy and principles working with insurance companies that we do encourage access and to give the choice to physicians and patients as much as possible to make the best choice for that patient, and so we do encourage that kind of transparency and openness, and that\u2019s something that I think is very important for all of us in the industry to ensure that we encourage all partners in the industry, to ensure that we provide that kind of open access and let physicians and patients dictate what\u2019s best for the patient.","Robyn Karnauskas \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber of Citi. Your line is now open.","Yaron Werber \u2013 Citi","Great, thanks so much. So Scott, I\u2019ve got to\u2014actually I\u2019m sorry, for Mark. I have a question about MDS-005. Is the data in line with the Phase II and the impact you think on ACE-536, about how you develop ACE 536? And sort of related, Bob\u2014it\u2019s really not related, but an M&A question. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense \u2013 I mean, you bought GED-5701, exciting compound but obviously it\u2019s got some risk to it. You have plenty of cash, and strategically you have a lot of early stuff. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of your appetite for late-stage acquisitions. Thanks.","Mark Alles","Yaron, it\u2019s Mark. Thanks for the question. So recall that we\u2019re talking about a segmentation of MDS when we think about our assets, so of course Revlimid approved for deletion 5q transfusion dependent patients, highly well identified patient population, but it\u2019s only about 6% of the overall treatable low risk MDS population, maybe 10% if you think about the high end of the model. That said, the vast majority of patients we\u2019re talking about cycle through transfusions and\/or epo as a way to deal with their bone marrow failure and chronic anemia. So we think that this is a complementary approach where either ACE-11, ACE-536 to be determined would drop into all classifications of transfusion dependent MDS, and that\u2019s for the future.","So I think there\u2019s a complementarity, but there\u2019s certainly segmentation that would have to be thought of. For us, it\u2019s pretty clear \u2013 the unmet medical need of transfusion dependent and then epo-resistant or refractory patients is our target market for our portfolio.","Robert Hugin","And just to go, Yaron, to the question on M&A, certainly it\u2019s been an active and exciting time in the industry as people reposition their strategies. I think we feel, first of all, very comfortable with our strategy for the long-term, where we\u2019ve been, where we are and where we\u2019re headed. Certainly the 301 acquisition is, in our mind, a very late-stage asset, and we\u2019re going to do everything we can to accelerate, to answering the questions, to prove that this is the kind of asset that is going to transform the treatment of Crohn\u2019s. So we look at that as a very important part of addition to the late stage assets, and I do think over the coming quarters there will clearly be much more increased visibility on what the next phase\u2014group of Phase III registration track studies, so there\u2019s clarity into the growth trajectory of the company.","That being said, our business model has always been designed as one to have tremendous leverage capabilities, both from a cash flow point of view, an operational leverage point of view, a financial leverage point of view. So adding late-stage assets or approved assets does give leverage to the model, but we don\u2019t see a need to change our strategy in any way, shape or form. We\u2019re very comfortable with where we are. We think we have an incredibly exciting, promising pipeline. ","If something opportunistic were to come along, we would certainly be assertive and aggressive and go for it; but that\u2019s not something we\u2019re out there thinking we need to do, so really no change at all. We\u2019ll keep a close eye on what\u2019s happening and we feel very good about the future and where we are today. We want that strategic, financial and operating flexibility so that if something does come along, we\u2019ll be ready to go. But again, no change to our strategy as we see the future.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham of JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Geoff Meacham \u2013 JP Morgan","Morning guys. Congrats on the quarter, and thanks for the questions. I\u2019ve got a couple I&I questions for Scott. Now that you\u2019ve closed the 301 deal, just want to get your sense of the size and scope of the Phase III and there were any mitigating factors to start. And then on Otezla, maybe a little bit bigger picture \u2013 you know, you guys have had some good long-term data in PSA. I just wanted to get a sense from you as to what you think that tipping point is for adoption in PSA, whether it\u2019s things like long-term data or doc experience or reimbursement, et cetera. Thanks.","Scott Smith","So just on the first question, GED-301, the first thing we need to do \u2013 and everything I would say here is caveated by the fact that we need to have regulatory discussions to talk about the development program and get agreement and alignment on that. I think it is sort of a perfect molecule for looking at alternative approaches as opposed to the standard dutch and maintenance, but all that stuff needs to be worked through and discussed with regulatory authorities, which are happening in the second half of this year.","Relative to Otezla, I think adoption is not\u2014I don\u2019t think there\u2019s one single thing. For me, what\u2019s really important for adoption is, one, you get the right kind of access footprint, and as the data that you have supports the use early and whether there\u2019s significant market opportunity. So the access footprint is critical. Obviously you need to drive new demand and get new patients on there. There needs to be good persistency of those patients. I think certainly the long-term data has brought a very nice aura to the asset, because when you take a look at either one year \u2013 and I don\u2019t want to get into the specifics of the week 104 two-year data for Palace 1 \u2013 but again, for me it\u2019s very striking, the significant advancement in terms of what that efficacy looks like from week 52 to week 104 with no new safety filings during that period. So the profile that\u2019s emerging is one that can be used long-term without increased risk of some of the things that you see with other therapies in this space, and we\u2019re looking to get that data out. ","But there\u2019s no one factor that drives adoption. I think initially it\u2019s a good footprint, making sure you\u2019ve got a good core group of prescribers who are prescribing multiples, and then making sure patients are staying on longer term. All of the data we\u2019ve generated and other things help support this fundamental proposition.","Geoff Meacham \u2013 JP Morgan","When is there more clarity on the Palace 1\u2014","Scott Smith","Palace 1, the 104-week, two-year data will be available at ACR. We\u2019ve submitted it to ACR. Hopefully it will be accepted and presented there, but that abstract has been presented.","Geoff Meacham \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ravi Mehrotra from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Ravi Mehrotra \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks for taking my question. No new deals announced today. Has George G. been on holiday? And more seriously, another question on 301. Notwithstanding your comments just made about you\u2019re still in the design phase, could you just give us any color on the possible dosing duration within that trial and remind us of the science that could explain what looks like a very prolonged duration of action on very short treatment protocols seen in previous studies. Thank you.","Scott Smith","Yes, so the things that you hit on, I think are really what needs to be considered \u2013 how do you take the molecule and what\u2019s the appropriate duration? Certainly in Phase III, you would test a couple of different dosing regimens in terms of that maintenance. What we see arising out of this when we take a look at the data, when we take a look at the possible avenues for development is just what a tremendous market opportunity it is to have a product in our hands which not only is showing really significant induction but also the potential to have really long duration remissions. So how you work out the dosing schedules and things like that is\u2014we need to, again, design some alternative designs, talk to regulatory authorities, but there really is a tremendous opportunity for a product which has good duration of remissions here.","You don\u2019t see it \u2013 50% of patients on TNS lose their remission over the course of the year, even with continued therapy, so I think we have a really nice opportunity on this duration gain to really change the length of time patients can be treated and change the treatment paradigm for Crohn\u2019s disease.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenbaum of ISI Group. Your line is now open","Mark Schoenbaum \u2013 ISI Group","Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. I actually had some Biogen and Merck questions if Peter is still there. Just kidding.","Can I ask about another question on Crohn\u2019s? So I think most folks, based on the money you guys spent, expect the data to be pretty good that you\u2019re presenting in October. And maybe Scott, maybe just address how you guys got comfortable that what we\u2019re going to be looking at in the Phase II isn\u2019t false positives? There have been some false positives in Crohn\u2019s in phase II.","And then second quick question is maybe for Mark, perhaps. Can you clarify what your expectation is at this point for the European front-line Revlimid label? Do you expect an indication for the transplant-eligible patients as well as the non-eligible, or just one of the above? Thanks a lot.","Scott Smith","So first of all, just to talk about Crohn\u2019s and GED-301 and the data that we\u2019ve seen, as I said on the last call, we saw really striking efficacy not only in terms of what you see from clinical response but also what you see in terms of patient remissions. I don\u2019t want to get into the specifics of the data, but the placebo rates were low in this trial and there was an appropriate dose response, and we did very significant diligence on all 166 patients who were in the study and looked at the data in very different ways, and we think it is very, very compelling and provides a tremendous opportunity for an asset to take into Phase III. Obviously given what we paid, the competitive nature of it, a lot of other companies did too; but I think once you see the data, and again it\u2019s going to be UEGW, which is the next major GI meeting October 21, when you see the full data and the dose response and the durability response and some of those things, I think you will understand exactly why we have\u2014we think what we do.","We\u2019ve also looked at all the data with the patient and case report forms as appropriate, looked at data from every patient in the study and really think it is strong, robust data, so we\u2019re very excited. We\u2019re very excited about the opportunity to get that data out so we don\u2019t have to talk so much in code about what\u2019s in that data, because it is very striking and compelling and (indiscernible) to talk about.","Mark Alles","Mark, thanks for the questions \u2013 Mark here. On the ongoing discussions in Europe about our newly diagnosed label for Revlimid, we are in fact continuing to push for the broadest possible label for myeloma. That said, you\u2019ll recall that our base case has been that we would be approved around the world for elderly transplant ineligible patients, but that label then would include continuous treatment. And because of the way that the market is evolving, we think that upwards of 70% of the newly diagnosed multiple myeloma market, even with somewhat of a limited label, would be candidates for Revlimid dexamethasone as a consequence of our regulatory approvals, not just in Europe but around the world. ","So we\u2019re at the front end of the process. We continue and will continue to support the broadest possible label at the end, but our base case has been elderly, non-transplant eligible patients as a label.","Jacqualyn Fouse","Yeah, that\u2019s exactly how we built the financial model and then the\u2014we don\u2019t have anything in there for the stem cell transplant population until at least 18 to 24 months later. So when you think about the model 2015 to 2017, that\u2019s how those layer in there.","Mark Schoenbaum \u2013 ISI Group","Thanks for taking the questions. Sorry for the poor joke.","Robert Hugin","Well, it is going to be an exciting time here with George and Peter. Jacquie is going to be able to keep everybody moving.","Mark Schoenbaum \u2013 ISI Group","Fantastic. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Brian Abrahams \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could talk more specifically about the strategy underlying the new immuno-oncology center. I\u2019m curious, what are some of the areas of most interest initially, and do you foresee building out a portfolio with early R&D efforts, end licensing or partnering, external assets, or is it more along the lines of expanding out accommodation studies to ensure that existing Celgene products are paired with other folks\u2019 cancer immunotherapies?","Robert Hugin","I think you\u2019ve outlined it, and the sense is really all of the above. I think as a company that has been focused on immunology from its beginnings as a pharmaceutical company, the impact of the core products that we have is in this space and we\u2019ve been very intent on it. We have programs internal in different geographies and in different groups and we have external programs that are coordinated with our internal programs, and so I think because of the magnitude and potential impact of what we have today and the ability to even further leverage it, we think it\u2019s great that we can bring a guy on like Rob to really help us coordinate and have a center of excellence consistent with how we\u2019re building our research philosophy of centers of excellence. ","So I think we feel very good about what we\u2019ve built. We now want to make sure its most effectively executed and coordinated and leveraged as we go forward, so we feel very good about where we are but the field is continuing to merge. It will be next generation technologies that we\u2019re very focused on to ensure that we\u2019re positioned today but also for the long term impact of the field. So this is still in the early innings. We feel good where we are and we intend to even be a more significant player over time.","Brian Abrahams \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Roden of UBS. Your line is now open.","Matt Roden \u2013 UBS","Great, thanks for taking my question as well, and Peter, welcome back to biotech. I admire your willingness to take on the tough comps of following Jacquie as CFO.","On Otezla, Scott, just trying to reconcile the sales, reported sales versus the volumes implied from the script. So we\u2019ve seen a really nice script trend here, as you\u2019ve pointed out. I guess the titration packs are not included in those scripts, but it also sounds like you guys are giving away a little bit more free drug from those who are converting over to commercial coverage. So can you just walk us through the math of how we get there \u2013 is it just increased gross and net here, and should that improve as you get a bigger base of patients?","And then lastly, just related, is there anything you can say on early persistency trends, discontinuation rate on Otezla, and maybe conversion rate from the titration packs to the scripts? Thanks.","Jacqualyn Fouse","Hi Matt. Thanks for the compliments. Peter\u2019s getting a little nervous now, but he\u2019ll be fine. So I just wanted to jump in real quickly and then I\u2019ll pass it to Scott. So just to make sure that everybody is clear on this, the titration packs are like samples \u2013 non-revenue generating, as you know. That\u2019s two weeks\u2019 worth of drug, and then we had been prepared from the beginning in order to support the patient\u2019s stay on therapy to have these bridging packs available, which are also non-revenue generating, so that if there was time waiting to get the authorization, the patients would stay on product. I think that\u2019s what we saw over the course of the early stages of the launch, and I think Scott will talk a little bit about the trends that we expect in that because it would be sort of natural for that to taper down over time as you grow your patient base.","Scott Smith","Thanks for the question, Matt. Like you, I\u2019m very encouraged by the Rx trends which are very strong, good growth week to week. I think what you see affecting is, as Jacquie has talked about, is titration. The average time to adjudication in the first two months after launch was 22 days, which is normal in a highly managed category with a new product, so patients with a titration and then a bridge pack to help them get to commercial supply. The good news there is that from the latest data that I have seen, over 95% of patients had that adjudicated positively, so there\u2019s really good access. It just takes a little time, and titration and adjudication just push it off a little bit. I would again go back to my comment that we see in July revenues which we expect to meet or exceed all of what we saw in the first quarter.","So you do get a little bit when you\u2019re giving out free titrations and samples to help with that. You do get a little bit of dampening in the initial weeks, but that goes away as you go forward. We can already see a significant acceleration in revenues, in line with what we\u2019re generating in terms of prescriptions, so it\u2019s a very positive picture.","Matt Roden \u2013 UBS","Thanks. And the persistency?","Scott Smith","Oh persistency \u2013 it\u2019s too early for me to give actual persistency numbers. The numbers of patients who have discontinued therapy is very low \u2013 less than 1% of patients that I can see have discontinued. But it\u2019s too early to really tell because you have a lot of patients very new. What we\u2019re hearing anecdotally is very similar to what we\u2019ve seen in the clinical programs \u2013 there was 3,000 patients in the Palace clinical program in total. What we\u2019re seeing is relatively low, very low rates of discontinuation \u2013 1%, 2%, that kind of thing like we saw in the clinical program, so too early to get a really good number on it. Usually we like to get out six to eight weeks\u2014or six to eight months to really get a good view on persistency, but so far it seems in line with what we\u2019ve seen in the clinical program, which was low discontinuations.","Matt Roden \u2013 UBS","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Michael Yee- RBC Capital Markets","","Great, thanks. Two real quick ones. One is on the CLL market \u2013 lots of products being approved yesterday, including one yesterday. Maybe as you\u2019ve seen this play out over the last year, remind us how you think you\u2019re going to fit in or play here as competition heats up. Secondly, a dividend has been mentioned but really not something that seems to be near term. Is there something that you\u2019d like to see play out? How important is that at the board level for you, and do you need to see stuff play out \u2013 for example, litigation and all that kind of stuff \u2013 to really get visibility on that before that happens? Thanks.","Jacqualyn Fouse","Hi Michael. Let me just jump in on the dividend question. So it does come up from time to time, and what we\u2019ve said in the past is it\u2019s not something that we see for the near term, but it\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to keep on the radar screen and just think about. One of the key things that would drive our decision on that, though, would be the diversification in the revenue stream that we would like to see take place over a period of time and be meaningful diversification, because as much as we love Revlimid and the growth in Revlimid, and we expect for it to be very good for a long, long period of time, we would also love to have some other products in there that are growing at very fast rates too, and you\u2019ve seen some of the projections that we\u2019ve given where we expect Revlimid to come down from kind of two-thirds or so percent of the total revenue pie to closer to 50%, and hopefully over time even maybe go a little bit below that, but for the right reasons so everything is growing. So it\u2019s not something we forget about, but it\u2019s a ways out.","Mark Alles","Mike, thanks for the question about the CLL. On CLL, recall that we are continuing to accrue and manage our CLL 002 continuum trial, and you\u2019re right \u2013 there are so many good things happening for patients right now with respect to novel therapy for the treatment of upfront CLL. What is not different is our strategy is that maintenance therapy remains the real potential to extend the benefit of some of the very powerful drugs that have been approved, so we\u2019re continuing to believe that we have an advantaged position with Revlimid if and when CLL 002 would read out as a positive way to maintain the benefit of prior treatment.","In addition, you may remember we talked about CLL\u2014CC-122, one of our next generation small molecule drugs. I think that this comes along at just the right time because what will happen over time is that large groups of relapsed patients off of drugs like ibrutinib, et cetera, will need different treatments to salvage their resistant disease. So we think that the market shifts, obviously, but then there will be newly defined, homogenously defined patients based on failure of prior therapy, and we\u2019re excited about coming in with our next generation molecules.","Jacqualyn Fouse","There are four of you remaining in the queue, and we\u2019re going to try to get to you. So Operator, please keep going.","Operator","Thank you. Mara Goldstein of Cantor Fitzgerald, your line is now open.","Mara Goldstein \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald","Thank you very much for taking the question. Just quickly then, I guess on Otezla, maybe you can just share with us if there are any plans to expand out the pharmacy distribution once the psoriasis indication is granted, and assuming that occurs in September as expected. And then secondarily on Abraxane, can you just remind us of the markets that are still outstanding for reimbursement?","Scott Smith","So on the Otezla question, at first when launching into a specialty area in a highly managed category, you want to keep your distribution very tight so that you can help with reimbursement and get the kind of managed care footprint and acceptance that we have. As we get into and get through those adjudications, get into the launch of psoriasis, probably not right after the launch but sometime next year, and we\u2019ll take a look at expanding that network once it\u2019s clear from a reimbursement perspective patients are accessing the product in a reasonable way with no time delays and things, I think there\u2019s an opportunity with this product to expand beyond the specialty networks, and that would be an initiative for us in next year.","Mara Goldstein \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay, thank you on that.","Mark Alles","The reimbursement for Abraxane in pancreatic cancer is going well, as we\u2019ve described. High priority markets for us include Spain and Italy, again as we\u2019ve already described, but markets like Australia and Canada are still in the mix also. So we have several remaining high value markets to secure reimbursement access over the next six months to a year, and I think that continues to bode well for our opportunity to really create a blockbuster in pancreatic cancer.","Mara Goldstein \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Wei of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Thomas Wei \u2013 Jefferies","Thanks. I had a question on the longer term model that you\u2019ve constructed and how we should think about broad populations versus targeting sub-groups in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and then triplet therapy in myeloma. So Remarc, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s designed to look at that question of GCB versus non-GCB, but when you think about Remarc, do you think about it being used in a particular sub-type; and then for triplet and myeloma, some of the commentary that you made earlier on the call, it sounds like you think the benefit is going to be specific to calling out specific sub-populations, maybe like poor cytogenetics, or do you think of it as being broadly applicable across the myeloma population?","Jacqualyn Fouse","Hi Thomas, thanks for the question. So generally just with respect to the financial model, as you may imagine, we tend to be probably on the conservative side with our assumptions around how we start with certain patient groups and then move forward over time, so I\u2019m going to let Mark jump in a little bit more in just a minute. Specifically to the question around the triplet regimens, we have not yet built into the model specific forecasts for what the benefits could be to Revlimid\u2019s position in some of the different patient segments associated with\u2014or on duration, for that matter, associated with the emergence of positive results for these triplet regimens. We\u2019ve talked about that on multiple occasions as potential upside to the model and certainly not downside to the model depending on how those things go \u2013 it would either be neutral or upside. So we\u2019ll see how those play out and give more color on those over time.","With respect to maybe the other sort of aspect of your question, I\u2019ll let Mark jump in.","Mark Alles","Thanks for the question. So with respect to Remarc specifically, we\u2019re testing Revlimid maintenance in a front-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma population that is at high risk of relapse based on an index of scoring. That\u2019s not the same thing, as you know, as activated B-cell\u2014as part of the non-germinal cell subtype. So what we\u2019re doing now is participating in the lymphoma market as it has been defined, and we think Revlimid maintenance therapy in this higher risk group of newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is a great place for the product to be.","Over time, the combination with rituximab we think will really enhance the value proposition of Revlimid and Rituxan, for that matter, in a number of subsets as we described today, the activated B-cell type as a brand-new subtype. It\u2019s very important that we create the kind of homogeneity with molecular markers and companion diagnostics going forward to really optimize that. So we\u2019re participating in the market as it is and we\u2019re shaping the market for future value.","Jacqualyn Fouse","Thank you. Operator, we\u2019ve got one last question, I believe.","Operator","Yes. Our last question comes from the line of Howard Liang of Leerink. Your line is now open.","Howard Liang \u2013 Leerink Swann","Thanks very much. How much off-label use is there for Revlimid in lower risk MDS, and if that\u2019s a simple answer, can I also ask a question about your immuno-oncology \u2013 when do you expect these preclinical assets, such as CD47 CAR T to move into the clinic?","Robert Hugin","Thanks for the question. Today there is very little \u2013 very, very little \u2013 use of Revlimid in the non-deletion 5q, or as you described, off-label market. So it\u2019s very clear, the role of the product is very well defined on label for deletion 5q non-transfusion dependent disease.","With respect to CD47 and CAR T, we believe that as we enter 2015 we can accelerate the clinical development of both of these programs. So this year is still a little bit more getting organized, understanding the profile, INDs, et cetera, and then 2015 would be, I would hope, a year we could accelerate both assets in the clinic.","Jacqualyn Fouse","And with that, thank you very much everybody for being on the call with us today, and we will see you soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude today\u2019s program. You may all disconnect. Have a great day everyone.

I would like to remind you that this call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Patrick Flanigan, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations at Celgene.","Patrick E. Flanigan","Thanks, Karen and welcome everyone to our Fourth Quarter and Year-End Earnings Conference Call. The press release reporting our financial results in addition to the presentation for today's webcast can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the corporate website at www.celgene.com.","Joining me in the room today with prepared remarks are: Bob Hugin, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Peter Kellogg, our Chief Financial Officer; Mark Alles, our Chief Operating Officer; Jackie Fouse, who's Global Head of our Hematology & Oncology franchise; and Scott Smith, Global Head of our Inflammation & Immunology franchise.","As a reminder, during today's call, we will be making Forward-Looking Statements regarding our financial outlook in addition to regulatory and product development plans.

Reconciliations of the adjusted financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measures are available as part of the earnings release.","I would now like to turn the call over to Bob.","Robert J. Hugin","Thank you, Patrick and thank you everyone for joining us this morning. As we reported, 2015 was an outstanding year for Celgene. We appreciate the opportunity to review with you these exceptional results, important strategic developments and our near and longer-term outlook.","Our operating momentum and advancement of high potential programs have us well positioned to produce market leading growth in 2016 and beyond. Very importantly, during 2015, we advanced a number of key strategic initiatives that will drive significant growth over the next decade.","We enhanced and provided greater clarity on the potential of REVLIMID. We firmly established the value proposition of OTEZLA, while significantly expanding our I&I franchise. We strengthened the long-term growth potential of our Hematology & Oncology franchise through strategic immuno-oncology collaboration and by advancing important late stage clinical programs.","And we broadened and deepened our research and development pipeline as the investments we made in internal and integrated collaborative research programs advanced. These significant accomplishments combined with our strong finish to the year, generates excellent momentum in our businesses as we head into 2016.","Later in the call, Peter, Jackie and Scott will more fully review the outstanding results of the year and the strong commercial momentum across geographies and products that has us well positioned to achieve for products with sales over $1 billion each expected to grow by double digit percentages in 2016.","Mark will conclude with his perspective on strategic initiatives and upcoming milestones. These milestones position us to sustain high growth for the long-term. And as I hope you can tell, this is an incredibly exciting time at Celgene, and our people are critical to maximizing our enormous potential.","Earlier this month we announced management changers that leverage the talents and experience of our exceptional leaders while expanding and strengthening our team. These changes provide Mark, Jackie, Scott, Peter and Rupert, all outstanding leaders, the opportunity to have an even greater impact on our organization.","Since announcing these changes, our teams across the globe are energized and even more focused and committed to producing exceptional results. I could not be more excited about the of Celgene, together with Mark, our entire leadership team and all of our employees around the globe, we look forward to continuing to deliver exceptional results and turning the great promise of Celgene into reality.","Thank you. Let me now turn the call over to Peter.","Peter N. Kellogg","Thank you, Bob, and good morning everyone. 2015 was another great year for Celgene. Our teams around the globe delivered robust financial results, while also advancing and acquiring further next generation growth drivers. In fact, 2015 was an exceptional year of significant strategic investments.","We've strengthened our portfolio in several key focus areas including immuno-oncology and epigenetic, in addition to laying the foundation to be a future leader in inflammatory bowel disease. While delivering strong commercial results, we made critical investments now; so that we are set up to deliver sustainable high growth performance well into the next decade.","Now let's discuss the financial results for the quarter and the year. The fourth quarter total net product sales grew 24%. Our four key products, REVLIMID, THALOMID, ABRAXANE, and OTEZLA, grew 28% driven by continued momentum in core indication, label expansion and global launches. Now, while Jackie and Scott will provide more color on the underlying market dynamics for these products later in the call, I would like to highlight just two items.","First, full-year product sales grew 21% and were supported by greater diversification. Now, as you have seen REVLIMID continues growing 14% to 16% per year and it now represents 63% of product sales versus 67% in 2013. We expect this performance as well as diversification trend will continue right through 2020 and beyond.","Secondly, U.S. ABRAXANE sales and international REVLIMID sales were positively impacted during the quarter by buying pattern. For ABRAXANE, contract optimization led to a customary buying during Q4 as we\u2019ve seen before and that is often followed by sell through during Q1. As we mentioned on our Q3 conference call, 2015 was the first year of REVLIMID sales in Russia via a tender. These occurred in Q2 and in Q4 and we now expect a similar buying pattern going forward.","Product sales growth for the quarter and the year remained volume driven. The foreign exchange markets remains volatile throughout the year resulting in an unfavorable net ForEx impact of $16 million to revenue during Q4 and $109 million for the year. Now our treasury team really did an excellent job mitigating this headwind.","And just as referenced in just for perspective, if we did not have a benefit of our hedging program, the ForEx impact would have been approximately $100 million during Q4 alone and approximately $450 million for the year. You can see that ForEx is a large factor that has been well managed in 2015.","Adjusted earnings per share in Q4 was $1.18 which include a $0.07 per share impact from a milestone to our partner OncoMed that we announced earlier. As a reminder, after entering into a collaboration, we include milestone payments and other collaboration expenses within our adjusted financial measures. Now of course we are pleased with how our partner programs are progressing and the potential contributions they could have on our long-term outlook that\u2019s good news.","For the full-year, adjusted earnings per share was $4.71, a strong 27% increase over the prior year. And even more impressive considering that it includes a $0.17 per share diluted impact related to business development activities and of course that includes the $0.14 per share diluted impact related to the Receptos acquisition this past summer.","As we discussed on the Q3 call, we expected a significant ramp in R&D spend during the fourth quarter and in fact, this happened and resulted in 25% of Q4 sales being reinvested in R&D. This is due to increased clinical trial activity for our important high potential late stage programs, and the collaboration related milestone expense that we just discussed.","And please note Q4 was the first full quarter with Receptos operations as part of our organization. All these investments are critical to creating our long-term growth profile that extends well into the next decade. On the other hand, as we also discussed last quarter, after investing in our global commercial capabilities over the past few years to support the global launches for ABRAXANE, POMALYST and OTEZLA, we are now achieving meaningful leverage on the SG&A line.","Our earnings quality remains exceptional with growth for the quarter and year driven primarily by adjusted operating income, further underscoring the momentum in our commercial business. During the quarter we experienced the full impact of last year's $8 billion debt offering which adds an incremental $310 million of interest expense per year. Accordingly, on an annual basis, we continue to expect total net interest expense will be between $480 million per year and $500 million per year going forward.","We ended the year with approximately $6.6 billion in cash and marketable securities and throughout the year, we assertively utilized our balance sheet and cash flow to invest in next-generation growth drivers, while simultaneously repurchasing approximately $3.3 billion of Celgene shares. This is the largest annual level of repurchase in the history of Celgene, an impressive fact given the numerous other key strategic investments made during 2015. And it reflects our continued confidence in the company's future and our continued support of shareholders interests.","Now, earlier this month, we provided 2016 guidance that calls for continued strong top-line performance and a leveraged bottom-line outlook. This positions us to continue as a leader in growth among large biotech. We expect total net product sales between $10.5 billion and $11 billion, a 17% increase from 2015. This range incorporates an approximately $120 million net ForEx impacts to predominantly affect international REVLIMID sales.","While we do not provide total revenue guidance, I would just like to highlight the royalty-bearing sales of Ritalin and Focalin by Novartis had decreased significantly over the past few years due to generic competition in certain markets and we expect that trend to accelerate further in 2016.","Turning to the adjusted operating margin, we expect 150 basis point improvement, driven by meaningful leverage in SG&A and a slight improvement in the product gross margin due to mix. Of course, we'll continue to invest in the commercial launches of our key products just to maximize their global potential and in particular, as we build out our I&I commercial capabilities in Europe to further capitalize on the growing momentum of OTEZLA.","We also expect to increase our level of R&D investment as we initiate 50 new clinical trials across the pipeline and expand a number of Phase III programs, included in adjusted research and development expense, our milestone payments to partners. These are projected to range between $130 million and $140 million for the year.","Moving to the bottom line and for the full-year, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $5.50 and $5.70, a 19% increase in 2015. Now we are off to a very strong start this year and we anticipate Q1 adjusted earnings per share between $1.27 and $1.30. This is a 20% year-over-year growth and this represents earning 23% of our full-year EPS guidance.","A better start versus historical Q1 performance as a percentage of the full-year than we've seen. Now this guidance does include two items in the quarter, first as you know, during Q1, we typically have higher growth to net adjustments which REVLIMID and POMALYST due to early Medicare doughnut hole and other ACA payments.","In addition to the potential sell through of inventory for vaccine in U.S., we expect these same pattern during the 2016. And second, we now expect several potential partner milestones soon to be achieved in the first quarter, resulting in between $50 million and $75 million of milestone to partner. Building on this great 2015, we look forward to another strong year in 2016 as our operating momentum continues and we advance to next-generation of growth drivers that has the potential to maintain our growth profile into the next decade.","Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to my colleague Jackie.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","Thank you, Peter. Good morning, everyone. Our Hematology & Oncology teams around the world and across all of our activities delivered another excellent quarter to finish 2015 with strong momentum. The franchise grew 18% year-over-year in Q4 and 16% for the full-year to reach just under $8.7 billion of product revenues, a record year. And our strong growth trajectory will continue in 2016 and beyond.","In 2016, we will see the first full-year revenues following launches for REVLIMID and newly diagnosed myeloma in the U.S., Germany, Spain and other countries and we expect reimbursement approvals of launches in France, Italy, Japan and others. We will see the first full-year revenues for POMALYST in Japan following the June 2015 launch there. In addition, demand is being fueled by increasing durations of treatment across all lines of therapy in myeloma. ABRAXANE growth outside the U.S. is very solid with nice momentum post launch in pancreatic cancer.","2016 will also be a year that kicks off a steady multiyear flow of clinical data across a number of our late-stage program with the first readout from our Phase III REVLIMID lymphoma program coming in the middle of the year for the remarks to see us largely cell lymphoma trial. We continue to build our hematology pipeline with programs currently enrolling for the novel compound luspatercept, AG-221 and durvalumab and the program for AG-120 is advancing.","Finally, a number of trials are ongoing for new indications for ABRAXANE as well as for ABRAXANE in immuno-oncology combination therapy. REVLIMID's year-over-year growth accelerated in Q4 with 18% growth for the quarter, including negative foreign exchange of about one percentage point. REVLIMID's full-year growth reached 16.5% including two percentage points of negative foreign exchange, this growth is primarily volume driven.","The ongoing launches of the newly diagnosed myeloma indication in U.S. and across several markets in Europe are in the early stages and are fueling volume growth. REVLIMID is the market leader in first line myeloma in the U.S. and in Q4 we hit another new all time high for number of unique patients treated. REVLIMID\u2019s share in second lion myeloma in the U.S. was stable throughout 2015.","European overall non-stem cell transplant newly diagnosed myeloma share reached around 15% at the end of 2015 with Germany at over 20%. Across Europe, REVLIMID held or gained second lion\u2019s share. Duration and treatment trends are positive across all geographies supported by an ever-growing body of clinical data in favor of continuous treatment with REVLIMID.","With the momentum of the newly diagnosed myeloma launch in Europe and reimbursement in Russia, our REVLIMID European region year-over-year volume growth accelerated and reached 26% in Q4 and 19% for the full-year. That excellent volume growth was somewhat offset by negative price and foreign exchange impact.","The future growth outlook is strong as 2016 will include the first full-year of revenues post the newly diagnosed myeloma launch for REVLIMID in a number of markets including the U.S. across Europe and Japan and we expect to continue to obtain reimbursement approvals in more countries in 2016 and REVLIMID\u2019s future looks right for a long time to come.","In the U.S., the NNCN in guidelines were recently updated and now include the RVD triplet regimen as a category one preferred treatment for first line myeloma patients in both the stem cell transplant and non-stem cell transplant settings. In 2016, we will see the read out of the REMARC trial in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and our overall program for REVLIMID in lymphoma will continue to advance.","Finally, within the FUSION program under our collaboration with AstraZeneca MedImmune, the REVLIMID durvalumab combinations for newly diagnosed myeloma will begin enrollment in a Phase I, proof-of-concept trial that will inform next steps for advancing durvalumab in newly diagnosed myeloma combination therapy.","POMALYST\/IMNOVID achieved strong sequential and year-over-year growth to finish 2015 up 45% for both Q4 and the full-year and 95% of POMALYST\/IMNOVID\u2019s 2015 growth came from volume. POMALYST third line in greater share in the U.S. showed an upward trend in the second half of 2015 and duration of treatment increase.","IMNOVID overall EU market share in both third and fourth line myeloma has now reached about one third and durations of treatment are increasing in Europe as well. We look forward to the first full-year of POMALYST revenues in Japan during 2016 after a strong launch in June of 2015 and strong demand uptake.","Emerging data for POMALYST\/IMNOVID triplet combination support longer durations of treatment and a number of combination trails with POMALYST\/IMNOVID and novel agents are ongoing including immuno-oncology combinations for Phase I data presented at ASH were highly encouraging were relapse refractory myeloma patients with higher overall response rate versus today\u2019s standard of care therapies. Our POMALYST durvalumab combination trials for relapse refractory myeloma has initiated and recently enrolled its first patient.","ABRAXANE had a very good quarter in Q4 and finished 2015 strong with 15% year-over-year growth for the quarter and 14% for the full-year. Importantly, volume growth was 18% and 16% respectively and was achieved despite a highly competitive landscape in some indications and geographies. The ABRAXANE gemcitabine combination continues to hold the standard of care position for pancreatic cancer in the U.S. and is moving to that position in Europe with strong uptake and ongoing launches in various markets.","During the second half of 2015, ABRAXANE U.S. shares in lung and breast were stable and the launch of the lung indication in Europe is in its early stages. Emerging data is providing signs that ABRAXANE\u2019s future in immuno-oncology combination therapies will be exciting. We have now seen promising early data for both lung and breast, and we expect significant data flow beginning in 2017 with two Phase III readouts in lung, and then triple negative breast readouts to follow in 2018.","Other programs for ABRAXANE also continue to advance across adjuvant and locally advanced pancreas, both triple negative and early stage breast and a number of patient segments in non-small cell lung cancer. We are optimistic about ABRAXANE\u2019s future growth prospects and the potential of the product in immuno-oncology combinations.","Building on the strong momentum created by our teams during 2015, we look forward to another year of both excellent sales growth and advancement of our clinical programs in 2016. We expect REVLIMID sales to grow to $6.6 billion to $6.7 billion, up 15% at the midpoint of the range and driven by volume again this year.","POMALYST\/IMNOVID and ABRAXANE are both expected to officially reach blockbuster drug status by each surpassing the $1 billion revenue mark this year and volumes will also contribute the majority of their growth. Our regulatory and clinical teams are very full agendas this year. On the submission side, we expect to submit REVLIMID for post stem cell transplant maintenance in both the U.S. and EU. POMALYST\/IMNOVID updated label with renal impairment data in both the U.S. and EU and ABRAXANE for early stage breast cancer in the EU.","On the clinical side, we expect data from the REMARC, CONTINUUM, ETNA and TENACITY trial. In addition, we expect proof-of-concept data for CC-122 in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and for the VentiRx TLR8 agonist in solid tumors. Furthermore, we are advancing a number of clinical programs, including the Phase III trials for luspatercept, AG-221 and AG-120. Our broad program across multiple hematological indications for durvalumab and our novel BCMA program for myeloma.","We're excited about both our short-term growth outlook and near term clinical and regulatory catalyst as well as the significant promise of the mid to long-term based on a number of key milestones to come.","Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to Scott.","Scott A. Smith","Thank you, Jackie and good morning. 2015 was a great year. A year full of accomplishment and advancement for Celgene I&I. In 2015, we saw revenues accelerating throughout the year in the U.S. We had approvals in the EU for both psoriasis and PsA and launched in the early EU reimbursement countries. We also significantly advanced the development pipeline for Celgene I&I with the acquisition of Receptos in lead molecule Ozanimod as well as taking major steps forward in the GED-301 development program.","We now look at global sales; we can see 2015 Q4 net sales were $183 million leading to full-year sales of $472 million. The majority of revenues in 2015 were from the U.S., but we are seeing very encouraging metrics in the early launch countries in the EU as well as Canada. Overall, we are pleased with how the global launch was executed in 2015, the first full-year commercialization for OTEZLA and we believe it provides the tremendous pace as we move into 2016 and beyond.","Now looking specifically at the U.S., physician and consumer campaigns are driving increases in brand awareness, patient requests and trials. The launch of DTC campaign in late Q2 corresponded with an inflection of the OTEZLA TRx trajectory. It is important to note that OTEZLA continues to lead all other therapies in new to branch here with approximately 40% in both psoriasis and PsA. Additionally, OTEZLA total market share in the large psoriasis market has surpassed Enbrel and now stands at 21% of the total branded market.","Now turning to Europe, we received regulatory approval for OTEZLA early in 2015 and have already launched in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, The Netherlands, Scandinavia and Scotland. We look to launch in the remainder of the significant European markets in 2016. As I stated earlier, we are seeing very encouraging trends in all the early launch markets and are particularly pleased with our progress in Germany.","In 2016, we should see continuing flow of data for OTEZLA. As mentioned earlier in the year at the JP Morgan Conference, we recently received the two year radiographic data from the Phase III Ankylosing spondylitis study. Although, the study did not meet its primary endpoint, we are very encouraged by the data which show a lack of progression of disease for a majority of patients. In addition to seeing these data in the major medical meeting in 2016, we also hope to get data from the Phase II proof-of-concept studies in atopic dermatitis and also colitis as well as data to support our QD formulation.","We are aggressively advancing all pipeline programs, including GED-301 and Ozanimod. Specifically looking at GED-301 in 2015, we initiated the endoscopic study CD-001 in Crohn's disease as well as the large pivotal Phase III Crohn's disease trial CD-002 and the Phase II proof-of-concept study in UC.","During 2015, we also acquired Receptos with a lead molecule Ozanimod, a potential best-in-class next-generation S1P receptor modulator. Post acquisition, we were able to work closely with the talented people of Receptos to accelerate both the MS and UC programs. The radius of funding Phase III MS clinical trials are now fully enrolled and ahead of schedule. We expect to file for MS in the second half of 2017. We've also initiated a pivotal Phase III UC trial to north and a Phase II proof-of-concept study of Ozanimod in the treatment of Crohn's.","2015 was a year of tremendous progress for Celgene I&I. The execution of the OTEZLA launch has put us in a position to be a blockbuster contributor to the Celgene portfolio in 2016 and beyond. We also moved all major development programs ahead through significant milestones in 2015. These programs should help drive strong growth through 2020 and beyond.","We are very excited and optimistic about the future of OTEZLA and the rest of the I&I portfolio as we move into 2016. Thank you for your attention and I would like to now turn the call over to Mark.","Mark J. Alles","Thank you, Scott. And thank you to all my colleagues for their commitments to patients we seek to serve and for delivering another year of outstanding result. As we transition to 2016, the clarity of our mission, the continuity of our leadership team and our focus on advancing key strategic imperative continues to energize and unify us.","Our robust 2016 guidance and 2020 outlook are built on a strong foundation of global commercial, clinical, regulatory and research operating excellence. The competitive advantages our products and teams have achieved provide us with considerable optionality and multiple strategic drivers to meet and exceed our near-term financial targets.","Longer term we expect significant additional revenue from new data and new indication for our existing commercial portfolio, plus the introduction of several products currently in late stage development to sustain our sales base through the loss of exclusivity for key products. Our long focus on internal research and external collaborations has generated a pipeline of approximately 50 unique molecules, many with transformative first in class clinical profiles and with the potential to be developed for more than 100 indications. These products are expected to fuel innovation and to create significant growth opportunities over the next 10 to 15 years. Moreover, we expect our consistently strong cash flow to provide additional opportunities to fortify our pipeline and enhance our outlook.","Near term catalyst for growth include the availability of data from at least 18 different Phase III trials beginning in the middle of this year and continuing through mid-2018. Strategically these studies also represent the opportunity to expand our hematology franchise to include lymphomas to advance our immuno-oncology programs in multiple solid tumors and blood cancers and the GED-301 ozanimod and OTEZLA to establish clear global leadership in the treatment of serious inflammatory bowel diseases. Other ongoing pivotal programs for AG-221, CC-46 and luspatercept may provide additional opportunities for near-term growth.","And over the next 12 to 24 months, we expect a steady stream of mid stage and proof-of-concept data to begin to establish the clinical profile of molecules generated from distributed and integrated drug development model. Importantly, these products and programs leverage or build on our established therapeutic franchises and may also support the creation of new franchises.","We know that our future begins with delivering on the results and the promise of 2016. We look forward to providing you with more details throughout the year on our progress achieving our top financial and operational priorities, and on our efforts to bring new disruptive therapies to patients in need.","Thank you very much. Operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt from Cowen & Company.","Eric Schmidt","Congrats on all the continued progress, maybe a question for Peter, I haven\u2019t heard Celgene refer to the 2017 guidance in a while. I think the last update was $13 billion to $14 billion top line about $7.25 in non-GAAP EPS. Is that still intact?","Peter N. Kellogg","Hey Eric its Peter, thanks for the question. So overall as you can see from our performance and the discussions today, we are feeling very good about the business performance. And in fact on a constant currently basis, we are on track driven by our multiple myeloma portfolio, REV, PAM and all the data that\u2019s been generated and all the great things; you are hearing about OTEZLA and the launch and the outlook. So on a constant currency basis, we are on track, maybe the mix is a little different than we originally thought but feeling really good.","That said, ForEx has been volatile since the time that guidance was issued in January 2013 and actually if you went from that time to today, we are probably seeing net of hedges about an $800 million impact on the top line. So we are calibrating on that and we do intend to provide an update as we get closer to 2017 based on where these ForEx rates, look like they are going to land in 2017. So thanks for the question.","I would also add just for what it's worth, we also added obviously in the beginning of 2015 our guidance out to 2020. And clearly we are making a lot of investments to drive towards that and we feel very good. We updated it last summer after the Receptos and the AstraZeneca deal and we have reaffirmed it earlier in this month and it remains entirely on track despite the implied ForEx impact. Clearly, ForEx has been affecting net outlook too but our operating performance in that timeframe we think will overcome that. And just for perspective from the time that we gave that guidance to 2020, there is about $700 million, $800 million headwind as well, but we\u2019re good to cover that. We feel very good about that.","And then obviously in the bottom line, we\u2019re making significant investments in R&D we have to see how those develop and so forth, and as well as some of the milestones that come through. So our feeling is in total we really kind of guide our organization headed towards hitting the 2016 numbers driving towards 2020, and we\u2019ll be updating that 2017 as we get close to the year when it's sort of like the next year ahead of us.","Eric Schmidt","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Alicia Young from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Alicia Young","Thanks for taking my questions guys, and congratulations on the progress over the past couple of years. I just wanted to switch a little bit and talk about OTEZLA, and maybe just understand some of the different European dynamics related with the large kind of country-by-country as you start to get reimbursement there.","Peter N. Kellogg","Thank you for the questions. So, where we are? Approvals was in early 2015 February and we then launched immediately in Germany and then there was a series of other launches mainly in smaller countries as we went through the year in 2015 where we were able to attain early reimbursement including Switzerland and Austria and Scandinavian country, Scotland. And so sort of a partial launch, we should see some very significant countries come online in Europe in 2016.","We should see the UK, France, Italy, Spain and some mid-markets in Europe. So I think I look at it as a very early start really in one of the major countries launch and 2016 will be the real true launch year for OTEZLA in Europe. And the early metrics as I said in the prepared remarks have been very strong in the early launch countries, so we're excited about being able to expand the presence in Europe.","Alicia Young","Are there any particular dynamics around like how patients are treated versus the U.S. in some of these countries in Europe, the kind of what changed as feeder rate of uptake in the particular country so we should focus on that?","Peter N. Kellogg","The only country where I think that there were two dynamics, one dynamic applies to all of Europe, there is a little bit less utilization of biologic therapies in Europe than you see on a per patient basis in North America and the U.S. and Canada. So the biologic market is a little bit smaller, there has been less use more use of earlier therapy, so I think that bodes well for our market presence.","There is one market in Germany that does have a substantial oral market already with the fumaric acid ester product and so there is a substantial market, that's lot less a little bit different than the U.S., but we think we have a really nice opportunity in Europe, because of the relative lack of use of biologics relative to the U.S. and Europe.","The demographic patient numbers are very similar when you take a look at psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, so that's a market which has been even less penetrated, so we're very excited about that forming out over the course of time in Europe. And then hopefully filing in Japan earlier this year and launching in Japan in 2017, which is a very underserved market, so we've got a lot of nice growth coming in the future.","Alicia Young","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JP Morgan.","Cory Kasimov","Hey good morning guys, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on POMALYST which seem to have a nice peak this quarter. I wonder if there is anything different about 4Q relative to the prior ones? And then maybe more so how you are thinking about how CD38 antibodies potentially fit into the myeloma treatment paradigm and I assume this is something you see as complimentary to your [style as] (Ph) IMiD backbone? Thanks.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","Cory, its Jackie, thanks for the question. So I think mostly what we're seeing with the POM performance in Q4 is the ongoing impact of penetration in Europe, you probably heard what I said in my prepared remarks where the product now and third and fourth lines in Europe has reached about a-third and that's happened over a period of time. Also, we had the launch of POM that started in Japan in June and we've seen very, very nice uptake in Japan in the first six months or seven months have been on the market there.","I also think that the treatment landscape is starting to maybe settle out a little bit, although we've got [indiscernible] coming in just now and just now starting to ramp up. Within this landscape, the Pom-Dex regimen is very competitively positioned as it's the only regimen that has proven survival after REVLIMID relapse and exposure to [indiscernible] inhibitor. So we're seeing early uptake riding in that fourth line in greater setting and we're seeing the rest of the landscape start to play out as we've got the other combinations that have been approved.","I think it's a bit early to call trends on Triplet adoption broadly in relapsed\/refractory myeloma, but with the sequencing of pattern, we're going to see more of that and we think POM is very well positioned to compete there. We're also probably getting a little bit of an impact carfilzomib moving into the second line there. Relative share gains were greater in second line than any other line of therapy as you would expect and I think that creates even potentially more in the third line greater setting for these other therapies to take their place.","Cory Kasimov","Okay. Thanks Jackie.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI.","John Miller","It's actually John Miller on for Mark. Congrats to Mark and Jackie for the new positions. Mark said in this regard he couldn\u2019t join the colleagues, he is at shopping for a new wig to wear in tomorrow\u2019s video. I just had a quick question about the REMARC trial. Do you need OS data for reimbursement and do you have it this year?","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","So our position on that at the time of readout of the trial and first of all, I'm not going to make any comments about what type of wig I think Mark may show up and show us, let\u2019s just see how that one goes. With the trial, what we would expect to see with the readout would be obviously the PFS result and then a trend in OS. I think we believe that if there is a positive trend in OS and it will depend on the strength of the trend that that would be something the regulator could view favorably with respect to the submission.","Obviously, if you had a statistically significant OS the trend right out of the gate that would be extremely positive and that\u2019s not our base case assumption, but we think with the positive PFS readout and some trend on OS that that would put us in a very good position with the regulators. As you know, it's a high unmet medical need, you have got a significant relapse rate in diffuse large B-cell and most of it occurs within two years, the patient prognosis is quite bad upon relapse. There is no currently accepted maintenance therapies, there is no data that support maintenance therapies right now and so a positive readout on this trial would put us in very good position in diffuse large B-cell.","John Miller","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Roden from UBS.","Matthew Roden","Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions, great job on diversifying this pipeline away from REVLIMID. That said, I do have a REVLIMID question on maybe one of the bigger readouts for the year the REMARC study. So this is a maintenance study following response to R-CHOP upfront in DLBCL. If you think down the road a little bit if the front line R-CHOP center to care shifts to include Ibrutinib then to what extent would you see that shift as potentially impacting the REVLIMID opportunity here? I am just trying to get a sense for whether or not this could wind up in with like GCB subtype? Because it seems like the non-GCB subtype addressed by Ibrutinib might be the smaller subset in DLBCL. Just trying to connect the dots for us in this opportunity if you will, thanks very much.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","Thanks Matt. Well, let\u2019s see how it goes and let's remember that across the program, we have data coming from the RELEVANCE trial, we have augmented and we have magnified. We have the ROBUST trial as well where we have that GCB, non-GCB and ADC subtype subset. So, I think in the first instant the positive readout on the REMARC trial gives us a nice opportunity. In diffuse large B-cell again you\u2019ve got high unmet medical need and probably going for multiple therapy should others come along and give positive results.","Matthew Roden","But I guess the REMARC study includes both subtypes. Is that right?","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","Yes.","Matthew Roden","Okay great. Thanks very much for taking the questions.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Harrison","Great. Thanks for taking the question and good morning everybody. Can you just maybe take a moment and I know in your prepared remarks you commented on this somewhat. But talk to us a little bit about specific trends and duration that you are seeing. How you are seeing that play out in Europe versus maybe lengthening duration in the U.S. obviously for REVLIMID? And then the impact that you are seeing from some of the new triplets that are coming on the market or even the potential for the antibody combinations, and just your expectation around how you are thinking about substantial changes to duration, either this year or over the next couple of years? Thanks.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","I think, well everything that we\u2019ve seen and you\u2019ve seen is supportive for continued positive trends in duration of treatment across all lines of therapy, and that includes the data that we\u2019ve been readout so far with the triplet regimens and in particular the RVD data, which as we know was the first triplet regimen to readout for newly diagnosed and really quite impressive PFS results.","So what we\u2019re seeing in the market both in the U.S. and Europe are increasing duration trend for both REVLIMID and POMALYST, those are continuing to go very nicely. Europe is still somewhat behind the U.S. I think we\u2019ve talked about first exposure durations in the U.S. now being somewhere over 17 months, total exposure now over 22 months, continues to trend in a positive direction. The range across the Europe is somewhere now in the 12 to 14 months. So you can see ways to go for Europe to catch up. And now with the newly diagnose approval we should see that trajectory maybe steepen a little bit and continue.","We\u2019re also seeing nice duration gains for POMALYST as well and I think we\u2019ll see those across Europe over time and we\u2019ll see them in Japan. So all these clinical data continues to evolve is supported for early and continuous treatment of myeloma with REVLIMID and then strong role for the image and backbone therapy across any of the triplets that we\u2019ve seen so far including in combination with the monoclonal antibody.","Matthew Harrison","And Jackie are you willing to just make a comment around how long you think it might take for Europe to start looking like the U.S., or if you expect it to ever be as good as the U.S. and just maybe a slightly less?","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","Well, medically there is no reason why it should different. We start in a different place, so it will take a little bit of time to get there, but the trends are very good and I think that we\u2019ll see that happen over a period of time. These numbers that we give you area always averages across I think portfolio of patients so you can expect an average data point, it\u2019s just going to jump up from one day to the next and it will be a cumulative thing.","so every time we get a newly diagnosed patient on drug and then that newly diagnosed patient is staying on drug for a longer period of time. There is accumulative effect of that in the portfolio and that average starts going up and that average data point of course is applied to all the patients in the whole portfolio and it becomes a pretty big number.","So what we saw in the U.S., if we go back to the ASH data that came out, I think it was in 2009 and we started to see more move towards the continuous treatment paradigm, overtime after a few years, duration became the larger driver of growth in the U.S. and at some point that will happen in Europe, but that will play out over a few years","So I think the great news is there is multiple drivers, particularly in Europe and then in Japan, you've got a more relatively higher impact from market share gains in newly diagnosed early on the duration then starts to kick in and then that plays out overtime and so you got multiple factors driving growth and it'll do so for a long-long period of time.","Matthew Harrison","Great. Thank you very much for the color.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Yee","Thanks. Just sort of following along on some of the prior questions about duration et cetera, I know there was growing and increase in confidence of operation, partly from the ASPIRE data and the AbbVie data as well as obviously the RVd data, but yet the 2020 guidance wasn\u2019t changed. I know there is a lot of dynamics moving along particularly FX, I mean do we just come away and take away the message that duration continues to get a lot better, but the FX was really a key issue in 2020. Maybe you just walk us through how the duration confidence is but yet 2020 wasn\u2019t really changed and things with that nature? Thanks.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","Hi Michael thanks for the question. I'll let Peter jump in after and maybe I'll just start. I think I mean we've just think the [SLOG] (Ph) data presented at ASH in December. We've now got the Triplet regimen approved in the relapse setting and this is going to play out over a period of time. We feel highly confident in our long-term growth prospects and what we think duration trends are going to be.","We also have been pleased with the reimbursement discussions for newly diagnosed label expansion for REVLIMID in Europe and now that we've got those countries on board and we'll have the remaining large ones in 2016. We go forward from that in a very good position with respect to having already negotiated REVLIMID price, so as other therapies come to market and all the clinical data supports longer duration of treatment.","So we feel really good about that. Have we fully updated our financial forecast to reflect what the full opportunity of that could be? We have not, because we want to give it a little bit of time to just settle in, see what physicians are saying now with all of the new treatments had come to market, socialize a bit more of that SLOG data and other things.","And we also are in the situation as Peter mentioned with the FX headwind. We got puts and takes in the financial model that might such that we already gave an update on 2020 in the middle of the summer and we increased despite with the FX numbers that Peter put out there. so I think all of these trends and where we are in the market also set us up very well in terms of how we think about development of our next-generation novel agents and molecules and a bit of this also could relate to the evolving non-Hodgkin's landscape as well.","But when you look at CC-122, CC-220, the DCMA, durvalumab and the things that we are moving along. I think we're in an excellent position to not only continue to evolve the treatment paradigms for patients, but to see those result in a very robust portfolio of products that's going to allow us to deliver strong growth for a long time to come.","Peter N. Kellogg","Well said. The only thing I would add is that just to be clear, my comments earlier highlighted in fact the foreign exchange rates have moved to create a little bit of headwind for 2020, but we've got that covered. In other words, right now some of the strengths in our business, all the things that Jackie talked about as well as some of the strengths you're seeing in the I&I portfolio makes us feel very comfortable for 2020. So we confirm out that 2020 guidance. We are recognizing the ForEx impact and we're fine.","And in fact sometimes I'm asked when I talk with investors, if the rates reverse if the dollar weakens a bit, does that help us? And the answer would clearly be, yes, so it works both ways, so but at this point we feel great about the guidance we have in 2020. 2015 what we've seen in the last year both commercially as well as in the pipeline just is very encouraging for that timeframe, so we feel great about it.","Michael Yee","Okay. Thank you for clarifying that.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays.","Geoffrey Meacham","Hey guys thanks for taking the question. I got a couple on ABRAXANE, so I wanted to get a sense for the near term and what if any changes have you seen in the number of cycles out of pancreatic or lung? And then two longer term, what you guys view as the biggest driver? Is it IO combination? Is it pancreatic adjuvant? Is it just executing on OUS launch, et cetera. Thanks.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","Hi Jeff, thanks for the question. So, in terms of number of cycle I mean I think we\u2019re roughly in line with what we would have expected that\u2019s not a big driver. As you know, we\u2019ve had wins particularly in the U.S. with the launches of the checkpoint inhibitors. In the second half of 2015, it actually felt like that that stabilized a little bit, it did very rapid uptake something new comes to market. So we saw a little bit more stable shares in the second half of 2015, which I think is a good sign.","Outside the U.S., growth is quite solid, mostly driven by the pancreatic ongoing launches, where it's still pretty early days, in some countries we still don\u2019t have reimbursement in all of the top five countries in Europe. So that\u2019s going extremely well, and there are still room for from a share gain standpoint for us to establish ABRAXANE as standard of care in Europe and it take essentially the same place as taken in the U.S.","The lung launch in Europe is in very early days. So in the near-term that stronger growth outside the U.S. is going to contribute to putting us in a solid position with respect to overall global growth, while the rest of these things play out. So, just with respect to the couple of things that you highlighted, I think pretty obviously assuming that IO combination data is positive, you\u2019ve got the potential for ABRAXANE to be the backbone chemotherapy in multiple indications and IO combination regimen, so that would longer term be the more significant upside.","At the same time, the adjuvant pancreas trial is our trial, so that\u2019s fully within our management. And as you probably know that indication could double or potentially more than double the size of the pancreas opportunity for ABRAXANE versus the one that we have today. So those are a couple of things that we are pretty optimistic about and then for the next year or so, until we see some of that Phase III IO data in 2017. We\u2019re holding our own and doing really pretty well.","Geoffrey Meacham","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang from Bank of America.","Ying Huang","On a high level, you guys have now more than 18 Phase III trials ongoing. Also, just recently you settled with Aragon on the IPO for REVLIMID. Should we expect similar pace of business development activity in 2015? And then maybe questions for Jackie. Can you talk about the contributions of pricing and also volume increase in 4Q 2015 sales or revenue within the U.S. market? Thank you.","Robert J. Hugin","We\u2019re going to break these questions up, and I\u2019ll take the first one of the pace of BD, and obviously the IP settlement. So you are right, 2015 was a very big year for us, we got a lot accomplished when you think about deal with AstraZeneca to get into the checkpoint inhibitor space, with Juno, and then obviously Receptos and then other deals that are equally important. It was a very full agenda for the year.","And quite frankly, we aren\u2019t in way slowing down or backing down at all on that. It's really a question of what opportunities we see there and it's really a question of as they come along and to the right opportunities present ourselves within our sales, but we remain very focused on building the next generation of great assets. We are scanning constantly what the next the generation of technology would be.","And we find that we happen to be very fortunately working between our hematology and oncology space in the I&I area and in therapeutic, or in scientific areas, where science is really opening up and there is a lot of great technology coming through. So we want to make sure we\u2019re positioned against that. But we don\u2019t really work with the pace necessarily or any one budget, we just make sure that we\u2019re availing ourselves to what\u2019s out there.","Clearly, from a financial perspective, we have the financial strength to work with everybody and I think we\u2019ve got a very nice track record of designing these relationships with other companies in ways that work for each company. And we\u2019re very comfortable with that. I\u2019ll pass it then to Jackie for\u2026","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","So just on the price question, I mean what we see in environment within the U.S. where we are for the moment able to continue to take reasonable price increases on notably REVLIMID and POMALYST. We are quite conscious of linking those to the value proposition of the drugs and we think we have a very good case to make in that regards.","For the long term forecast, we have somewhat more moderate assumptions about the level of price increases that we would take in the U.S. over a period of time. What we\u2019ve seen this year is that outside of the U.S. and notably as we made our way to the newly diagnosed label expansion negotiations in Europe, we had price decreases across the portfolio that were pretty much in line with where we expected them to be, but versus a year ago they were a little bit more this year as we made our way through those negotiations.","So globally when you have those things together and Peter showed the numbers on one of his slides for the overall portfolio, we had a little bit of positive impact on the overall portfolio this year. But that includes mix as well and the ongoing growth in IMiD, OTEZLA coming into the portfolio. If you strip that out, the global impact of price all together is relatively modest.","Ying Huang","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Yatin Suneja from SunTrust.","Yatin Suneja","Hi guys, thank you for taking my question. I have a question on Juno collaboration; I believe you guys have an option on the CD19 program that might trigger sometime in first half. So, could you help us understand what efficacy threshold you need to see in order to exercise that option? And then a quick one for Peter. I noticed that the gross margins were a bit higher than expected; could you maybe give us some color there? How we should model it going forward? Thanks.","Peter N. Kellogg","Let me take the second question first, this is Peter. Hi, good morning. I did indicate that actually gross margin going forward and I'm talking about 2016, you should see a slight margin improvement in gross margin again and it's all mix related. I mean the guys in our operations space do a fantastic job, so they are always very productive, but also we had some benefit from mix. So I did highlight as you go forward into 2016, we will get the basis points I talked about at the bottom-line that would be driven primarily first by SG&A leverage there, but also by improved mix continuing to occur after the gross margin line.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","Thanks Peter, so just on the Juno opt in. As we know CD19 was the first program to come up for opt in under that collaboration. The totality of what we will see and want to see and under the contract are able to see to allow us to make that opt in decision include a whole package of information that Juno will be providing us and then we'll have the opportunity to evaluate that for some period of time before we make the opt in decision. And as we do that and as the programs move along, I'm sure we'll find the right way to talk a little bit more about all of the things that we're seeing around that that help us evaluate the program.","Yatin Suneja","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond from Raymond James.","Christopher Raymond","Just a question on OTEZLA and maybe a follow-up question as well if you don\u2019t mind, but on OTEZLA I think you guys have acknowledged that key barriers you've launched in the U.S. has been accessed. We've got some checks that sort of suggest that's kind of enduring. Can you sort of talk about where you are in the cycle here for improving that dynamic? What sort of changed? And maybe talk a little bit about the details about where in the chain that the biggest barriers might exist, is it sort of the PBM level or at the actual payer level and maybe contrast that to what you might expect in Europe, because you have obviously got sort of a different sort of payer situation there. And then on the business front, how much of a priority is it for you to use ex U.S. cash going forward? It's been an element I think in deals before, but just wondering, how much you think about that going forward? Thanks.","Scott A. Smith","Thanks Chris for the questions, this is Scott. We're very excited about the first year launch that we had for OTEZLA. As a matter of fact, it's the highest revenue first full-year launch in I&I ever, so really-really tremendous first year and momentum that we generated in the U.S. That was as I stated in the prepared remarks the 472 million, the vast majority of that was U.S. We're really launching in Europe this year and Japan thereafter, so we were able to I think very successfully penetrate the market.","Access is a barrier in this marketplace, it's a highly managed category. There is no question, but we continued to chip away that access environment and I think the important thing to note is that payers have implemented exceptions two biologic step pool, those that have it because they want to be able to encourage patients to be able to get on alternate therapy if the biologic therapy is not appropriate.","And so, the interesting thing is sort of the proof is really in the data, when I take a look at the data, more than 80% of patients in the psoriasis market that are coming on OTEZLA are not coming from a biologic, so the access things are there, but there are exceptions to be able to get around that and we have not found access to be a significant burden on the ability to drive demand.","We would like to evolve that access and maybe be in a preferred position as we go forward, but critical things for navigating the access environment is driving demand, driving volume and as I said earlier the most successful first year revenue launch in the I&I space ever, so we're very pleased with where we're at.","Robert J. Hugin","And Chris, it's Bob Hugin. Just on the business development, so I think we\u2019ve been incredibly sensitive and strategic for a very long time in terms of managing our intellectual property assets, our tax positioning so that we have a financial flexibility to execute any business development deal that we think is appropriate and promising for our long-term outlook and that's been the history to track record.","And as a part of that, our teams have been incredibly successful in terms of using offshore cash extensively on multiple transactions for a relatively long period of time. I think that strategy is one that's proven to be effective. We've never seen ourselves to be in a situation where we have some financial restriction that didn\u2019t allow us to do the kind of things that we want to do and our plan going forward anticipates that same kind of positioning, and I think Peter and his team is doing a great job in managing that.","Peter N. Kellogg","Thanks Bob. And the other thing I highlight is we really are not in a position where we\u2019re constrained in any particular manner in the U.S. In fact as you saw and I mentioned in my remarks, during 2015, we spent $3.3 billion on share repurchase. And where the market is today and where it's been recently, it's a great opportunity going forward. So, we will continue to see ourselves being particularly forceful in the share repurchase area, because we are in great shape on cash and we see the stock in this sector right now great value.","Christopher Raymond","Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jim Birchenough from Wells Fargo.","Nicholas Wunderlich","Good morning. It\u2019s Nick on the line for Jim this morning. I just want to go back to REMARC and couple of questions there. And what is the hurdle you\u2019re looking for on the clinicaltrial.gov listing? There is a 60 month improvement in PFS, which seems very aggressive for relatively small trial. So is that a hurdle? And then in the statistical analysis plan, does that include the analysis the data by cell of origin? Thank you.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","There is a lot of details of our statistical analysis plans that we don\u2019t give out. So we\u2019re not going into that detail. What I would say is in the setting we just filed earlier about the high unmet medical need in diffuse large B-cell. we believe that with the trial design and when we have that data readout and then present the details now that you will have significantly more information obviously. But we believe within this landscape that a positive REMARC trial with in imply clinically relevant benefit for patients for REVLIMID\u2019s maintenance therapy post R-CHOP and would put us in a very good position with respect to regulatory submission and with respect to reimbursement negotiations.","Patrick Flanigan","So operator we\u2019re moving past clock now. We apologize and appreciate all the questions. Why don\u2019t we take two more questions if there is still some in the queue, and then we\u2019ll wrap up.","Operator","Certain, our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams from Jefferies.","Brian Abrahams","Hey guys thanks for taking my question. Question on the long-term opportunity for ABRAXANE in the neoadjuvant breast setting, you mentioned the ETNA study. Wondering if you could talk a little bit about the design there? What we should be looking for in that retail this year? And how that potentially fits into your regulatory plans for that indication alongside GeparSepto? And maybe just from a bigger picture standpoint, how we should be thinking about that overall market opportunity, just given what seem like very high patient numbers, but maybe an unclear standard of care with paclitaxel not necessarily used across the board there? Thanks.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","Yes, I mean we think it's a nice incremental opportunity. There are other opportunities for ABRAXANE that would more significant. Let me just put the ETNA study into context first. So our discussions with the healthcare authorities so far has been based on the GeparSepto trial and getting feedback from them with respect to what they would want to see for a regulatory submission in the neoadjuvant setting.","So the GeparSepto trial data would be the data to focus on for that. it could be that the ETNA study should it be supportive for their different trial designs would be something that we potentially could consider again as supportive, but not necessary. And we\u2019ve had enough of feedback and particularly we thought the path is clear in Europe and we have said that our plan is to submit based on the GeparSepto data in Europe the fourth quarter of this year.","We need a little bit more clarification from FDA about some of the data that they would want to see before we make a decision about timing in the U.S. So do we want to go through the trial design for ETNA we looking forward up on the clinicaltrials.gov is a slightly different patient population, it's the HER2 negative high risk the population, again potentially complementary to the GeparSepto data but not necessary from the submission standpoint.","Brian Abrahams","Got it. Thanks very much Jackie.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question for today comes from the line of Brian Skorney from Robert Baird.","Brian Skorney","Hey good morning guys, thanks for taking me in. Just a quick question, you put up an interesting slide at ASH showing the breakdown in first line myeloma sharing the non-transplant setting in the U.S. about 30% of the market its Velcade based without REVLIMID. Just give your thoughts on given the efficacy or RVd. What you guys see as the primary roadblock to converting that share over? Is it just an education component or is there a cost component? And maybe should we be thinking of the entrance of Generic Velcade next year as a driver there?","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","So I guess the point that we were trying to make and believe me we do everything we can from education standpoint to make sure there is a clinical data is properly disseminated and well understood. When you look at shares, the point is that given the strength of that RVd data and the current share position, there is room for more adoption of the RVd triplet and we think that even in the current environment the PFS data supports that greater adoption.","You have also potentially seen in smart guideline as one example, get updated where RVd has replaced [indiscernible] for newly diagnosed under those guidelines, so you can already see a positive reception to that data just based on the strength of the data. On a go forward basis, I think that going generic given the strength of the efficacy data for the RVd regimen is going to put the regimen in a very good position in a number of geographies with respect to adoption and I think it's going to be highly competitive for the regimen and we think about the Triplet coming along. They are all going to have to find a way to show their value proposition in that landscape.","Brian Skorney","Great. Thank you.","Patrick E. Flanigan","So thank you for all the questions this afternoon. We apologize we ran a little bit past 10:00. We are very excited about obviously proud of 2015. The organization did a great job and very excited to get going in 2016. We are off to a good start in Q1 and I think there is going to be a lot of interesting pipeline news flow, as well as great launch, continued success with OTEZLA and expansion of the HemOnc franchise around the world. So looking forward to a very good year in 2016. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference.

As we have reported, 2013 was an exceptional year for Celgene. And the outlook for 2014 is even brighter. Today, we will review some of these highlights from a perspective of how they support the achievement of our 2014 goals and enhance our long-term growth trajectory. The progress achieved in 2013 positively impacted our prospects in multiple ways. Through our innovative research and development strategies, we have built an extraordinarily high potential, deep and diverse research in Phase 1 pipeline. This pipeline has been created by our internal teams and in collaboration with some of the world\u2019s finest research-based companies and investigators. I should note that we\u2019re rapidly advancing our next generation biologics platform with three biologic candidates in the clinic and expected 50% of our new INDs to come from these programs in 2015.","In addition to our early stage pipeline our Phase II program which today encompass over 100 clinical trials in over 50 different indications have the potential to produce proof-of-concept data in multiple indications for multiple products in the next 12 to 24 months.","As for genetics focused compound from our pipeline such as oral azacitidine as a priming agent for solid tumor cancers and compounds from Agios and Epizyme are among these high potential opportunities.","Our Phase III pipeline has delivered numerous positive results over the past 12 to 18 months. We expect important new data this year from Phase III trials in both our I&I and Hematology Oncology pipeline.","Significantly we\u2019re advancing new compounds and indications into Phase III including the potential for an ACE-11 or ACE-536 Phase III trial in beta-thalassemia and NVS later this year. The operating and financial results achieved in 2013 provide us with increasing momentum supporting the raising of our financial targets and provides the resources for us to invest in the future and to assertively manage our capital structure. It's an exciting time at Celgene and one of our most important opportunities is OTEZLA. Normally we would have Scott Smith, the Head of our I&I franchise here with us today to provide the update but he is with one of our regional teams participating in launch meetings today. I was with them last evening and are finalizing preparations and are ready to go.","We have assembled world class highly experienced commercial and medical affairs teams. Our complete psoriatic arthritis U.S. sales force is on board. They are energized, focused and prepared for launch. Using a wide array of tools including expense as market research a well-defined brand strategy has been developed to effectively position OTEZLA in the current competitive landscape.","We have finalized our sampling and distribution plans and our market access and pricing strategies as well. Our teams have built extensive, robust, strategic plans. As we\u2019re concentrating on launch preparations in the United States for psoriatic arthritis we\u2019re also ready to launch preparations for additional indications in the U.S. and international markets. In the United States we\u2019re moving forward expeditiously in advance of our September PDUFA date for our psoriasis application and our team in Canada is accelerating planning for psoriatic arthritis launch in the next few months and we anticipate European action on our combined psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis application late this year.","We\u2019re also actively advancing OTEZLA and other indications. We expect Phase III data from our ankylosing spondylitis trial during this coming next quarter. We expect to initiate Phase II trials in Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and atopic dermatitis later this year. It's an exciting program.","Let me now turn the call over to Jackie.","","Jackie Fouse","Thank you Bob. Good morning to all and thanks for joining us on our Q4, 2013 call. We have finished 2013 with strong momentum across the Board and we\u2019re happy with the start we\u2019re seeing so far in 2014. Our teams around the world deliver on all of our key financial and operational metrics. Product sales grew 18% in 2013 versus our original expectation of 11%. REVLIMID sales grew 14% versus our original expectation of 10%. Adjusted earnings per share grew 21% versus our original expectation of 14% and we did this while investing in our emerging Inflammation & Immunology franchise and while making incremental investments in R&D over the course of the year that were in addition to our original plan. We also continued to return funds to shareholders via share repurchases and these totaled $2.8 billion for the year.","As we move into 2014 we are in a great place with respect to our ability to deliver both strong current year financial performance and strong sustainable long term growth and performance.","Summarizing our topline growth for Q4 and the full year, product sales reached just over $1.7 billion for the quarter posting 22% year-over-year growth and $6.362 billion for the full year, 18% growth. Both periods reflect the entry of generic competition to VIDAZA in the U.S. as of the beginning of Q4.","Royalty and other revenues for the full year amounted to $132 million. Including these, total revenue for Q4 was just over $1.75 billion, year-over-year growth of 21% and $6.494 billion for the full year, 18% growth. Q4 year-over-year growth accelerated compared to the prior two years, particularly as a result of building momentum in ABRAXANE globally, POMALYST in the U.S. and IMNOVID in Europe, along with very good overall growth in geographies, where our local businesses are still in the early stages of development.","Full year 2013 growth accelerated versus 2012 for the same reasons and in spite of the impact of the U.S. generic VIDAZA entry. Consistent with what we saw throughout the year, our Q4 growth was driven by volume, which was up 21% and globally we had a modest net 2% positive impact from price and a net 1% negative impact from foreign exchange. Full year growth came entirely from 18% volume growth as price of positive 2% and foreign exchange of negative 2% offset each other.","Our adjusted earnings per share growth trajectory continues to be strong and EPS grew faster than revenues for the full year at 21% while we continue to invest in the business and including the impact of milestone payments related to our R&D collaboration agreements. The amount of collaboration milestones and extension payments totaled $65 million for the full year or $0.13 was $52 million of those occurring in Q4 about $0.10.","For the quarter, our EPS growth was fueled solely by operating income growth. For the full year, operating income growth contributed 90% of our EPS growth and the cumulative impact of our last three shares of share repurchases contributed the remaining 10%. We are extremely happy with the evolution of our product portfolio, including the performance of our flagship product, REVLIMID with strong momentum in ABRAXANE now with three approved indications and the addition of POMALYST, IMNOVID and the outstanding launches our team delivered for those products in 2013.","U.S. REVLIMID growth was very solid all year finishing with 15% year-over-year growth for the quarter and 16% for the full year. International REVLIMID growth was equally impressive at 11% for both the quarter and full year net of price decreases in many international markets. Branded VIDAZA continues to grow nicely outside the U.S., while in the U.S., we saw the impact of generic competition to the brands in Q4. ABRAXANE growth accelerated throughout the year as we solidified our position in breast cancer, grew it in non-small cell lung cancer, and began the launch of the product in pancreatic cancer. We have realized outstanding global growth in the brand with an overall 90% increase for the quarter year-over-year comparison and 52% for the full year with both the U.S. and international markets performing well.","In our first year on the market and even without a full year of revenues in any jurisdiction, POMALYST\/IMNOVID is already an over $300 million product in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma and we look forward to a strong growth trajectory for the product for some time to come. Total other revenues include ISTODAX, thalidomide, and our authorized generic for VIDAZA in the U.S., with this latter particularly impacting Q4.","Looking at other major line items in the P&L, our product gross margin improved 40 basis points to 95% for the quarter and 30 basis points to 94.9% for the full year. R&D expense as a percentage of revenue delivered 60 basis points of leverage for the full year ending at 23.2% even as we invested incrementally to support our top line and long-term growth. For the quarter, R&D expense was up 420 basis points versus last year as a result of our expense for ongoing clinical trial as well as incremental investments in our collaboration arrangements and the impact of the milestone payments I mentioned earlier.","SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue was down by 70% basis points in the quarter but increased 60 basis points for the full year due to investments in support of a multitude of launch activity in our Hematology and Oncology franchises throughout 2013 including POMALYST\/ IMNOVID globally, REVLIMID for mantle cell lymphoma in the U.S., REVLIMID for India and Europe and ABRAXANE in pancreatic cancer globally.","As well as investments we made in our I&I business will be ready for OTEZLA commercialization. I will talk more about the trends we see in the (indiscernible) for 2014 when I cover our financial guidance. We improved our full year operating margin by 30 basis points to 48.4% a little lower than we originally planned because we saw opportunities to make unplanned investments that we believe will serve us well in the future.","Those related to both launches and new clinical development projects. The margin was impacted in Q4 by collaboration milestones, pancreatic launch expenses and hopefully in the U.S. and in the IMNOVID launch expenses in Europe.","We ended the year with an effective tax rate of 16.8% basically in line with our guidance. We continue to produce higher returns on invested capital over time as you will remember we acquired Abraxis in 2010 and our returns dipped modestly for that year and then returned to their pre-acquisition level right away and continued to grow subsequently. The income when used for this ROI pre-calculation [ph] is U.S. GAAP income and we will give two measures of ROIC one that is growth invested capital including cash balances and one that uses net invested capital excluding cash balances. The gross return was somewhat negatively impacted in 2013 by increase in cash we experienced post our August bond issuance and I expect that trend to reverse and improve over the course of 2014.","At 12\/31\/2013 we had about $5.7 billion of cash in our balance sheet up from 3.9 billion at year-end 2012. We have produced strong net cash flows from operations of over 2.2 billion during the year and we bought back $2.8 billion of our shares. For the full year 2013 we made 576 million in upfront payments in the context of R&D collaboration deals, another 162 million for equity stakes in our Partner Company and $53 million for prepaid R&D of both totaled $227 million was paid in Q4 for upfront payments and $40 million for equity spend.","The equity stakes appeared on balance sheet, if the companies are public the stakes are mark to market with the value of the stakes being included within our total cash and marketable securities but the impact of the mark to market does not go through our adjusted GAAP P&L, adjusted or GAAP P&Ls unless we sell the stake.","For partner companies we do not record any gains on those investments unless we realize gains upon sales of the stake but we do record write downs in both our adjusted and GAAP P&Ls in the events of impairments of those stakes.","Prepaid R&D is amortized in both our adjusted and GAAP P&Ls as the R&D work is carried out. If we have cost sharing arrangements in our deals those expenses are included in both our adjustment and GAAP P&Ls and any milestone payments included in these deals also flow through both our adjusted and GAAP P&Ls.","Onetime upfront payments included value for the components of the deals related to acquiring product rights, options to license products and options to acquire our partner companies. We view these as acquisition like payments and therefore exclude them from our adjusted P&L.","Our unique business development strategy is designed to give us access to potential breakthrough science and leading technology to allow us to pay our partners for success and share risks with them along the way and to give us the multitude of (indiscernible) in the categories we think will be important to sustaining long term innovation in our core businesses.","Turning to our financial guidance for 2014, we previously told you we expect total revenues of approximately $7.5 billion with product revenues of 7.3 billion to 7.4 billion and REVLIMID revenues of 4.9 billion to 5 billion. Growth of 16% each at the midpoint of the range. Our total revenue guidance includes the impact of a full year of generic VIDAZA in the U.S.","We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $7 to $7.20 growth of 19% at the midpoint. We expect an operating margin for the full year of about 50% with cost of goods sold around 4.8% of revenues, R&D about 22.8% including the impact of collaboration cost-sharing arrangement and an estimate for possible 2014 milestone payments and SG&A around 22.5% including the impact of continued investment in our I&I platform. We see some leverage from each of these line items in 2014 while we maintain our strategy of investing for the future. Finally, we expect our effective tax rate to be about 16.5% for the year and we forecast a fully diluted weighted average share count of 425 million shares for our EPS calculations.","On the strength of our outstanding performance in 2013 and with the catalyst we see ahead of us in 2014 and beyond, we have updated our long-term targets and now see revenues in the range of $13 billion to $14 billion in 2017 and earnings per share of at least $15. Our expected comps and annual growth trajectories for both revenues and EPS are accelerating up to 21% and 26% respectively versus 19% and 25% from our previous targets. All of the increase in our revenue targets comes from our hematology franchise as REVLIMID is poised to embark on its next wave of accelerating global growth with future label expansions expected for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and as POMALYST\/IMNOVID solidifies its global position in relapsed refractory myeloma.","To finish on our long-term targets, our EPS targets include our assumptions for investment in our I&I infrastructure globally as well as continued investment in our portfolio of our new projects and activities, including our collaboration arrangements. While we make those investments, we believe we can continue to generate sustained improvement in our operating margins and grow earnings at a faster rate than revenues. As concerned to the financial drivers, we expect our effective tax rate to be on average flat at about 16.5% for the 2014 to 2017 period and for our fully diluted share count to be flat at 425 million shares.","There are a number of Phase 3 trials for which potential positive impacts have not yet been included in our financial model. These are listed on the webcast slide and include both new indications for existing products as well as completely new compounds in late stage developments like CC486 or oral azacitidine compound and the Acceleron compounds, ACE-11 and 536. You will see data for our Phase 3 trial of OTEZLA of ankylosing spondylitis in the first half of this year and for other trials over the timeframe to 2017. With these as well as numerous other trials we have planned or initiated in Phases 1 and 2, we are confident in our R&D engine and its ability to produce continuous flow of data and new products to fuel our growth for very long time.","Our business model continues to deliver sustainable operating leverage. And on this chart, you can see our past track record in that regard as well as where we see ourselves by 2017. We now estimate our adjusted operating margin to reach 57% in 2017 versus our prior target of 55%. All of our P&L metrics are strong and our model is delivering on its promise as a result of the efforts of all Celgene employees around the world and across all functions.","Let me now finish by reiterating that 2013 was a year of excellence in both execution and strategy across all functions throughout Celgene around the world. That excellence drove outstanding financial performance and momentum that we see carrying into 2014 and we are in a great position to capitalize on the milestones we see coming this year and beyond. Mark will now talk more about our strong operational performance and our bright future. Mark?","","Mark Alles","Thanks Jackie. Good morning everyone. As you heard from Bob and Jackie, we made outstanding progress last year and generated strong momentum in the fourth quarter. We achieved a number of very significant clinical and regulatory milestones. Total net product sales grew 18% year-on-year to $6.400 billion. REVLIMID sales exceeded more than $4 billion for the first time. We introduced REVLIMID into new markets, added the MDS\/Deletion 5q Indication in Europe and the relapsed or refractory mantle cell indication in the United States.","Major new REVLIMID clinical data and the U.S. and EU regulatory approvals for POMALYST\/IMNOVID significantly strengthened and expanded our global multiple myeloma franchise. ABRAXANE in combination with gemcitabine is approved in the U.S. and in Europe for the treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Extending our scientific leadership remains a top priority and we significantly strengthened our development pipeline. In 2013, we established several important partnerships and alliances and together with investigators presented and publish the results of more clinical research than ever before. We enter 2014 completely aligned by our common purpose. We\u2019re acutely aware of the unmet medical needs of cancer patients worldwide. In 2013 more than 200,000 unique patients in over 60 countries were treated with one or more of our products but the treatable population we seek to help is more than 1 million patients and it's growing. Let me turn briefly to our product results and begin with REVLIMID. Key brand performance indicators remain strong in the fourth quarter, sales were driven by four factors, increased duration, global myeloma market share about 50% and continued expansion of use of mantle cell lymphoma in the United States and NVS in Europe.","REVLIMID sales grew 4% quarter-on-quarter to $1.136 billion and 14% year-on-year to $4.280 million. New potential clinical and commercial opportunities for REVLIMID in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, low risk MDS, AML and CLL are expected to come into greater focus throughout the next 12 to 18 months. Two little Phase III registration studies testing REVLIMID as maintenance therapy in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in combination with rituximab in follicular lymphoma and as maintenance therapy and chronic with specific [ph] leukemia should complete the enrollment in 2014. We also expect to have the results of the MDS-005 study in patients with Non-Deletion 5q MDS during the second half of this year.","Each study is tied directly to a major unmet medical need and positive results would be expected to provide significant upside to our current 2017 sales target. The American Society of Hematology Meeting in early December represented a milestone for the next phase of accelerating growth for our Hematology franchise. We believe four major themes emerged during ASH, renewed focus on the molecular classification of diseases and necessary diagnostics, the evolution of targeted treatments, epigenetics in MDS and NHL and the clinical benefit of continuous treatment uncured disease progression. In the short term we\u2019re completely focused on establishing the continuous treatment paradigm for REVLIMID in all lines of therapy for multiple myeloma and for POMALYST\/IMNOVID in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma extending duration of treatment until disease progression is critical for optimal patient benefit and it is one of our most important value drivers.","Prior to ASH we highlighted three abstracts with particular importance to our REVLIMID newly diagnosed multiple myeloma regulatory strategy. The progression free survival two results from the MM-O15 study, the meta analysis for lenalidomide randomized maintenance trials in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and the final [ph] representation of the initial results of our MM-20 study.","Our focus now is to provide these and other safety data sets as part of our EU and U.S. regulatory submissions for REVLIMID in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Recall that we plan to pursue the broadest possible indication. REVLIMID in combination with low dose dexamethasone is indicated for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. We have made excellent progress building these regulatory dossiers and we continue to expect submission by the end of this quarter.","Fourth quarter POMALYST\/IMNOVID sales grew 34% quarter-on-quarter to 120 million and full year 2013 sales were $305 million. Although still very early in U.S. launch we\u2019re encouraged by reports of significant patient benefit and by the almost 30% market share used in patients with multiple myeloma who have progressed after at least two prior therapies. Since the August 2013 approval of IMNOVID in Europe we have initiated market by market pricing and reimbursement discussions and they are going very well. Despite this obvious gain to market adoption early 2014 sales of IMNOVID are strong. Given the lack of other novel agents in Europe for patients who have failed REVLIMID based or Bortezomib based treatments we expect IMNOVID to rapidly become standard of care in this study. The 2013 clinical regulatory and commercial success of the ABRAXANE has helped us to more fully establish an oncology franchise that is bringing important outcomes to patients who continue to have extremely limited therapeutic options. 2013 is a breakout year for ABRAXANE.","Fourth quarter sales were $202 million representing 19% quarter-on-quarter and 52% year-on-year growth. Approved for metastatic breast cancer in more than 30 countries, the recent U.S. approval and launches of ABRAXANE in combination with carboplatin for lung cancer and in combination with gemcitabine for metastatic pancreatic cancer have dramatically changed the clinical and commercial potential of this innovative therapy. At least 11 trials of novel agents, including demcizumab in combination with ABRAXANE plus gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer are ongoing. We have initiated Phase 3 registration studies in adjuvant pancreatic cancer and in triple-negative metastatic breast cancer and we are exploring new clinical opportunities in lung cancer.","We will stay confident of being considered using combination strategies with epigenetic priming plus the T-cell checkpoint inhibitors, PD-1 and PDL-1, in lung cancer and other solid tumors. We are still learning about ABRAXANE\u2019s role and its full potential in the treatment of solid tumor cancers, but the clinical evidence and our execution are expected to make it one of our franchise blockbuster brands.","Our research and development team continued to build on our internal strengths while adding important opportunities through external alliances. We have developed substantial research platforms with competitive advantages in epigenetics, protein homeostasis, cancer stem-cell resistance and others. And these programs are producing multiple drug candidates each year. This productivity and innovations go to Phase 1 program in hematology and oncology that now includes next generation immunomodulatory drugs, targeted monoclonal antibodies, highly selective HDAC6 inhibitors, inhibitors of histone methyltransferases and other promising agents.","We are conducting or planning more than 100 Phase 2 or 3 clinical trials with our inline and pipeline therapies. Advancing CC-46 in MDS, AML and defining its role as a priming agent in combination strategy with solid tumors continues to be one of our most important and high potential programs defining registration studies for Btk inhibitor CC-292 and our next generation ended CC-152 are major objectives for 2014. In collaboration with our partner, Acceleron, we expect to be able to select either sotatercept or ACE-536 for full development in \u03b2-thalassemia and MDS during the second half of this year. 2014 is off to a very good start and our future is more promising than ever. Looking ahead, our franchise strategy remains very clear. We intend to capitalize on our global strength in hematology and to expand our oncology franchise. The opportunity to optimize the full clinical and commercial potential of REVLIMID, POMALYST and ABRAXANE drives what we do every day.","Before turning the call back to Bob, I would like to again thank my colleagues for their outstanding achievements in 2013. Thank you very much. Bob?","","Bob Hugin","Thank you, Mark, thank you, Jackie and thank you Scott for being out in the field ensuring that we are really ready for the launch of OTEZLA, very exciting. I hope you can sense our optimism on the future of Celgene. As we close the presentation, we thought it\u2019s helpful to provide a chart of the many significant milestones for 2014. We are very fortunate to have milestones across our portfolio with the potential to positively impact our growth trajectory. Many of which are not included in our base case outlook. These milestones range from late stage regulatory actions and the Phase 3 data that numerous proof-of-concept studies that can lead to registration trials. These milestones are the product of a long-term of investments in disruptive technologies with the potential to transform patient care.","The outlook for Celgene is brighter than ever. And we look forward to updating you up throughout the year on our 2014 results and our progress in enhancing our long-term growth prospects. Thanks for joining us today.

Your line is open.","","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank","Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. I guess I just wanted to ask about spondylitis, you had mentioned at JPMorgan that if that trial is successful, it could really change the trajectory of Apremilast, maybe talk a little bit more about what does that mean? How might it really affect the launch and other indications? And then second when you think about doctors and what they are looking for in Phase 3, what are the key metrics that docs will be looking about in the trial and we also have heard that the market smaller than psoriatic arthritis your number is just otherwise, how do you think about improving diagnosis in the market? Thanks.","","Bob Hugin","We\u2019re very excited about the potential here and it is a very, very near term outlook and I think as people really do have the opportunity to meet with thought leaders and understand the importance of the disease it will become more prominent as to what the potential is. I think one of the issues is that there really not many therapies for the indication certainly not any oral therapies and ones that really have the prospect for changing the course of disease. So it's such a near term event for us and it's almost 500 patients in the study fully accrued and we\u2019re in the last couple of months before we get that data. And we\u2019re optimistic that as we look at the not just science and symptoms but also the real underlying implications of the disease and impact of the disease that our product has the potential to have a significant impact there and when we think about the marketing and the fit with our focus on psoriatic arthritis we really see great leverage opportunity all around the world. This is as therapies come out of this marketplace I think you will see people looking and understanding on what the size of the market is and it's one that really fits with our focus on rheumatology organization that we have already built. So there is tremendous leverage there and again it's such a near term thing, we\u2019re going to see the data and we will be able to see what the consequence of that data are on and further we have the program to fully capitalize on it.","","Jackie Fouse","And just on [ph] demand, very quickly in terms of the potential I mean I think you\u2019ve seen probably the patient numbers, we know that there is a sizeable number of patients in for this indication in terms of the dollar value associated with that opportunity. It doesn\u2019t maybe look huge today but it's an evolving situation because of the need for it's an unmet medical need and the need for treatments there so we think it's going to be something that evolves quite positively overtime and we have not included anything in our model for that. So let\u2019s see how that goes.","","Bob Hugin","Yeah the data is very near term.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Schoenbaum with ISI Group. Your line is open.","","Mark Schoenbaum - ISI Group","Hey guys, hey first of all congratulations to Jackie on winning World\u2019s Best CFO contest in the II Magazine, well deserved and also for Patrick for the recognition in the IR part of that and also thanks for the detailed slides. I was looking at them and on slide 41 Jackie you had in there that you did about $576 million of upfront payments through collaboration partners in 2013. I was just wondering if you could give us directionally kind of what your budget for that line is roughly speaking in 2014 if possible and can congrats again.","","Jackie Fouse","We were really trying to educate a little bit on these upfront payments in just the nature of how we account for the things around our BD deals. We think that we have got a unique strategy going with respect to how we\u2019re approaching business development and our ability to access the assets and acquire those assets overtime so we think it's going to pay off very nicely from a strategy standpoint.","In 2013 we had significantly more activity than we have had in prior years partly because we\u2019re very focused on that but also because many of the partner companies have evolved overtime and are now at a point where my years of a lot of hard work of producing data and things that we have some visibility to certain compounds and certain areas and I think that\u2019s behind the level of activity as well. So in any given year it's going to hard for us to predict that, what we do include in our guidance our estimates for potential milestone payments in those agreements. We include the cost sharing components of those and we do not include new deals that we could have necessarily because it is just very hard to predict the flow of those and then what the components of each deal will be in terms of amounts related to equity stakes versus prepaid R&D versus upfront payments. So we are trying to give you the visibility to the data explaining what\u2019s behind the strategy and then dealt from there. So hopefully that answers the question.","","Mark Schoenbaum - ISI Group","Yes, thanks for the disclosure and clarity, Jackie.","","Jackie Fouse","Thank you.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","","Geoff Meacham - JPMorgan","Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Question on newly diagnosed label in Europe, obviously assuming approval, how should we think about the face of the rollout across Europe. And I know obviously it will take some time for reimbursement, but wasn\u2019t sure what you could do to accelerate that? And then I wasn\u2019t also sure what\u2019s now assumed in your 2015 new guidance or 2017 new guidance that accounts for the first time label? Thanks.","","Mark Alles","Yes, hi Jeff, it\u2019s Mark. Thanks for the questions. So on the pace of approval, we should start with what the assumption is in terms of submitting this quarter and then with typical review cycle for any application in front of CHMP and the European Commission. So we would expect approval coming about 12, 15 months later, maybe it\u2019s a month before that, but in that range followed immediately by uptake in some early launch countries, where we have experienced with POMALYST\/IMNOVID is illustrative, because we have seen sales in countries, for example, like Germany prior to the AMNOG full review and final price negotiation. So we would see some early launch and that is built into our base case out for \u201817. By mid \u201816 we would expect \u2013 mid 2016, we would expect that the majority of the European countries would have settled into a negotiated pricing volume agreement similar to what we have dealt with over the years with REVLIMID in the relapsed setting, now IMNOVID in the relapsed setting. And again in our model out for \u201817, we see that timing relatively constant. If we move a country, for example, one of the big five countries ahead by a quarter that would provide some obviously a nice momentum and upside in the years \u201816 to \u201817 but we don\u2019t see a lot of flexibility in that timing. Jackie, did you want to add anything?","","Jackie Fouse","So I think just from a modeling perspective, we have been able to refine a little bit ourselves on timing, so we \u2013 because of the visibility that we now have to the timing on the submission. So we would be assuming standard review times and approvals in Q1 of 2015 thereabouts in both the U.S. and Europe Q1 maybe beginning of Q2, but we also as a reminder assume in Europe that we are talking about a non-transplant eligible population, which in any event is about 75% of the opportunity in the first instance and we moved the stem cell transplant population out in terms of timing for approval. It\u2019s 18 to 24 months later in the model just to be clear about that. So the upside that you saw are reflecting our 2017 targets when we increased the $13 billion to $14 billion and the REVLIMID number now include our thoughts about the impact of the MMO-20 data in terms of influencing treatment paradigms as well as solidification of our thoughts on the timing and all of that. And that\u2019s what you see reflected in the numbers.","So whereas before, we talked about I think over time having somewhere between $300 million and $500 million globally and for incremental newly diagnosed revenues in 2017, you can essentially add that $1 billion increase in the REVLIMID number to that. I would say that we continue to be probably somewhat conservative in terms of our assumptions in any given geography around how fast we see share uptake, how fast we see the impact flowing through in terms of duration of treatment. So we put in there, as Mark said, base case based on what we think that we see today.","","Geoff Meacham - JPMorgan","Thank you.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoff Porges with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.","","Geoff Porges - Sanford Bernstein","Thank you very much for the question and congratulations on remarkable year. Quickly on MMO-20, just Mark could you talk a little bit about where you see things in the U.S. in terms of your ability to push share and duration, remarkable uptake already even without the label but with the label presumably your field organization and MSOs [ph] would be able to be much more active there. So is that something you see as a real opportunity and the driver and then just quickly another just could you tell us what we should be looking for on CC-486 in solid tumors. Is there a result this year that\u2019s going to tell us whether this is really a seemingly an incremental driver of effect and benefit and value?","","Mark Alles","So with respect to the U.S. market we\u2019re extremely sure that full approval in the U.S. for REVLIMID and newly diagnosed multiple myeloma will have a significant opportunities for expansion of market share. We have never being able to commercialize the full value of REVLIMID from induction all the way through continuous treatment or maintenance at all in the history of the brand. So a newly diagnosed approval particularly on the strength of MM-20 offers that induction continuous treatment paradigm from a commercial clinical perspective and we do think 10 to 15 points in market share are possible. That\u2019s not the only reason to believe that. There are so many trials in development across the landscape of novel agents using REVLIMID dexamethasone as the backbone that we really think that newly diagnosed myeloma over the next five years will be transformed where subset of patients get triplets and\/or doublets and all of that will be built on the web Rev\/Dex platform. So induction followed by continuous treatment either in young or old population.","So we remain extremely, extremely optimistic about what we can do on the demand side and on the continuous treatment side. So Jeff I hope that answer the question? And then on the priming side as you\u2019re seeing the timing of the question couldn\u2019t be appropriate. I will leave today to go to an Advisory Board Meeting with some Top KOLs in the U.S. on some recent evidence that have introduced in ovarian cancer with that very phenomenon, epigenetic priming using azacitidine with or without platinum based chemotherapy and then the T-cell checkpoint inhibitors.","So it's relatively new transitional data but we think it may build to additional work in lung cancer or ovarian cancer and some other solid tumors. If I had the forecast I think we would be looking for abstracts and presentations where we will put this in more of a Phase II category probably ASCO 2015 timeframe. We need about probably 8 months to another 16 months or so and then new data will start to mature and be available at major medical meetings. Remember those CC-486 is continuing to be developed in AML and MDS so while we\u2019re developing as an extension in our blood cancer franchise we will continue to double down and triple down on the solid tumor side and see where we go.","The other things they are early pipelines, Bob mentioned on targeted therapeutic antibodies. We will talk a lot about CD47 but we\u2019re excited about different antibodies and developments and different approaches that in the market different investigators are working on as other opportunities with priming, with new antibodies, not just the straight out PD-, PD-L1 approach. So I think it's dynamic circumstance, we\u2019re looking forward to the next really 12 months to 18 months to prove if we can that we can go on to pivotal randomized Phase III trials with epigenetic priming. So thanks for the question.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Yaron Werber with Citi. Your line is open.","","Yaron Werber \u2013 Citi","So I think Mark I don\u2019t know if it's kind of adjusted or is it you, it's relating to the active (indiscernible) you\u2019re assessing with sotatercept and ACE-536 and so I sort of have two question. One help me understand how do you look to differentiate the two drugs? Sotatercept is kind of a broader acting and active in ACE-536 (indiscernible). So what do you think that means clinically? And then two you are also looking at CKD which is obviously a very different price point than MDS and thalassemia. So is there an opportunity to differentiate there and sort of how serious are you guys about CKD? Thank you.","","Mark Alles","I think couple of us will chime in on this one, this is a high, high potential program right in areas that really there are not a lot of things that can provide the kind of value in this area of unmet need. And I think you highlight a number of the very, very important considerations and the decisions that need to get made over the coming months as we get more data, more mature data to really understand the full profile of the different compounds and they are different, there are clearly number of similarities, but the side effect profile to the prep difference activity levels in different indications, but we are certainly very much encouraged on the potential. And you highlight when you look at \u03b2-thalassemia chronic kidney disease, very, very differentiated markets. And I think the fact that there appear to be multiple compounds with differentiated activity, different side effect profiles, the ability to position the right profile for the right marketplace and therefore capture the maximum value, that opportunity is there for us. I think we need a little bit more data, little bit more time to be very clear about it.","And on the chronic kidney disease, it\u2019s a huge, huge opportunity if we can demonstrate both and then the impact on hemoglobin and also on bone. And obviously so 11 was originally designed as the bone age and that demonstrated a very positive hematological activity also that we have to see if the actual therapeutic window index gives the opportunity to do both with the right dose that provides the right risk benefit reward. So if it does hit that bull\u2019s eye, it is going to be a big, big winner, but I think we have to wait for more data to be clear and a little bit more data on the profile and then we have got to do the analysis that your question implies there is a lot of factors that to be considered, so we would make \u2013 map out the right long-term strategy to maximize patient benefit and then the value of the whole franchise.","","Mark Alles","The only thing I would add, Bob is exactly right. I think it was a great description of where we are is that we have the opportunity to look at these two agents. We have differentiated data from erythropoietin. That\u2019s the first part of \u03b2-thalassemia. EPO clearly does not work well or at all in \u03b2-thal, so that the gate towards some differentiation right away. The second thing is we are looking at treatment for the acute setting for disease and then support of care. And again, these are decisions that we would make on the base of data \u2013 basis of data and the Phase 3 programs that we would eventually initiate.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Schmidt with Cowen. Your line is open.","","Eric Schmidt - Cowen","Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of nits, maybe the first for Mark, we are used to saying some seasonality in Q1 with sales actually being down on a quarter-on-quarter basis, would you expect to see that or would the MMO-20 presentation and others at ASH perhaps cloud what we might be seeing otherwise? And second just your views on pricing in Europe, I was kind of surprised in the press to see that overall for the franchise, you have about 2% price benefit in 2013, is Europe becoming less of a headwind?","","Jackie Fouse","Hi, Eric, this is Jackie. Let me just jump real quickly on the pricing issue. So I think as you know we typically take cost increases in the U.S. that net 2% is a global number. So we did continue to see price declines in other markets around the world, probably most notably in Europe. However, what I would say is in 2013 on average, those came out a little bit less than what we had planned for in terms of the magnitude of the decline and maybe a little bit less than what we had seen in the year or two prior. So but some of those countries can have choppy patterns in terms of their pricing actions, but we felt pretty good about what we saw in 2013 as you just observed.","","Mark Alles","Yes. And the dynamic for country-by-country reimbursement is interesting, because we model a pretty steady decline in terms of price and price volume. The different things that happened that have changed that equation a little bit over time. One example is that AMNOG has come out again Germany, where we have been modeling a more steep decline, or a deeper rebate system of double-digits. And what happened in the last couple of weeks, months is that the outlook has changed where that rebate looks to be more in the mid-single-digits versus double-digits. So things can change to be slightly more positive, but overall, we are pleased \u2013 and what we understand is happening with price volume across Europe. And of course the POMALYST negotiations are reengaging Celgene across the value proposition in every major market. With respect to Q1, you\u2019re right to say that the historical trends is that Q1 over Q4 sequentially s challenged by not so much seasonality but more we call that in the U.S. there is that donut hole exposure that early year exposure for patients who convert year-on-year to the benefits program and then also that has a full grown [ph] gross to net so we typically have to deal with that gross, the net challenge and potentially some seasonality but early in Q1 and so far we\u2019re encouraged with the start of the year. It's not very different than what we expected.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Rachel McMinn with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","","Rachel McMinn - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I was hoping if you can provide a little bit more color on ABRAXANE in 2013. Is breast cancer growing at all? Should we think about that kind of a basic 400 in 25ish million and I was wondering if you can give us a sense of how pancreatic actually occurred in 2013 so you can think about growth for \u201814 and then Jackie on capital allocation you know couple of years ago you\u2019ve said we don\u2019t need to have more than $2 billion cash for our working capital needs. You obviously have well more than that now. Are there big deals on the horizon or how do we think about the outlook over the next year or two as your free cash flow generation goes up and your cash balances is high, is it? Thanks.","","Jackie Fouse","So I think as the company grows you do like to have some growth in your, the absolute value of your financial flexibility to deal with all of the things you may want to do on the R&D side and lots of things but I mean what we have seen is really nice business model kicking in with the strong stable cash flow generation and we\u2019re trying to pursue a dynamic strategy in terms of how we manage the capital structure and sustained long term share repurchase program so you saw that in 2013 with regard to just $3 billion of share repurchases and we will continue to do those. From a business development standpoint we\u2019re always going to say that we want to pursue the things that we feel are key to the our ongoing strategy. I don\u2019t think that much has changed in that regards though the simple fact that we have got a little bit more cash in our balance sheet, right now doesn\u2019t influence how we think about the strategy there.","We like very much the things that we have done with our collaboration of partner arrangements overtime and we will continue to look at things like that and I think we can say that we don\u2019t see any huge M&A activity on the horizon for now and we are going to keep doing what we have done so well.","","Mark Alles","Rachel thanks for talking about ABRAXANE again, quickly, of course remember that the European Commission approved pancreatic cancer for vaccine right at the end of 2013. So we\u2019re in full launch mode if you will in Europe for that indication. The growth for ABRAXANE in 2014 will be driven first by adoption in the U.S. and Europe in metastatic pancreatic cancer. That\u2019s a large portion of the growth. In the U.S. lung cancer continues to contribute very nicely to growth but that will be second in 2014 to pancreatic cancer and as you said breast cancer, I will describe that business is very stable but we continue to be excited and enthusiastic about the triple negative opportunity where our registration program is ongoing and thought leaders around the world are quite interested in ABRAXANE agent kind of being in that setting and then other novel agents part [ph] inhibitors et cetera that may come into clinical trials with us. So I think you can think about the breadth of the business as very stable and potentially growing on new programs but pancreatic cancer followed by lung cancer are the clear drivers in \u201914 and beyond.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets","Question on two pipeline products, you had some data in Btk inhibitor at ASH looks active now. I just wanted to understand your interpretation of the CLL market now and where you think you\u2019re and how you think you can differentiate there and the second question was on MOR202, I know we are starting Phase 1, do you think we are going to need data at ASH this year, what you think about for that this year?","","Mark Alles","Thanks for the question. What a great time for patients who have CLL, all of the emerging small molecules and biologics that have changed the landscape really for newly diagnosed patients is remarkable. So we are very happy for the marketplace and for patients. With respect to CC-292, you are right we see a profile emerging, where the activity profile, the safety profile is becoming very competitive. The segmentation is something we are evaluating all the time. The thing to remember in CLL was an indolent disease. None of these treatments are cheering the disease. So we see prevalent pools of patients growing who have resistance to Btk inhibitors in the market, other therapeutic approaches. And we think this is creating new segmentation, new opportunity for us to come in and create a standard-of-care status in one or more homogenous groups of previously treated patients. I think the newly diagnosed setting for CLL is where we expect REVLIMID to play quite frankly in the maintenance setting. We have an ongoing study, CLL-002, which is testing REVLIMID maintenance after responses are achieved in CLL. And the like multiple myeloma we think have the differentiated approach, whether or not the combination of our Btk inhibitor with REVLIMID or with the biologic would be further differentiated remains to be seen on the back of data.","With respect to MOR202 we do expect a constant flow of data coming probably late this year throughout 2015, because we are going to rapidly combine our CD38 inhibitor with pomalidomide in relapsed setting and with REVLIMID in second and first line myeloma. So we would expect that to accelerate over a 12 to 18-month window leading to an approval. The other disease category for MOR202 that we are interested in is AML.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Ian Somaiya with Nomura Securities. Your line is open.","","Ian Somaiya - Nomura Securities","Thanks for taking my question. I had a question on two of your pipeline drugs, CC-122 and ACY-1215 I was just hoping to get your thoughts on how these two drugs fit within your myeloma portfolio and maybe if you can speak to their potential role outside of myeloma into the other hematological malignancies?","","Bob Hugin","Well, thanks for the question. First, CC-122, as demonstrated good response data in cohorts of patients with lymphoma, leukemia and we are in expanding cohorts to look at it in myeloma. So I think it\u2019s early to decide, declare, which type of patient or subset of myeloma NHL\/CLL we would go to. But as I said in my prepared remarks, this is a year we are defining that pathway from a therapeutic value proposition and a registration point of view is quite important. ACY-1215 is an HDAC6 inhibitor and we like this opportunity a lot, because we think epigenetics in multiple myeloma is an underappreciated way of extending the benefit of treatments like REVLIMID, we think like pomalidomide, but even in combination with proteasome inhibitors like bortezomib. So multiple, Phase 1, 2 studies are ongoing in combination with the branded drugs for myeloma. So we would expect news flow on ACY-1215 in myeloma over the next year, year-and-a-half. And once again, our effort this year is to define a registration path for the combination of ACY-1215 with one or more of a myeloma asset.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Ravi Mehrotra with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","","Ravi Mehrotra - Credit Suisse","Thank you for taking my question, which is an extension of Rachel\u2019s question on capital redistributions, I mean Jackie you have obviously returned more than your operating cash flow this year, going forward, how should we think about your return as a proportion of cash flow, can we at least presume it\u2019s going to be the majority and just in your views on dividend versus share buyback? Thank you.","","Jackie Fouse","Yes. So I mean in terms of the share buyback program, we have got this is a pillar of our capital deployment strategy. It\u2019s something we will be part of the strategy year-after-year on an ongoing basis, that\u2019s what you have seen from us for the past three years and you will continue to see that. So the question of dividends probably will continue to be on our list as I think we have said often, we would like to have a more diversified revenue stream and actually have seen those the new products ramping up as we think about the dividend issue. So probably not for this year or so for sure but we will come back to that overtime and as we continue to foresee a very strong growth profile that the company has. So I think that\u2019s the short answer to the question, we look at what we think the cash flow is going to the net cash from operations is going to be in any given year and we kind of flex these different tools along the way as we see that as well as the other opportunities that we have got to invest in our own research and development topline as well as support our collaboration agreements and the other things that we think are appropriate to do in terms of long term investment for the business.","I think we have got time, we do have a fairly long list of people in the queue so we\u2019re going to try to take maybe 3 or 4 more questions and if we don\u2019t get to everybody we apologize for that. We will follow-up with those of you who we don\u2019t get to afterwards. So next question please?","","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","","Brian Abrahams - Wells Fargo Securities","You have talked a little bit more lately on the potential for POMALYST in Crohn's and ulcerative colitis. I was wondering if you can maybe talk a little bit more about the preclinical data supporting moving forward there, what the developments has to look like and where you see it fitting into the paradigm and then secondly how should we think about the regulatory pass forward for ABRAXANE in myeloma given the data today. Thanks.","","Mark Alles","On the POMALYST obviously I think it's been developed in our own lab, discovered and developed in our own laboratory. We have worked for a long time to fully understand the mechanistic and some tremendous amount of work pre-clinically to think where the areas that it's activity would be most beneficial and so we have chosen the three indications that I mentioned out of that work, but extensive work and it is our goal to have all three underway this year so that over the next year or two we will have some data to make that decision thus the actual activity in humans actually reflect what we see the potential in the clinic, in the pre-clinical work. So it's very close those of what we see today is the three best, we also still continue our work in rheumatoid arthritis to see if both that there are monotherapy opportunities. We have studies underway that we will see data later this year to understand is there something there but these are the ones we\u2019re going for ankylosing spondylitis.","","Bob Hugin","The other clinical relevance of the (indiscernible) data is such that when one sees the magnificent ulcers in the oral cavity et cetera one can make a clinical judgment which is well we believe we have support for an ulcerative colitis approach because the data are constructed [ph] under a resolution of those oral ulcers so that I give it some sense that the preclinical has translated to the clinical.","On melanoma, thanks for the question. Recall that the primary endpoint for the CA-33 study was progression free survival so we were encouraged that the study met the primary endpoint as statistically significant results. The interim results showed a trend for overall survival. We have completed the analysis and now that trend did not translate into a final overall survival analysis. At this time we have decided not to pursue a regulatory strategy but we continue with multiple clinical trials of high interest, one that I think is very novel is investigators who are combing ABRAXANE with Avastin as a combination approach and in fact it was a randomized Phase II study ongoing with Elotuzumab as the control. So we\u2019re learning, we have learned and we\u2019re going to continue to look at melanoma as an opportunity but in our model and in our overall plans for ABRAXANE we\u2019re currently deemphasizing that indication.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Howard Liang with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.","","Howard Liang - Leerink Partners","Given the potential excitement over Oral CC-486, can you talk about the IP protection on this compound?","","Mark Alles","Yes, this has been in development internally here for a considerable period of time. And so we can give you that the actual patents that have been produced there, but it\u2019s we are certainly expecting longer than 10 to 12 years after launch to have protection.","","Operator","Our final question comes from Matt Roden with UBS. Your line is open.","","Matt Roden - UBS","Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question as well. I am going to ask about another one of these near-term events and that\u2019s the VIDAZA Phase 2 readout in AML, first, just to clarify if the top line data will include overall survival or whether or not that will mature later? Secondly, AML has been the top segment taking into account azacitidine results, can you talk about why you think that this trial may work or may not work? And then related to you, could this read out have any impact on the oral 486 development strategy? Thanks.","","Bob Hugin","Yes. So thanks very much. On the AML-001 study, first recall that the Europe and in other markets around the world, VIDAZA is proof of subset of AML, which is the smaller portion of the AML population. This study would extend the benefit of VIDAZA with a primary endpoint and other endpoints including overall survival, progression free survival etcetera to patients across the board with AML. So we see this as a very important market expansion opportunity for the brand. The second part of your question though, I didn\u2019t hear all of it, so I want to just clarify, can you repeat the second part of your question?","","Operator","Matt, your line is open.","","Matt Roden - UBS","Can you hear me?","","Bob Hugin","Yes, we hear you. Go ahead.","","Matt Roden - UBS","Okay. So the first part was can you clarify whether or not the overall survival be included in the top line results this half? Secondly I asked why you think this is going to work considering some other data like, for example, from azacitidine, it\u2019s just a tough segment? And then third whether or not this could have any impact on the 486 development strategy in AML?","","Bob Hugin","Yes. So I appreciate the reference to azacitidine. We think VIDAZA is a very different drug. This has been a well-studied discussion. Clearly, the study design may or may not have an impact, because of the heterogeneity of these patients with acute myeloleukemia, but we feel very good about the control that we exerted on the population and on the concept of the study and the product already has demonstrated as I said before good benefit and a subset of AML. We are looking for this study to repeat it in the broad population with AML. With respect to CC-486, the read-through, we have to consider it as positive, because our development of oral azacitidine in AML is maintenance following induction treatment. So it\u2019s a very different setting and it could be very complementary. One could see an induction or acute treatment with over time the generic form of azacitidine followed by the very, very appropriate oral use of azacitidine to maintain that benefit. And of course low risk in MDS, oral azacitidine as we develop again in a very different population, then VIDAZA at in its current form. I think we feel very good about the segmentation, the clinical program and the potential for success.","","Jackie Fouse","And just to follow-up on Howard\u2019s question on the patent goes out to 2029. And with that, I think thank you everybody for your interest in us and joining us on the call today. I think we are out of time, so we are going to wrap up here and we will see you soon.","","Bob Hugin","Thank you.","","Operator","Thank you.

(Operator Instructions) Later we will conduct a questions-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to your host, Mr. Patrick Flanigan, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Patrick Flanigan","Thanks, Sahid, and welcome, everyone, to Celgene Corporation\u2019s Fourth Quarter and Year End Conference Call. The press release reporting our financial results in addition to the presentation for today\u2019s webcast can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the corporate website at www.celgene.com.","Joining me in the room today with prepared remarks are Bob Hugin, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jackie Fouse, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Alles, who is Global Head of our Hematology and Oncology business.","As a reminder, during today\u2019s call we will be making forward-looking statements regarding our financial outlook in addition to regulatory and product development plans. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those forecasted. A description of these risks can be found in our most recent 10-Q on file with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today\u2019s date and we undertake no duty to update or revise them. Finally, reconciliation of the adjusted financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure is available as part of the earnings release.","I would now like to turn the call over to Bob.","Bob Hugin","Thank you, Patrick, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. I appreciate the opportunity to review the results of 2012 and our outlook for 2013. 2012 was the year of exceptional accomplishments. We achieved remarkable results on multiple significant milestones across our portfolio. We\u2019re generating strong operating momentum and with the opportunities created by these results, Celgene today is stronger than ever. Three new blockbuster potential products across three therapeutic franchises position us to significantly accelerate growth over the next five years.","The financial results for 2012 were outstanding. Revenues for the year were strong. Earnings per share exceeded guidance and operating margins improved significantly. And we actively managed our capital structure to enhance shareholder returns.","These results underscore the strength and leverage of our business model. Our commercial teams, across the globe, are maximizing the potential of our products in existing indications and are growing the business in new indications and markets.","Our Research, Clinical and Regulatory teams made tremendous progress advancing our products and pipeline. We completed key regulatory submissions including POMALYST, for relapsed\/refractory myeloma, in both the United States and Europe and for REVLIMID in the United States for mantle cell lymphoma.","We realized positive data on a number of late stage clinical trials during 2012 and these data position us for both new product opportunities and new indications for existing products. These data are highlighted by the positive results for ABRAXANE in Phase III trials in both melanoma and pancreatic cancer. We now have positive data from five pivotal studies of apremilast in psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis.","Our early to mid stage pipeline also made significant progress. With oral azacitidine entering two Phase III trials, four INDs filed, seven programs progressing in Phase I and several new important collaborations established.","In 2013, we\u2019re focused on capitalizing on the opportunities produced by the significant results of 2012. On creating new opportunities and accelerating our business. Four strategic imperatives guide us as we advance through this next phase of growth. We\u2019re committed to maximizing the full potential of our Hematology franchise. REVLIMID continues to be an important growth driver. We\u2019re preparing for launches of relapsed\/refractory myeloma in China and mantle cell lymphoma in the United States. Broadening access to patients around the world with newly diagnosed myeloma is an important 2013 priority. Our extensive Phase III program also provides opportunities to extent REVLIMID\u2019s potential into lymphomas and CLL.","The launch of POMALYST, this year, provides us with the opportunity to extend our global leadership in myeloma. The Phase III data presented at ASH demonstrating a significant survival advantage in a highly pre-treated population, illustrates the complementary nature of REVLIMID and POMALYST.","Our other high potential Hematology programs are advancing. We expect to see Phase III data of VIDAZA and AML later this year and are accelerating accrual in important trials of oral azacitidine, our Btk inhibitor, CC-292, ACE-011 and ACE-536.","In our Oncology franchise, we now have the opportunity to expand ABRAXANE into new indications, submitting our pancreatic cancer regulatory filings as soon as possible, around the world, is a major corporate priority. We also intended to finalize our clinical and regulatory plans for ABRAXANE in melanoma when we review the mature survival data from our Phase III trial in the middle of this year.","2013 is the year of a critical importance for apremilast as we transition from clinical development to commercialization. Let me review our 2013 plans for apremilast. We\u2019re on track to submit our psoriatic arthritis application to the FDA this quarter and expect to submit in Canada shortly thereafter. In the second half of this year, we plan to file a combined submission in the E.U. for psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis and we also plan to file supplemental applications in the United States and Canada for psoriasis.","We\u2019re preparing for a commercial launch of apremilast starting with the United States and Canada in 2014. We expect accrual of our pivotal Phase III ankylosing spondylitis trial to complete by year-end and are expanding studies of apremilast in other indications.","A tremendous market opportunity exists for an active, well-tolerated oral medication in serious inflammatory diseases. The potential impact of this franchise on Celgene\u2019s future growth is extraordinary.","We\u2019ll continue to invest in the future by advancing our early to mid stage pipeline to key decision points. There\u2019s a tangible feeling of acceleration in our research and early development programs. And we will continue to focus in the areas where we have competitive advantage such as our IMiD platform, Epigenetics, selective kinase pathways and protein psyonsing.","We\u2019ll also continue to partner with the finest emerging companies in the world so we can make an increasingly meaningful difference for patients with innovative therapies. We\u2019re also looking forward to important milestones across our portfolio in 2013 that will capitalize on what we achieved in 2012 and also provide new growth opportunities for the future.","Let me now turn the call over to Jackie to review our financial results.","Jackie Fouse","Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. As a reminder my comments cover our adjusted financial results. The reconciliation of these results to our GAAP results can be found attached to our slide deck and press release.","The Celgene business model continues to deliver strong financial results in 2012 added to our impressive track record. Total revenues for the year grew 14% and product revenues an even stronger 15%. Driven by volume growth profits in both the operating and net levels grew faster than revenues as we leveraged our model and fully diluted earnings per share grew 30% twice as fast as revenue growth. Our performance is fueled by our core operations and we are adding additional value with financial drivers mainly share repurchases for now.","Our team is delivering across all of our key metrics and we are producing outstanding performance in the present while investing appropriately for the long-term. In the fourth quarter, product revenues rose just over 14% on a year-over-year basis and as I already noted full-year 2012 product revenues grew just over 15%. This is very good performance on a base of business that reached about $5.4 billion in 2012.","Our growth continues to be volume driven and in the quarter, 11 percentage points of our 14 percentage points of growth came from volume. Price added about 3 points of growth and the impact of foreign exchange was negligible. This picture is essentially the same for the full-year of 2012 with volume contributing 12 points of our 15 percentage points of growth, price 3 points, and foreign exchange neutral.","Fully diluted earnings per share grew 26% for the quarter on a year-over-year comparison basis to $1.32 and 30% for the full-year to $4.91. This earnings growth was primarily operations driven as we expanded our operating margin by 300 basis points. For the quarter, $0.23 or 85% of our $0.27 earnings per share improvement came from operating income growth. The combined financial drivers added the remaining $0.04.","For the full-year, operating income growth contributed $0.85 of our $1.12 EPS improvements or 76%. The combined financial drivers added $0.27 primarily due to the cumulative impact of our share repurchase program on share count.","Turning to individual product sales, REVLIMID growth was robust in the U.S. and across international markets with year-over-year growth for Q4 of 18% and 16% respectively. We reached our first over $1 billion revenue quarter for REVLIMID in the fourth quarter and finished the year strong to produce 17% annual growth with equal contributions from the U.S. and international. Sequential growth for Q4 over Q3 was a very solid 3.3% and we are quite happy with REVLIMID\u2019s 2012 performance, which was again volume driven and the result of positive duration of treatment trends, year-over-year share gains and further geographic penetration.","VIDAZA posted another great quarter, up 14% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis and finished up 17% for the full year, with international growing and exceptionally strong 24% as a result of volume fueled by share gains.","ABRAXANE ended the year with strong momentum on the heels of the approval for non-small cell lung cancer and the positive results on both the pancreatic and melanoma trials. The product grew 11% for the full-year 2012 over 2011 with over 40% growth outside the U.S. Q4 U.S. growth was impacted by a difficult comparison to Q4 of 2011 as the generic paclitaxel shortage experienced a year ago was rectified by Q4 of this year. We\u2019re very optimistic about the future growth projectory for ABRAXANE given the highly positive clinical data we have seen recently and our expectations for future approvals of new indications for the product.","This slide shows the pattern of quarterly REVLIMID revenues that we have seen for the past four years. As we move into Q1 of 2013, I simply want to remind you that because the impact of certain items, like the Medicare coverage gap in the U.S., is more negative in Q1 than any other quarter, we can see the lowest essential growth of any quarter in the year in Q1. We feel very good about the momentum we saw in the REVLIMID business globally as we exited 2012 and that is reflected in our 2013 full year REVLIMID revenue guidance.","Our P&L continues to deliver higher operating margins. For both the quarter and full year, we saw improvements in product, gross margins and those stood at just under 95% for both time periods.","Q4 R&D expense as a percentage of revenues was down significantly versus last year\u2019s Q4, as a result of milestone payments incurred last year. For the full year, R&D as a percentage of revenues declined 200 basis points. In any given year, how much leverage we see in this line item will depend on our evolving portfolio of clinical trials and their timing.","SG&A expenses were higher as a percentage of revenues in Q4 of this year versus last year due to the timing of sales and marketing spend associated with the launches of ABRAXANE and non-small cell lung cancer and the preparation for the POMALYST launch. For the full year, SG&A came in at 22.8% of revenues, the same percentage as 2011 as we invested in 2012 for our future commercial success.","A very attractive feature of our business model is our ability to deliver operating margin leverage through a variety of drivers and take the opportunity to invest, as appropriate, for the long-term while delivering higher margins in the short-term. In 2012, we improved our operating margin by 300 basis points and we expect to continue our positive leverage for many years. I will cover this in our outlook in just a moment. We also produced a 16.4% effective tax rate for the full year, slightly better than expected.","This graph summarizes our P&L leverage story of the past five years and demonstrates our ability to deliver on our margin targets. The core fundamental drivers of our business for the next five years are supportive of continuing these trends.","We focused on our balance sheet, returns and uses of capital, along with our P&L and you can see that leading to improved returns on invested capital. The figures in this slide are calculated based on GAAP income numbers and the invested capital base includes cash on our balance sheet. So these are conservatively stated returns.","Our cash from operations generations continues to be strong, with over $2 billion produced in 2012 and that is net of some payments related to collaboration agreements. In order to optimize our returns over time, we are trying to strike the right balance between investing in our business and returning funds to shareholders. Our preferred way of returning excess cash has been share repurchases and we bought back $2.1 billion of our own stock during 2012 after having done $2.2 billion in 2011. We entered 2013 with approximately $1.8 billion of repurchased authorization open for use.","I would like to wrap up my part of the discussion this morning with an affirmation of the 2013 guidance we gave you on January 7 and our outlook to 2015 and 2017, as well as provide you with a few more details behind that guidance.","We have a 2013 target of $6 billion for net product sales, year-over-year growth of about 11%, including a negative FX impact of about two percentage points that mostly impacts REVLIMID. In our $6 billion revenue target, we plan to be able to absorb up to two quarters of impact of a generic VIDAZA in the U.S. should it occur. We expect REVLIMID sales in $4.1 billion to $4.2 billion range, growth at the midpoint of about 10%.","Even with investing in our Inflammation and Immunology business unit during 2013, we still expect to produce earnings growth faster than revenue growth and see earnings per share in a range of $5.50 to $5.60 and growth of about 13%. This earnings guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of $430 million. With cost of goods, research and development and SG&A as a percentage of revenues targeted at 5%, 24% and 22% respectively, we have multiple points of leverage in our P&L and expect to deliver an operating margin improvement of at least 100 basis points in 2013. We expect our effective tax rate to be relatively flat at 16.5%.","The REVLIMID growth of about 10% comes from an expected 11% to 14% global volume growth slightly offset by 2% to 3% of negative currency impact for the year-over-year comparison 2013 over 2012. With 2013 as the anchor year for our long-term outlook to 2017, we expect to produce a 13% constant annual growth rate from our existing franchises in Hematology and ABRAXANE breast and lung. The hematology growth assumes approvals for REVLIMID and new indications including newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and a gradual ramp-up of those sales. It also assumes approval for of POMALYST in the U.S. by February 10th and in Europe in the second half of this year and myelofibrosis in 2015. We have not included revenues for any of oral azacitidine, CC-292 or VIDAZA for AML.","ABRAXANE breast and lung are expected to continue their growth as we further penetrate markets in those indications. For VIDAZA we assume generic competition in the U.S. no later than January 1, 2014, so the 2014 to 2017 time period includes that full impact.","When we add ABRAXANE pancreatic to our portfolio, we expect our constant annual growth rate from 2013 to 2017 to increase to 15%. There is further upside to ABRAXANE for melanoma and other potential indications. Apremilast in psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis has been layered into the portfolio according to the timelines we have provided you and these add 4 more percentage points to our expected growth trajectory to reach a 19% constant annual growth rate to 2017. With an ever more diversified portfolio of revenues from both new products and new indications we are highly confident in our ability to deliver on these targets.","We expect these drivers should allow us to double our revenue base from $6 billion in 2013 to $12 billion in 2017 and on this slide you can see the expected contributions from hematology, oncology, and inflammation and immunology in the 2013, 2015 and 2017 periods. By 2017 we expect our hematology business to reach $8.3 billion to $8.8 billion, ABRAXANE $1.5 billion to $2 billion and inflammation and immunology, $1.5 billion to $2 billion. We expect REVLIMID to continue its strong growth trajectory globally while declining as a percentage of total Celgene product sales to about 50% by 2017, given the faster growth in other products, such as POMALYST, ABRAXANE and apremilast. Our outlook does not include any contribution from acquisitions.","Over the 2013 to 2017 time period we expect to invest as appropriate in our I&I business unit infrastructure mainly in commercialization capabilities and still deliver consistent improvements in operating margins. We believe we could see a 52% to 53% operating margin by 2015 and around a 55% margin by 2017.","As for the financial drivers in this base case model we are holding them constant with a tax rate at 16.5% and fully diluted shares at $430 million. All of this combined feel an attractive long-term earnings per share growth target of 25% on a constant annual growth basis faster than a 19% top line growth target.","To summarize we delivered excellent financial performance on all metrics during 2012 and we did so while investing in our business to prepare for the next phase of our long-term growth trajectory. We enter 2013 very well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable leverage from our P&L, consistently improving returns and an ever more diversified revenue base that we expect to deliver an industry leading 19% top line growth out to 2017 and 25% earnings growth. We\u2019re doing all of this while making tangible progress on the earlier stage projects in our R&D pipeline that hold upside potential for the future.","We look forward to sharing updates on those with you at our May Investor Analyst Day. I will now turn the call over to Mark who will cover more details of our commercial performance. Thank you.","Mark Alles","Thanks very much, Jackie. Good morning, everyone. Our hematology and oncology franchises entered 2012 with strong operating momentum with multiple opportunities for our products to achieve robust sales growth. And with the significant opportunity to deliver breakthrough clinical outcomes for patients whose lives are threatened by blood and solid tumor cancers. And we delivered. Total net product sales grew 15% year-on-year to $5.4 billion, sales of our flagship hematology brand REVLIMID increased 17% year-on-year, to $3.8 billion. The value propositions and the profiles of our cancer brands were improved by a steady stream of published an presented clinical research that helped to define new and better ways to treat patients.","Our global teams successfully delivered on our commitments and on our goals for 2012 and we are even more optimistic about the potential for 2013 and beyond. During the next few minutes, I\u2019d like to offer my perspective on the existing and emerging opportunities for our Hematology and Oncology brands, on the key drivers important to our 2013 outlook and on the current pancreatic cancer market, including a high level review of the statistically significant and clinically meaningful ABRAXANE plus Gemcitabine Phase III data. As we begin 2013, our Hematology and Oncology business unit is executing our fully integrated plans for REVLIMID, VIDAZA, ABRAXANE and POMALYST; plans we expect which will give Celgene three Hematology and Oncology brands generating $1 billion or more in annual sales within the next three to five years.","While we were pleased that REVLIMID achieved sales of over $1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012, important and meaningful opportunities for continuing strong growth should materialize. REVLIMID has a long growth runway, with multiple drivers. Throughout 2013 and 2014, we expect more mature results from the longer-term follow-up of the three existing Phase III studies of REVLIMID in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and MM-015, CALGB 104 and the IFM 0502 study and to have final progression-free survival and interim overall survival data from our large international Phase III study, MM-020. We continue to expect results from MM-020 to be available by early second quarter.","Collectively, the results from these four REVLIMID studies in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma will inform and dictate our global regulatory submission strategies. Exiting Q4 2012, REVLIMID\u2019s overall multiple myeloma market share in the United States was strong, at approximately 55%. In our core international markets, REVLIMID market share in second-line myeloma trended higher and is now above 50%. In 2013, we expect REVLIMID sales to continue to grow by gaining market share in relapsed\/refractory myeloma by improving duration of therapy and by launching the brand in new markets such as China.","In early December, we submitted the SMBA for mantle cell lymphoma, making this application the first of what we expect to be several REVLIMID lymphoma indications. The clinical profile for REVLIMID in the diffuse large B-cell Lymphoma, follicular lymphoma and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia was enhanced by data presented during last year\u2019s American Society of Hematology meeting and our clinical and regulatory commitment to these indications remains firm.","VIDAZA has the near-term potential to become one of our brands with annual sales greater than $1 billion. Year-on-year 2012 sales growth was 17% to just over $820 million. VIDAZA\u2019s use is used as a standard treatment for high risk MDS and a subset of Acute Myeloid Leukemia continues to grow. Duration of therapy is improving and our expansion into new markets continues. We look forward to the results of VIDAZA Phase III study, AML-001, late this year.","We expect to significantly extend our leadership position in multiple myeloma with the upcoming launch of POMALYST given the high unmet medical need in patients with relapsed\/refractory multiple myeloma and the significant survival advantage demonstrated by POMALYST in combination with low dose dexamethasone, we believe that POMALYST is positioned to become our next blockbuster in Hematology. We are on track for marketing approval in the United States by the PDUFA date of February 10 and in Europe, by CHMP during the second half of this year.","In the United States, our Commercial and Medical Affairs teams are ready to launch and to support the thousands of patients who have exhausted all existing myeloma therapies. Successfully launching POMALYST is a major corporate objective and we are ready. We also continue to expect the results of the POMALYST Phase III study in myelofibrosis during the first half of this year. With positive data, we would submit marketing applications in the United States and in Europe as soon as possible.","The fourth quarter of 2012 was remarkable for many reasons, but the Phase III data supporting ABRAXANE as a potential new therapy for the treatment of Meta Melanoma and pancreatic cancer was among the most promising. Q4 began with the FDA approval of ABRAXANE plus carboplatin for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, followed quickly by the highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful progression free survival data from the ABRAXANE Phase III study in melanoma and most recently the significant improvement in overall survival demonstrated by the combination of ABRAXANE and Gemcitabine in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.","As you know, pancreatic cancer is a disease with a long history of failed drug development and virtually no improvements in median and one-year survival. Improving quality of life has been a secondary outcome to improving survival. But still, treatment outcomes have been consistently poor. Nearly all patients will die of their disease and most will die within one year.","The conclusion from this slide is clear. Oncologists in the United States and around the world have very few good choices to treat advanced pancreatic cancer. Gemcitabine is used alone or in various combinations to treat approximately 60% of newly diagnosed patients. The combination of four chemotherapies, Leucovorin; Fluorouracil; irinotecan; and Oxaliplatin, also known as FOLFIRINOX regimen; is used to treat approximately 25% of patients. A variety of other treatment strategies are used for the remaining patients. Currently, various sources estimate that approximately 24,000 patients are treated with first-line therapy in the United States. But due to the rapidly progressive course of this disease, less than half receives second-line therapy.","In our pivotal randomized Phase III study of weekly ABRAXANE plus Gemcitabine versus Gemcitabine alone, in patients with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer, 842 patients were randomized to be treated by weekly ABRAXANE followed immediately by Gemcitabine or Gemcitabine alone. The primary end point is overall survival. Key secondary end points included progression free survival and overall response rate. The combination of weekly ABRAXANE plus Gemcitabine met the primary end point by demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in median overall survival, 8.5 months versus 6.7 months. The hazard ratio equals 0.72 and the p-value is p equals 0.000015.","Importantly, ABRAXANE plus Gemcitabine increased the percentage of patients alive at one year by 59%, 35% versus 22%. The percentage of patients alive at two years doubled, 9% versus 4%. The combination of ABRAXANE plus Gemcitabine also demonstrated significantly improved progression free survival with a median PFS of 5.5 months versus 3.7 months for Gemcitabine alone.","The response rate tripled for the combination to 23% compared with a very predictable single-agent Gemcitabine response rate of 7%. Treatment with ABRAXANE plus Gemcitabine was associated with a slight increase in Grade 3 and 4 adverse events, including more neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, fatigue and neuropathy. We look forward to the oral presentation of the full results tomorrow afternoon during the ASCO GI symposium in San Francisco. Submitting regulatory applications in the United States and Europe during the first half of this year, and global submissions in key international markets.","My colleagues and I are completely focused on our mission to build an industry-leading Hematology and Oncology company. REVLIMID is one of the most successful cancer therapies ever developed and yet we see a long and significant growth runway in front of us. Our team is focused on the top priorities that matter most. Increasing share and duration, establishing REVLIMID as the global standard of care for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, opening up emerging markets and developing REVLIMID as an important monotherapy and combination agent in the treatment of lymphoma and leukemia.","Our existing multi-billion dollar multiple myeloma franchise will soon expand with the approval and launch of POMALYST. Together with REVLIMID, this novel therapy may help make it possible for hematologists and their patients to think of a future when this incurable cancer becomes a chronic disease.","Our scientific exploration and understanding of all categories of MDS and AML are the driving forces behind the full development of VIDAZA, CC-486 and REVLIMID as part of an integrated global MDS franchise strategy. The full potential of ABRAXANE is just starting to be appreciated. In addition to our global plans in lung cancer, pancreatic cancer and metastatic melanoma we are rapidly advancing the development of ABRAXANE plus Gemcitabine for the treatment of women with triple negative metastatic breast cancer. We expect the randomized Phase II study to begin during the second half of this year.","We are entering a period of expected new growth, driven by brands and outcomes that are the result of years of investment and risk taking. REVLIMID will be joined potentially by at least $3 billion plus brands. ABRAXANE, POMALYST and apremilast and we expect additional landmark therapies to come from our robust early drug development pipeline.","Thank you very much, and I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Bob.","Bob Hugin","Thank you, Mark, and thank you, Jackie. 2012 was an outstanding year for Celgene as we delivered excellent operating results and advanced our portfolio positioning us for accelerating growth. 2013 will be a year of many milestones across both our approved products and our earlier stage programs. Our teams are energized and focused on capitalizing on the significant achievements of 2012, and on creating the next generation of opportunities to make a meaningful difference in the lives of patients around the world.","Thank you for joining us this morning. We look forward to updating you throughout the year. Operator, let\u2019s now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Geoffrey Porges from Bernstein Research.","Geoff Porges \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Thank you very much for taking the question. Congratulations everybody on the terrific results for the year. Jackie, could I just ask a question about the margins again? You indicated that you expected about 100 basis points of operating margin improvement in your guidance for 2013. But I\u2019m just interested in, what will happen if for example you don\u2019t face the VIDAZA generic or you see other sources of upside on the revenue line, would you expect that that to be reflected in even more positive trend on the margin or do you think that there are incremental projects that you\u2019d invest in and you\u2019d stick with that 100 basis point improvement as a maximum sequentially? Thanks.","Jackie Fouse","Hi, Geoff. Thanks for the question. When we give this kind of guidance the way that we frame it is what we believe that the minimum is that we\u2019re able to deliver. Because we have so many different drivers in the model now, as the model has continued to evolve and grow, we\u2019ve got lots of opportunities there. So I would just reiterate that we\u2019ll deliver at least 100 basis points of improvement. And as you\u2019ve heard with everything that we\u2019ve got going on, there may be some opportunities to invest in projects that we don\u2019t have the radar screen on today, on the radar screen today but if we do that, it will be because we\u2019ve got some upside there. And we saw that we delivered upside in 2012 versus what our original operating margin target was.","Geoff Porges \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Terrific. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Marshall Urist from Morgan Stanley.","Marshall Urist \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Good morning. Thanks for the question. So just first, can you give us a sense of kind of sequential trends in international REVLIMID and kind of what you guys saw quarter-over-quarter? Obviously not a ton of growth in dollars so just kind of understanding the dynamic there with that hedges or something else going on. And then second, just on the 2017 guidance, can you give us your thoughts on the importance in how much incremental growth you guys see from MM-020 in a formal, frontline label for REVLIMID in Europe? And how much growth acceleration should we think that that\u2019s worth to the business over the next five years. Thanks.","Jackie Fouse","Thanks, Marshall. Let me start with the first part of your question. I\u2019ll probably hand it over to Mark for the MM-020 comments. Just the \u2013 what we saw in Q4 over Q3 as you heard I think was about 3.3% sequential growth in REVLIMID globally as we finished last year, which we felt was very solid performance on a product that\u2019s becoming extremely large.","As we go into the beginning of every year, what you regularly hear me talk about is the pattern that we see in the past for Q1 just because of some of the impacts that we have where they\u2019re more negative in the first part of the year most notably in the U.S., on things like the coverage gap issue and things like that. So we feel very good about the momentum that we have going into the first part of 2013. We\u2019re just mindful that that quarter sometimes can be the lightest of all the quarters of the year from a sequential growth standpoint. So let\u2019s see where we come in with that.","And to your question about 2017, I mean, I think we highlighted on the slides that the major assumptions behind how the franchises are expected to evolve over the next four years out to 2017. And we\u2019ve \u2013 you might assume that we\u2019ve layered in assumptions around timing and ramp-up in terms of how much share we take and how quickly we expand geographically. And that we might have been conservative on all of those things.","We have so many things going on that as the portfolio gets more and more diversified we\u2019re increasingly confident in our ability to deliver on those targets. We also do continue to assume things like pricing pressures in Europe and places like that. So that\u2019s all built into our model. And maybe on MM-020 I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark for some comments.","Mark Alles","Sure. Hi, Marshall. Thanks for the question. So the model as Jackie points out has label expansion globally to a newly diagnosed multiple myeloma coming in that window of 2014 through 2015 with reimbursement layered in. MM-20 is an important study as you well know and everyone knows because we\u2019re trying to establish REVLIMID dexamethasone not only as a standard of care in relapsed\/refractory myeloma but importantly in all stages including smoldering and the broader newly diagnosed category.","But it is an expansion opportunity on top of the post-transplant opportunity and the induction maintenance opportunity for elderly patients through MM-015. So the composite of these studies and overall myeloma strategy really will blend and provide growth through the five-year model and then we\u2019ll see how we accelerate late in the model and into the following five years. A positive outcome is important but it\u2019s certainly not the only driver of our performance in newly diagnosed myeloma or myeloma overall.","Marshall Urist \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks for taking my question and congrats as well on all the progress last year. Was just wondering, two questions really. As a follow-up to Marshall\u2019s question, I was wondering if you can comment about just the strategic importance of 020 more on the pricing dynamic side given the cost of MPT and then assuming Velcade goes generic in the 2017, 2019 timeframe? And then a question for Jackie just on the target-operating margin, the mid-50% range. Was just wondering if maybe you can rank order for us some of the drivers of getting to that level? Thanks a lot.","Bob Hugin","So thanks for the question. The value proposition for REVLIMID and myeloma is growing all the time. And, of course, the positive result of MM-20 not only provides some direct comparison on the value with respect to price, but much more importantly, it takes a toxic regimen led by the use of Melphalan Prednisone and it puts it into a category of an alternative use versus a standard use. So I think the most important outcome of MM-20 is not a price comparison but a huge difference in the value proposition overall for RevDex while MPT or Melphalan would still remain an important consideration for the treatment of myeloma.","Jackie Fouse","And with respect to the operating margin targets out to 2017, so we\u2019ve said that we think we can get in the mid-50s in 2017 and about 52% to 53% by 2015. If we go back and look at the history of where this has come from, where in a great place with respect to how the Celgene model has evolved from the standpoint both of diversified drivers within the P&L, the geographic expansion and the ever increasing size of the base of some of the fixed costs in the model and things like that. So if we look at 2012, what you saw was that we delivered 300 basis points of margin improvement with that coming from cost of goods and from R&D principally because we continue to invest in the SG&A infrastructure in preparation for everything that\u2019s to come on a go-forward basis.","In the guidance built into 2013 we should see the numbers there but we expect a continued modest contribution from cost of goods. We\u2019ve actually got R&D going up a touch as a percentage of revenues and SG&A down a bit.","So it\u2019s coming from multiple places and all of those have the potential to have some upside associated with them or the ability for us to deliver even if one line doesn\u2019t go exactly the way that we see it playing out today. So those different things and the reason why I continue to highlight the fundamentals associated with the model as this plays out over a long period of time, the natural evolution of this model should allow us to appropriately reinvest for the long-term health and growth of the business while having some natural leverage in particularly the research and development lines in the SG&A lines of the P&L.","And why is that? We have a very focused business model that from a commercial infrastructure standpoint is dealing with specialty physicians and you don\u2019t need thousands and thousands of people in your commercial infrastructure to sell these products. So we\u2019re in a very good place where I think that 100 to 150 basis points a year is pretty straightforward to do without a huge amount of effort. It\u2019s natural part of the model. And we can take the opportunity to invest along the way as upside potential comes along. So it\u2019s going be a combination of R&D over a period of time and SG&A mostly.","Terence Flynn \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Schmidt from Cowen & Company.","Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen & Company","Question first on the 2017 guidance with the $1.5 billion to $2 billion of apremilast sales included there. Should we now assume that you\u2019ve made the decision to go at it alone including in dermatology and also including around the world? And then second, on ABRAXANE for melanoma, what will be required do you think to file there? Do you need specifically an overall survival advantage?","Bob Hugin","Thanks, Eric. It\u2019s Bob regarding apremilast. We are moving forward internally with the view that we will commercialize globally ourselves. That\u2019s important as we build a franchise to have that focus in doing that. We are looking to ensure that we do maximize the strategic value of this franchise but as the clock ticks we really have about the next six months or so to make sure that we understand all the opportunities that are out there to both accelerate the development through assistance and partnerships whether it be targeted geographically or by support and other indications. But our base case internally is to go alone and that\u2019s where we\u2019re headed but we are \u2013 we still are examining other opportunities and I would imagine this summer is sort of the timeframe that would have to be clear if we\u2019re not going to go completely alone. But that is the base case that we\u2019re operating under.","Jackie Fouse","And that\u2019s the way the financial model has been built out to 2017 to include those costs.","Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen & Company","Okay. On ABRAXANE?","Bob Hugin","With respect to melanoma, thanks for the question. The base case we have is that we have a robust outcome of PFS. We do want to hold on for mature overall survival events with what we would expect would be a continuing very positive trend and maybe even a significant overall survival outcome. We should have that information by the middle of the year and that would really inform our global filing strategy. Certainly the U.S. is an opportunity but internationally we think mature survival data, whether or not it\u2019s significant is important for regulatory acceptance.","Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen & Company","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rachel McMinn from Bank of America.","Rachel McMinn \u2013 Bank of America","Yeah, thanks very much. Two questions. One specific, one a little bit bigger picture. Just the specific question on ABRAXANE. Why is the duration of therapy four months actually shorter than progression free survival? Is that physicians that\u2019s pulling patients off for toxicity or for whatever reason just stopping them before they\u2019re actually progressing? And then my second question is just thinking about the big picture, ex-U.S. REVLIMID sales, if you look at other major myeloma products, Velcade or look at VIDAZA for example, the majority of revenues are coming from outside the U.S. in those products but they\u2019re not for REVLIMID. Do you think you need to get front line label expansion in order for ex-U.S. revenues to eclipse the U.S.? Thanks.","Mark Alles","Hi, Rachel. It\u2019s Mark. Thanks for the question. First of all with respect to ABRAXANE duration of therapy, and looking at progression free survival versus overall survival. I think a lot of the explanations will become clear as part of the presentation tomorrow in the Q&A. So speculating today in the absence of a full presentation, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful. With respect to the overall composition of international versus U.S. sales, we certainly need market expansion internationally for REVLIMID into newly diagnosed multiple myeloma no matter what. But for REVLIMID to eventually become a bigger selling product internationally than the U.S., that indication is absolutely critical. There\u2019s no doubt.","The overall mix of things that are happening though is quite interesting. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s a forecast or prescription for drug therapy in the world that the U.S. would be larger or smaller than certain regions or other ways. It could be that with the pending inevitable changes in healthcare, reimbursement, the way the systems will work in the U.S., other things, it\u2019s hard to know in the future how the mix will come together. That said, I think our business is robust. I think we have opportunities for growth in many emerging markets. In the regions that we currently have our franchises built out and our portfolio is quite strong. So thanks for the question.","Mark Alles","Bob, this is Mark, I\u2019ll add a little onto it also. We do have our MDS 5q application pending in Europe and it\u2019s taken us longer in terms of the scrutiny there to get that approved. So that will also help ex-U.S. sales given the MDS approval. And as we look at other indications with REVLIMID in terms of lymphomas and CLL, we in fact may see bigger opportunities ex-U.S. for those indications. Some of those may even come sooner outside the United States than the U.S. So I certainly do think newly diagnosed is important and we\u2019re certainly committed because REVLIMID is such an ideal therapy for newly diagnosed patients and with these other Indications MDS, et cetera, over time we do believe that ex-U.S. sales will be significantly larger than U.S. sales over time with REVLIMID.","Rachel McMinn \u2013 Bank of America","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham from JP Morgan.","Geoff Meacham \u2013 JP Morgan","Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. I got a couple on 020. So the first one is, what do you think the market share opportunity is that you can take from cell\u2013based on the study? And the second part is how much of an opportunity do you guys view the smoldering market is and for myeloma? And then the last piece I guess from a regulatory perspective, will the 020 filing in the U.S. just include that study or you guys going to be including other studies that have RevMP like IFM, CALGB, CLGB for various safety or efficacy reasons?","Mark Alles","Hi, it\u2019s Mark. Thanks for the question. So with respect to the market share of thalidimide versus REVLIMID and what would happen with an MM-020 win, I think it\u2019s important to understand around the world the standards for newly diagnosed myeloma are slightly different. For example in the U.S., RevDex overall is a standard and thalidimide base regimens make up a very small percentage of the newly diagnosed myeloma market.","Wherein in other markets, for example the U.K., thalidimide is reimbursed as the only first line regimen followed by Velcade second line and then REVLIMID in the third line. So it really is a question of local market practices, reimbursement, access, et cetera. With that said, we would think that the way MM-020 would play out would not be just an MP cell question, but where Melphalan prednisone, thalidimide, where Melphalan prednisone and Velcade, any regimen that would include Melphalan prednisone we would assume once we had approval and reimbursement, significant share gains from those regimens.","You asked about smoldering myeloma and I think that\u2019s an important dynamic in newly diagnosed myeloma today. Smoldering myeloma is being redefined as a segment of newly diagnosed myeloma. The international myeloma working group continues to look at patients who are at high risk of relapse or progression with the classic smoldering condition and more and more, they\u2019re adding to the definition of a newly diagnosed myeloma.","So we think that that could add anywhere from 2% to 8% of patients eligible for treatment over time. So the opportunity is clear. We understand the composite and then with respect to the label in the U.S. or around the world, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we look to the composite of MM-015, IFM, CLGB and MM-020 to inform and to really dictate the strategy for submissions to the U.S., to regulatory agencies in Europe and then, of course, around the world. So we will know much, much more in the next few months about exactly what our strategies will look like and, of course, we\u2019ll inform everyone at that time. Thank you.","Geoff Meacham \u2013 JP Morgan","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from ISI Group.","Mark Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group","Hey, guys. Congratulations on a great January. Hey, Mark, this has come up here and there and I want to address a little more dead on if you don\u2019t mind. What do you think the consequences are, if any, if the MM-020 happened to actually fail as primary end point? And then on apremilast the 1.5 billion that\u2019s implied in your 2017 numbers, was I think probably the biggest variant from where your analysts sat on that, certainly including me. I was just wondering if you can help us, if you can help make the case I guess for that 1.5 billion to get us all a little bit more comfortable with. Thanks a lot.","Bob Hugin","So, Mark, you put people on dangerous ground when you talk about speculating on the downside for trials that we built with great strong assumptions of very, very important knowledge base about the disease a decade of drug development in the space. And so I have to start by telling you we are still very confident that MM-20 will produce the results the trial was designed to test.","Mark Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group","Okay.","Bob Hugin","That said, you\u2019re asking me to speculate. So what I will tell you is the downside risk as we\u2019ve described a couple of different places and even when we\u2019re together at JPMorgan I spoke to it is more a long-term dynamic with respect to how myeloma would be treated. For example, the question about stem cell transplantation would still the primary question for newly diagnosed patients.","In a scenario where RevDex is not superior to MPT, one could look at the newly diagnosed myeloma marketplace and say that the next opportunity for REVLIMID would be in combination with a prodisome inhibitor from some of the studies that are going on now. But these are more long-term, 2017 through 2018, 2019 implications. The short-term business for REVLIMID in a failed MM-20 environment are limited. We see good strong growth in relapsed\/refractory myeloma. We see novel agents coming into the market in combination with REVLIMID. And so in the end we think the five-year window is not that affected by MM-20 if the results wouldn\u2019t be positive but the longer-term outlook is a little bit more uncertain. Thanks.","Jackie Fouse","Let me start maybe on the apremilast question, Mark, and then we have Scott Smith in the room with us and so I\u2019ll pass it onto him for comment. But just to make sure we\u2019re clear about that $1.5 billion to $2 billion range, it includes psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis approvals according to the timelines that we\u2019ve laid out for you and we have made some assumptions around how we\u2019ll price the product, what kinds of shares that we take. I think we\u2019ve been very conservative in terms of what we\u2019ve assumed for ramp-up on this product given that it will be a new paradigm in the treatment options for these diseases. But we feel very strongly and I think that you are hearing this now from physicians. In the psoriatic arthritis indications you will hear it and you\u2019ll have a better view on things when you see the detailed psoriasis data.","But we believe strongly that a safe, effective, well-tolerated convenient oral therapy will have a distinct place to take in the market early on in the treatment paradigm for these indications. And we think it has a lot of advantages to offer to patients and the physicians will embrace it. And with that maybe let me let Scott make additional comment.","Bob Hugin","Yeah, I believe that there\u2019s a tremendous opportunity in the pre-biologic space for patients who have not moved onto biologic therapy. In recent TOPO data that\u2019s been released and others really showed there\u2019s tremendous utilization of these drugs early ahead of biologics and that\u2019s where there\u2019s a real significant unmet need for oral compound effective with a good profile. And so we believe that there\u2019s significant need. That coupled with five positive oral trials in a row, psoriasis and PsA, with strong consistent data across the board, we believe that the opportunity is tremendous for a product. Again, and the real soft spot in this market, the weak spot in the market is for that pre-biologic early utilization space.","Mark Alles","And, Scott, we expect to see the psoriasis data presented at medical meetings here in the first half of the year which I think will be important for the marketplace to understand the risk benefit opportunity here and the dynamic of what apremilast presents in terms of the safety profile, the activity, et cetera. So we\u2019re very much looking forward to that psoriasis data the first half of the year.","Mark Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Yee from RBC Capital.","Michael Yee \u2013 RBC Capital","Hey, a question on POMALYST since this could be launching soon. In your long-term guidance, what are the key drivers that you were thinking in your assumptions? As I think that was another area versus where consensus may be modeling. Maybe walk through that. And then just a really quick question for Mark. When you think about the SWOG 232 study that is out there with RevDex, how should we think about that in terms of handicapping how you designed 020? Thanks.","Bob Hugin","Thanks for the question. So your first question about POMALYST. We see a partial year launch effect this year and we expect significant ramp-up over the five-year model primarily in third and fourth line multiple myeloma. The survival data is well understood coming out of ASH. And in the U.S., we think access will be immediate and that we will do very well.","In Europe, we have a parallel launch approach. In fact in certain markets in Europe now we already have access programs, the ATU program in France and the main patient program that will roll out in different markets throughout the remainder of the year. So we have paralleled registration tracks ongoing. And access from 2013 through 2014 and into 2015 in the major developed markets in the world. Even Japan, the bridging study for POMALYST is ongoing.","The first indication for example in Japan will be myelofibrosis. So the other catalysts besides just myeloma for POMALYST is our high expectation that POMALYST will resolve transfusion dependent anemia for patients with very, very difficult disease course with myelofibrosis. So that\u2019s POMALYST. The SWOG 232 study is one of those other trials that informed our overall assumption base for MM-20.","That is when one looked at ECOG E4A03, SWOG 232, even the registration trials of RevDex, the MM-009, 010 studies that of course are the basis for REVLIMID\u2019s approval around the world. We modeled and assumed then a median progression free survival time for RevDex in the MM-20 study versus the MPT arm which was a modeled of course after this cone data, MPT versus MP. So I thank you for the question. It was one of the studies that we looked at and considered in designing MM-20.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Thomas Wei from Jefferies.","Thomas Wei \u2013 Jefferies","Thanks. I had a couple questions. Just to help on the $1.5 billion to $2 billion number for apremilast I guess I\u2019m curious as to what is your current estimate of what the sales of biologics are in psoriasis, in psoriatic arthritis and how fast is that growing? And it also sounds like based on your answer to Mark\u2019s question, you think that $1.5 billion to $2 billion is largely additive. And then I just wanted to ask about a comment that you made, Bob, on some of the European indications in lymphoma and CLL may come sooner in Europe than in the U.S. Can you be a little bit more specific there? Are there specific settings where the Europeans are accepting a shorter-term end point?","Bob Hugin","Well, no, I just think when we look at CLL and certain lymphomas, important studies are being done by leading European thought leaders, investigators there. So the opportunity to have a strong endorsement and understanding especially with CHMP process how decisions are made, it\u2019s important to have strong European endorsement to get a rapid review and understanding of it. So there isn\u2019t something unique to it. It\u2019s just the positioning of those trials and the opportunity that we see with those investigators to help us lead to effective and expeditious regulatory review of those indications.","Thomas Wei \u2013 Jefferies","And this is Scott. Thanks for the question. Total biologic sales approximately in the $22 billion to $23 billion range. The proportion of that which is psoriasis and PSA varies by product but it\u2019s very significant portion of that $22 billion to $23 billion. But I don\u2019t think biologic sales in and of themselves clearly identify the true market opportunity for apremilast. It\u2019s got a very different profile, different benefit risk. And a very significant number of patients particularly in the psoriasis and PSA areas are not treated by biologics and biologic therapies. So we believe the opportunity is greater than just competition for the biologic space.","Jackie Fouse","Operator, I think we have time for about three more questions, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Yaron Werber from Citi.","Yaron Werber \u2013 Citi","Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my question. So I\u2019ve got just a couple of questions, really, for Mark and Jackie. First of all, REVLIMID 2017. So it looks like your guidance at this point is not including contributions from CLL or NHL. They\u2019re talking about outside of mental cell. Is that correct? And then if so \u2013 yeah, go ahead. If so, why? And then I have a question on ABRAXANE.","Jackie Fouse","They are in there according to conservative assumptions on timelines and ramp-up and so on and so forth. So the contribution in 2017 from those other indications that you highlighted is quite modest in our model. And the way that we think about them is the long-term growth potential for those really comes beyond the 2017 timeframe.","Yaron Werber \u2013 Citi","So the CLL, when are you expecting data? You\u2019ll finish accrual, it sounds like, this year? Can we see data next year? When do you expect data from NHL?","Mark Alles","Yeah, so, Yaron, it\u2019s Mark. Just to try to answer that question as specifically as we can. So you know that we have two principal studies in CLL-008 and 002. One is 008 is the head-to-head versus (inaudible) and 02 of course is our maintenance trial of single agent REVLIMID. So we would look for data from 008 in the middle of 2014. That\u2019s our current expectation. For CLL-002, given that it is a maintenance trial, the data would come in the 2015 timeframe. So this speaks directly to Jackie\u2019s point about the model. And even if these results would be astoundingly positive, then we have regulatory approval, then we go through reimbursement. In CLL we would see the impact to the revenue contribution that would be relatively modest in our model. The lymphoma studies remark and then the follicular studies are ongoing. Again, the data could read out because this is, again, remark of the placebo control trial, sooner if the magnitude of benefit is great. But right now we\u2019re still in that 2015-ish timeframe with data expected. Hope that answers the question.","Yaron Werber \u2013 Citi","Okay. Great. And then ABRAXANE, for this year it looks like the guide is between 600 and 700. Give us a sense what\u2019s driving that? If you can, how much of that is lung versus pancreatic?","Bob Hugin","Yeah, so the majority in the model of the upside from where we are in 2013 is coming incrementally from what we expect will be the broad adoption of ABRAXANE in pancreatic cancer. That said, the early metrics in lung cancer, especially this physician-driven decision to treat history logic subsets. And you know the data was preferential to patients with (inaudible) non-small cell lung cancer. The early read in the launch phase has been quite positive with respect to making a treatment decision based on histology. So early lung cancer results are promising, but, as I know you know, the pancreatic market is really just so underserved, we model physician uptick pretty dramatically.","Jackie Fouse","And just to make sure we\u2019re clear on all of that, the \u2013 I mean, as we go into 2013, Q1 is going to be the first full quarter post the lung launch late last year. So I think we\u2019ll be able to give you more color on that when we have the Q1 call. As Mark said, we think we\u2019re off to a great start. And then whether we\u2019ve been conservative or not in our assumptions around pancreas, I don\u2019t know. But if you look at the timelines for regulatory submission, which we are working exponentially towards, and then when we might expect approval, the contribution from that, from an approval standpoint, would be later in the year. Then we would expect a much more rapid ramp in 2014 for the pancreas-specific sales. That being said, the data, obviously, is very positive for the moment on ABRAXANE.","Bob Hugin","Yeah, this is another scenario, just to close out the point on pancreatic cancer, where Celgene is working with global regulatory authorities to make sure that they understand the data, they have the full review opportunity, and, of course, in the marketplace, we will appropriately support physicians and patients. But this is not a commercially directed opportunity until after we have approvals.","Jackie Fouse","I think we have two more questions now, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Schimmer from Lazard Capital.","Josh Schimmer \u2013 Lazard Capital","Is there opportunity an opportunity to re-price ABRAXANE with new data in any of the territories? What percentage of long-term estimates are derived from U.S. versus ex-U.S.? And then separately on 292 when would you expect to advance that into inflammatory indications and is there any rationale to combine it with apremilast? Thanks.","Jackie Fouse","Let me jump there real quickly just on couple of things and then pass it over to Mark. Just to be clear with respect to our financial model out to 2017 we have not assumed anything different for ABRAXANE from a pricing standpoint versus the dynamic that we have today. So just be clear about that from a modeling standpoint.","And then Bob may want to jump in later on 292 but I would just highlight the fact that we are planning an Investor Analyst Day in the early part of May where we\u2019re going to go into a lot more detail on all of our earlier stage projects and platforms and talk not only about the progress that we\u2019ve made over the last 12 to 18 months with something people will be pleased with but also the development plans for some of these molecules. So with that, let me turn it over to Mark for some comments on the pricing aspect of ABRAXANE.","Mark Alles","The part of your question I wanted to start with the mix of U.S. versus international sales for ABRAXANE in the model for the five-year window we\u2019ve been discussing. U.S. sales of ABRAXANE are the majority of those sales. The pancreatic indication as it launches around the world would provide a nice opportunity but for the five-year model, U.S. remains the majority of sales. That goes directly to the question about price.","We will be opportunistic in markets where ABRAXANE today really doesn\u2019t have a presence or an opportunity in either breast cancer or non-small cell lung cancer. That said, it\u2019s difficult to imagine direct opportunity in those markets where currently the brand is reimbursed for the treatment of breast cancer. We will update the value dossier. We will seek pricing where we can provide for a better outcome compared to for example generic Taxane, et cetera. But that\u2019s going to be a market-to-market opportunity.","Josh Schimmer \u2013 Lazard Capital","Thank you.","Bob Hugin","Sorry. On 292, now that we have a defined dose in hematological malignancies we are rapidly accelerating combination studies with 292 there. For a plan as we look at inflammatory disease with 292 would be to begin as monotherapy examine as we see the data, understand the potential in those indications as to what the strategy would be but obviously initially would begin as a monotherapy.","Jackie Fouse","Operator, we have time for one more question, please. Thank you.","Operator","Our last question comes from Matt Roden from UBS.","Matthew Roden \u2013 UBS","Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to come back to apremilast and how you guys are positioning this for the launch. Is there anything that you guys can learn from the way payers are managing Zelgens which we understand that despite its label has been put behind one or two or in some cases three TNFs by some large payers. Realize that RA isn\u2019t the same as psoriatic arthritis or psoriasis but what can you do to avoid this from happening with apremilast? Is it just price? And then related among the things on the to do list here is to raise awareness of apremilast among prescribers which by I think some measures lags other categories including the jacks. What can be done on both of these fronts to maximize the impact of the apremilast launch? Thank you.","Bob Hugin","So relative to the first question on price, from the utilization data that I see in TOPO there\u2019s significant use of that in the pre-biologics space as well as post biologics despite indications where payers may be putting it. We look at price may be definitely than that a little bit and price should I think reflect where you want to be positioned in the marketplace and we would be looking at that pre-biologic early space. On the second question and the prescriber in KOL awareness of apremilast, I think we\u2019ve made a tremendous stride in the last couple years in really increasing and accelerating the awareness of the compound amongst prescribers in KOL.","I think you really get a nice boost when you got good Phase III data. We\u2019ve released a Phase III data from our initial trial in PSA (inaudible) trial and we will be, as Bob mentioned earlier, hopefully appropriate medical meetings in this year and hopefully early in 2013 getting that psoriasis data out there. And then with getting the data out there and in socializing it through important medical meetings and with others, that\u2019s when the awareness continues to grow. But I think from my personal perspective, I\u2019ve seen the awareness of apremilast grow very, very significantly over the last year.","Mark Alles","And we\u2019re still a year away from launch. So that would be the critical time where, as people see Phase III data applications submitted and regulatory review and approval, there\u2019s an opportunity to really increase the awareness. And certainly we recognize that in this marketplace, that is going to be critical. And I think we have a very robust plan to ensure that this will be a very well known drug at the time of launch.","Matthew Roden \u2013 UBS","Thank you.","Jackie Fouse","So with that, thank you, everybody, for joining us on the call today. Anybody who was in the queue didn\u2019t get to ask a question, apologies for that. We will be happy to follow up with you after the call. So thanks again, and talk to you soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This concludes our program for today.

I appreciate the opportunity to review the outstanding results in the third quarter and the sustained progress achieved on critical corporate objectives. This quarter Celgene teams across the globe produced exceptional commercial and operating results leading to outstanding financial performance which again supports raising our full year financial guidance for adjusted earnings per share. We achieved important milestones during the quarter including the approval of Pomalidomide in Europe for our last refractory myeloma and the launch of the ABRAXANE in the United States for pancreatic cancer. We also advance important initiatives that position us for a strong finish to 2013 and to deliver on the promise of 2017 and beyond. Our commercial performance in the third quarter was excellent with our regular teams producing impressive results in markets around the world. The stronger ABRAXANE trajectories that began with the lung cancer launch late last year has accelerated with the introduction of the pancreatic cancer indication in the United States.","POMALYST\u2019s launch momentum continued in the second full quarter in the market and we\u2019re now beginning our commercial efforts in Europe. And are encouraged by the early results. Several important clinical and regulatory developments also strengthen and enhance our hematology, oncology portfolio. We are pursuing regulatory approvals for ABRAXANE and pancreatic cancer around the world to stand access to this important therapy to patients in need. In Europe we expect the CHMT opinion by the end of the year. As we continue to learn more about the potential of ABRAXANE we are expanding our clinical trial programs in multiple indications including Triple Negative Breast Cancer and adjuvant pancreatic cancer.","We also expect final overall survival data from our Phase III trial at metastatic myeloma in the coming months. And the annual meeting December will again be a highlight for Celgene. And Mark will provide his perspective on the important body of clinical data from the Celgene portfolio expected to be presented in New Orleans. An important part of today\u2019s presentation will be Scott Smith\u2019s update on a very positive developments or inflammation and immunology franchise. Our team is working hard to prepare for an expected first quarter launch of a POMALYST [ph] for psoriatic arthritis in the United States. We are accelerating the build out of our organization in the U.S. and beginning to expand our operations overseas in time for expected approvals in 2015.","Though we have much to do the expertise and commitment of our new team and the extensive preparations to insure a world class launch are impressive. Our clinical and regulatory teams are meeting all expected time lines for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis applications around the world. We hope to see some of you at the American College of Rheumatology Conference in San Diego starting this weekend where important new data will be presented on the POMALYST and psoriatic arthritis and the Behcet disease further strengthening the value proposition of this very promising new therapy. We\u2019re expanding the clinical profile of POMALYST additional indications specifically our Phase III trial and ankylosing spondylitis is now fully enrolled and we expect top line data in the first half of next year and we\u2019re also beginning trials in additional areas of unmet medical needs and Scott will provide more detail in developments and potential of POMALYST in few minutes.","During this quarter we continue to strengthen our prospects for sustained long term growth by advancing our internal pipeline and portfolio of external collaborations. We\u2019re confident that our strategy of investing an internal programs with disruptive potential and complementary external programs that leverage our competitive advantages positions our franchises to deliver transformational therapies for patients.","We\u2019re energized by the significant promise of our innovative portfolio. As we looked to 2014 and beyond we\u2019re excited about the opportunities for Celgene. We\u2019re focused on our strategic imperatives maximizing the full potential of our hematology franchise expanding our oncology business, building a global I&I franchise and advancing our innovative early pipeline. Our business model has extraordinary potential to deliver exceptional near term results and long term growth. Let me now turn the call to Jackie.","","Jackie Fouse","Thank you Bob and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on our call. 2013 continues to be a great year for Celgene and the third quarter provided further evidence of our strong commercial and financial momentum. Year-over-year product sales growth accelerated again and reached 18% for Q3. REVLIMID growth was 12% propelled by volume growth and total hematology franchise sales are benefiting from the rapid uptake of POMALYST in the U.S. as it had its second full quarter of sales as well as the launch of IMNOVID in August in Europe.","Excellent ABRAXANE growth continues in the U.S. in non-small-cell lung cancer and now in pancreatic cancer post our September approval for that indication in the U.S., while the product marches upward outside the U.S. Our P&L metrics remained positive and we grew earnings per share by 21%. Our operating margin for the quarter was down 20 basis points versus last year as a result of our investments in launch activity, but year-to-date Q3 compared to the same period last year, we have increased our operating margin by 150 basis points to 49.3%. And we did this while investing in our emerging inflammation and immunology franchise.","Through Q3 of this year, we have bought back over $2 billion of our own shares. And during the quarter, we entered into several new research and development collaboration agreements as part of our ongoing unique strategic approach to accessing leading-edge science in ensuring our long-term growth potential. With the 18% year-over-year growth, total net product sales for the quarter were $1.644 billion and total revenues reached $1.674 billion. All major products are contributing to our growth and our portfolio is becoming ever more diversified based on new products, new indications and new geographies.","The net product sales growth of 18.4% came from 19.3% volume growth that was negatively impacted by foreign exchange of about $16 million or just over 1 percentage point. Price was essentially flat globally. The 19.3% volume growth is our strongest volume quarter so far this year. With 21% year-over-year earnings per share growth for the quarter, we continue to deliver faster EPS growth and revenue growth and we are doing this while making important investments and product launches this year and while building our inflammation and immunology franchise as Scott will speak about in a moment. The $0.27 absolute increase in quarterly earnings per share year-over-year came from a $0.23 increase via operating income growth and only a net $0.04 increase from all financial drivers combined. This means that 85% of our earnings per share growth is operationally driven with the added value from financial contributors being the icing on the cake.","Taking a look at individual product sales. REVLIMID\u2019s very solid commercial momentum was appearing yet again this quarter as the product posted 12% year-over-year and 4% sequential growth for the quarter. The U.S. came off of a very strong 10% sequential growth rate in Q2 and put up 1% sequential growth in Q3, a pattern consistent with last year. International sequential growth was strong at 7% and was demand driven. VIDAZA was impacted in the U.S. by the long-awaited entry of generic competition and Mark will speak more about our CapEx for addressing that category in a moment. The product remains on very sound footing outside the U.S., an international growth of 13% fuels the quarter\u2019s 4% global sequential growth.","Year-over-year ABRAXANE growth of 60% and sequential growth of 10% comes from the products continued strong non-small-cell lung cancer performance in the U.S. from building momentum now in pancreatic cancer in the U.S. and from very solid performance in breast cancer globally. POMALYST in the U.S. and IMNOVID in Europe are driving outstanding sales results globally in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma and global sales of these products totaled $90 million in Q3. These products are still early in their long-term growth trajectories.","REVLIMID\u2019s year-over-year 12.3% growth for the quarter came from 11% volume growth and a net positive contribution of 1.3% on price and foreign exchange. Our positive income statement dynamic and operational leverage story remain robust. Gross margins improved 20 basis points for the year-over-year comparisons for both the quarter and Q3 year-to-date.","Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues is running at just over 22% and was down 90 basis points for the quarter comparison and 230 basis points year-to-date. This percentage can fluctuate up or down in any given period depending on the time lines for our clinical trials and the timing of collaboration milestone payment. SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues is running around 24%, but peaked during Q3 and should trend downward in Q4 following spending on multiple product launches earlier this year. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of revenues of 150 basis points this quarter and 110 basis points year-to-date is driven by a combination of launch expenses and selective investment in our global hematology and oncology franchise commercial infrastructure along with new investment spend in our inflammation and immunology franchise.","Even with all of these investments our year-to-date adjusted operating margin has improved by 150 basis points to 49.3%, our effective tax rate is running at 16.8% slightly above last year\u2019s 16.5% due to our revenue mix.","To the point of improving operating margins a look back at the last five years and 2013 through Q3 shows our track record of sustained improvements in margin as we leverage our global business model. This data also reveals the power of our model to generate the P&L capacities that allows us to make appropriate new or incremental investments in both our research and development and commercial capabilities to ensure our long-term growth profile while we also deliver faster profit growth to our shareholders today.","To complete the picture on our financial metrics we have an objective to improve our return on invested capital overtime. On this slide we show you both the most conservative measure of ROIC based on total invested capital including cash and U.S. GAAP income as well as return on invested capital excluding cash balances. As a result of the debt raise we view [ph] it back in August in the higher cash balance we carried as of Q3, our gross ROIC dipped slightly in the third quarter on a 12 months trailing basis. You can see the positive momentum in the net ROIC calculation driven by our operating profit performance and our returns both as long term investment approach.","As we continue our strong operating performance on a go forward basis and as we maintain and enhance our capital structure strategy we expect positive trends for both of these ROIC metrics. Our strong business model produced a strong cash flow that allow us to reinvest for the long term health of our business and simultaneously return funds to shareholders. Cash generated by operations in Q3 was just over $570 million and year-to-date we have repurchased 2.05 billion of our stock. We have also deployed over 500 million to investments in various strategic business development opportunities this year.","To wrap up my section today I\u2019m pleased to provide you with some updates to our full year 2013 financial guidance. We now expect our total net product sales to exceed $6.2 billion and we expect REVLIMID sale to be in the middle to upper end of our guidance range of $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion. We continue to expect operating margins to come in around 49%.","We now expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.90 to $5.95 assuming a full year weighted average fully diluted share count of 430 million and an effective tax rate between 16.5% and 17%. As compared to prior periods the fourth quarter of this year will reflect the impact of the generic VIDAZA U.S. in turn.","In addition investment in our inflammation and immunology franchise will accelerate in Q4 in advance of our first expected POMALYST approval early next year and as we build that franchise into an engine for future growth.","Thank you for listening and let me now turn the call over to Mark.","","Mark Alles","Thanks very much Jackie. Good morning everyone. We had an excellent quarter, third quarter total net product sales grew 5% quarter-on-quarter and 18% year-on-year to $1.144 billion a very positive reflection of the discipline execution of our integrated clinical regulatory and commercial operating plans. Our hematology and oncology franchise made substantial progress in the third quarter towards achieving the four key objectives that we established at the beginning of this year. To capitalize our clinical and commercial strength in hematology to build our global oncology franchise to deliver strong product sales growth and to accelerate the pace of scientific innovation to provide new and significant long-term opportunities.","Our multiple myeloma business is well-positioned for its next phase of growth. REVLIMID demand fundamentals were strong in the third quarter and in 20 met its primary endpoint. POMALYST is launching in the United States and now in Europe and we established new drug development collaborations with the biotechnology companies MorphoSys and Acetylon to expand our myeloma therapies to include monoclonal antibodies and new HDAC inhibitors.","REVLIMID sales were driven by the combination of duration, global share of the myeloma market above 50% and prescriptions in the new indications mantle cell lymphoma in the United States and MDS deletion 5q in Europe. REVLIMID sales grew 4% quarter-on-quarter and 12% year-on-year to $1.90 billion. Third quarter POMALYST sales grew 35% quarter-on-quarter to $90 million. In the United States, POMALYST continues to rapidly gain market share in the third and fourth lines of therapy for myeloma. The launch results remain above plan. In early August, we received European marketing authorization for pomalidomide with the trade name IMNOVID and we immediately launched in Germany.","We are pleased with the pace of sales in France and the use of IMNOVID in the United Kingdom is now being reimbursed from a special cancer drug fund prior to formal review by NICE. We are confident in the value proposition IMNOVID provides for patients and for payers. Our market active teams have started reimbursement negotiations in every European market and we expect to achieve broad patient access throughout Europe by the second half of 2014. With regulatory approvals now in both the United States and Europe and the clear unmet medical need of patients in this clinical setting, POMALYST IMNOVID is on track to become our next hematology blockbuster.","Sales of VIDAZA in the third quarter were $220 million, 4% quarter-on-quarter growth and flat year-on-year. While we did see the launch of generic azacitidine in the United States during the quarter, we remain committed to optimize in the full potential of VIDAZA in Europe and other international markets. Top line results from our Phase 3 study of VIDAZA in elderly and now are expected by the end of this year or early next year. And we are advancing two Phase 3 registration track studies for CC46 in AML and MDS. Our MDS AML business continues to represent a multi-billion dollar potential and Celgene is committed to remaining the scientific leader in the specialized segment of hematology.","Third quarter ABRAXANE sales were $170 million, representing 10% quarter-on-quarter growth and 60% year-on-year growth. Sales were driven by increased use in both histologic substance of non-small-cell lung cancer, steady demand in metastatic breast cancer, early adoption in metastatic pancreatic cancer and increased sales in Europe and in Japan. In the United States, ABRAXANE is emerging as a cornerstone therapy for the treatment of multiple solid tumor cancers.","The FDA approval in September of ABRAXANE in combination with gemcitabine for the treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer expands the commercial opportunity for ABRAXANE to three major indications, breast cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer and now metastatic pancreatic cancer. FDA approval of this important indication represents the first of what we expect will be a series of international regulatory marketing approvals starting with the expected CHMP opinion in Europe by the end of this year.","We are driving a paradigm shift in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Just last week, the results of the Phase 3 CA46 study were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. We are confident that this ABRAXANE regimen has the potential to rapidly become the global standard of care for the treatment of this incredibly challenging disease. In late 2012, we described the significant and clinically meaningful progression free survival advantage demonstrated by ABRAXANE over the carbazine in a Phase 3 study of patients with metastatic melanoma. We expect the final overall survival results to be available during the fourth quarter. These data will inform our regulatory strategy and we will submit the final study results of presentation at a medical meeting next year.","To further expand the clinical and commercial potential of ABRAXANE, we initiated the Phase 2\/3 study in first line triple-negative metastatic breast cancer during the quarter. Additional Phase 3 studies in adjuvant pancreatic cancer and squamous cell, non-small cell lung cancer should begin by the end of this year. Every year the American Society of Hematology meeting provides an important opportunity to present the results of the latest research featuring our therapies and our promising pipeline drugs. And the 2013 will continue this tradition. We\u2019re aware of at least 160 abstracts that have been submitted to ASH [ph] on Celgene therapies. There are approximately 100 abstracts on REVLIMID alone a strong signal [ph] opposite involving clinical profile in multiple myeloma NMVS [ph] and it's emerging profile in other hematological malignancies.","Important abstracts on POMALYST and relapse and refractory multiple myeloma will provide additional clinical information that should help hematologist to further define their use of this novel therapy. Initial data from this separate Phase I studies of CC-122, CC-223 and CC-292 will also be highlighted. I would like to briefly summarize three important abstracts on the use of REVLIMID and newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. First, updated results from the MM015 study will be an oral presentation. This abstract focuses on the mature overall survival data in elderly patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. The presentation will also include an important analysis of progression free survival to PFS2 is a validated surrogate endpoint for overall survival and it is an important end point with respect to European regulatory guidelines recognized now as a clinical benefit end point.","As you know assessment of PFS2 is measured from the time from initial randomization to the time of second progression after the next line of therapy or debts from any cause. The second abstract is an important and robust meta-analysis conducted by hematologist with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota of randomized trials testing REVLIMID maintenance in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. This abstract was also selected for oral presentation. We expect the results to highlight the overall benefits to risk ratio of REVLIMID used continuously to maintain long term disease control in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.","Third the ASH Program Committee has selected the abstract summarizing the initial results of the Celgene sponsored international Phase III NM-20 study for presentations during the scientific plenary session. The plenary session is scheduled during the afternoon of December 8, you will recall that in July we announced that MM20 met the primary end point of superior progression free survival for the combination of REVLIMID, plus low dose dexamethasone used continuously until disease progression compared with standard Melphalan, Prednisone and Thalidomide for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are not eligible for stem cell transplantation.","The part of presentation of MM20 is expected to review analysis of final progress free survival interim overall survival, PFS2, response rates, time to response, duration of response and safety including second primary malignancies across all three arms of the study achieving global regulatory approvals for REVLIMID for the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma is one of our most important corporate objective and it is the most important objective for our hematology franchise meeting to the regulatory authorities to discuss our submission plan for REVLIMID in this indication have progressed and are ongoing.","We\u2019re working expeditiously to submit our regulatory dossiers to the CHMT in Europe and to the FDA in the United States and expect to submit these applications in the first quarter of 2014.","Our hematology and oncology franchise is generating strong operating momentum. We\u2019re on track to feed our full year 2013 sales target to advance the significant near term sales catalyst and to unlock new opportunities for growth. I would love to thank and recognize my colleagues in clinical and regulatory and in commercial for their extra-ordinary dedication to our vision and to the mission to discover and develop therapies that extend and improve the lives of people with cancer. Our results and our products are making the positive difference. Thank you very much. I would like to turn the call over to Scott Smith for an update on our POMALYST and our inflammation and immunology franchise.","","Scott Smith","Thank you Mark and good morning to all. 2013 has been a year of tremendous progress and momentum within the I&I franchise. We are refocusing on four key strategies as we move the franchise forward targeting markets with high-end medical needs. Precise execution of the clinical development plan is evidenced by six positive Phase 3 trials in psoriasis and PsA hiring experienced leadership with peak therapeutic knowledge to lead our global launches and advancing the important programs in our early clinical phase pipeline.","Our regulatory plans for apremilast will remain on track. Our discussions with the FDA on our PsA application have been progressing well as we move closer to the March 2014 PDUFA date. We are on track with our apremilast psoriasis NDA filings with the FDA later this year. In addition, we expect to submit the combined psoriasis PSA marketing authorization application to the European authorities before the end of the year. During Q3, we completed enrollment in our 500 patient Phase 3 POSTURE trial of apremilast in ankylosing spondylitis. AS is a formal arthritis is primarily affecting the spine. It has estimated effect over 2 million people in the United States and Europe and there is a tremendous need for new treatment options for this disease. We expect to see top line results from POSTURE I trial in the first half 2014.","Earlier this month at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology Annual Meeting, there was a deeper look at the ESTEEM 1 data, the positive and robust scalp and nail psoriasis could be very meaningful to patients as additions. More than half of psoriasis patients have scalp or nail involvement, which can be debilitating and difficult to treat. An effective oral option for these patients could be an important addition to the treatment (indiscernible). Also presented in the ADV was an abstract that demonstrated that apremilast improves psoriasis patient\u2019s quality of life as measured by improvements in the LQIs and other key secondary endpoints.","We are also very excited about the upcoming ACR which will start later this week in San Diego. You can see from the slide there will be a tremendous amount of apremilast data being presented including 52-week results from both the PALACE-2 and PALACE-3 trials data on the effect of apremilast and the important disease manifestations of PsA such as dactylitis and enthesitis as well as swollen and tender joints, improved safety and laboratory data. These data showed apremilast offers patients a robust response as the continuing to prove over time reaching ACR 20 scores in the 50% to 60% plus percent range by week 52 as well as deep and clinical meaningful responses in numerous key secondary endpoints. The cool safety and laboratory data show a consistent and highly differentiated safety profile that confirms our belief of laboratory monitoring for patients will not likely be necessary.","In addition to the data listed above, I am excited to announce the acceptance of a late-breaking abstract of our PALACE-4 trial of apremilast monotherapy in DMARD-na\u00efve patients. An abstract on the use of apremilast in Behcet\u2019s disease from our recent Phase 2 trial was selected by the ACR to be a plenary presentation confirming the importance of this data and the need for new treatment options for patients with this serious disease. Finally, there will be some interesting data on our new immunology-specific compounds CTQ20 which will begin Phase 3 trials in the near future. We will be summarizing all these data as well as highlighting our launch readiness and an investor event at ACR on Sunday, October 27, 6.30 PM Pacific Time. This event will also be available via webcast.","In summary, a lot of progress has been made since we last spoke. We are very confident about the emerging profile of apremilast based on the robustness and consistency of the data including the 52 week results. Our launch planning has continued to accelerate and we will be prepared to execute a high impact launch early next year. Joining our team recently had been a number of very talented experienced commercial and medical affairs leaders that are finalizing and implementing launch plans as appropriate. We are now actively recruiting a rheumatology sales force in the United States. The response and caliber of candidates has been tremendous. It\u2019s very exciting time, a lot has been accomplished. There is still a lot yet to do. Our team is working passionately to ensure that we can bring this potentially transformational treatment option to patients worldwide in the near future.","Thank you. And I would like to turn it over to Bob.","","Bob Hugin","Thank you, Scott and thank you Jackie and Mark. Third quarter performance was truly outstanding. We are encouraged by these operating results as we look forward to the promise of the coming quarters. Our teams are focused on discovering and delivering innovative therapies and are well-positioned to sustain long-term growth. I want to thank all my colleagues around the world for their dedication to improving the lives of patients every day. We look forward to updating you on a number of occasions before the end of the year, including at the American College of Rheumatology meeting this weekend in San Diego and at the American Society of Hematology meeting at early December in New Orleans.

Your line is open.","","Geoff Meacham \u2013 JPMorgan","Got one for you on 020 what was the driver to push the EU filing, was it just data maturation or was it the request of the regulators and just another one related to ABRAXANE. You guys talked about last quarter acceleration mostly due to lung cancer approval and was that also the case in the third quarter did you guys see some early signals of pancreatic uptick? Thanks a lot.","","Mark Alles","Geoff on MM020 we have great clarity on where we believe the dossiers need to evolve in terms of collecting the data we have organizing it well and submitting with the best a dossier is possible. So when we look at the timeline it pushes it into Q1 just to be sure that everything is exactly right and when the submissions go in they are lined up with what the regulators have talked to us about and that the process is smooth and complete. With respect to what\u2019s happened with ABRAXANE the dynamics are very interesting. We still see as I said good penetration in the lung cancer markets and we remain excited about that opportunity but there is no doubt we saw uptick in pancreatic cancer and I think it's consistent with the idea that remember the (indiscernible) data were presented first early this year at (indiscernible) but then again featured as ASCO and I think that the marketplace is getting used to the idea that this is a robust outcome from those patients, it has been as a single agent the standard of care and it's evolving nicely. So we\u2019re looking forward to even accelerated performance now that we have launched.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Rachel McMinn with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","","Rachel McMinn - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I know it's a little bit early to ask for 2014 guidance specifically but can you help us a little bit with the SG&A expense line, you know for 2013 it was on track for more 20% growth in that line item. Is there a lot of new infrastructure that\u2019s going to come in 2014 with marketing for POMALYST infrastructure there and then as a totally separate question I\u2019m curious on your R&D perspective for the need for a JAK inhibitor just following the ruxolitinib data there and some of the evolving landscape with a lot of companies placing bets on JAK inhibitors. Thanks.","","Jackie Fouse","When you look at the targets that we have laid out going back to earlier this year in 2013, \u201815 and \u201917 obviously you can look at the trajectory there and we have also I think laid out on a couple of occasions how we see the P&L dynamic evolving and how we can deliver faster profit growth in the revenue growth even when we we\u2019re making these investments and we only talked about 2013 and 2014 being the incrementally largest investment years in terms of building the inflammation and immunology franchise. So you see what we have done so far in 2013 when you look out a how we have talked about \u201915 and \u201917 where we say that we would go around 52% operating margin by 2015 and 55 by 2017 it's not going to be a linear progression but as we have talked about we will still deliver leverage in 2014 even while we invest in mostly the I&I platform from an incremental standpoint. So while we took the opportunity to do in 2013 is invest appropriately and ahead of the launches so that you have seen the trajectories in the launches and the demonstration of the executions on the commercial teams there both in the U.S. and in Europe with POMALYST IMNOVID in the S-REVLIMID and ABRAXANE and others. And now we start seeing a bit of a sheath and more standard going to the I&I platform and we will see that continue in 2014. So we will deliver the P&L leverage at the operating profit levels despite that. When we think about R&D as long as there is some getting to the end is determining on that will be dependent on the time launch for our clinical trials. You have seen us talk about adding some new trials for ABRAXANE. We have a big portfolio now where we do get some turnover as things come down and some new things come into the mix and then whether we have collaboration milestones or not. So we are seeing that percentage of revenue to be a little bit lower this year than we thought, but it\u2019s just because the nature of this large portfolio.","","Bob Hugin","And Rachel, it\u2019s Bob. Generally, we are very pleased with the performance of our internal pipeline and the progress that our collaborators are making in programs that will help support our pipeline and broaden and deepen our pipeline over time. And clearly, the marketplace has embraced some of those collaborators in terms of the opportunity to even raise more capital over the last few months. And so we feel very good about where we are. So we don\u2019t see a need to do anything that at this time we feel very good about where we are positioned. We always are looking at the landscape for partnership opportunities and products that have a good value proposition. And if there is an opportunity to bring something in this complementary and to our products, we certainly do that, we look very closely. And even if we don\u2019t bring the products into our specific portfolio, we very actively look at clinical collaborations whether that\u2019s in combination or sequential to ensure that our products are combined with the best products to give the best output for patients, but I can\u2019t comment anything specifically, but there is nothing dramatic that we are looking at right now and we will continue to look at the landscape.","","Operator","Thank you.

Mark, just a follow-up on the question about the filing about MM-020, we are not seeing an update on IFM or CALGB at ASH and can you comment specifically on that this morning? Could you tell us whether the filing is going to include all four of the frontline trials IFM, CALGB, 015 and 020 or is it really now focused on 020? And should we anticipate that the label includes both transplant and non-transplant patients frontline in maintenance or is there going to be some subset of that? Thanks.","","Mark Alles","Thanks for the question, Geoff. First, our intent is to get the broadest possible label for newly diagnosed myeloma period. Second, the IFM 05-02 study will be at ASH. There is an update plan. The reason that I didn\u2019t speak about it directly is because is the trial that would be part of as it goes to your question about the comprehensive nature of the application. It is a trial that will be included in integrated safety summary that we do as part of our submissions without doubt. So we are looking for a broad label. We are looking for the safety data from all of the REVLIMID and the MM studies and then of course MM-020 with 015 would be the pivotal studies that would make up the bulk of the dossier.","","Bob Hugin","And country by country can have very different outcomes on the label and the indication, but we are very encouraged by the discussions and we are moving as quickly as possible.","","Geoffrey Porges - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, thanks very much.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Terrence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open","","Terrence Flynn - Goldman Sachs","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Was just noticed your comments, Mark, about PFS 2 and I was just \u2013 that\u2019s the kind of the first time I have heard about this was just wondering how we should think about that in the context of overall survival data here? And then want to know longer term multiple myeloma market, just would love your thoughts on the potential for PD-1 drugs here? Thanks.","","Mark Alles","Thank you for the question. I think this first thing is we really should congratulate regulatory agencies when they look at these diseases like lymphoma, myeloma, etcetera and overall survival as a primary endpoint is so difficult to achieve because of the ability to treat these diseases long-term is very important for us to say PFS2 as a validated surrogate endpoint is quite important. What that allows us to do is priority study progression as an endpoint that is extremely valuable. We know that from PFS and the initial way of looking at our data but now even after cross over one is able to measure the effect of the drug from randomization all the way through the second progression. The regulatory things are moving with the science, the biology and the therapies in this space. The way I think about it is that we will always now in lymphoma, leukemia, and myeloma looking to build in PFS, PFS2 and then of course as a secondary endpoint overall survival. I think with the respect to PD1, you know it's interesting because I think it's a very, very flexible mechanism and I think we just had to wait and see a little bit and it's pretty clear what\u2019s happening in the market generally but we have thought about that a lot and in fact in our discussions about antibiotics generally it has come into our scientific debate.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Yaron Werber with Citi. Your line is open.","","Yaron Werber - Citi","I just had a question, Jackie just a little bit when you look at your share count I mean this year you\u2019ve done about 2 billion in stock buybacks last year, the share count went down you know pretty significantly throughout the year and I\u2019m trying to kind of get a sense and last year potentially the same amount of stock buy backs what difference this year or do you think the share count will go down dramatically, is there a catch up effect in Q4?","","Jackie Fouse","It's most related to the fact that you know the stock price is a lot higher now than it was a year ago. So again we stick by the assumption that we have underlying our targets which is a flat share count and if we have you know lower share counts in that in the future obviously that gives some upside potential from the financial drivers.","","Yaron Werber - Citi","Okay but the option expenses is pretty much consistent I guess just to clarify the question.","","Jackie Fouse","Yeah I mean you get a little bit more delusional when the share price is higher and then it depends a little bit on the activity you know of employees there so.","","Bob Hugin","The expense is higher, the stock price rises was restricted stock but it's really it's just the function of the stock price.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Schoenbaum with ISI Group. Your line is open.","","Mark Schoenbaum - ISI Group","Can I just clarify Geoff\u2019s question the on the filing, can you just confirm for clarity sake that you will be filing both for the transplant eligible population as well as the transplant ineligible population when you file on the U.S. and Europe and then Pomalidomide if I might or POMALYST possible to give us a couple symmetric such as perhaps share in the U.S. in the target market and I assume Mark since you used the word blockbuster I know you\u2019ve have used that before with Pomalidomide that I would assume that you would encourage us but do not view this drug as anywhere near it's peak potential right now, there is a lots of growth ahead I just want to make sure I understood your, not over-reading your comments. Thanks a lot.","","Bob Hugin","So just to clarify again on our filing strategy the intent is to use a comprehensive data set, MM-20 is key to that in all markets around the world O15 [ph] is also part of that remember that in O15 lenalidomide maintenance was used after MPRs induction. So this gives us a lot of flexibility market to market in different regulators to seek the broadest possible label for newly diagnosed myeloma. By definition that would allow for us to look for the transplant ineligible as well as had discussions about eligible because the label for the treatment of myeloma could then be considered inclusive. So with all of the above not one or the other at this point and we\u2019re moving as quickly as we can to make sure these dossiers are comprehensive line-up with the regulatory agencies expectations and include the very important safety data that is part of the overall set of induction, maintenance, eligible, ineligible patients.","","Mark Schoenbaum - ISI Group","CALGB and IFM trials be in the package?","","Bob Hugin","These data on maintenance at CALGB and IFM will be part of it at least the integrated safety summary for the brand. Now, with respect to pomalidomide and the blockbuster status, I think it\u2019s clear to us that the brand I know that everyone has modeled this has $1 billion plus potential in its core indication. So that\u2019s the context of the comment.","","Jackie Fouse","And just when you think about the trajectory I mean, look we are only in the second full quarter in the U.S. the product screening, while we just launched the product in Europe while we are well ahead of the competition. So the growth trajectory is very good for this product and will be for a while.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Yee with RBC Capital. Your line is open.","","Michael Yee - RBC Capital","Hi, thanks. Good morning. A question on guidance actually when you gave your 2017 guidance, you didn\u2019t have your MM-020 results, so given the importance of that study, did that change how we should be thinking about your guidance over the next few years, has that changed probabilities? And then as a related question, when you present that MM-020 data and when you submit it, what is the maturity of events on the PFS and OS? Thanks.","","Jackie Fouse","Let me start and take the question. So when we gave the 2017 targets \u2013 2015 targets for that matter, we did not have the visibility to (indiscernible) that we have today and some other things as well. So the way that I would look at that is I mean a couple of from a couple of different perspectives, first of all, you can take the targets that we have laid out there and consider that they are highly achievable and that we have significantly de-risked the assumptions necessary to get to those targets over the course of this year. So if for anybody who is still doing their analysis to come to a conclusion about how they think, what they think about our range for apremilast since that\u2019s the newest thing that\u2019s in there now, we still have to get out there and get the approvals and execute on that or whether you think about the potential for upside to those targets based on where you are in your analysis, I think you can come at it from both of those different ways, but there is a significantly lower level of risk to our achieving those targets today versus when we gave them 10 months ago.","","Bob Hugin","Again, I will just follow up that question with the data. We are encouraged about MM-020 and we are really looking forward to reviewing it at ASH. The abstracts will come out in early November and I think together we can look at the data after the scientific plenary session, but we are very, very optimistic about the impact of the data.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.

So question on 020 again, just I guess wanted to get your thoughts on how this \u2013 how that could impact the U.S. trends. And if I could take another one then, do you think that apremilast will require a panel?","","Mark Alles","I think this is Mark. Thank you for the question about MM-020 and IMPACT. The important part of the newly diagnosed multiple myeloma trials that have been ongoing were (indiscernible) MM-020 other studies and there will be a lot at ASH is that the constancy in this continuous Rev decks is highly effective at producing progressive-free survival, trends in overall survival. We have seen overall survival in many studies. So the nice opportunity here is to reinforce duration of therapy matters in the treatment of myeloma. So we look for opportunities and we think that data will start by increasing duration of therapy even above the pace it\u2019s on today. Beyond that, I think there is a market share opportunity, but that would come largely from the approval and the first time that our full U.S. commercial organization is able to promote REVLIMID\u2019s benefit for newly diagnosed myeloma. So it\u2019s kind of two stages duration in the short-term, share in the longer term.","","Scott Smith","And this is Scott, relative to the apremilast Adcom question at this time, we do not anticipate an Adcom, but the regular process \u2013 the regulatory process is ongoing.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Schmidt from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Company","Thank you. Question for Mark on REVLIMID, it looks like maybe for the first time at about a year you saw a nice quarter-on-quarter increase in the international business there. Just wondering if there is a different trend in Europe or if that\u2019s coming from some other new markets you may have penetrated can you give us some more detail.","","Mark Alles","Sure. So as you know different markets will come in and out of picture but Europe was quite strong, we were very, very happy with the performance of Europe in general and then we saw some strength in Japan. Canada and Australia, quarter-by-quarter are very strong so when you add it up you see that nice performance in the quarter very balanced.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Howard Liang with Leerink Swann.

Thanks.","","Bob Hugin","Well Howard CC-292 is really just an ongoing update of the Phase I profile, as you know there is combination data with REVLIMID my guess is that we would see some of that in the presentation. With respect to O15, the maturity of the survival continues but what is the feature of the O15 study is the pre-specified plan to look at progression free survivals and this is the initial PFS2 results which could be considered final but we don\u2019t have not yet, it's the percent. That\u2019s correct, right. So we\u2019re still maturing on overall survival but PFS2, one can consider that mature.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike King with JMP Securities. Your line is open.","","Mike King - JMP Securities","Regarding the guidance for the remainder of the year, it seems rather conservative because if you just do the math real quick it looks like you\u2019re guiding to us to down towards quarter historically your fourth quarter has if anything has been the most robust of the year. So I\u2019m just wondering if you can help us think that through.","","Jackie Fouse","So the way that we\u2019re looking Q4 is we\u2019re factoring in the impact of the generic VIDAZA entering in the U.S. where we would have all of that in the fourth quarter as you know that came very late in Q3 so there was little or no impact on either of the top line or the bottom line in the third quarter. So we would have the first full quarter impact of that and then we\u2019re also looking at an acceleration in the expense investment in I&I at the same time we will be coming you know off a bit on the hematology oncology side of things because of the launch expenses that we have had up to now so I would expect percentage of revenue the SG&A to come down a little bit. I think when I look at, everybody is for the quarter I think we have got a little bit higher estimates for our R&D expense in the quarter versus the rest of you but let\u2019s see where we come out. I feel very, very good about our ability to hit the new rates, guidance\u2019s that we have given for the full year.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Thomas Wei with Jefferies. Your line is open.","","Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Company","I just wanted to ask on this PFS2 endpoint, how should we think about the regulatory or marketing value of an endpoint like that when the protocol does not prespecific that patients in the control arm receive REVLIMID on progression. I don\u2019t quite know how to think about that I guess it's specifically from a regulatory standpoint and then just separately any update on the I&I marketing strategy and what you\u2019re planning to do on the dermatology side?","","Mark Alles","So the way the conversations have gone with the academic key opinion leaders and then more generally with the regulatory authorities is that while we wait for mature that is greater than 50% or 75% of the survival events PFS2 becomes a surrogate and now it is recognized in the EMEA guidelines as an endpoint that will be substituting for final overall survival advantage and it of course calculates in a PFS continuum from time of randomization all the way through the benefit of in this case the experimental arm of the study. So I think it\u2019s acting as a long-term view at the health disease control from the first treatment through the impact of crossover and then prior to survival benefits patients and it is a very, very good surrogate. So the way we are thinking about it from a regulatory endpoint is it completes the discussion about risk benefit from progression-free survival in the setting of in our case this question about long-term exposure in SPMs that develop or don\u2019t develop as a consequence of treatment. So the general way to think about it is as a surrogate for benefit risk prior to having final overall survival. I&I was your second question.","","Mark Alles","Yes, it was around general marketing strategy. We are moving forward and preparing strongly for a second half of the year 2014 launch in the dermatology space with psoriasis. We are on selected geographies together with some certain patient segment having some discussions around partnering, but we are definitely preparing to do it and manage it ourselves in that space. We think there is tremendous potential in the derm space. We are also looking at some potential DTC type approaches in a targeted perspective once we get into 2014 or 2015, but we are moving strongly towards market in the second half of the year next year.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Joel Sendek with Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open.","","Joel Sendek - Stifel Nicolaus","Thanks a lot. I just have a question about the strength in your myeloma business in the past quarter. So first a follow-up on Eric\u2019s question, you said for REVLIMID x U.S. or in Europe, you are particularly strong. I am just wondering if that\u2019s driven by duration off label use, can you give us any view on that? And then Kyprolis in the U.S., I am wondering what the kind of the same question there is, is that driven by duration or sequencing ahead from relative to Kyprolis for pomalidomide, is it due to sequencing ahead of Kyprolis if you can give us any detail on that? Thanks.","","Mark Alles","Thanks Joel. It\u2019s Mark. So with respect to Europe, we saw market share gains in the second and later lines of therapy, where REVLIMID is reimbursed for second line therapy in the UK, it\u2019s later lines, but very, very good market share growth. Duration was the biggest driver in the quarter for Europe. And I think the dynamic continues where now POMALYST coming into the market, one would imagine as we have seen in the U.S. a list of REVLIMID, because now the drug can be completely exhausted prior to moving to a salvage setting, which in Europe of course will be POMALYST only IMNOVID, not Kyprolis. So this is why when we talk about blockbuster status, Europe has a very different dynamic than the U.S. where POMALYST is competing with day-in and day-out in the salvage market Kyprolis. Today, we can tell you that the vast majority of POMALYST patients are either coming directly from a REVLIMID containing regimen, so a direct sequence or this is a patient getting I am sorry, POMALYST instead of Kyprolis. So it\u2019s really not a dynamic between Kyprolis and POMALYST in the market, it\u2019s more where and how the patient treated before a decision is made to use pomalidomide or carfilzomib and you could see the dynamic is favoring in the short-term more POMALYST.","","Jackie Fouse","So we have got a few questions still left in the queue. We are going to try to get at least to those of you who haven\u2019t gotten to ask a question yet. So operator, please next question.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Ying Huang with Barclays. Your line is open.","","Ying Huang - Barclays","Thanks for taking me. So the first question is given the long-term falloff of apremilast in (indiscernible), was your update is thinking about pricing and also as you have seen, what the (indiscernible) in the market? The second one is without knowing the PFS term separation before ASH, what is your base case consideration here? Does that impact your guidance for 2017 if you only get 6 cycle 18 months REVLIMID on label in Europe for frontline? Thanks.","Mark Alles","So first the question relative to POMALYST pricing relative to 52 weeks data. We have a 52 week data for PALACE-1 and ACR will have the full 52 week data for PALACE-2, 3 and 4. So there will be a fuller picture of what that 52 week data looks like relative to the effect on pricing. I think what we want to do is, we want to make sure we price POMALYST in a position which is in accordance with where we see the utilization. We see mostly the utilization being in pre-biologic space before initiation of biologic therapy so we will price it according to that. There was also a question on (indiscernible) we certainly we take a look at their strategies and things but I don\u2019t want to comment on them.","","Jackie Fouse","And just on the 2017 guidance and what we have assumed in there for newly diagnosed there are a number of assumptions in there around shares and durations and the different geographies and all sorts of things but we have also got assumptions in there around the timing of approvals, launches as well the issue that came up earlier around the patient population that might or might not end up in the label. So we have been quite conservative in that regard with respect to what we have assumed in the financial model for non-stem cell transplant versus stem cell transplant. So again you will use the data at ASH but between that and the way that we built the financial model for 2017. I feel very, very good about our 2017 targets in general and specifically related to the newly diagnosed piece of that","","Mark Alles","Just a quick add-on part of the question was about a cap on the use of REVLIMID when it's improved for newly diagnosed myeloma. I want to just remind you that arm A which is the continuous REVLIMID dexamethasone arm was superior to MPT and it's the overwhelming data set generally for REVLIMID is continuous treatment until disease progression. This benefit risk profile continues to favor by far the use of continuous treatments and we don\u2019t expect capping in the label.","","Jackie Fouse","That\u2019s correct and in the financial model we\u2019re not anywhere close in 2017 to where the durations could go when we look at the assumptions that we made for where duration is at that point in time.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Ravi Mehrotra with Credit Suisse.

Thank you.","","Mark Alles","We like more to lot, we looked at daratumumab long before it was licensed to another company and looked at different synergies with IMiDs. Of course we\u2019re doing the Phase I program with more 202 but our view was that overall we saw a different antibody that was a little more specific to the target, the infusions schedule administrations was very different and favorable than daratumumab and so we think about controlling the development of IMiDs antibody through Phase I and into our overall program with REVLIMID and then of course with Pomalidomide in the relapse setting.

Thanks.","","Mark Alles","I apologize we\u2019re just not able to get into the data, there are two opportunities one is when the ASH abstract sort of available online and in publication which is November 7, and when those data are available of course we can have discussions about the abstract and then of course this is plenary session presentation so a lot of the questions, for example, the proportion of patients above or below a certain age this will be part of the plenary presentation we just can\u2019t comment."," ","Mark Alles"," ","And relative to ankylosing spondylitis very interesting market for us that trial, the POSTURE trial enrolled well ahead of schedule, which is always a good sign. I think if we get positive data there, there is tremendous opportunity. There is very little oral therapy that\u2019s been effective if any in the space. Biologic utilization is relatively low. There is approximately a million ankylosing spondylitis patients in the United States and some are 2.2 or 2.3 U.S. and Europe. So the significant from an epidemiology standpoint and on to your broader actual spondyloarthropathy question, that is a much bigger market than you see what they (indiscernible) probably the major subset of that. But in that group just probably 2.5 million patients in the United States alone and so it\u2019s a market opportunity with very little there nothing from an oral perspective.

I know you guys won\u2019t comment specifically on duration, but I am wondering if you could just give us what are the some sort of qualitative guidance or your thoughts where things are relative between U.S. and EU in terms of duration? How much behind is EU from U.S. right now, any sort of comment you can give us on the average duration for REVLIMID.","","Mark Alles","Yeah I\u2019m glad you qualified because with POMALYST it's just too early know, I assumed you met REVLIMID. So let me start with Europe. So the European all in with second, third line therapy the duration is approaching very nicely that year plus mark and we like that because the reality of that is we see a lot of upside again when POMALYST is available for salvage where today some physicians will stop prematurely, they have disease control, they want to optimize the product and just creates a lot of confidence and the ability to continue to use REVLIMID while other drugs like POMALYST are available at progression. With respect to the U.S. we\u2019re quite encouraged by the duration effect but we still know and again in U.S. the duration is a magnitude of order better because what ends up happening of course is that there are different segments of patients in the U.S. some newly diagnosed we have the maintenance feature after transplant that\u2019s part of the duration curve in the U.S. and that\u2019s quite long. So it's a very different dynamic. You can think of these markets as totally different with respect to duration but what you can say is that across the board and around the world duration in sequential quarters continues to improve.","","Jackie Fouse","With that thank you everyone for joining us on the call today. We look forward to seeing many of you, hopefully all of you over the course of the next couple of months between the ACR meeting that we have got coming up with the I&I team starting this coming weekend and into the first part of next week and then at ASH in December.

Alles","Thank you, Patrick. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'd like to start today's call by thanking my colleagues for delivering another quarter and another year of excellent operating results and strategic progress. We learned a lot last year and begin 2018 better for the experience and more committed than ever to achieving our ambitious goals.","Our 2017 accomplishments and momentum continue to build on our core strengths to drive long-term value creation. You'll hear much more about our fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 performance from Peter, Nadim, Terrie, and Scott later during the call.","Strategically we're building our capabilities and business model to ensure operational excellence, continuously grow and strengthen our financial flexibility, and to accelerate the discovery, development and introduction of new medicines with clear and compelling value proposition. We believe that this strategy ultimately creates the most value for shareholders and the patients we seek to serve.","In 2017, we significantly accelerate critical programs which have the potential to meaningfully diversify revenue and position us for growth from now through 2020 and beyond, powered by our research and discovery engine built on our internal centers of excellence and combined with high potential industry and academic partnerships. We continue to expand the number and diversity of novel agents entering clinical trials, led by Dr. Rupert Vessey, our distributor research teams and collaborators, advanced more than 25 new molecules into preclinical or Phase 1 development.","2017 was the second year in a row that at least eight IND CTAs were filed and our global clinical development teams advanced 14 pivotal trials across 13 indications including seven new agents. Celgene has a long track record of making strategic acquisitions and entering into early scientific partnerships to complement and expand our research efforts and commercial portfolio.","Since July of last year we've added three late stage assets each with blockbuster potential to our clinical portfolio. BGB-A317, fedratinib and just this week JCAR017. The acquisition of Juno immediately establishes Celgene as a global leader in the very promising field of cellular immunotherapy. It is also an enabler for us to advance our immuno-oncology platform.","Working with our partner bluebird bioscience is to bring bb2121 to the myeloma market remains a top corporate priority and with JCAR017 for relapsed lymphoma, Celgene is poised to launch two CAR T therapies for blood cancers in the next three years. We will continue to aggressively invest in research and development and to deploy capital to acquire or license the most promising science, technology, and products.","Everyday my colleagues and I are working to multiply the value we can create for all stakeholders through the combination of operating excellence, world-class research and drug development, our significant financial flexibility, and our passion to improve human health worldwide.","To begin the detailed discussion of our 2017 results, I'd like to turn the call over to Peter Kellogg and thank everyone for their attention.","Peter N. Kellogg","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. 2017 was a strong year for Celgene with top line growth and exceptional operating performance. Year-over-year product sales and EPS growth continue to be industry-leading. During this past year, we gained regulatory approval for REVLIMID maintenance in both the U.S and Europe, approval for IDHIFA in the U.S and submitted an NDA for Ozanimod in MS.","As Mark discussed, we made numerous strategic investments for the next decade, all while balancing our deployment of capital to opportunistically benefit from market volatility in the fourth quarter by strong share repurchase actions. All these achievements set up Celgene for a positive growth profile for the next decade.","Turning to our net product sales results, in the fourth quarter of 2017, total net product sales were $3.5 billion, a 17% increase year-over-year. Top line growth was driven by 13% volume growth worldwide. Full-year 2017 total net product sales were $13 billion, a 16% increase year-over-year driven by 13.6% product volume growth.","Fourth quarter operating earnings per share was $2, a 24% year-over-year increase. Operating income drove the majority of our performance. For the full-year, adjusted earnings per share were $7.44, a 25% year-over-year increase. Again this strong bottom-line performance was driven by operating income.","For the full-year 2017, our operating margin increased 300 basis points to 58%. We ended the year with approximately $12 billion in cash and marketable securities. Throughout the year, we continue to use our balance sheet and cash flow to invest in new collaborations, while we repurchased approximately $4 billion of Celgene shares in line with our plans for 2017.","At the J.P. Morgan Conference earlier this year, we presented our full-year 2018 financial guidance. As a reminder, we expect total revenue to increase 12% year-over-year and adjusted diluted EPS to grow 18%. This guidance does not include the expected dilutive impact of adjusted EPS from our recent announced acquisition of Juno Therapeutics. Once this transaction closes, we will update guidance.","Now as we began 2018, we do want to remind you that in Q1 we expect to see the customary P&L impact of our ACA donut hole payments primarily for REVLIMID and POMALYST. The softer seasonality impacts of ABRAXANE as we've seen in prior years and the normal beginning of year seasonality in psoriasis and OTEZLA as we discussed before.","Thank you. I'll now turn the call over to my colleague, Nadim.","Nadim Ahmed","Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. The hematology and oncology franchise delivered a strong fourth quarter with 16% year-over-year revenue growth and for the full-year 2017 $11.7 billion in revenue with 15% year-over-year growth. We continue to see solid growth across geographies with our key brands.","REVLIMID and POMALYST\/IMNOVID demonstrated robust growth through increases in both market share and duration. We expect several key Phase 3 data readouts in 2018 for our in-line brands, including REVLIMID in lymphoma, POMALYST in second line plus myeloma and ABRAXANE in adjuvant pancreatic cancer.","In terms of our pipeline compounds, the luspatercept Phase 3 programs in low-risk MDS and beta-thalassemia will read out later this year as well the Phase 3 results for CC-486 in AML. We are making excellent progress with the advancement and expansion of our pipeline programs. Starting with CAR T, bb2121 was granted breakthrough designation in the U.S and prime eligibility in Europe in Q4. And we also initiated the pivotal KarMMa trial in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma.","We are also very excited about our agreement with Juno Therapeutics announced earlier this week. With expansion of global rights to JCAR017 and the U.S approval expected in 2019 for relapsed refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The addition of fedratinib to our portfolio will allow us to build a leadership position in myelofibrosis, and we\u2019re actively preparing for a midyear FDA submission.","With our early pipeline, we are advancing our newest CELMoD CC-92480 with the Phase 1 trial initiated in relapsed refractory myeloma. We are also initiating a Phase 1 study for CC-93269, our biospecific antibody targeting BCMA.","REVLIMID fourth quarter sales increased 21% year-over-year. In the U.S., the brand grew 24% year-over-year fueled by continued gains and duration and market share. We are seeing a positive impact from the post stem cell transplant maintenance launch and we expect to see continued increases in duration from the front-line use of REVLIMID as well as the use of triplet combination regimens.","Outside of the U.S., REVLIMID sales were robust with 15% year-over-year growth. REVLIMID share in front-line on stem cell transplant patients continues to grow across all reimbursed countries. REVLIMID is also gaining reimbursement in additional markets in the post transplant maintenance setting with positive uptake.","We recently secured reimbursement in Spain and we expect access to additional markets throughout 2018. In terms of future potential growth drivers, we plan to submit an sNDA for RVd for frontline multiple myeloma in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2018.","Beyond multiple myeloma, we await the results of our R-squared trials augment and robust in 2018 in lymphoma. We also expect Phase 3 data readout for ongoing studies utilizing REVLIMID-based triplet regimens in the front-line setting throughout 2018.","POMALYST\/IMNOVID net sales continued to grow with 17% year-over-year growth. In the U.S., POMALYST net sales grew 29% year-over-year driven by duration and share gains. We continue to see a strong increase in demand since the U.S approval of the triplet regimen, POMALYST in combination with daratumumab and dexamethasone for relapsed refractory myeloma. Just as with REVLIMID, we expect to see additional POMALYST share and duration gains through the use of triplet regimens.","Outside of the U.S., POMALYST\/IMNOVID revenue was stable, whereas growth and volume was up 15% year-on-year. The triplet option of PVd will be an important future driver and we expect the results of the optimism trial in the first half of this year.","ABRAXANE continues to maintain stable demand overall with full-year 2017 net sales of approximately $1 billion with 2% year-over-year growth. And we look forward to data readouts later in 2018 for the APACT adjuvant pancreatic cancer trial as well as the pivotal I\/O ABRAXANE-elotuzumab combination trials in non-small cell lung cancer and triple negative breast cancer.","We are very excited about the addition of fedratinib to our portfolio. There's a large unmet need in myelofibrosis with only one agent currently approved. Fedratinib is a highly selective JAK2 inhibitor with potential clinical utility in patients who are resistant or intolerant to REVLIMID.","Fedratinib complements our ongoing myelofibrosis program, which includes key molecules such as luspatercept, and we've already seen encouraging preclinical activity with fedratinib in combination with multiple molecules in the Celgene early pipeline.","Currently a significant segment of patients approximately 40% are not eligible to receive ruxolitinib due to progression on treatment or low platelet counts. These patients would be available immediately at launch for treatment with fedratinib. We believe fedratinib represents a significant opportunity for patients and has the potential to be a $1 billion blockbuster for Celgene.","The acquisition of Juno Therapeutics will strengthen our position as a leader in cellular immunotherapy and would allow us to capitalize on future advances in this important scientific field. JCAR017 is an anchor asset which would allow us to establish a global leadership position in lymphoma with a potential best-in-class profile.","We plan to develop JCAR017 in second line and third line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma as well as CLL, yielding a global peak revenue estimate of approximately $3 billion. JCAR017, in addition to our existing lead asset bb2121 partnered with bluebird biosciences, represent two potential best-in-class assets which could completely disrupt the treatment of lymphoma and multiple myeloma as we understand it today.","Other assets in the Juno portfolio include the BCMA directed CAR T asset, JCAR125, which will further enhance Celgene's broad campaign against BCMA, a key target in multiple myeloma. Additional cellular therapy assets are currently in early phase trials for solid tumors and will complement Celgene's existing pipeline of next generation immuno-oncology molecules.","In summary, the hematology and oncology franchise delivered a strong quarter. We continue to deliver robust sales growth and made significant progress with our pipeline. The promise of our pipeline is delivering with near-term Phase 3 data readouts for luspatercept in low-risk MDS and beta-thalassemia, as well as CC-486 in AML.","Additional pipeline assets will enter into pivotal programs this year such as BGB-A317, marizomib, luspatercept and CC-122. The addition of fedratinib will build a leadership position for Celgene in myelofibrosis. Our CAR T program with bb2121 and JCAR017 are moving rapidly towards registration, and will strengthen Celgene's position as a leader in the rapidly advancing field of cellular immunotherapy.","Thank you and I will now turn the call over to Terrie.","Terrie Curran","Thank you, Nadim and good morning. 2017 was a very good year for Celgene I&I, highlighted in Q4 by strong net sales growth and progress against our strategic priorities. OTEZLA has now established a solid foundation in a pre-biologic setting, resulting in a substantial increase in utilization in both the U.S and key international markets.","In addition, we\u2019ve made significant investments relative to multiple lifecycle opportunities. With Ozanimod we presented the positive results from both Phase 3 studies in relapsing MS and submitted the U.S NDA for FDA approval. We also advanced development of our portfolio of novel oral therapies for the treatment of IBD, initiating Phase 3 development of Ozanimod in Crohn's disease and preparing to initiate the pivotal program for OTEZLA in ulcerative colitis.","Looking specifically at OTEZLA, Q4 sales were $371 million, which represents 20% sequential quarter-on-quarter growth. Full-year sales were $1.28 billion, which represents a 26% year-on-year increase. In the U.S., OTEZLA brand volume has continued to grow faster than the market and despite increased competitive intensity, OTEZLA continues to expand its pre-biologic foundation in the market.","Internationally, we noted an increasing contribution from key markets where a differentiated access position has been secured. In Japan, OTEZLA has already captured 15% market share after only 10 months on the market. Similarly in France, OTEZLA is surpassing competitive benchmarks in its first full-year on the market.","We also look forward to future growth from the development of new indications including the Beh\u00e7et's disease and ulcerative colitis as well as a once-daily formulation. In 2017, OTEZLA demonstrated strong TRx growth in the U.S., driven by compelling brand fundamental.","OTEZLA continues lead in both new-to-brand and overall pre-biologic market share. With a broad access position secured we continue to execute multichannel DTC efforts to position OTEZLA in the pre-biologic post-topical market segment.","As we enter 2018, OTEZLA is poised to serve the growth. It's now estimated that approximately 80% of commercial lives have biologic step free access. In Q1 we expect the normal seasonality that has impacted the psoriasis market in addition to a modest increase in GTN that we anticipate with stabilize throughout the year and be offset by very strong demand.","Turning to Ozanimod, we are highly encouraged by the results we\u2019ve seen today in both SUNBEAM and RADIANCE pivotal trials for RMS. We believe these data support a differentiated clinical profile. We remain focused on preparing for world class launch in the RMS market. We\u2019ve been aggressively expanding our commercial structure across numerous functions and adding important capability in critical areas of market access and patient support services.","We're very pleased with the calibrating experience of the talent we\u2019ve been able to attract and we remain on track for launch readiness by Q4 this year. 2017 was a year of excellent progress and strong growth for the I&I franchise. We remain focused on expanding the pre-biologic market opportunity for OTEZLA. In the year ahead, we are set to capitalize on several upcoming growth drivers, activating broader utilization in psoriasis, more convenient dosing, as well as expansion into new disease areas like Behcet's and ulcerative colitis.","With Ozanimod we are planning to secure FDA approval in RMS by year-end and to submit international registration dossiers in 2018 starting with Europe in Q1. Taking to fully maximize the Ozanimod opportunity in MS, we plan to initiate a pivotal program in secondary progressive MS. This represents an important lifecycle opportunity characterized by high unmet medical need.","For IBD, we plan to complete enrollment of our Phase 3 TRUE NORTH trial in ulcerative colitis and continue to advance the Phase 3 pivotal program for Crohn's disease. It's an exciting time for Celgene I&I. Thank you for your intention. And I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Scott.","Scott A. Smith","Thank you, Terrie. In Q4 we saw strong commercial performance from our inline portfolio, particularly REVLIMID and OTEZLA. We\u2019ve advanced key pipeline assets and importantly expanded patient access to our medications worldwide. Focusing on execution, the NDA for Ozanimod and RMS was submitted on the heels of two positive global Phase 3 studies. We are currently building out a strong neuro inflammation team to execute launches and unlock the value of this important product.","As we move into 2018, we are preparing to submit the NDA for fedratinib in myelofibrosis by midyear. We also see tremendous opportunities to continue to develop both OTEZLA and Ozanimod as platform molecules across several indications. For OTEZLA, we will be submitting an sNDA for Beh\u00e7et's disease, finalizing enrollment in the pivotal scalp psoriasis study and initiating a pivotal trial in UC.","Now turning to Ozanimod, again we see tremendous lifecycle opportunities as we complete enrollment for our Phase 3 UC study and we will initiate pivotal programs in both Crohn's disease and SPMS in 2018. We continue to aggressively execute on our strategy of adding meaningful assets and bringing medical innovation to patients worldwide.","JCAR017 together with BGB-A317 and fedratinib represent three late stage products added to the pipeline in the last nine months. Our pending acquisition of Juno Therapeutics and strong ongoing collaboration with bluebird on bb2121 will help Celgene become the preeminent cellular immunotherapy company. These products together with Ozanimod, luspatercept, and others could yield over $16 billion in incremental peak revenue through 2030.","We're very excited to build up the momentum from the inline products in Q4, execute against the late stage pipeline programs and continue to be aggressively looking for opportunities to add transformational assets to our growing portfolio. In 2017, greater than half a million patients were prescribed at least one of our therapies and we look to continue to expand their impact on human health in 2018 beyond.","I'd now like to turn over the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore. Your line is now open.","Umer Raffat","Thanks so much for taking my question. I have two quick ones. Perhaps, the first one as you guys have obviously diligenced all the JCAR017 data in a lot of detail. One of the questions I've had is how has the CRS and neurotox rates changed when you look at the first batch of patients versus the next batch of patients versus subsequent batch of patients? I\u2019m just curious what type of progression and the rates are you seeing if you look at these patients in completely different batches and then pull it all up very curious for what trend you saw there, one. And then, secondly, perhaps the quick one on one on the CELMoD that was being tried in myeloma CC-122, I didn\u2019t noticed that from slides anymore. So I was curious what the status is there, if that\u2019s the program in development myeloma still or not? Thank you.","Jay Backstrom","So, hi, this is Jay Backstrom. So for the first question with respect to the CNS in the neurotox across JCAR017, I think we've been able to see over time that the profile has been reasonably consistent as we see across. I think the effort on JCAR017 and understanding that has been quite good. So really haven't seen any major changes with -- from first -- the subsequent batches or patients being treated.","Nadim Ahmed","And Umer, it's Nadim. I will take the second part of your question, which was CC-122. So I think based on kind of emerging profile, our view now is that this is CELMoD that works best in lymphoma and so our future development programs will incorporate CC-122 in lymphoma. Reminder, we continue to look at CC-220 in multiple myeloma and our new CELMoD CC-92480. But 122 is being targeted for lymphoma for further development.","Umer Raffat","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Michael Yee","Thanks so much. Regarding the strategic potential for the Juno deal and your strategy in cell therapy, maybe you can just talk about what type of synergies you can derive as you have a partnership with bluebird. And previously you\u2019ve said you can't share information there. Can you just maybe clarify or talk about how you could lever to those two and whether there's opportunities, whether that's commercially, whether that's cost-saving, whether that's manufacturing, maybe just talk a little bit about how you think about those two partnerships and one of them being an acquisition. Thanks.","Mark J. Alles","Hi. It\u2019s Mark. Thanks for the question. Just starting with our partnership with bluebird bio as we've mentioned now several times this week and today, it is a very, very important partnership. We're advancing bb2121 very rapidly to the market. I will remind investors that the entire cohort of patients in clinical development, the manufacturing of bb2121 is happening by Celgene in support of the program. We're extremely, extremely proud of it, excited about it. We think as the Nadim said in his prepared remarks that 2121 is a disruptive technology and therapy for patients, particularly with relapsed myeloma. And so we will protect it, we will build around it as we need to and are required to, but we see that as a standalone dynamic very critical program for our future. I\u2019m going to turn the rest of the description over to Scott.","Scott A. Smith","Yes, just a follow-up. Thank you, Mark. Just to follow-up on Mark, bb2121, one of the really critical programs. We are continuing to advance it very aggressively. There have been just from the investments we made in New Jersey manufacturing facilities, we\u2019ve dosed now over 40 patients with product here made in New Jersey for bb2121. Specific to the relationship and synergy, nothing really changes. There was a partnership that existed before this deal with Juno and with bluebird. The partnership has changed in structure, but there were firewalls in place and the fundamental synergies that existed in areas that we couldn't discuss still remain the same post-acquisition.","Michael Yee","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey Meacham","Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for the question. Just had a few quick ones. The first one is how critical is REVLIMID broadly in lymphoma to the 2020 guidance or the long-term picture? It just seems to me that we had JCAR017, you have better strategies in lymphoma, which actually diversify REVLIMID. And the second question just on I&I, the Ozanimod study in SPMS, it's new tough indication now and I think GILENYA hasn\u2019t had -- hasn't -- didn\u2019t have much success in PPMS, which is somewhat related. So just curious how you guys are thinking about the study vis-\u00e0-vis patient selection. And are there other opportunities that you see in neurology for Ozanimod? Thank you.","Mark J. Alles","Geoff, thanks for your question. I will hand all kind of how we are thinking about lymphoma and then Pete can talk a little bit about the revenue beyond 2020. So our view and I think this is part of what we talked about JCAR017. Our view is that REVLIMID is essentially our entry point into lymphoma and an entry point for which we want to build a leadership position around. So we have a long-term view of lymphoma where JCAR017 form the anchor molecule. In terms of our 2020 guidance, I\u2019m going to turn that back over to Peter.","Peter N. Kellogg","Sure. Thanks, Geoff. So as you know we have --- we gave a high and low end of the range for 2020 revenue and some of the moving parts in there do include some of the additional indications for REVLIMID. So at this point really there is no change in our thinking at all. We still have some trials to come through. As you know, 2020 are really targets and we're seeing it with a lot of different ways things can come through, so we feel very good. Obviously, we took the opportunity to refine them in the fall and we feel very good about them right now. Clearly, while they -- may well be revenue contribution that\u2019s additive from the Juno partnership in 2020, we haven't updated our targets yet, because there's still basically what we\u2019re shooting for, but clearly the Juno and the whole cellular immunotherapy space is all about after 2020 and I think that's really what we'd encourage you to think about is just what kind of potential this technology and these assets across the board can contribute when you get out to the mid-part of the next decade and we're very excited about developing that we see as Mark and Nadim have said, enormous breakthroughs in the science and what the potential is for a treatment of patients. And so, that's really what our focus has been on that. On the Ozanimod question, I will pass it over to Terrie.","Terrie Curran","Thanks, Geoff for the question. You\u2019re right. I mean, in the SPMS specification, there has been a large number of failures. I mean, that has given the team an opportunity to really do some deep analysis and take a look at the trial design, and particularly the patient types and the power of the studies have influenced the outcome of those trial. So taking that into account the team has been able to design trials that are powered over a length of time with particular patient type that will hopefully give us positive outcome. We are still in discussion with authorities, so you have to communicate the actual trial design, and we're continuing to review additional neurological indications for Ozanimod.","Geoffrey Meacham","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Yatin Suneja with SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Mark J. Alles","Yes, let's go then -- go to the next caller please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.","Eric Schmidt","Thanks for taking the question, especially ahead of Yatin's question. Just kidding. We took note of the Phase 2 OTEZLA, UC abstract, that\u2019s -- I guess, now out and available on the ECCO Web site. Maybe you guys could just talk about how -- perhaps you can give the overall thoughts on the data, but more specifically how this drug differentiates itself for might be position relative to Ozanimod obviously having two assets in the series, good thing, but are there patient populations you think one might be better suited for use in? Thank you.","Terrie Curran","Thanks for the question, Eric. Yes, we\u2019re really excited with the data that we saw in Phase 2 for OTEZLA. I mean, within this disease area, there's really a high unmet need with patients that are really quite sick and being treated with CNS. And OTEZLA really presents a unique opportunity. It's an RO compound with a very compelling safety profile. In terms of the positioning versus Ozanimod, the two trials really look to different patient population. With OTEZLA, we look to naive patient population whereas Ozanimod, the patients were largely treated with CNS. So as you mentioned, it will be great to have two RO compounds in this category when potentially we could utilize their monotherapy or in combination. So wait to see as the data emerges and how we position the two, but very excited to have two -- potentially two efficacious RO compounds to treat UC.","Eric Schmidt","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes the line of Geoffrey Porges with Leerink. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey Porges","Thanks very much. Peter, just like to ask a question about the outlook for the Juno acquisition. I know you haven't sort of closed the acquisition or formally given any guidance, but clearly initially at least the CAR T programs you\u2019re going to have the inferior margin profile and you\u2019re going to take on a significant amount of overhead with that acquisition. So just wondering if you could give us a sense of do you think that the 58% operating margin performance that you achieved in 2017 is achievable again in the future after you incorporate Juno and complete the acquisition? And if so, how long that might take to be restored? Thanks.","Peter N. Kellogg","Thanks, Geoff. Actually that\u2019s a great question, because as I mentioned, if you just do the math for this year and we indicated on the call earlier this week, that if you just do the math and you assume some level of financing, it's in the neighborhood of $0.50 diluted this year, which obviously will take our operating margin down little bit versus our guidance for '18. We are going to update that when we close, because it really is sensitive too. It's a partial year impact, so we have to know exactly when we close and then we will evaluate the financing based on how the debt markets appear and we can do less or more debt. Quite frankly, we are in very strong cash position. So those will be the things to refine our final outlook for this year. When you think about the margin though, you're right. So it will cause the margin to step back a smidge in the '18 timeframe, but then I think you'll see us kind of growing right back again with the continued leverage, while its -- we\u2019re very excited about it. In the next couple of years it's actually a very small element in our overall P&L. So we'd be going right back and we probably expect to still be getting close to 60% by 2020. So it's a great question is that while there will be a little bit of a step back, we\u2019re going to be growing right again as we go into 2019 on a margin basis and into 2020. So you're right. It's just a small refinement, but instantly when we originally gave our 2020 guidance, we said we'd be up around in the high 50s getting close to 60 by the time it get to 2020 and actually with this acquisition now we're probably on track for that still, which is great.","Geoffrey Porges","Terrific. Thanks very much.","Peter N. Kellogg","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Terence Flynn","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe, Peter, can you just comment on your thoughts on capital allocation here post Juno, maybe just willingness to lever up more significantly to do another Juno sizer larger deal and how to think about the path on repurchases on a go forward basis? I know ahead of Juno you\u2019ve talked about maintaining a pretty aggressive pace here, but maybe help us think about the pace of repurchases? Thanks.","Peter N. Kellogg","Sure. So, yes, I\u2019m going to actually tag team with my -- with Jonathan Biller, who is here with me, who heads our Tax and Treasury working. He actually was as you know really our point person on a lot of the tax reform activity and which in some way he is actually while we just on the Juno transaction we\u2019ve also just had tax reform which in a sense opens our capacity a bit and quite frankly has -- while it had an impact in Q4 on the GAAP basis. It's really a favorable thing for companies like ours that are U.S based, but operate around the world. So this is something we worked hard on for -- I want to say 5, 6, 7 years, Jonathan. So it's really been a great impact. As you saw -- I will just start and I will pass to Jonathan little bit. As you saw last year, we we're very selective about when the timing of when we're doing share repurchase during the first few quarters we didn't buy a lot with the volatility we saw in the fourth quarter, we actually stepped up our purchase activity quite a bit. And yet while that was in a sense on a full-year basis landed us above where we expect it to be anyway, that was pretty much in line -- in our final share count and it has pretty much which we\u2019re aiming for to the average -- weighted average share count for the year is about what we had in our plan. It was great, because on a weighted average basis we bought our shares at a much lower price and that was probably good planning. But in many ways that's in a sense part of the capacity and the thinking of the company all along, but really in no ways that hold us back from doing strategic investments for our future. That is our number one priority. It has been -- it will continue to be. Sometimes people ask us, have you done enough and our answer would be, our focus is on the science as science continues to evolve, as good work comes along, we're going to keep going after it, because it's not like we have like a decision that oh, we\u2019ve done enough BD [ph] and that we're done. We are going to keep dialing this in and using our resources to make sure we're in the forefront of everything that\u2019s evolving not just for this year, but for the years ahead. That said, people sometimes ask you hey, how do you think about capacity? What could you do and how does that evolve over time and if I could I would just like to ask Jonathan to just make a few comments in that regard in terms of how we look at it and how that evolves over time.","Jonathan Biller","Sure. Thanks, Peter. It's a great question, Terence. So if you look at our current situation, at our current target credit rating with our growing EBITDA, and then the benefit of tax reform with the ongoing access to offshore cash, we will maintain significant financial flexibility and potential leverage if we needed as well as the cash flow post closing the Juno acquisition. So we really remain in a great place to be able to take advantage of opportunities to make investments -- external investments that can help us grow beyond 2020, and at the same time still maintain share repurchase program consistent with our historic practice. We can do both of those things. So we really remain in a very good place and that's largely due to the access to offshore cash.","Mark J. Alles","Operator, we\u2019re ready for the next caller, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Salim Syed with Mizuho. Your line is now open.","Salim Syed","Yes, hi. Great, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So, I had maybe one for Terrie and one for Nadim or Mark. For Terrie, Terrie could you just outline a little bit for us how you\u2019re thinking about or maybe this more a Peter question, BD within neurology, specifically which areas of neurology would you guys be interested in going down? And then the -- and then for Nadim or Mark, can you confirm that you're not de-prioritizing the BCMA that you got from Juno please? Thank you.","Rupert Vessey","Hi, Salim. It's Rupert Vessey here. I will take the question on BD. So we have formed a small internal team that's very expert in neuroscience and the areas that we've been focusing on leveraging our strengths in protein homeostasis, last year you\u2019re aware that we formed relationship with Evotec that was looking at that angle for neurodegenerative disease. And then also we really see ourselves as a immunology expert company for obvious reasons and as you\u2019re aware neuro inflammation is a key cause of neurodegenerative disease and we\u2019re in the process of evaluating approaches for that angle of therapy as well. Salim, I will take the second part of your question, on JCAR125. So just kind of reiterate bb2121 continues to be one of the highest priorities in the company and we\u2019re rapidly progressing our clinical development plan around that. JCAR125 adds to a very broad campaign talked in BCMA. As you know we have multiple antibodies, too. So, the thing to remember is a patient hasn\u2019t been dosed to JCAR125 yet. So we\u2019re going to get it quickly into the clinic. We will see the data, we will see the emerging profile, but our plan is to get JCAR125 also into the clinic and rapidly build a development plan around it also. So definitely no de-prioritizing. In fact, if further enhances our overall BCMA campaign.","Salim Syed","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adnan Butt with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.","Adnan Butt","Hi. Thanks for the question. On fedratinib, could you expand on what your filing strategy is? Would you be filing for a broad label or for treatment experience label, then your $1 billion estimate is that U.S or U.S and AU, thanks.","Mark J. Alles","Thanks for your question, Adnan. We have two studies already today. So one is a randomized Phase 3 study in the front-line setting. There is a Phase 2 study in that kind of second line plus setting and so I think we\u2019re going to pull the NDA submission together and then what the actual label will be -- with the result of discussions with the agency, Adnan. And then in terms of your question around the revenue, the $1 billion plus is based on a global revenue forecast.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alethia Young with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Alethia Young","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe two for Terrie. One, just around the U.S., can you talk about some of the marketing works that you\u2019ve been doing with OTEZLA, maybe in psoriasis and psoriatic and then also as far as the OTEZLA enrollment goes, during a further color you can give us there, kind of about the progress that you\u2019re making so far. Thanks.","Terrie Curran","Sure. Thanks for the question Alethia, I think overall within really pleased with the momentum of the U.S business both its psoriasis and PSA. If you look at some of the underlying kind of key driver. The business is performing really well. If you look at some of the marketing activities that have been driving that, we are really been focusing on executing very strong, DCC campaign. Multichannel campaign. But in the U.S it will outside of the U.S. It's really kind of activate that pre-biologic post topical segment and there is 50% of psoriasis patients that diagnosed were actually untreated and we really say that\u2019s a significant opportunity for OTEZLA both in the U.S and outside of the U.S. In terms of the Q1 dynamics, while we see that demand continuing as Peter mentioned in his comments, we do see some kind of seasonality in Q1 as well as a minor impact of GTM as we continue to contract in the U.S. As a reminder, we entered into a number of significant contracts in '17, we\u2019re entering '18, they\u2019re really solid position with 80% of commercial lives having biologic step free access to OTEZLA. So again that\u2019s really strategic and important for OTEZLA, because that\u2019s where we want to position in that pre-biologic post topical segment. In addition to the DTC work that we\u2019re doing, we\u2019re also focusing on in-office promotion as well as significant engagement with the KOL, both in the U.S and outside of the U.S. Outside of the U.S., we had really the second full launch in some of the core markets and performing exceptionally well in countries like Japan as well as France where we\u2019ve a very broad reimbursement and access position. So we\u2019re excited about that. To answer your second question, regarding UC and its enrollment we do see that the UC enrollment for Ozanimod has accelerated this year and we expect to complain enrollment of that trial by year end, so that\u2019s on track.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Cory Kasimov","Hey, good morning, guys and thanks for taking my question. I guess, I wanted to follow up on the fedratinib question and based on the data that\u2019s been generated to date you see this product as better suited to take share and that 20% of patients in the second line, that\u2019s failed Jakafi or the 20% of my patients that aren't really qualified given the low platelets or its really intensive equally support between the two. And then as you prepare for the submission of potential launch of this drug. To what extend will you be able to leverage your existing sales force to market it or you need to augment marketing organization to some degree? Thanks.","Mark J. Alles","Thanks for your question, Cory. So on the first point, I think, we believe because a significant market both in the post ruxolitinib failure setting and also in the segment that\u2019s either intolerant too or has underlying thrombocytopenia such that they can't receive ruxolitinib. So we\u2019re going for both of those segments in terms of how we\u2019re thinking about the actual clinical utility of fedratinib. The other thing to remember and as I referred to early, we also have multiple assets in our portfolio that could be great combination place that attack the disease from a multimodality perspective. So luspatercept for example have the opportunity to attack with the anemic components of the disease. So we\u2019re very, very excited about the opportunity for fedratinib as a monotherapy, but also as a combination therapy to address this disease. In terms of your second point, we already as you know have a global myeloid footprint. So we see fedratinib as an easy plug and play situation for us across the world in our heartland of hematology.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kripa Devarakonda with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Srikripa Devarakonda","Yes, it's [technical difficulty] from Citi. Just a question big picture. It sounds like you now have JCAR017 which is helping the U.S refractory DLBCL and move up that line and then you have your BCMA suite. And I want to get a sense of do you need the CELMoD to do more for multiple myeloma? Where do they fit in? And then when you think about these markets as you\u2019re entering a refractory market, how big is that refractory market today and how do we model that, say, in10 years as, I think, you\u2019re saying that lot of it will impact 2030. How big will that market be do you think in 10 years? Thanks.","Mark J. Alles","So let's start with the CELMoD question first. So, absolutely there is a role for new CELMoDs in multiple myeloma. It was the same situation when we launched REVLIMID. POMALYST came immediately after. The disease has many unmet needs and that\u2019s why we\u2019re continuing to progress CC-220, we are continuing to progress our brand new CELMoD CC-92480. So there is an absolute role for new CELMoDs, again as single agents, but also a combination place. In terms of the refractory and I think you\u2019re probably referring to lymphoma, but it sounds that refractory population. If you think about diffuse large B-cell lymphoma today in that relapse refractory setting. It's very much an acute disease. That\u2019s why we feel that JCAR017 offers a very disruptive approach to that treatment. So that we enhanced curates. We turn the disease from an acute situation to chronocity. And so, with that the prevalence of this disease will continue to expand ongoing year-after-year which is why we feel very good about our current revenue estimate for JCAR017.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Ian Somaiya","Thanks. I had a question for Terrie. This is in regard to the OTEZLA UC data. Just looking at the trial design, you\u2019ve a 12-week primary endpoint, you have a 52-week follow-up, just trying to -- I was hoping you could speak to what we should expect from at the time the data release. And the decision to move into Phase 3 trials, is purely based on the week 12 data or were you able to look at the 52 follow-up in these patients, especially with the endoscopy results?","Terrie Curran","We are really encouraged with both the 12-week data as well as the long-term data across -- the totality of the data really enables us to make a decision to move forward. It was really very positive and very compelling across all endpoints.","Ian Somaiya","Great.","Patrick E. Flanigan","Next caller please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Ying Huang","Thanks for taking my question. I have a question on your business development philosophy. The Juno acquisition probably will give you more like mid-term to a long-term growth. So the next acquisition you do, would you focus somewhat more near-term revenue growth opportunity or still more longer-term? And then, maybe a question on the share repurchase. If I do my math right, Peter, I think you purchased about $3 billion in fourth quarter. Is that more opportunistic given the stock price or is that going to be kind of like the new run rate for 2018 as well? You\u2019re going to consider a pretty significant share buyback in this year?","Peter N. Kellogg","Hi, Ying. It's Peter. Let me take these -- first on the BD philosophy. Look, as I said earlier we don\u2019t necessarily like zero in on short-term versus medium term. We really are driven by the science. I mean, obviously if we can buy a commercial asset or a Phase 3 asset that's great. They\u2019re hard to find and -- but more importantly we're looking for opportunities. We are not trying to plug any holes kind of the next few years at all. We are in great shape in terms of our growth potential and the momentum we have. What we really need to do is make sure where as I said earlier on the front here on science, on the really innovations that are coming in the areas of science that we work and that can really make a difference in the whole next decade. So we like to see high potential with a lot of optionality that has long IT and very strong science behind it. So, I don't know that we sit around saying let's plug the hole here and there, we don\u2019t really think that way. We think about where is the high potential assets. So the next thing we do will be really based on the science and the opportunity and the potential for it to make a big difference on our long-range plan. Relative to the share repurchase in the fourth quarter, you're right. That was a large activity, but our stock was really in a different spot during the fourth quarter, so we saw it as a great opportunity. For the full-year, we ended up at about $3.9 billion or close to $4 billion and that's not really out of line with what we\u2019ve done in past years. Obviously, we\u2019re growing our capacity and so on. So, I wouldn't assume that every quarter you\u2019re going to see us clicking off the exact same amount of share repurchase, because we do design it such that we're responsive and taking advantage of the volatility in the overall markets as well as sometimes in our stock. But, in general, I think that we feel like it makes a lot of sense, we run return on invested capital analyses and it's been a fantastic investment in a great way to return cash to shareholders for the company and certainly has been a major contributor to our return on invested capital as a Corporation. So we will continue -- expect to continue to do that as we go forward, but always as we said our first priority is strategic pipeline next-generation. And then our second priority is just make sure we do have a strong financial capacity to return cash to shareholders in the most advantaged way possible.","Ying Huang","Thanks.","Peter N. Kellogg","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Brian Abrahams","Hi. Thanks very much for taking my questions. On Ozanimod and MS, as you process the data and interact around the submissions, just wondering your latest views on the phase case for potential monitoring requirements there in MS? And then, OTEZLA ex-US., just wondering if there's any opportunity for an inflection in growth in its existing indications or should we be looking for more of a steady climb throughout the course of this year? Thanks.","Terrie Curran","Yes. Thanks for the question, Brian. So this question regarding the base case for Ozanimod. The base case continues to be that we'd have a class label with monitoring. Clearly, from the data we\u2019ve a highly differentiated compound both in terms of efficacy, safety, and tolerability. So we will continue to discuss the potential label with the authorities, but at this case -- at this stage that is the base case. Having said that, we will have the ability to include the data within the label and differentiate this with the competition. In terms of ex-US OTEZLA sales, as I mentioned earlier, the core markets, the U.K., Germany, France, and Japan are really at the early stage of the launch. And so we do expect the momentum will continue and we do expect to have that kind of an inflection outside of the U.S.","Patrick E. Flanigan","Liz, we have time for two more callers.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with UBS. Your line is now open.","Carter Gould","Good morning, guys. One question for Terrie. Obviously, I see you moving OTEZLA into Phase 3 study and mild to moderate psoriasis. This will, obviously, expand the addressable population. From your work, how do you think about the fair challenges and receptiveness from dermatologists to moving that trigger point earlier and starting a systemic agent and to what extent was this baked in when you made your concessions on pricing for better positioning earlier this year -- earlier or last year? Thank you.","Terrie Curran","Yes. Yes, so I think, I mean, especially if you look at the unmet need, there clearly is a need for therapy like OTEZLA to mild to moderate disease. 60% of patients that are diagnosed with psoriasis are untreated. So there is an opportunity there for a compound like OTEZLA. In terms of the pricing, we need to kind of see the full totality of that data and then look at the value that brings to patients. That wasn\u2019t at all considered when we took the price concession early that -- this year. That was really -- the strategy there was to really enable access to the existing patients that are covered within our label. And as I mentioned earlier, we now have a -- really solid position in the U.S rates. Patients don\u2019t have to step through a biologics.","Carter Gould","Thank you.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Matthew Harrison","Great. Thanks for taking the question and thanks for fitting me in. Peter, I was just hoping, you\u2019ve obviously talked about missing these dynamics year-over-year where first quarter was impacted. You highlighted ABRAXANE, OTEZLA, which we saw last year and donut hole. Can you just sort of dimensionalize for us versus what we saw last year which I think some of the downward trends maybe surprising for people, just how you\u2019re --what you\u2019re seeing shape up now through January and how you\u2019re expecting gross to net impacts in the first quarter? Thanks.","Mark J. Alles","Hey, Matt, its Mark Alles. Let me just take the last part of your question about momentum. As we discussed on the call, I think quite nicely fourth quarter was a strong quarter for the company with a lot of momentum and a lot of strategic progress. We've seen through the early part of January that momentum continuing. So I would argue that the quarter is off to a good start, but it's early. Peter?","Peter N. Kellogg","Yes. And I think as you said, we always do see a couple of these impacts in our P&L, so really want to make the comments that I made. I\u2019m just reminding everybody that just as you think about as you work for your own models, remember Q1 is always a little soft. We feel very good about the momentum. Beginning of the year, we certainly feel good about our plan for the full-year. This year, actually I think we're going to have a very good year here, but that said it's always Q1 that we\u2019ve to remind everybody, hey be careful, because you do have these different dynamics in the U.S healthcare system where you end up with donut hole payments for REV and POM, Abraxane always show some seasonality. It happens every year. You see its softer in the first quarter and then OTEZLA -- yes, I think last year we spent a lot of time talking about the first quarter and it was kind of a market-wide psoriasis market dynamics that affected OTEZLA as well. Now as Terrie said, really this year on the gross to net side there's always a little bit of an effect, but it's nothing like we saw last year. So really we already had contracted most of the market and as Terrie said it's been very successful in terms of getting us away from all these biologic step at its first, so it's a great breakthrough for patients. So thanks a lot for the question. And I guess we're coming up on the end of the hour. We already are so. I want to thank everybody. I feel like you\u2019ve heard from us a lot lately. We\u2019ve been at JPMorgan. We talked to everybody. We had a call earlier this week. We are very excited about where we\u2019re going here. We\u2019ve a lot of financial capacity. We are in really instinct areas the science, we have great products in our pipeline coming through. I think we\u2019re headed for a very exciting time period and we really appreciate your support and look forward to working with everybody going forward and certainly we're excited about how Q1 in this year looks rough.

Bob will add his perspective on our outlook before we open the call for your questions.","The six regulatory approvals for REVLIMID, POMALYST, ABRAXANE and OTEZLA are among the most notable accomplishments in the first quarter. We have continued to leverage the significant investments in clinical trials made over many years to enhance the value propositions of our therapies.","These approvals provide an important new treatment options with thousands of patients and they created new commercial opportunities that represents some of the most important drivers of our financial outlook from now until 2020.","The REVLIMID newly diagnosed multiple myeloma approvals in United States and Europe are, of course, critical as they further strengthen the position of REVLIMID as the backbone of treatment for myeloma.","We also made excellent progress in the first quarter building for the future. In addition to advancing the comprehensive clinical development program for GED-0301 in Crohn's disease, we added exciting new opportunities to our robust internal and external pipeline that have the potential to make an increasingly meaningful difference in lives of patients and to contribute to our long-term growth.","Our recently announced strategic collaboration with AstraZeneca strengthens our competitive position in the rapidly emerging and evolving immuno-oncology market. To-date, we have been opportunistic, anchoring the clinical advantages of ABRAXANE and REVLIMID in combination studies with T-cell checkpoint inhibitors across tumor types and with several different partners.","This new collaboration with AstraZeneca gives us the unique opportunity to actively drive the development and commercialization of the anti-PD-L1 axis inhibitor MEDI4736 as monotherapy and with our existing commercial and emerging clinical therapies in Hematology, a core area of strength.","To further advance our leadership in the field of epigenetics, we completed a definitive share purchase agreement with our partner Quanticel committing to an acquisition that bring Quanticel\u2019s proprietary platform for single-cell genomic analysis of cancer stem cells and their development programs targeting histone methyltransferase into our research organization.","We extended our partnership with Agios by exercising our option to an exclusive license outside the United States for AG-120, a drug targeting mutant IDH1 in patients with AML, glioma and selective sarcomas.","We also entered into a new joint worldwide development and commercialization program for AG-881, Agios' IDH1 and IDH2 inhibitor that has shown in preclinical models to fully penetrate the blood brain barrier.","In Q1 we advanced our biologics program initiating a Phase 1 trial in multiple myeloma and solid tumors with CC-90002, our antibody targeting CD47 receptor on tumor cells. Additional early trials with CC-486 were initiated and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, metastatic breast cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma.","Taken together, our immuno-oncology programs now reflect the comprehensive strategy, testing IMiDs and related [cerrabon] [ph] modulators, rational combinations with T-cell checkpoint inhibitors in solid tumors and with MEDI4736 in Hematology, programs directed at amplifying innate anti-tumor immunity, combinations of CC-486 deploying epigenetic priming and engineered T-cells.","These and many other develop reflect our commitment to medical innovation and sustaining long-term growth and are supported by the operational excellence and high-quality financial results that we delivered in the first quarter.","I would like to close my remarks by thanking our global teams for their outstanding working and committed to patients. And I'll now turn the call over to Peter, who will provide additional details on our financial results. Thank you.","Peter Kellogg","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As Mark mentioned, we are off to a very strong start this year. Our key products are growing significantly. We added new topline drivers with several global approvals across the portfolio, all of which we expect will sustain our momentum well into the future.","While we are focused on delivering current performance, we continue to invest the long-term. The deals we announced this month add to the growing pipeline of partnered and internal programs that represent the next-generation of growth drivers at Celgene. Today we have over 50 unique programs advancing through various stages of preclinical and clinical development.","Now investing for the future is a high priority for the company and given the strength of our financial performance, we are able to strike a balance between making these critical investments for the future and returning capital back to shareholders through the share repurchase program.","Now turning to the first quarter results, total net product sales grew 20.4% to approximately $2.1 billion. This growth accelerated from prior period and was driven by continued strong growth in REVLIMID in addition to the ongoing launches of POMALYST\/IMNOVID, ABRAXANE in pancreatic cancer and OTEZLA.","Volume accounted for 19.3 percentage points of the growth, while the modest contribution from price was partially offset by foreign exchange. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar drove a negative Forex impact of approximately $27 million or a 1.6% negative impact to net product sales growth.","$22 million of this $27 million impacted REVLIMID. Yet, despite this headwind total net REVLIMID sales grew 17% year-over-year to $1.34 billion and was primarily driven by impressive growth within the U.S.","POMALYST\/IMNOVID, ABRAXANE and OTEZLA combined for net sales of $482 million, a 50% increase compared to Q1 last year. These products are performing strongly in the marketplace, and importantly, they are still in relatively early stages of their global launches.","Now in looking at the sequential performance, as I mentioned on the fourth quarter earnings call, REVLIMID and POMALYST are always impacted in Q1 by higher gross to net adjustments related to early Medicare, donut hole and other ACA payments.","It also note -- worth noting that the Forex impact on REVLIMID between Q4 and Q1 was a negative $10 million. In addition, customer buying patterns negatively impacted ABRAXANE by approximately $12 million to $14 million. Now Jackie, Scott will provide additional color on the underlying product dynamics later in the call.","This robust topline product performance drove an adjusted earnings per share of $1.07, a 29% year-over-year increase and in acceleration from prior periods as we continue to deliver -- P&L.","Year-over-year, the adjusted operating margin improved 190 basis points to 52.4%. The improvement came primarily to the SG&A line as strong G&A leverage continues and we're beginning to see sales and marketing leverage from the investments made in prior years, and we expect that leverage will grow throughout the remainder of the year.","Combined R&D and SG&A expenses grew $119 million or 15% year-over-year, reflecting our continued investments to advance our very strong pipeline and support the global product launches.","Sequentially adjusted operating margin improved 280 basis points, but was favorably impacted by higher spending Q4 related to collaboration related payments, increase participation at fourth quarter medical conferences and the timing of clinical trial activity.","Going forward, we expect the pace of R&D spend to increase, due to clinical trial activity and collaboration-related expenses. We continue to expect the adjusted operating margin for the full year to be approximately 52%.","Our adjusted earnings quality remains strong and operating income accounted for $0.21 per share of the year-over-year increase and the financial levers modestly contributed remaining $0.03 per share.","We ended the quarter with $7.3 billion in cash and marketable securities of which approximately 85% is located outside the U.S. The cash flow from operations was $858 million.","During Q1, we repurchased approximately $1.1 billion in shares. Now the pace of our repurchases can fluctuate throughout the year as we prioritize our capital allocation across internal investments and external opportunities. However, we do remain committed to returning excess capital to shareholders through the repurchase program.","To complete the financial picture, we assess return on invested capital both with and without cash in the capital base. The trend for both metrics shows a competitive return that improves overtime. This gives us confidence that we are making the right strategic investments to generate long-term value for our shareholders.","So to summarize, the financial and operating momentum in Q1 provides a very strong foundation for the full year. We are well on track to achieve our net product sales guidance of $9 billion to $99.5 billion and with the additional new R&D investments associated with maximizing the opportunities with AstraZeneca, Quanticel and Agios that were announced just this month. We expect to deliver our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.60 to $4.75.","Thank you. A great first -- and now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to my colleague, Jackie.","Jackie Fouse","Thank you, Peter. Good morning, everyone. The hematology oncology team delivered stellar results across the franchise in Q1. Our overall net sales grew 18% year-over-year, excluding the 1 percentage point negative impact of foreign exchange and REVLIMID grew 19% year-over-year, excluding foreign exchange driven by volume.","For all of our key products, we hit our goals and the regulatory achievements we landed in Q1, set us up well for strong growth to come over the remainder of this year and beyond.","We made great progress, advancing our clinical development pipelines and are moving forward with a number of collaborations in the immuno-oncology space, including the very exciting recently announced partnership with AstraZeneca\/MedImmune. Bob will speak more about in a moment.","REVLIMID is off to an outstanding start to the year. Duration of treatment continues to increase across our key geographies and our market shares are strong across myeloma overall and in the relapsed, refractory setting. We are in launch mode for newly diagnosed multiple myelomas in both the U.S. and Europe, following regulatory approvals during Q1.","We are on the market in the early access countries in Europe and our teams are focused on driving to successful outcomes with our ongoing reimbursement discussions across the other countries in Europe. It is early days for the launches in both the U.S. and Europe and the initial positive commercial momentum in both geographies bodes very well for REVLIMID\u2019s future growth trajectory in newly diagnosed myeloma.","Across both, relapsed refractory and newly diagnosed myeloma, we have significant growth still ahead of us in numerous geographies. We're looking forward to incremental contributions from both Russia and Mexico this year and we will update you on those markets as we roll out our launches in the relapsed, refractory myeloma there.","We are very happy with progress on our REVLIMID\u2019s clinical program in lymphoma, with the last to initiate of our current program of five phase III trials in lymphoma, the robust trials for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma now enrolling. As we will see when I talk about ASCO in a moment, the flash meta-analysis in follicular lymphoma has been accepted for oral presentations and we look forward to that.","To put Q1\u2019s REVLIMID performance in perspective, we grew sequentially about 2% versus Q4 of last year, even with the foreign exchange headwinds. This is our best Q1 over Q4 sequential performance in the past four years. Across all major geographies, our shares are strong and trending upward and duration of treatment continues to increase as well.","In the U.S, REVLIMID hit all time record highs in average daily total RXs and new RXs in Q1. We are in the early days of the newly diagnosed myeloma country launches across Europe and we anticipate significant market share gains in that largely untapped indication over the coming months and years, as we gain reimbursement approvals over time.","We also see incremental share gain opportunities in the U.S. now that we have a broad myeloma label from which to promote the product, with second approval for newly diagnosed myeloma in Japan around the end of this year and then an incremental growth opportunity associated with that indication in Japan, starting in 2016 and beyond.","Finally, we believe the ongoing emergence of triplet regimen data in myeloma, some details of which we should see at ASCO will further support REVLIMID\u2019s backbone position in the treatment paradigm for myeloma and further solidify the product\u2019s market share position and duration gain trajectory.","This summer, we could see the first U.S. regulatory approval in one of these triplet regimens with REVLIMID based backbone therapy. We're extremely pleased with REVLIMID\u2019s strong start to the year and now expect REVLIMID revenues at or above the upper end of our product sales guidance range of $5.6 billion to $5.7 billion.","POMALYST\/IMNOVID's leading position in third line and greater myeloma continues to solidify across multiple geographies. POMALYST share trends in both the U.S. and EU are favorable and duration of treatment has been increasing in the U.S. since launch.","IMNOVID is penetrating rapidly in Europe and we anticipate the same duration trends over time, is what we have seen in U.S. We recently received final regulatory approval for POMALYST in the U.S. based on MM-003, trial data and we received an update to our label that now includes overall survival data.","We also achieved approval for POMALYST in Japan in February about 18 months or so ahead of our original plan and we are now working with the reimbursement authorities there and expect pricing approval in June. Clinical data for POMALYST in combination regimens is emerging and that data will further support the product\u2019s position in the Relapsed Refractory Myeloma segment.","We have phase II combination trials enrolling for POMALYST with checkpoint inhibitors, HVAC inhibitors and proteasome inhibitors and are excited about the prospects for this program.","On this slide, you can see the growth trajectory for POMALYST since our Q1 2013 launch of the product in the U.S. Upon U.S. launch, we saw very rapid uptake and market share gains over the first quarter, five quarters post launch, driven by the medical need for treatment options in the third line and greater setting. We are since seeing more measured but steady share gains coupled with increasing duration of treatment in the U.S.","In the early launched European markets, we're seeing this same pattern as we're just reaching that four to five quarter post launch time point in markets such as Germany. In Q1 in Europe, we had a bit of headwind for IMNOVID, as a result of an increase in the government rebate percentage in the U.K. that took effect January 1st and a delay in uptake in Spain as the regional reimbursement progress has been slower than expected though it is now moving along.","Our Q1 2015 POMALYST\/IMNOVID performance set a new Q1 baseline for the quarter and we see a strong future growth trajectory ahead for the product as it approaches blockbuster status this year. Most major markets in Europe have not yet reached their full first year of sales and we expect reimbursement in Italy, Finland, Ireland and Netherlands over the coming months.","Durations of treatment are also trending up across Europe and have not yet reached the same levels within the U.S. Furthermore, we are very excited about the contributions of POMALYST growth to come from Japan and other markets like Australia and Canada.","Turning to ABRAXANE, overall share trends are positive for ABRAXANE across its indications in the U.S. and Europe as well as Japan, where we are partnered with Tahoe. In combination with gemcitabine, the product has become the standard of care for first-line metastatic pancreatic cancer in the U.S. and we remain in early days of that launch in Europe.","We achieved EU approval for non-small cell lung cancer in February and Germany and Austria are launching in that indication, with other markets to come as we receive reimbursement approvals. We have multiple trials currently enrolling for ABRAXANE, including the phase II triple negative breast cancer trial, the phase III adjuvant AND phase II locally advanced pancreatic trials, as well as the abound program of four trials across various non-small cell lung cancer indications.","We are also extremely excited about the future potential use of ABRAXANE in combination with a variety of checkpoint inhibitor agents and other novel therapies and are working with a number of other companies on combination trials in the immunotherapy arena.","We are off to a great start to 2015 with ABRAXANE and we finished the quarter well on our plans. Well, we saw the usual U.S. customer buying patterns in Q1. Global product demands were very solid in our global Q1 2015 results, compares quite favorably to Q1 from past years.","We have multiple drivers of growth to give ABRAXANE positive momentum for the remainder of this year and into 2016. In the EU, we just received reimbursement approval for pancreatic cancer in Spain and Italy during Q1. We still await approvals in France, Belgium and other EU countries.","The contribution to EU ABRAXANE revenues from non-small cell lung cancer is just beginning and will ramp-up over the course of this year and into next. Because some of these growth drivers are still ahead of us and will impact future years more than this year, we see global ABRAXANE revenues falling in the lower half of our product guidance range of $1 billion to $1.25 billion, while we are highly confident of achieving our target of being within this range. And this year, ABRAXANE will reach blockbuster status.","The future for ABRAXANE is bright and the potential positive impact from ongoing trial of ABRAXANE in combination with immunotherapy agents has not been included in any of our forecast and represents great optionality for the products in the medium to long-term.","We are excited to get your preview of an upcoming medical meetings where our hematology and oncology products and programs will be featured, starting with ASCO. For hematology highlights, we will see updated overall survival data presented from the MMO2O first trial.","The FLASH analysis correlating complete response with progression-free survival will be an oral presentation for first-line follicular lymphoma. Finally, there will be significant data presentations for multiple triplet regimens in myeloma with REVLIMID as the backbone of treatment therapy.","For oncology features, we will seek phase I data on demcizumab, the compound for which we are partnered with OncoMed and we should see additional program details for immunotherapy combination work being done, including ABRAXANE as a component of multiple treatment regimens.","The biannual MDS Foundation Meeting starts today and we are very happy with the expanded presence we have there, covering our myeloid disease franchise. We look forward to data presentations for both sotatercept and luspatercept in MDS, compounds coming from our collaboration with Acceleron.","Together with Acceleron, we have now chosen luspatercept to move forward into a pivotal program in MDS. June's European hematology Association meeting will again feature a strong Celgene presence and we expect a data presentations on a number of our products, including AG-221 for IDH2 mutations coming from our collaborations with Agios.","We recently announced an important new immunotherapy strategic collaboration with AstraZeneca, MedImmune. We are extremely excited to partner with AZ\/MedImmune in this area to aggressively begin our initial focus on a portfolio of clinical development plans for multiple hematological indications, studying AZ\/MedImmune PD-L1 inhibitor, MIDI4736 in novel combination.","We believe this collaboration will lead to expanded opportunities to combine novel assets in hematology. Together, our two companies have a unique portfolio of complementary compounds from which to create multiple development path options to pursue exciting new treatment regimens.","Our initial agreement represents the first waive of development centered on checkpoint inhibition anchored therapy and we look forward to expanding into the subsequent ways of immunotherapy possibilities to come. After making our upfront payment to access AZ\u2019s clinical stage PDL-1 assets, the financial terms of the deal essentially create a 50-50 sharing by our two companies of the PDL1 economics in hematology, thus creating a structure under which both of us are incentivized for maximum success.","At Celgene, our hematology-oncology franchise is off to an excellent start to the year and our continued investment in our pipeline and strategic collaboration like this one with AZ\/MedImmune position us for ongoing success and growth over the very long term.","Thank you very much. Let me now turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Smith","Thank you, Jackie and welcome to everybody on the call. We are off to a very strong start in 2015. Q1 was a quarter full of advancement and accomplishment within the INI franchise.","During this quarter, we saw significant acceleration of prescriptions and revenue for OTEZLA in the U.S. Revenue was $60 million for Q1 and we are well on track to achieve our goals for the year.","Additionally, we received approval in Europe and Australia for both PSA and psoriasis. We are also advancing critical aspects of GED-0301 registration program as well as other key pipeline projects.","Turning now to the U.S. OTEZLA launch, we see continuing strong prescription growth that puts us ahead of all recent launches in the space after 52 weeks of commercialization. The vast majority of use in both PSA and psoriasis is for patients who are coming off non-biologic therapies. Approximately 85% of patients who are initiating OTEZLA were pre-biologic and only 15% were coming to OTEZLA from biologic therapy.","The majority of OTEZLA prescribers have prescribed for multiple patients and despite the highly managed nature of this category, access continues to be favorable with OTEZLA at 99% formulary coverage and 72% of OTEZLA prescriptions successfully fulfilled.","If we look specifically at new-to-brand patient share, you can clearly see that OTEZLA now has the leading share of new patients ahead of all other products, branded or unbranded for both indication. New-to-brand patients are those patients who initiated new therapy in a given month including those who switch, add-on or na\u00efve therapy.","While new-to-brand patients represent only 10% of the market in any one month, market share leadership in this area is a very strong leading indicator of future growth and also shows the tremendous potential for OTEZLA in PSA and psoriasis. The early launch dynamics are strong in countries that have launched outside of U.S. as well in Canada. After only four moths, OTEZLA leads all promoted brands and new-to-brand share on the private market ahead of public listing. And there are very encouraging early launch metrics in Germany, U.K. and other European countries.","The data rollout for OTEZLA is expected to continue throughout the rest of the year through publications and at major medical meetings. The focus of these abstracts and presentations will be mainly on the longer term data for OTEZLA which shows a highly differentiated benefit risk profile relative to the other competitive products. Earlier this month, the New England Journal of Medicine published data from phase II proof-of-concept study of OTEZLA in Behcet's disease.","Turning our attention to GED-0301, we are aggressively moving clinical development plans forward. Our registration enabling endoscopy study is underway. Start-up activities for the large phase III registration trials are ongoing and the study initiations are expected midyear.","The phase II study in ulcerative colitis will begin with second half 2015 and we are preparing for clinical development in adolescent Crohn's disease with initiation targeted for Q4. As many of you know data from the phase II IGON1 study of GED-0301 and Crohn\u2019s disease was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in March.","DDW, the Digestive Disease Week meeting in May will provide an opportunity for further presentation of IGON1 data, including important subset analysis. As stated earlier, Q1 was a quarter full of advancement for Celgene and INI. The balance of the year should also be full of major milestones and accomplishments.","We are focused on continuing to build on the strong U.S. OTEZLA launch, the successful launch of OTEZLA in key geographies outside of the U.S. and also started completing enrollment of the phase III study in Behcet's disease and phase II study with OTEZLA in atopic dermatitis and ulcerative colitis.","We are aggressively managing the development of GED-0301 and plan on moving other key clinical programs such as CC-220 and Sotatercept forward through important medical milestones in 2015. We are excited that momentum has been created and we look forward to further in many key aspects of the INI franchise throughout 2015.","Thank you very much. I would like to turn the call over to Bob.","Bob Hugin","Thank you Scott and thank you to everyone at Celgene for producing the outstanding results reported this morning and for advancing the five strategic imperatives that guide our company. Our commitment to aspirational objectives combined with our focus on these comparatives strengthen our confidence in the achievement of our near-term goals and positions us for continued long-term growth.","Our sustained investment at our franchises key programs has contributed to the numerous recent regulatory accomplishments leading to increasing commercial opportunities. And as outlined in the earlier presentation, our commitment to sustaining innovation is being demonstrated by the progress in advancing our internal programs and accelerating our collaborations with strategic partners.","Our most recent investments and partnerships leverage our leadership and expertise in important areas of research and provide a foundation for future growth in the transformational areas of immuno-oncology, epigenetics and cellular therapy. Our first quarter performance was compelling evidence of our team\u2019s intense focus on operational excellence, the foundation of all of our success.","As we look to the future, we\u2019re excited about the numerous near-term milestones that have a potential to fuel significant growth. We expect new data medical conferences throughout the year illustrating the opportunities in our deep and diverse pipeline. All of us at Celgene are energized and committed to delivering exceptional results and capturing the full potential of our company.","Thank you for joining us this morning. And operator, would you please now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Geoff Porges of Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Geoff Porges","Thank you very much for taking the question and congratulations on all the progress this quarter. First, a question for Peter. Just on one-time items and you mentioned the gross to net and presumably there was a step up in your co-pay systems contributions in the quarter. Could you just give us a sense of the magnitude of how much your gross to net went up from Q4 to Q1 and also potentially how much the co-pay systems went up?","And any other one-time items, it was helpful to see currency. And then just a little bit on the AstraZeneca collaboration. That's certainly interesting, but could you perhaps explain to us what are the assets from Celgene for the share with AstraZeneca that go into the collaboration? It\u2019s pretty clear what happens with the PD-L1, but what are you giving up in return for that access? Thanks.","Peter Kellogg","Great. Hey Geoff, this is Peter. Thank you very much for the question. So I\u2019m going to go in a very sequence if I can. Let me just talk about foreign exchange first because I know foreign exchange is a topic for a lot of multinational companies like us. And in fact, as I mentioned at the topline versus prior year, foreign exchange was a net 1.6% negative impact to $27 million.","Just to break that out for you versus prior quarter, so going from Q4 to Q1, it was a negative 0.6% impact to our total company growth. Now, we have a very active hedging programs. So obviously the foreign exchange impact by itself was much larger but a lot of that was offset by the benefits of hedges that we had rolled in over the last three years.","We have a very active program in that to manage our exposures. Just to give you a feel for that versus prior year, the foreign exchange impact on our P&L alone without the hedges was 5.8 negative, we got 4.2 positive impact from the hedges. That was very good.","Relativistic to co-pay and other gross to net items, we did have a slightly larger co-pay charge this quarter. And likewise, the gross to net did increase. What I\u2019ll have to do is come back to you a little bit on exactly the details of gross to net. We don\u2019t often break that out in lots of detail. But it is true that the first quarter always is a little bit more challenging particularly for REVLIMID and POMALYST because of those ACA payments in the gross to net filling the donut hole contributions.","That said, I think often that why it\u2019s good to compare Q1 to Q1 prior year because in fact we have that effect every year. So as you can see in our year-over-year growth rates, we've done extremely well, even with foreign exchange environment and it's really a great start to the year. For the AstraZeneca asset sharing, maybe I\u2019ll turn it to Jackie for that.","Jackie Fouse","All right. Geoff, thanks for the question. So I think the gist of your question is related to whether we would share any of the economics on Celgene asset, the answer is no. So the collaboration includes just the sharing on the PD-L1 asset in hematology.","Geoff Porges","Okay. So there's -- none of the assets in your pipeline would be shared, assuming they are successful in those indications?","Jackie Fouse","That is absolutely correct.","Geoff Porges","Terrific. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. I\u2019ll get back in the queue.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Cory Kasimov of J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.","Cory Kasimov","Hi. Great. Thank you very much for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the update this morning with luspatercept in MDS and beta thalassemia. Is there anything that you can say with regard to the potential proposed trial design and endpoints of those trials? And where you see this product ultimately best fitting into the market as successful in phase III? Thanks.","Jackie Fouse","Thanks for the question. So I would just say with respect to the specific trial designs, I think you will see more details on the program as we take that forward over time. You had already heard us indicate that we would take luspatercept forward in beta thalassemia. Now we\u2019ve formally taken a decision to take it forward in MDS as well and you\u2019ll get more details about that phase III program as we move along in both of those indications. Our intentions with our partner Acceleron are to keep those programs moving as quickly as possible and initiate by the end of the year. So stay tuned for more in that regard.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Schoenbaum of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Mark Schoenbaum","Hey guys, thanks a lot for taking the question. If I may, I think Scott is on. Hey, Scott. Congratulations on The New England Journal publication. I was just wondering if you could comment maybe on some of the points the editorialist made. I think the editorialist said that the efficacy was unprecedented, but then basically tried to make the point that the author thought there was a lack of congruence between clinical and biological signs of remission. Just love to hear your commentary on that, if you may.","And then my follow-up would just be there has been a lot of Street focus on the upcoming European patent ruling. Just -- I know there's not a lot you guys can say or willing to say on the IP on a call such as this, but maybe just in general, do you think there is read across in the situation in the U.S., yes or no? Thanks a lot.","Bob Hugin","Thank you for the questions. So there was actually two articles published in the New England Journal since we last spoke one on OTEZLA in Behcet's disease , one in GED three or one in Crohn's and I assume you're speaking to the Crohn's publication.","Mark Schoenbaum","Yes.","Bob Hugin","The two was very positive in balanced. Unprecedented in efficacy. The opportunity potentially change the face of treatment of Crohn's disease or maybe the first steps in a cure and some very positive things. I think it was balanced with some things that we know. We don't know one of the good parts of it, I think a lot of that questions that were raised would be addressed at DDW in the abstract in the presentations there. They are looking at some of the subside analysis, the more severe patients, the relationship between dose and clinical responses and remission.","So we are going to get a chance through DDW to dig into that data more. I think that\u2019ll answer some of the questions and most of questions that came up in the editorial. But overall I thought the editorial was very positive.","Jackie Fouse","Hi, Mark. Thanks for the question on the EU patent situations. So that hearing will take place on May the 7th. We do not believe that that case would be a read through to the U.S. lines doing on things that, there\u2019s a couple of things there, I think people are pretty well aware of from standpoint of the differences between the two geographies on these issues they are both substantive, as well as procedural differences in terms of how the U.S. and the EU looks at these patents in the U.S., the law looks at POMALYST is very distinct compounds in the EU. It\u2019s a little bit more specific to the facts around the particular patent being examined, we happen to think there are facts are very strong. And we\u2019ll see if the court agrees, but because of those substantive and procedural differences we don\u2019t think there is a read through from the U.S. states to the U.S. situation, I mean, from the EU case to U.S. situation. Thanks.","Mark Schoenbaum","All right. Thanks Jackie.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Matthew Harrison","Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask two on OTEZLA, if I could, so can you just talk a little bit about the growth in gross to net in stocking and if that had any impact on the revenues for the quarter? And then, something I noticed in the charts that you provided, especially on the new to brand, it looks like methotrexate use is sort of declining relative to OTEZLA share rising, is that really what is happening, that people are using this instead of methotrexate or is that just an aberration in the grass? Thanks.","Bob Hugin","So first, sorry, about that. The first comment being on gross to net. You do see differences as you go through the quarters in gross to net with OTEZLA, as well as in the oncology portfolio and tends to be highest in Q1. And so you will see it go down over the course of the year so that did have some small impact on revenues methotrexate.","Matthew Harrison","What about distribution...","Bob Hugin","Yes. We expanded distribution at the end of Q4 to include wholesale distribution, a product that had an affect in towards the end of Q4 and we saw that drawing down during the course of Q1. So, overall, good steady state there from this point forward and GTN goes down during the course of the year.","In terms of utilization of OTEZLA relative to methotrexate. I think what we are seeing from the data and particularly in the last few months, you are seeing a dip in methotrexate, you are seeing OTEZLA being used early in a prebiologic space, some of that is a substitution for methotrexate, we are in earlier switch off methotrexate to another world before going to a biologic.","I think you're also seeing some decline in a couple of the biologics which are used earlier, particularly in the Enbrel space. So I think we are seeing market share being gain from OTEZLA at both from [indiscernible], from Enbrel and other biologics.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Robyn Karnauskas","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, first question is for Scott. There is -- have there been any plans yet that have put a step edit in place to use OTEZLA ahead of a T&F, just even one plan? And then the second question is more on the use of Kyprolis, because I know that ASPIRE is coming up and Kyprolis looks superior to VELCADE? Have you seen any changes in -- on the percentage of people getting REVLIMID VELCADE to REVLIMID Kyprolis yet in this space, is that starting to happen? Thanks.","Scott Smith","So this is Scott on the step addict question, we do see some plans during the course of -- particularly during the course of 2015 some smaller plans who have taken that step. We are putting it preferentially ahead of biologic therapy, it\u2019s certainly not a majority of plans at this point.","Our goal for the course of the year in terms of access is to be on completely equal footing, no additional step addicts and then longer term it put in a position of stronger forced utilization ahead of biologics. But we are starting to see some of that happen in the marketplace today.","Jackie Fouse","Hi, Robyn. Its Jackie. So I think with respect to your question about Kyprolis, I mean, the discrimination of the ASPIRE data is still relatively fresh. I would say, we are -- the comment that I made in my prepared remarks about potentially seeing the first U.S. approval of the triplet regimen for that that coming this summer relates to that combination.","I think it\u2019s a little bit early to start to make a call on trends there. What we like about the evolution of this is the story that's playing out with respect to REVLIMID is a clear backbone therapy in these triplet combinations and the benefit from the patients that we are seeing of the PFS improvements and the treatment outcome improvements with the triplet regimens.","So I think over the course of the remainder of the year and as we going into ASH we have a little bit more data to be able to have some better ideas the true trends that we would see emerging from these triplet data based on approvals. Thanks.","Robyn Karnauskas","Great. Thanks. And if I could have a follow-up, Scott. So a lot of investors now are talking about biosimilars coming potentially 2017 and I assume that OTEZLA will be much more entrenched by then? So what are you seeing in the space, like so far, going into potential competition in the T&F space that makes you feel comfortable that OTEZLA can be entrenched in front of the T&Fs or in front of any price sensitivity in the market in the next few years, I mean, just help us think a little bit going forward how you are thinking about the space evolving?","Scott Smith","We don\u2019t see necessarily biosimilar is affecting what\u2019s going on with OTEZLA in the marketplace. If you take a look at the early data 85% of the utilization today of OTEZLA is ahead of biologics. The profile that we have is highly differentiated versus biologics whether branded or unbranded and it really is unique value proposition for this marketplace there is completely different than you see from the biologics or from biosmilar.","So we don\u2019t see it as a competitive in the space at all. We think we really the value proposition of early used non- biologics space has really played out in the first year of virtualization, particularly early in the first quarter, quarter and half of psoriasis you really see a lot of early utilization there so.","Bob Hugin","And having another two years advance of biosimilar has really build this marketplace. Just a couple of years ago people didn\u2019t even believe the marketplace existed and now it\u2019s quite clear. And so that these two years is very valuable even though as you say the value proposition is very clear in the product profile, so it\u2019s very encouraging.","Robyn Karnauskas","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from John Newman of Canaccord. Your line is now open.","John Newman","Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking the question, guys and congrats on a tremendous amount of progress here. I am just curious, on ABRAXANE, do you think as the year goes on, there maybe some potential for revenues to move kind of higher in that range of your guidance? And then also, just a follow-up on biosimilars, given the guidance that we saw from the agency yesterday, what do you ultimately see playing out in the T&F space, since it seems like interchangeability even though that's a product that goes through the retail channel, interchangeability could be a little bit of a tall order at the moment? Thanks.","Jackie Fouse","Hi, John. Thanks for the question. What I would say about ABRAXANE is, we think that we are going to see a significant acceleration in the revenue growth trajectory over the remainder of the year for several reasons.","We are still in the very early stages of the pancreatic launch in Europe, so those the early launch countries are ramping up. We -- based on the experience that we\u2019ve had in the U.S. expects for the product to become standard-of-care in combination with gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer. We are seeing a very positive share trends of light in the U.S. and again we expect that same position to be achieved in Europe.","As I mentioned in my remarks, we have a number of countries where we are still awaiting the reimbursement approval, if those come in, those will positively contribute there as well.","We also have just started with the lung launch in Europe and that's completely incremental for us as well. So we just got that approval in the middle of Q1, just starting to launch in the early access country like Germany and Austria, and all of the approvals in the other countries across the Europe for pricing are still ahead of us.","And then, one more thing that, as we move overtime will impact even more the future, but is not yet included in our numbers is any potential for ABRAXANE in combination immunotherapy regimen as that space continues to evolve.","So we are seeing a lot a enthusiasm around the product and we believe it will be accelerating pretty significantly in terms of the revenue growth over the remainder of the year and into 2016 and beyond.","Scott Smith","So the question relative to biosimilar impact on the T&F inhibitors, I\u2019m not really a position to say what that's going to look like and how the market\u2019s going to transform to what extent post-biosimilar initiation in U.S.","And again, I just want to, we are focuses on a different space, we see a lot of utilization in the pre-biologics space a very different value proposition in terms of an oral drug, different benefit risk and other things. So it\u2019s not something that we see fundamentally necessarily changing our business dynamic going forward.","John Newman","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Schmidt of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Eric Schmidt","Good morning. Thanks for the question. Maybe back to the PD-1 collaboration with AZ. Can you give us your thoughts on sort of general outlook for checkpoint inhibitors in he malignancies and maybe what specifically in terms of data sets or evidence that you did due diligence on allowed you to make a major bet here?","Jackie Fouse","Hi, Eric. This is Jackie. Thanks for the questions. So, I mean, it\u2019s still early days in terms of the evolution of the data in he malignancies, as you know we did significant diligence with our team and the AZ team, and have looked at all of the data available to at this time and we are quite excited about the potential for combination therapies in this space, which is why we wanted to move forward with the collaboration.","AZ has invested quite significantly across their solid tumour clinical development plan for this product and make started to generate preclinical and early data in the hematological malignancies.","We feel like we've been in the complementary nature of the assets in our respective portfolios that we have an opportunities. The leader in Hematology will take this program, accelerate it, move it very fast. And with that those potential product combinations seek some multiple different paths to regulatory approval that could potentially some accelerated timeline.","So, we think, we are in a really good position with this. And we are quite excited about the first wave of this with the checkpoint inhibitor anchored therapies. And yeah, we\u2019ve got the opportunity to look at both of our respective pipeline of earlier stage assets and see what we might be able to do there, across, again a range of hematological indication.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Michael Yee","Thanks. Good morning. A question for Scott. Following up on GED-0301, of course, your endoscopy study is underway. Maybe you can remind us when -- you can announce something from that, what you could actually say, what end points, et cetera. How much color could you give to the Street as we discuss, obviously, that part of the program and get confidence around the endoscopy aspect? Thanks.","Scott Smith","So we\u2019ll have a deep dive around the specific structure in a lot of detail around the whole clinical program for GED-0301 and DDW next month. What I can say about the endoscopy study is it\u2019s a 12-week study. There is a mucosal healing endpoint at 12 weeks, but then there is a 52-week extension on that to see durability of remission over time. And so the full study for completion is 12 plus 52 weeks, getting us to 64 weeks.","And as always we will make that data available through medical meetings and other sources of appropriate publication when it\u2019s completed. But it\u2019s a 12 weeks study with the 52-week observation period. And again, we\u2019ll go through a lot of detail on all those studies at DDW but that study is up and going and we\u2019re very excited about it. It\u2019s enrolling very actively and hopefully that will get done quickly.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ian Somaiya of Nomura Securities. Your line is now open.","Ian Somaiya","Thank you for taking my question. Just as I -- look at your pipeline, you have done a tremendous job of building a pipeline that should drive growth well into the next decade. But I was hoping for is, maybe, if you could provide some color on the line extension strategy, specifically for REVLIMID? As despite the breadth of the portfolio that you have put together, one can imagine that REVLIMID still would be 40%, 50% of overall sales, despite successful vast majority of pipeline drug.","So I was just hoping that you could comment on that. And just on GED-0301, I was surprised to see a pediatric study in Crohn's. What type of safety work was required to sort of move forward in that? And I guess, how should we think about for the overall safety of the drug, in light of your decision to move forward there?","Jackie Fouse","Hi, Ian, it\u2019s Jackie. Thanks for the question. So let me start with the REVLIMID question. So I think the most significant program that we would focus on for the moment is a lymphoma program. So we have five phase III trials, up and running, enrolling in lymphoma. Some of those have already completed across a number of indication diffuse large B-Cell, follicular.","You will see again the FLASH analysis. It\u2019s been accepted for all presentation at ASCO around the surrogate endpoint of complete response for PFS. And then we will have a better idea and be able to talk about the potential impact of that on timeline. So we are very happy with where we are, in terms of the momentum in the current commercial business around the newly diagnosed launch. We\u2019re seeing great results from there, already expected acceleration that over the remainder of this year.","So for the next few years quite happy with that, with how we think REVLIMID is going to play backbone therapy in the myeloma spaces. And then we will look at a little bit further, we\u2019ve got all this potential indications to come in lymphoma. It's been also possible that in the first wave of the immunotherapy regimen that REVLIMID could be an enabling compound to bring novel therapies to market in combination faster as well. So, great place for it in the portfolio and helping us get on to the next round of things to come even beyond. Well, thanks.","Ian Somaiya","Yes. I guess my question was more geared towards how do you ultimately replace REVLIMID and what is the strategy there?","Jackie Fouse","Well. I think, I mean, it\u2019s a little early but with respect to how we see the market applying at. I mean, I think about it not exactly as \u201creplacing\u201d REVLIMID but it's more about, how do we continue to evolve the treatments paradigms to best impact patients' lives and do that in such a way that the business proposition is there for us to sustain our growth profile for a long period of time with the portfolio of products that would allow us to continue to be leaders in multiple myeloma and become leaders or have leading position in another indication as well.","So, I think, as we continue to take things forward and what you are seeing more and more of between the evolutions of biomarker evidence another thing is more targeted therapies. So we can continue to see segmentation in the market and products taking leading positions in different segments of the market. So you can very much see it being a portfolio of products that over time comes into sustain our REVLIMID franchise for a very, very long period of time rather than one product replacing REVLIMID. So, we would we see it playing out that way targeting high-risk and unmet medical need segment. So we are making our way through the profit.","Peter Kellogg","I just want to add a little bit, I think Ian, this has been clearly a long-term strategy both as Jackie points out that have very fundamental research in the space of biology. That leads to the B-cell malignancies and all the proteinomia stages area it gives us confidence that. As the technologies is increase in our abilities to sub-segmentation populations into specific biological responders in targeted areas. We will have the products from our own internal portfolio and through collaborators that will allow us have a greater and greater impact on diseases, where REVLIMID exist today in a general way.","So we're very optimistic that our own internal research pipelines are going to do that. And at the same time, we have built a portfolio in pipeline approach that we believe we\u2019ll have regardless what happens a very strong growth trajectory in addition to that. So we are not just looking to deal with replacing REVLIMID. We\u2019re going to continue to go through it and we\u2019re going to provide better alternatives and therapies to the patients in those specific areas over the next decade.","Bob Hugin","Specific to adolescent Crohn\u2019s just a couple of thoughts on that. First of all, it\u2019s an area tremendously a large number of patients suffer from adolescent Crohn\u2019s, so very difficult diseases to treat. There a tremendous amount of high unmet medical need in this phase. The conventional therapies work even less while in this subset of the population as they do in adult population. So it\u2019s an area of really high unmet medical need.","Given the profile that came out in phase II to looked balanced and looked very similar to placebo in terms of all the different dose cohorts for GED-0301 in terms of side effects and severe SAEs. Given that side effect profile, when we had discussions with both the EMA and with the FDA, they were very encouraging of us, to stay this particular patient population.","And lot of high unmet need and there is a lot of -- and there has been also in the community care -- well community, lot of enthusiasm to study the drug in this community. And the safety data was there from phase II, that we will support and encourage to move forward with that. The adolescent Crohn\u2019s study should initiate before the end of this year.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Raymond of Robert Baird. Your line is now open.","Chris Raymond","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. A question on the cash. I think I heard Peter say about 85% of your cash is ex-U.S. Can you talk a little bit about what the sort of current trajectory is? Is your current free cash flow rate, sort of, in line with that ratio or is it higher? And sort of, coupling with that, I assume the AstraZeneca deal was paid for with ex-U.S. cash, if you could just confirm that? And can you maybe talk about that dynamic of the relative attractiveness of deals outside the U.S., given your cash base in the U.S. dollar exchange rate, et cetera? Thanks.","Peter Kellogg","Great. Chris, thank you. This is Peter. So a very appropriate question. You are right that, first I\u2019m going in a reverse sequence. The AstraZeneca upfront payment was done with offshore cash. And the IP will be domiciled outside the U.S., so all those assumptions are correct. I\u2019ll come back to that relative deal so forth in a minute. One thing, I would say, when you look at cash balance of the company like ours, the cash flow from operations is actually much stronger in the U.S. than you might think relative to where the cash ends up.","But what we do is we do a lot of business development deals in the U.S. and so therefore end up using U.S cash there as well as all of our share repurchase activity is utilizing U.S. cash. So actually we have very balance cash flow between the U.S. and the rest of the world. We have a very strong cash flow in the U.S. that\u2019s why I want to make sure you really appreciate that. And it gives us as I mentioned ample strength to, on one hand execute the business development agenda in a robust manner, certainly -- Celgene has done over the last few years, it\u2019s been excellent.","And yes at the same time, really maintain the efficient capital structure and return cash to shareholders through the share repurchase program. The cash that\u2019s outside the U.S. is deployed on many deals relative to the rights for non-U.S. markets. So even though some of the deals for example, maybe global nature, there are some structures where we use certain amount of U.S. cash and there is a certain amount of non-U.S. cash to domicile the IP in the relevant market in the right places.","But overall, we're in very good shape on cash flow. We are very financially strong. We look at this going forward and we\u2019re in a very good position to be able to continue our business development agenda and also return cash to shareholders. So I think it\u2019 s -- we are coming from the position of real financial strength.","Chris Raymond","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Geoff Meacham","Morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. One for Jackie and one for Scott. So Jackie, I know early days for the European launch of REV in newly diagnosed. But any color on the experience so far in Germany with respect to types of patients or new start share? And then when you look to next year, what role do you think budgets will play -- budget allocations on demand?","And then for Scott, real quick on slide 29, it looks like the positioning of OTEZLA ahead of biologics is working already. Where do you think the next leg of growth is, the bigger opportunity? Is it naive patients or is it just expanding the market? Thanks.","Jackie Fouse","Thanks for the question. Hi, Geoff. So, we\u2019ve just got the approval in the middle of the quarter and essentially we are in launch mode in Europe. What we're seeing in the early access markets notably Germany as it is the largest, is the same kind of trends that we saw in early days in the U.S. But the messaging on the product is positioning in the frontline setting in terms of the target patient profile and all of those sorts of things are very consistent.","So we are seeing quite a nice response there. Remember, it's quite early. I think we are going to see extremely strong momentum over the course of this year. We have -- are in active negotiations with the other countries and it\u2019s already started quite some time ago working on the modeling for helping each country appreciate what budget impact of this approval could be.","There are some offsets when you get a new product approval and it takes share in certain patient segments and we\u2019ve been helping the authorities model those and we built in to our forecast some expectation for the net impact on pricing associated with coming to market with the newly diagnosed indication. I think we feel good about where we are on that already and where we are going to end up on it. So it\u2019s very exciting times for us. In Europe, with this as we\u2019re essentially going from practically zero market share and now have the ability to draw the product the same way that it has moved in the U.S.","Peter Kellogg","There are three major areas that I would see for a future OTEZLA growth and we\u2019re just at the very beginning here. So there\u2019s a lot of growth ahead of us. There is something like 10,000 to 20,000 patients in the U.S. who come for treatment, initiate a treatment every month in psoriasis and PsA. And so getting a leading share of those patients and maintaining them for a period of time is a critical area for us.","I would also say that if there is a component of this, which is market expansion for psoriasis. Of the 2 million to 3 million patients that are moderate to severe psoriasis, the United States is only 10% of them at anyone time are being treated with effective therapy. So expanding that market, providing other options for patients that are easier for them to use that are oral, that don\u2019t require monitoring, other things can hopefully expand that marketplace.","And then specific to OTEZLA, we\u2019re just at the very, very beginning of launch outside of the U.S. and U.S., Canada and Australia, European approval, really need to going with the launch of those. We are working very hard. The metrics look really good there but geographic expansion, getting reimbursement and real geographic commercial expansion, something over the next 8, 10, 12, 14 months, I think will have major impact.","Geoff Meacham","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Roden of UBS. Your line is now open.","Matt Roden","Great. Thanks very much for taking my question. Your old friends from ABRAXIS now at Sorrento, have a competing paclitaxel nanoparticle that seems that they would be interesting in filing to the FDA in referencing your ABRAXANE data. So just wanted to see if you could speak to why you think this is or is not a threat to ABRAXANE. And whether or not this is contemplated in your longer-term ABRAXANE targets? Thanks.","Jackie Fouse","Hi. Matt, It is Jackie. Thanks for the question. So, yeah, we monitor those developments very closely. The first thing I would say is that we would not comment on the regulatory filings or potential regulatory filings or regulatory strategy of other companies, so let se how that goes. You have probably seen and had a chance to look into the detail of the data and information position that we presented in our citizen\u2019s petition.","We feel very strongly that PK data alone is not sufficient to evaluate whether a product would be comparable to ABRAXANE, where ABRAXANE has been studied in numerous phase III clinical trials and has demonstrated its efficacy across multiple indications overtime.","So, we'll see how this goes. We\u2019re quite confident in ABRAXANEs future as the chemotherapy agent, nanoparticle technology that does not need steroid use associated with it and its potential attractiveness and again, with the body of clinical data based on multiple phase III trials to support its efficacy. That will get used in combination with other therapies in the immuno-oncology arena as that plays out. So, we are standing on the strength of the body of clinical data behind ABRAXANE and we\u2019ll see how it goes.","Matt Roden","Great. Thanks for taking the question.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mara Goldstein of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.","Mara Goldstein","Thanks very much. I know it is early days in psoriasis, but perhaps if you had any intelligence you could share on OTEZLA and the persistency of the prescriptions? And that is for patients that discontinue treatment. Is that a function of cost\/insurance or tolerability? Is there anything you can share with us there?","Bob Hugin","So there is comments I\u2019d like to make on persistency, as usually you\u2019d like to have a significant period of data, 12 months or so. We do have some early six months persistency data. It shows that we are in line with all analogs in this space. Persistent does not look different than others. I would say, there is some potential upside for OTEZLA relative to persistency.","If you take a look at the clinical trial program in the first -- between zero and 24 months, dropout rates in the clinical trial programs, OTEZLA looks very similar to what they do on biologics. You see a market change after 24 months as you go out to two years and three years, where the persistency of patients maintaining therapy on OTEZLA is much higher than you saw in the clinical trial programs.","So it\u2019s early for us. It looks encouraging and in line with what we would expect. We think there might be some good upside relative to competitors in the space to keep patients on longer as we start to get one-year and two-year and three-year data. But there was nothing there outside of anything, outside of the ordinary at all and it is in line with our expectations.","Patrick Flanigan","Great. Thanks for that question. We\u2019ll take two more questions if we could because we\u2019re getting a little late in the time here.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Howard Liang of Leerink. Your line is now open.","Howard Liang","Great. Thanks very much. Regarding the AstraZeneca deal, is there a scientific reason, such as REVLIMID's effect on NK cells, Anti-TC, to go with a PD-L1 antibody rather than a PD-1 antibody? And also, can you give us some sense -- some color as to the mechanism that will be used to distinguishing between HE malignancy cells and solid tumor cells?","Jackie Fouse","Thanks, Howard. It\u2019s Jackie. So, again, the data in hematological malignancies is a little bit early, so we\u2019ll have to see how this plays out. You\u2019ve looked at some of the early science including nature article and other things that are out there with respect to that. So as we have the opportunity to work with our partners at AZ, with our earlier scientists as well as our clinical development team, we will be able to tease more of that out over time.","But we are very enthusiastic about the possibilities here and let\u2019s see how it goes. We look forward to sharing more data with you as we move along. So with respect to -- I think your question was about the commercial data that we will then eventually have to be able to split the revenues between solid tumors and hematological malignancies. In the U.S., that\u2019s a pretty straightforward. Also between numerous data sources and our ability to trying delay the cost of those data sources outside the U.S.","We think that that's going to turn out to be relatively straightforward. And then just to the point on revenues and it links a little bit back to the question that Ian asked. Another reason why we really like these deal on top of the exciting science and everything we think that that holds for us for the future. Our share of the PDL-1 revenues could start to generate revenues for us in as early as 2020. We think it's locked in very nicely to the portfolio in terms of our future revenue generation and diversification of those revenues from the various products in the portfolio beyond the 2020 timeframes. So, thanks for the question.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from Mike King of JMP Securities. Your line is now open.","Mike King","Thanks for squeezing me in, guys. A couple of related financial questions. I would note that it looked like your both R&D and SG&A spend were both below consensus. So I guess my question is whether you feel like you are making the appropriate investments in SG&A against the products. That is the first part. And the second part -- and I don't if you can you comment on this yet. But it seems like you guys spent a lot of money this quarter, the AZ upfront, the Quanticel acquisition, the CRISPR investment, Agios. How would we think about that in terms of how that is going to affect your numbers for this next -- for the second quarter? Will we expect all of these to be in the non-GAAP P&L, the GAAP P&L or some mix of both? Thanks.","Peter Kellogg","Hi, Mike. It\u2019s Peter. So thanks for the question. I mean, first of all, for the first quarter as you saw, we did increased our spending. I think it was 15% in combination of R&D and SG&A versus prior year. So the first quarter results do reflect strong investment throughout the world commercially to prepare and actually execute launches for ABRAXANE, POMALYST\/IMNOVID, and now even though, OTEZLA getting ramped up and were ready to go in many of the markets in Europe.","So we feel like we\u2019re making all the investments that are really important and necessary. And we\u2019re driving ahead -- obviously the topline performance for this quarter was very strong, so even sequentially versus Q4. So, we feel all the investments are being made. I did highlight my comments going forward that we do expect to see R&D continue to step up because we have both internally in our pipeline very exciting programs moving forward, which is really good news and great for the future of the company.","Likewise, we have some of the kick-off activities that Scott talked about in GED-301. We will be picking up some of the AstraZeneca\/MedImmune clinical activity through 2016. So, we will have additional spending areas in R&D. On the other hand, I mentioned that we continue to get great leverage on our G&A though as a subset of SG&A.","Certainly, the G&A infrastructure has been built is highly leveragable. Our Boudry operation is just fantastic. The teams over there handle the international arena extremely well and can just work very well with all the launches and expansion of activity throughout Europe and throughout the world.","We also think that the investments that we have made over the last couple of years, quite frankly are now nicely leveragable. At this point quite frankly, the investments we made have been -- let\u2019s say a little bit ahead of the sales and marketing curve and now we are trying to see the sales curve rather come up the line really, really nicely.","Now in terms of our handling of different investments that we\u2019re making, I will just start by saying, really there is nothing that can be any different than has in our practice in the past and you\u2019d be glad to go off-line and check to each of those components. On some of the investments we\u2019ve made are purely equity investments and so I think that\u2019s pretty straightforward.","The upfront buying, it will be handled just like all of our other upfronts for the AstraZeneca\/MedImmune oncology transaction. So, I don\u2019t think there is really any change from the standpoint of how we positioned GAAP to non-GAAP. So, I think we\u2019ll continue to roll forward. I will just reiterate that it\u2019s just great to get off to a strong start in the first quarter with results that we\u2019ve posted. I think that it sets us up extremely well for 2015.","Equally importantly, we\u2019re making investments, while we\u2019re getting these numbers to set ourselves up to drive right through 2020 in the guidance that we\u2019ve provided there. And quite frankly, as Jackie has highlighted, the number of the assets that we are investing in quite frankly build the potential of this company in the next decade.","So really some of them may not be big factors on a revenue standpoint between now and 2020, but really start to take off, hopefully after 2020. So, I like the way that we\u2019ve got this nice balance investment portfolio of short-term and long-term, as well as strong performance of the topline and delivery of results. I would just like to wrap up if I could as that was the last question. I think and I know, I really appreciate everybody's staying with us this long.","I think Celgene is continuing its path of building its future and investing while delivering strong results. The team is very excited. The number of approvals and new indications that we got this quarter is I think probably unprecedented. We continue to have a very active business development agenda and we\u2019re not done at all, so much more to talk about as we go through this year. I think it will be an exciting year and really pleased do get your support and talk about the activity of Celgene going forward. So, thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect.

In addition to the approval of POMALYST in United States on February the 8, we submitted regulatory applications for ABRAXANE and pancreatic cancer both -- to both the FDA and EU authorities, and submitted our psoriatic arthritis application for apremilast in United States and Canada. These are all very exciting developments with enormous potential for patients and for Celgene.","Our teams are also working with regulatory agencies to advance pending applications for REVLIMID and deletion 5q MDS in Europe for mantle cell lymphoma in the United States and for POMALYST in relapsed\/refractory multiple myeloma in Europe, action on these applications is expected in the next few months, all important upcoming milestones.","In a few minutes, Jackie will review our financial results and Mark will provide his perspective on our hematology\/oncology franchise. As Scott Smith, the Head of our Inflammation and Immunology franchise is not on the call today. I\u2019ll briefly review the status of the apremilast program on which we are making excellent progress.","In addition to our submitted regulatory applications for apremilast for psoriatic arthritis in the United States and Canada, our submission for psoriasis in United States and for psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis in Europe are on track for the second half of the year. These submissions are based on five positive Phase III registration trials, 3 in psoriatic arthritis and 2 in psoriasis.","Enrollment in our Phase III ankylosing spondylitis trial is accelerating rapidly and is significantly ahead of our original internal expectations. Positive results from the ESTEEM program in moderate to severe psoriasis were presented at the American Academy of Dermatology Meeting in March.","We are also well-positioned for major presence at the European League Against Rheumatism Meeting in Madrid this coming June. At EULAR we expect presentations of additional data from the PALACE psoriatic arthritis pivotal program, including topline results of PALACE-3 and importantly, 52-week data from PALACE-1, data from the Beh\u00e7et's disease Phase II study is also expected to be presented.","With our submissions advancing and continued positive data flow, we are preparing for the apremilast global launch and accelerating or hiring of key franchise leadership. We are very encouraged for the top talent we are attracting in our focus on building a world-class organization.","The accomplishments of the first quarter were substantial and provide us with strong momentum for the rest of the year. We are excited about the data flow and regulatory events expected in the coming months and look forward to updating you on those throughout the year. These accomplishments position Celgene for our next phase of growth and illustrate our accelerated progress on our strategic imperatives.","We are focused on maximizing the full potential of our hematology franchise, expanding our oncology franchise and building a global INI franchise, while we advance our innovative early pipeline.","We are very excited about what the meaningful opportunities on the near-term horizon and extraordinary -- and our extraordinary potential for long-term growth.","Let me now turn the call over to Jackie.","Jackie Fouse","Thank you, Bob and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on our call today. We started the year at Celgene with excellent momentum in Q1 and we see that momentum reflected in our results across all of our major performance metrics. Net product sales growth of 15% for the Q1 year over year comparison was driven by REVLIMID growth of 16.5% and was broad based across the globe.","Total revenues also grew 15% and sequential growth in both product and total revenues was 1% off of the strong Q4 2012. Our business model continues to perform well and we leveraged this topline growth to 27% year over year Q1 adjusted earnings per share growth and improved our adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter by 320 basis points. We continue to add value with our share repurchase program and even more importantly, we saw numerous successes from our clinical and regulatory efforts. Successes that will fuel our future growth plans. These included the approval and launch of (inaudible) refractory multiple myeloma in the US. Mark will comment more about this launch in a moment.","We also invested further for our long term future via new R&D collaborations and expansions of existing collaborations. All of our major products contributed to the 15% growth in total net product sales and all grew a double digit rate. I mentioned REVLIMID with 16.5% growth. VIDAZA grew 10% year over year and ABRAXANE 18%. All major geographies contributed to product these results and they were volume driven as we will see in a moment. POMALYST is off to a strong start and is now making its contribution to our total multiple myeloma franchise growth profile.","On this slide, we can see the components of our net product sales growth. All of the 15% year over year growth came from volume. The net global impact of price was somewhat favorable with a 2 percentage point positive contribution but was offset by a 2 percentage point negative foreign exchange impact. This FX impact was about $27 million for the quarter year over year comparison and was in line with our expectations for the quarter. We previously highlighted for you an expected full year impact of FX of about $100 million negative and that is included in our full year guidance. We are currently tracking to that estimate.","With a 27% increase earnings per share grew much faster than revenues. This growth came mainly from operating profit growth of 23% as our operating margin expanded by 320 basis points for the Q1 year over year comparison. This operating margin expansion came most from lower R&D and SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenues with a modest contribution from a higher gross margin.","As you can see from the next slide of the $0.29 absolute growth in EPS, $0.25 is coming from operating income and a net $0.04 from financial drivers mainly share count as we see the cumulative impact of our ongoing share repurchase program.","Turning to the details of our net product sales, REVLIMID growth of 16.5% came from across the globe with similar growth rates in both the US and international. Sequential growth over Q4 was impacted by the usual seasonality of Medicare covered guest expense in the US, with that sequential impact being $11 million and sequential growth in international was impacted by negative foreign exchange of $18 million. Both of these were in line with our internal estimates.","REVLIMID\u2019s growth continues to be volume driven as the dynamic for market share, duration and global expansion remains quite positive. VIDAZA continues its double digit gains on a year over year basis. International growth was impacted by the distributor buying patterns particularly as a sequential comparison. ABRAXANE grew by an outstanding 18% year over year and a strong 15% sequentially as the US had a strong ABRAXANE performance for the fourth quarter and as the international business continues to expand. The momentum behind the product is favorable post the launch of the lung indication in the US.","Finally, we are off to a great start with POMALYST thanks to the excellent work of our US commercial team and our launch in the middle of Q1. I will let Mark comment further on what we are seeing in the market with POMALYST. Let me make one additional comment about the components of REVLIMID\u2019s growth. As we have seen REVLIMID\u2019s growth for Q1 year-over-year was 16.5%, all of that growth came from volume.","The impact of FX on total product sales is most felt by REVLIMID and that impacting Q1 was $19 million or 2.2% negative. This negative impact was offset by price in the quarter. The estimated FX impact for the year is included in our REVLIMID guidance for the full year.","On the next slide you can see the details of the key line items of our P&L and how we deliver the operating margin improvement in Q1, we are tracking nicely against our guidance and are quite pleased with our first quarter performance which is all operations driven and how we see the remainder of the year unfolding.","Our business model continues to deliver sustainable operating leverage and on this chart we track our progress in that regard on the year-to-date basis every quarter. So you can see we are off to a strong start to the year and you can put this year in the perspective with the past five years. All of our P&L metrics are strong and our model is delivering on this promise as a result of the efforts of all Celgene employees around the world and across all function.","We also remain focused on returns and how we invest our capital. In this chart we calculate ROIC using GAAP income and invested capital figures are very conservative picture. We calculate the current year on trailing 12-month basis, so at this time of the year we would not expect to see much of difference in the ROIC trajectory versus the prior year. We track our performance on this metric every quarter and we\u2019ll discuss it with you as we move through the year.","Our cash and marketable securities balance declined somewhat versus year-end 2012 due to the magnitude of our share repurchase activity in the first quarter as we used $1 billion for repurchases during the quarter.","We began execution of $600 million accelerated share repurchase program in February and expect that program to complete in May. In addition, we bought back about 400 million worth of shares outside of the ASR program. Our cash flow from operations for the quarter was $367 million.","Let me wrap up my comments with a quick look at our full year outlook and financial guidance. We are reaffirming total net product sales of $6 billion, annual growth of about 11% and REVLIMID net product sales in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.2 billion, growth of 10% at the mid-point of the range.","Given the strong start to the year, we are increasingly confident in our ability to hit these targets. In light of our strong start and the visibility we have to our P&L dynamic, now that we are about four months into the year, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $5.55 to $5.65, 14% growth at the mid-point up from our original guidance of $5.50 to $5.60 and 13% growth.","Both our product sales and EPS guidance include the possibility of generic VIDAZA entering in the U.S. during the second half of this year. EPS guidance includes our forecasted investment spend in our emerging Inflammation and Immunology business unit, that spend is more heavily weighted to the second half of the year. EPS guidance assumes the weighted average fully diluted share count for the full year $430 million and an effective tax rate of 16.5%.","Thank you. And I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Alles","Thanks very much, Jackie. Good morning, everyone. We produced excellent year-on-year growth in the first quarter. We delivered meaningful clinical and regulatory catalysts that will add to our short and long-term growth opportunities, and we build a strong foundation to achieve our full year 2013 sales targets.","First total product sales grew 15% year-on-year to $1.429 billion, greater customer demand across our brand and our core markets combined to offset the negative growth to that and foreign exchange impact that Jackie has discussed.","Even with these first quarter challenges, year-on-year REVLIMID sales grew 16.5% to $1.003. Through the first four months of this year our franchise regulatory and clinical teams have been remarkably productive. Let me summarize the highlights.","In February, the U.S. FDA approved POMALYST for patient with multiple myeloma who have received at least prior therapies, including REVLIMID and bortezomib, and he was demonstrated disease progression on or within 60 days of completing their last therapy.","In China, REVLIMID was approved by the SFDA for patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. In United States, the REVLIMID supplemental new drug application for relapsed and refractory mantle cell lymphoma remains on track for approval by the June 5 PDUFA date. The CHMT review of our POMALYST marketing application for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma is progressing well, and we expect a decision in the EU during the third quarter.","Patient enrollment into our early access program across Europe suggests very significant patient needs for POMALYST. We are working hard to meet this need. We\u2019ve submitted marketing applications to the FDA in March and to the CHMT in April for the innovative drug combination ABRAXANE plus (inaudible) for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. This follows the January ASCO GI meeting and the oral presentation demonstrated significant overall survival benefit in metastatic pancreatic cancer.","During the next few minutes I would like to focus your attention on five specific topics. Q1 REVLIMID results, the current status of the four pivotal phase 2 studies that support our regulatory strategy to expand REVLIMID into newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, the early launch of POMALYST in the US, ABRAXANE performance and momentum and current perspective on the upcoming American Cytoclinical oncology meeting.","Turning to the Q1 REVLIMID sales, our global year on year sales increased by over 16%. In the United States year on year sales grew by 15%. Even though sequential quarterly sales growth was impacted by the [covered got] rebate, overall market share increased slightly during the quarter as more unique patients were treated with REVLIMID than in any previous quarter and as the duration of therapy continued to increase.","Given the ongoing economic conditions in Europe we were very pleased with this region 16% year on year and 6% quarter on quarter REVLIMID sales growth. Market share gains in second line multiple myeloma and increases in duration in our major markets combined this very positive result. France was a particularly strong contributor, re-emerging as a critical growth driver.","Q1 REVLIMID sales in Japan, Canada and Australia, were excellent. We have made outstanding progress preparing to launch REVLIMID in China and expect to generate our first REVLIMID\u2019s commercial sale later this quarter. During the first quarter we successfully expanded REVLIMID reimbursement for deletion 5q MDS in Australia and achieved full public reimbursement for REVLIMID in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma in Taiwan. There is no greater priority for us than to expand the clinical benefit of REVLIMID patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.","Results from three large randomized phase 3 studies MM-015 cell GB 100104 and the IFM 0502 have been presented at numerous (inaudible) meeting and were published in the May 2012 edition of the New England Journal of Medicine. Until now these published and presented results have been accompanied by relatively shortfall for overall survival as forecasted. Overall survival events in our sponsor trials MM-015 now exceeds 50% of the overall study population and the in incidence rate of second primary malignancy has plateaued and can be considered mature. We\u2019ve conducted analyses to update the overall and event free survival results for the intentions to treat population and for patients less than 75 years of age.","The overall and event free survival trends remain positive. We plan to discuss this updated data with regulatory agencies in the coming months and we will submit an abstract of the results to the American Society Hematology meeting in December of this year and update analyses of the significant overall survival events from the use of REVLIMID as maintenance therapy following a (inaudible) stem cell plantation in a randomized phase 3 placebo controlled study, (inaudible) 100-104 was presented during the recent international multiple myeloma workshop meeting in (inaudible) Japan.","Meetings follow-up is now four years and the updated overall survival analysis confirms treatment with REVLIMID continues to demonstrate a significant overall survival benefit with a p-value of p equals 0.008 and has a ratio of 0.61. This result is despite crossover of more than 70% of patients from placebo to REVLIMID maintenance prior to disease progression. Compared with previously reported analyses of SPMs, the update from [Chilto] demonstrated a numerical increase in the REVLIMID and placebo arms but concluded that the benefit risk profile for REVLIMID remains positive.","It is our understand that updated results including overall survival and the incident rates of SPMs in the IFM 0502 study -- following stem cell transplantation will be submitted to this year\u2019s ASH meeting. Once these data are available to us we will immediately consider the IFM field to resolve to develop our global regulatory submission strategy for REVLIMID as maintenance therapy for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma following stem cell transplantation.","The unblinded efficacy and safety analysis of MM-20, our international Phase III study of REVLIMID plus low-dose dexamethasone versus the standard melphalan prednisone thalidomide regiment are forecast to be available late this quarter or early in the third quarter. The exact timing of data availability is dependent on when the protocol required number of progression events is met.","The efficacy results will include the final analysis for the primary endpoint, progressive free survival and interim analysis of overall survival. Important secondary endpoints and safety data will be included.","Given the current timeline, we expect that these results will be available in time to be submitted to the ASH meeting in December, considered separately and together, the results from these four REVLIMID studies in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, will inform and dictate our global regulatory submission strategy.","We are encouraged by the early commercial success of POMALYST in the U.S. market. As Jackie outlined, U.S. sales from mid-February to the end of March were $22 million and global Q1 sales were $29 million. We made excellent progress introducing our harmonizer risk management program, so that hematologist and their patients were able to immediately access POMALYST.","More than 1000 patients were registered and more than 1000 prescriptions were dispensed during the first quarter. Early feedback from hematologist about their clinical experience is very positive and we received broad coverage and reimbursement support from national and regional payors.","Not surprisingly, thought leaders are developing clinical trial strategies to combine POMALYST with other approved and investigational agents. With approval in Europe expected later this year, we remain confident that this important therapy will become our next block buster hematology brand.","The string of good news and momentum for ABRAXANE continued into the first quarter, driven by stable share of the U.S. metastatic breast cancer market and measurable market share gain in the non-small cell lung cancer market, Q1 net sales reached an all time high of $123 million.","ABRAXANE year-on-year sales increased 15% in U.S. and 28% internationally. We also advanced number of new clinical studies of ABRAXANE including triple-negative breast cancer, squamous cell non-small cell lung, bladder cancer and adjuvant pancreatic cancer.","Recently the National Comprehensive Cancer Network or NCCN updated its practice guidelines for the combination of ABRAXANE, plus gemcitabine for treat, as a treatment for pancreatic cancer from category 2B to category 1.","We expect final overall survival data which is event driven from our Phase III study of ABRAXANE in metastatic melanoma during the second half of 2013. The 2013 calendar of Academic Cancer Meeting offer significant and numerous opportunities for new and updated presentations of clinical data for our portfolio.","Through April we have benefited by featured presentations of data in pancreatic cancer, multiple melanoma, AML and MDS. Next up is the American Society of Clinical Oncology Meeting in Chicago. We have currently worth approximately 50 abstracts on Celgene products that have been accepted.","Importantly, these abstracts provide data on one or more of our products across nine diseases and more than 20 unique clinical studies. We believe five abstracts are important and immediate clinical considerations.","In newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, the efficacy and safety of nPR compared with high-dose melphalan and stem cell transplantation, followed by a second randomization comparing REVLIMID maintenance versus placebo will help further define the benefit of REVLIMID maintenance therapy in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, and lower risk transfusion-dependent non-deletion 5q MDS, the transfusion independent response rate for the combination of REVLIMID plus erythropoietin will be reported.","Full responsive safety data from the REVLIMID mantle cell lymphoma study MCL over one plus data from two additional REVLIMID studies in patients with aggressive NHL and mantle cell lymphoma will be available.","Robust pharmaco economic and safety data about the use of POMALYST in patients with multiple myeloma and renal impairment was accepted.","Given the clinical concerns about renal function patients with multiple myeloma, this is critically important information and the abstract reporting updated results of our ABRAXANE phase 3 study metastatic pancreatic cancer has been accepted and will be in oral presentation. We are at the beginning of a new phase of growth driven by very good operating momentum. We have and continue to build opportunities for accelerated sales growth.","Throughout 2013 we expect global regulatory approvals for new indication that will support the growth of our existing products, to launch REVLIMID in new markets, to successfully launch POMALYST in the US and in Europe and to benefit from robust new data coming from studies of novel drug combinations. We are extremely confident in our full year outlook. Thank you very much and I will now turn the call back to Bob.","Bob Hugin","Thanks Mark and Thanks Jackie. The first quarter was a great start to 2013 as Celgene delivered excellent operating results and advanced our portfolio. We are energized by our progress to date and focused on our near-term objectives with multiple clinical and regulatory milestones throughout the remainder of the year. I want to thank all of my colleagues at Celgene for their dedication and commitment to delivering outstanding results and advancing our strategic initiatives and most of all for striving to improve the lives of patients worldwide.","I hope you will be able to join us either in person or on the internet for our upcoming analyst day on May, the 6th in New York City. This meeting offers us the opportunity to provide you with a more in-depth review of our research and development programs. Thank you for joining us today. Operator, please open the question to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Company","Mark, I just wanted to clarify on the MM-015 study it sounds like if you have the mature overall survival data in-house and did you confirm the positive trend in patients over the age of 75?","Mark Alles","So we confirmed the positive trend overall, but the trend that we are focused on is the less than 75 population and that trend is quite favorable. So we are beyond 50% events but I will just remind everyone that 50% is a bit of an arbitrary cut, we want that as a minimum. So we continue to follow and will continue to look at updated cuts of survival as we go forward. We thought that was the minimum threshold and we would look to continue to update appropriately and engage the regulatory agencies in the coming months.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Company","Just a quick one for Jackie if I may. You didn\u2019t mention any Q1 impact from the donut whole or patient assistance programs. Was that not a particular seasonal headwind this year?","Jackie Fouse","I think just on the coverage gap, the sequential change is a 11 million unfavorable for REVLIMID. So the actual number for REVLIMID for the quarter in 2013 for the coverage gap expense of $15 million, Q4 2012 it was 4 and Q1 of 2012 just way of reference also was 13. That was in line with our expectation, it is in a 11 million sequential headwind for REVLIMID.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with JP Morgan.","Geoff Meacham - JP Morgan","One for you on POMALYST can you give us a sense of for the line of therapy, is it mostly second or third line? I know it\u2019s early but I just want to get some initial feedback. And then maybe tell us so far where you think that patients are coming from, is it mostly REVLIMID or Velcade?","Mark Alles","It\u2019s Mark, it\u2019s an important question. So on our analysis first, it\u2019s important that virtually 100% of patients who were receiving POMALYST have previously been treated with REVLIMID. So that\u2019s the first metric. We believe that the vast majority of the patients are third, fourth line and given the recent introduction of (inaudible) we are aware that many patients are either finishing or switching from cuts follows-through POMALYST and then we see a dynamic where it\u2019s moving up.","Geoff Meacham - JP Morgan","Just to follow up on the myeloma franchise. I know you guys had talked about the filing strategy in the U.S. and Europe for newly diagnosed but how do you think about other regions beyond U.S. and Europe. Are you waiting on 020 to mature and to have four full packages or four full trials to submit? Should we think about say Japan or other regions as kind of the next wave for first line newly diagnosed as an opportunity? Thanks.","Bob Hugin","I think it\u2019s very fair to think about rest of the world beyond Europe, U.S. as a next wave. I think that\u2019s a fair characterization but what we\u2019re really doing is focused on getting a referenced country. So either the U.S. or Europe and following that we would have a cascade of other markets.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Schoenbaum with ISI Group. Please go ahead with your question.","Wes Nurss - ISI Group","Everyone, this is Wes turning in for Mark. Two questions, one was, I just wanted to specifically ask you didn\u2019t change the 2013 revenue guidance but you did change the EPS guidance. So I want to know what\u2019s specific line items below the revenue line changed?","My second question was regarding the CALGB data presented at the conference of [Quidel]. You mentioned that the benefit risk ratio was continued to be positive. I want to know if you had spoken or trying to speak to the regulators in Europe about that 50% mark?","Jackie Fouse","Wes, this is Jackie. Let me take the first question. So there are multiple drivers within the P&L dynamic of EPS growth. So given that we\u2019re four months into the year now, essentially we got a bit more visibility to our operating expenses. We feel like we can increase the EPS guidance now and be very, very comfortable with that work.","We feel quite optimistic about where our revenue was as well and very confident of hitting those revenue targets across the board as we\u2019ve outlined damages. There are more drivers of EPS we thought, we had bit more visibility to the overall P&L dynamics. There is nothing more than that. Maybe I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark on the CALGB question.","Mark Alles","Actually, I think we\u2019re encouraged by the updated analysis of survival from CALGB that included now more mature data on the crossover effect. The SPM rate has for all intents and purpose plateaued and matured but that was important to have as an update.","Our intent is to look now to segment newly diagnosed Myeloma regulatory consideration as well as the market into the elderly non-transplant eligible and still the still post transplant maintenance setting, the younger patients and we think that the IFM update later this year will be important.","But this composite of the four studies, 20, 015, IFM and CALGB remains a bit of an ongoing composite opportunity for us to consider what our final or comprehensive approach would be to a regulatory approval for REVLIMID in newly diagnosed myeloma. So nothings ruled in, nothing ruled out yet but we\u2019re very, very encouraged by the [Quidel] update.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges with Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.","Geoffrey Porges - Bernstein","Thanks very much and congrats on the quarter. Look -- so you keep talking on these four trials mostly. First on MM-020, you\u2019ve said recently I thought that the result could come as late as the end of Q3. Is that still your expectation? And has your expectations changed since you\u2019ve seen the analysis of CALGB in terms of what you think the outcome in those arms will be for the SPM rate?","And lastly, related to that, U.S. filing for maintenance, are you expecting to go ahead with just what you have now or are you going to wait for 020 or is that still up in the air? Thanks.","Bob Hugin","On MM-020, our pursuit is in ventures and analysis that we\u2019ve been talking about a lot. The timing continues to be on almost every other week to every month basis because it is event driven. So we are getting close to that protocol specified number but it really depends on when we would hit it, adjudicate those progression events and then turn it over to the BMC for final decision of unblinding. So we\u2019re in this window of two to three to four months where it's just very difficult to be more precise than what we have done. For your question about Q3, is that topical, I think it\u2019s in the range, yes, it\u2019s possible but exactly what the timing would be is other than what we are seeing today very difficult to pen out. And I can say we would expect it certainly this year but we are trying to narrow it down because we need that information as much as you do.","With respect to maintenance, the sort of the post-transplant maintenance environment, the survival data from CLGB is still only about 30%. We don\u2019t know what the ISM update will be at the end of the year but we\u2019re hopeful that, that would show survival as well. So then we would be looking at two studies robust PFS, a mature SPM rate we would expect because the follow-up on the two studies should be much longer than four years at that point. And then we would be able to put the benefit risk into the context of regulators whether it\u2019s the US and Europe for those specific indication of maintenance post-transplant.","Geoffrey Porges - Bernstein","What about maintenance, not post transplant but with the US, 015 or you\u2019re going to wait for it to\u2026","Bob Hugin","I think in US like Europe we would want to try look at the opportunity of both studies, not one or the other and see if again we could combine data or have one -- won\u2019t be supportive but I am happy that we have the opportunity to a potential 2.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas, Deutsche Bank.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank","Just on the POMALYST, you mentioned that (inaudible) the latest trial is growing faster, maybe you can give us an update on how -- what can be the earliest timeframe where you can get the date? And regarding the market opportunities, there is around 2.5 million patients, what percentage is treated? And then second, regarding your POMALYST for PALACE 4, how do you view the opportunity and when could we get the data in the naive population?","Mark Alles","Robyn, on the ankylosing spondylitis we had targeted originally early in next year that the ankylosing spondylitis trial would fully accrue, that was our internal estimate. We are probably close to six months ahead of that in terms of the speed at which accelerated in the last few months. We\u2019ve got a half -- at least a six-month follow-up after that. So we would see -- we hope to see topline data in that timeframe but assuming that the accrual continues these next few months and finishes again in the next few months, and then we will hopefully six months after that to see the data.","Bob Hugin","And PALACE 4, that is -- I think we are expecting that data imminently. So we\u2019d expect some top line results hopefully here in the next month or so.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank","And the market opportunities for naives and spondylitis what percentage of this 2.5 million actually get treated?","Bob Hugin","Yeah, I think that certainly with ankylosing spondylitis, there really has never been a therapy similar to POMALYST in terms of an oral opportunity for that disease. Obviously we have to see the data to know the magnitude of the effect and profile etc. before we could really quantify what that market opportunity is. But it is a tremendously unmet need that if we were to get positives, but we do get positive data it really does expand the opportunity very significantly for us and on the na\u00efve population I think that it's been rare that therapies in different (inaudible) have looked at this population because of the failed results that have been seen in rheumatoid arthritis etc. And so if we can show a positive result there, that also would be a significant market expansion for us. So I think again when we see the data, understand the durability of the data, the magnitude of effect, I think then if that turns out to be positive, it is another very significant expansion of the opportunity for POMALYST.","Operator","Our next question comes from Marshall Urist with Morgan Stanley.","Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley","Just two from me, one is for Mark. Could you maybe just clarify again what exactly plan on the non-transplant setting is in Europe, and you have seen 015 under 75 data, and when can you update us on kind of feedback from regulators on how they are working at now the combination of the trend, the trend in OS in that population. If you can give us into how that compares to the last -- I think we saw it was July of last year and kind of how that spell up, is it gotten better, is it consisting with what we saw last time?","And then second just for everyone, it would be helpful, ahead of the R&D date, maybe you can just highlight a couple of the things that you guys expect kind of most interesting drop from the pipeline side for people as we think about what we are going to hear then? Thanks.","Mark Alles","Marshall, it\u2019s Mark. Thanks for the question. So the regulatory discussion environment has always been dynamic, so we recently updated our analysis for overall and the target population less than 75 years of age. So we will begin to engage regulators, especially in Europe over the next coming months. So we schedule these events. We have a dynamic process, so we are on the front end of that. There is no question that as soon as we are able to update you on the progress of those discussions and the strategy for a submission on the transplant eligible population of Europe. We would speak to that.","So, I think it\u2019s a dynamic active environment and we are at the front end of that. I think the notion that we would in the interim, as we are having these discussions expect or hope that we would have other data facts including maybe MM-20, is important not just for us but the dynamic discussions with regulatory agencies. So we will update you when we can but we are at the beginning of it and we will see where we go.","With respect to R&D data, I don\u2019t know Bob or anyone wants to make the comment but I\u2019d just tell you our agenda is robust. We\u2019ve been working to bring together from our early research group, Tom Daniel shop, what I believe is a very comprehensive view of our alliances, the platforms we have across external partnerships, the very, very exciting data that\u2019s emerging around our global leadership in epigenetics. And these mechanisms that work around the macro environment of the epigenetic therapy. So we are excited about that.","On the hematology, oncology franchise, my colleague, Jean-Pierre Bizzari who runs our global research organization and then our new head of global medical affairs, Dr. Markus Renschler. We intend to go through a very structured well laid out view of the next five to seven years of how our hema franchise in line and then how our early drug pipeline would lay on top of that. So we are putting this together today but I hope to show up.","Bob Hugin","And also, we obviously will spend time to go through where exactly we are with apremilast, the opportunity there. So there will be a good I&I franchise review and also discussion of our focus in where we are in cellular therapy initiatives. So our goal is to give you a very broad based. There will be some financial components to it. So we will give you -- it\u2019s an Analyst Day not just an R&D day. So we will give you a good idea of our strategy, financial strategy and our business strategies of the franchisees, the research programs. So our goal is to give you the opportunity to hear what we are really doing more in depth than we will ever have the chance at the investor presentation or a conference call and the opportunity to make it interactive with the broader sense of set of Celgene leaders. So you really can get in-depth discussions, both from the presentations and in discussions with people throughout the course of the day.","Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley","Great. Thanks. And Mike, just a follow up, just on the most recent 015 analysis and even some qualitative comments on how it compares to the last cut in the under-75 from, I think summer last year?","Bob Hugin","So qualitatively, the trends remain positive and we think that the trends are supportive of the overall benefit risk that we need to be able to secure label expansion in Europe, ultimately secure label expansion in Europe.","Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley","Great. Thanks for the question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Raymond with Robert Baird. Please go ahead with your question.","Chris Raymond - Robert Baird","Thanks. It\u2019s more of a, sort of a macro question in terms of what you are seeing the marketplace. So, I know it is early days here since sequestration cuts have hit few reimbursements from medicare. But a lot of the oncology advocacy organizations have been making a big deal out of this.","I\u2019m just wondering if, since your hema offerings represents sort of an economic alternative to injectable, especially in multiple myeloma. Are you seeing any dynamics out there that you can describe in terms of what physicians are doing? Is there any sort of benefit that perhaps you can describe to the REVLIMID and other compounds in your franchise?","Jackie Fouse","This is Jackie. Let me make just a very high level for financial comment, I think this is a little bit early as we watch it play out. But you might imagine that when you look at the composition of portfolio versus maybe other companies in the industry you can think through what some of the issues would be and maybe some of the ways that we could be positioned well and in the grand scheme of overall sometimes difficult environment. But just from a very high level we take a look at the totality of what we think all of the impact could be of the current budget available, it\u2019s less than one half of one percent of Celgene global revenues that could be impacted by that. So it\u2019s a very modest impact that again I think relates to the portfolio of products that we have in the therapeutic categories in which we compete. Now Bob might have some higher level macro comment, Mark may as well.","Bob Hugin","I think with sequestrations specifically putting aside the budget proposals from the different entities, sequestration would be expected all things considered to have a slightly positive impact on orals compared to other programs just in that period through the October the 1st, after that it's really dependent on other issues in the budget and as Jackie pointed out so far we seem to be not having any kind of dramatic effect on any of the proposals excluding the Presidents which we don\u2019t think is included in either the House or the Senate budget proposals. So we will see but again not dramatic but if there is any benefit orals would be slightly preferred for the next four to five months.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rachel McMinn with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Rachel McMinn - Bank of America","I am wanting to follow up on ABRAXANE. Actually you had given guidance I guess earlier in the year, 600 to $700 million in 2013 sales, with the first quarter under your belt and looking now that lung (inaudible) how confident are you in your ability to exceed that guidance range?","Jackie Fouse","Just a short answer is very confident. We think we are going to have accelerating momentum in ABRAXANE over the course of the, and we like very much how we came out of the gate in the first quarter.","Rachel McMinn - Bank of America","And do you see the momentum primarily from pancreatic or is it a combination of things (inaudible)?","Jackie Fouse","The primary driver at this point in time is momentum behind the lung launch was occurred in the middle of fourth quarter, and now as we move into the first full quarter of that and I think Mark made some comments about share gains in that segment in the US in his remark. So it\u2019s mostly positive momentum from lung in the US and then as you saw on the international numbers not strong growth there from the continued expansion of the ABRAXANE product outside of the US. I think Mark\u2026","Mark Alles","And to that point, Jackie, just as a reminder, we were very pleased for (inaudible) where they received approval for it, not just lung cancer but also gastric cancer. So we have seen this incremental upside in the label expansion and of course we will benefit royalties from that opportunity. But I think the composite for ABRAXANE from geographic contribution from the lung launch which is really still relatively early and then Rachel, as you know, you and I were in San Francisco for the GI presentation on the pan data, that was late January and we really think the pancreatic market dynamic is that new patients starve versus existing therapy is really the sort of go forward opportunity for pancreatic cancer. Again, I am very encouraged the NCCN guidelines were updated to reflect the high level of evidence in category in support of the combination. So I think we are confident about the outlook for the year and we like the different elements coming together to support the brand.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets","Hey. Thanks. On 020 and we are doing a lot of work obviously on REVDEX maintenance versus the control. But of course there is also another arm with a fixed dosing regiment, I think, 18 months. Can you just give us some expectation, so that when investor see this, they know where we should be thinking about for the fixed dose, were you expecting what is you powered for, what the importance of that arm in thinking about the totality of the study? Thanks.","Mark Alles","Thanks for the question. So just as a reminder, so we are all on the same page, the study has 1,600 patients, little more than 500 per arm, arm A is REVDEX continuous, arm B is REVDEX for 18 months of therapy, that\u2019s the fixed arm and then MPT is the control arm which on a dose intensity basis is 18 months of therapy.","So we are looking for the primary comparison of arm A, so already continuous to the control arm and the study assumed 25% improvement in progression free survival, that approximately is around 30 months versus around 24 months for the control. So those are our assumptions.","It is our strong expectation that the two REVLIMID arms at 18 months will be superimposable because it\u2019s a same regiment for up to 18 months and then what we\u2019ve seen in many data sets that have been reported as soon as therapy is discontinued either for tolerability or in this case protocol defined stop progression begin. So we have an assumption built on arm A versus arm C and arm B will overtime show progression.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mara Goldstein with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead with your question.","Mara Goldstein - Cantor Fitzgerald","Great. Thanks very much. A question on ABRAXANE and on REVLIMID. On ABRAXANE, the inclusion in the company, does that change any of the marketing work that you can do prior to NDA approval of ABRAXANE in pancreatic cancer?","And then Secondarily on REVLIMID, the guidance for the year is about 10% growth, the first quarter saw 16% growth, and offsetting price and currency. So I was hoping that you might be able to give us some thoughts about any quarterly fluctuations, given that the overall growth guidance for the year is lower than what we saw in the first quarter?","Jackie Fouse","Hi, Mara. Let me take the REVLIMID question first, I mean, this is simply a function of the continuously increasing base for REVLIMID and when we start the year and do first quarter comparison. I think we maybe a little bit of ahead of where we expected to be. We feel very good about how we started the year. But I think you would expect that to kind of convert a bit overtime towards our 10% guidance for the full year. But we like where we are. We like the momentum as we started the year with REVLIMID.","Mara Goldstein - Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay.","Mark Alles","On the ABRAXANE question with respect to NCCN guideline update. It doesn\u2019t change anything that we can do commercially or from the marketing point of view because we don\u2019t have indication yet, so that doesn\u2019t have any impact. I think on the payor side there is a sense of confidence in that, if they would see a claim for the combination, they would recognize that it is supported by the highest level of evidence.","I think the other area that dynamically is evolving as I mentioned in my prepared remarks is that the investigator community in pancreatic cancer, some of the top thought leaders in the world are aggressively with our clinical resource organization to develop and launch an adjuvant pancreatic study, there is a lot of interest in advancing the clinical profile into the resectable or surgical setting. And I think the triple-negative opportunity and some other study opportunities really are where we are in the current lifecycle.","Mara Goldstein - Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay. All right. Thanks. And if you don\u2019t mind me asking on REVLIMID in France, where do you think you are at this point in terms of regaining sort of from a market share perspective in that particularly country pre-SPM versus post-SPM at this point in time?","Mark Alles","We are at and we think now slightly ahead of the pre-SPM time period.","Mara Goldstein - Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next questions comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs","Was wondering first just to follow up on Tom, if you can provide any color in terms of trends you're seeing in April versus March in terms of new add and then anything on combo, you just went out Prolyst, separately on a POMALYST, can you just remind us of potential sizing of the sales force, and when you might start to take those actions to build out the commercial site there?","Mark Alles","I will tell you the trends in April for POMALYST are accelerating and we do not see any use of POMALYST with CYPOLYST in the market and investigators are just high, we have a number of investigators in Kyoto who would like to see if for example, POM or CYPOLYST that might be somewhat superior indirectly to what people are already seeing with REVLIMID CYPOLYST. I will tell you that the RCD or CRD combination as it\u2019s called was very very well-received during the Kyoto, Japan meeting particularly in studies like smoldering myeloma and newly diagnosed myeloma. So I think the marketplace whether we are talking about academic research or combination therapy is really thinking that REV CYPOLIST vaccine could end up being the top regiment especially for high-risk patients or in the setting of newly diagnosed myeloma. I don't think that there is any real momentum around POM CYPOLIST vaccine yet. But of course over time that study will have whether it\u2019s 1, 2 or phase 3, it will happen at some point in the future.","And then on [Premalibs], the buildout accelerates in the second half of the year as we get closer to the launch time of the US and in terms of sizing, we have an opportunity at the analyst day to go into more depth and more discussions on some of these issues but slightly bigger investment on the dermatology side to cover that marketplace you are talking about 100 plus, maybe 120 and on the rheumatology side, on the arthritis side, you are taking about 100 maybe slightly less is this order of magnitude of the type of sales force that we are talking about now. As that plays out in the second half of the year we can continue to update you on more robust discussion on May 6.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ying Huang with Barclays.","Ying Huang - Barclays","On the slide, the parts the coverage gaps in the first quarter\u2026","Jackie Fouse","You\u2019re breaking out just a little bit, so I think I heard yes we did quantify that the dollar impact of the coverage gaps for REVLIMID in Q1 of 2013 is $15 million and that\u2019s an increase of $11 million over Q4 of 2012, it\u2019s an increase of $2 million over Q1 of 2012.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Abrams of Wells Fargo.","Brian Abrams - Wells Fargo","This is Matthew just call in for Brian. A couple on POMALYST for Mark, could you talk about the amount of revenues from inventory fill for first-quarter?? Second of all the rationale behind running the 009 and 010 studies for POMALYST (inaudible) studies and then lastly timing for POMALYST (inaudible) in Japan looks like there is a pretty dose escalation study ongoing?","Jackie Fouse","Let me quickly touch the inventory question, with the launch in the US you would -- we had -- or you would expect in terms of putting some products into the top line, we think the impact of that was probably in the order 6 to 8 million and now what we see is prescriptions catching up with that and that inventory coming down to what we would expect and over the course of the coming months and throughout the year it\u2019s going to come down to a normal level along the lines of what we would see with REVLIMID. So that\u2019s going as we saw it.","Mark Alles","Just a little bit of an extended comment on inventory. The level that we saw Jackie outlined a number was what we expected given the footprint of our specialty pharmacies in the U.S. So it\u2019s about what we expected with the respect to the expanded access protocol.","So [Paxil] 9 and then 10 for Europe, this is a very important of cancer drug development and I think if you look across different portfolios from cancer companies when regulatory certainty starts to become more focused or the opportunity is clear for the drug we approve, creating an expanded access program following the pivotal results you have and regulatory discussions.","It is really an important part of the launch as well as the access opportunity for patient. So I think the logic is that we want patients who have exhausted existing therapy to be able to, in a pre-launch period get access. That said the 09 study, the [Paxil] study did not have much participation really at all.","We had the protocol open for about six or seven months. But the participation was again what we expected but not a huge number of patients enrolled. Again I think it was the dynamic nature of drugs becoming available, Kyprolis became available and then as you know, POMALYST got to prove in a fairly rapid fashion.","In Europe, the access programs are expanding because with approval, the dynamic is a little bit different. We want to make sure we have access through the course of time, where we get reimbursement country by country. So that\u2019s the dynamic and the logic for Europe.","Brian Abrams - Wells Fargo","Great. Thank you. And then just Japan?","Bob Hugin","So we are conducting the bridging study. And we will once complete it and again have a reference country. We have the U.S. now but the European [DEX], which is very important. Remember in European, our [DEX] is supported by the survival benefit from MM-003. And that\u2019s really the international label including Japan that we would want to have.","Brian Abrams - Wells Fargo","Great. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike King with JMP Securities. Please go ahead with your question.","Mike King - JMP Securities","Good morning, guys. Thanks for fitting me in and congrats on a great quarter. I wanted to focus on VIDAZA if we could. Jackie didn\u2019t mention anything about expectations on the guidance for generic. So I just wonder if we could get a quick update on that and then I just wanted to ask also about when we might see the first efficacy of the oral VIDAZA and when we might see some, you mentioned in the slide some heavy generic programming, I guess, you could call it with VIDAZA. When might we see the first evidence of that data.","Jackie Fouse","Hi Mike. So the 2013 full-year guidance can accommodate a generic VIDAZA entrant here in the U.S. anytime in the second half of the year. That\u2019s how we put it together. Originally, it continues to be that way. Not much has changed but we want to be able to accommodate that should it come in the second half of the year. The latest date for our assumption of generic VIDAZA is competition in the U.S. and that is built into the targets that go up 2017 is the first of January of 2014.","And on the -- the other questions around oral azacitidine and Celgene are priming and things like that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Bob or Mark. You will see that as one of the key feature topic at our investor analyst day on May 6. So I think we are getting pretty excited about that program. Go ahead Mark.","Mark Alles","Yeah. Just to add, Jackie is exactly right. Thanks for the question. The way I would frame it as you\u2019ll see data at R&D Day in Celgene Oncology as well as existing data, recall that at ASH last year, M.D. Anderson reported on oral aza in a couple of abstracts and we can provide them to you following this conference call.","So there is some data available that we continue to update it and our enthusiasm for combination therapy as well as how we could build priming and sensitizing strategies with oral aza is growing.","Jackie Fouse","We have four of you left in the queue. And we\u2019re going to try and go and get all four of you. So, operator, please go ahead.","Operator","Our next -- are you waiting for the next question.","Jackie Fouse","Yeah. Please, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Roden with UBS. Please go ahead.","Matt Roden - UBS","Great. Thanks for taking the question. Good morning. Question for Jackie, in your 2015 and \u201817 EPS guidance can you talk about the various ways by which you could protect EPS if for any reason the top line scenarios don\u2019t play out as projected because I get a questions on this, I thought it will be helpful if you could talk about the ways -- what levers you could pull, to what extent you have flexibility to protect the bottom line number a wide range of 7%?","Jackie Fouse","So I think one thing that I would point it out first is that even when we think about the top line target now we have more and more drivers of that top line growth through an increasingly diversified product portfolio, increasingly diversified number of indications and increasingly diversified geographies. So even when we think about our ability to have some upside on things that might offset downside on things within the revenue portfolio, I think that is the one thing to consider. Beyond that, when you look at our P&L dynamic and whether you go back and look at how it\u2019s evolved over time and the company build up the global commercial infrastructure and what, that gives us the ability to do particularly on the size and scale that we have now and with that increasing diversification just focus model that we have on specialty position channel and the clear benefit profiles of our products, what you see is in the P&L we have positive dynamic of the gross margin level, those are modest and they are there and we have positive dynamics in the R&D line as a percent of revenue and the SG&A line as a percentage of revenues. We have large buckets of sand where we still got efficiency to capture, the leverage that we are going to get with additional scale.","So that\u2019s why you continue to see our results being driven by leverage as a operating profit line items in the P&L and that is going to be a story for a very long time, and you heard talk about going from 49% this year even while we are investing in the immunology franchise to 52 to 53% in 2015 and into the mid 50% right about 2017, all imminently doable. This is a multiple line items in the P&L that are contributing to that while we continue to invest for the long term future growth in the biz. As the NIM when you look at below that at the financial drivers obviously you know what is the assumption for share count of 430 million, you know what the assumption is for pancreatic 16.5 for spend which I feel very confident is not going to go up, maybe there is a little bit of room there over time as well. So a lot of levers to pull.","Operator","Our next question comes from Thomas Wei with Jefferies.","Thomas Wei - Jefferies","I just had a couple on MM20, how would you guide or direct us to think about the prospects on the overall survival and plain and then I wanted to see if you could help us with any interpretation of the delay in the times to the MM20, is that something that would have been actually expected based on prior historical data, (inaudible) that\u2019s very linear initially but then they start becoming non-linear when you got to the tail end of the curve, or is this something that given the timing of follow up, was unanticipated and so this population seemed to be obtained quite differently from historical cohorts treated with (inaudible).","Mark Alles","So the first part of your question was about overall survival and what we anticipate is that the overall survival in terms of a follow up on events would be rather immature given the nature of the population and of course the cost of the therapies that exist in the market, (inaudible). So there are number of dynamics where we would think the overall survival would be rather immature. That said, there will be an interim survival analysis done in conjunction with the unblindings. So we look forward to that as very interesting part of the analysis.","With respect to your other question, I suppose that if we had to bracket where we are we don't think that there is any change that has any sort of dimension to it that we don\u2019t understand, whether we talk about the population newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, the performance of MPT, what we would expect from [RV]. So really what we\u2019ve been talking about is, would we land sometime in Q2, let say, in the June timeframe or would we potentially land sometime in the August, September timeframe.","And I think our thinking is not change from what\u2019s been. The constant feature or factor variable that is driving all this is the rate with which progression events occur. So, I would leave it there and I guess, I would tell you that, as the study continues to mature, there are still our patients on therapy in arm A, which is another reason why the study continues to have this window for when progression events would occur.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Birchenough with BMO Capital. Please go ahead with your question.","Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital","Hi, guys. Two questions, just coming out of, one of the things we heard is, you guys are making a big push in China and folks were impressed with that push. So, could you maybe provide some guidance on the opportunity in China and always seems to be this market that never gets realized because it\u2019s just one-off and private pay? But how are you thinking about that?","And then just quickly on 020, in terms of what we should be focused on when we get the data? Is the median benefit important versus the hazard ratio and the reason I ask that is, as we get deeper into the tail of the curve, I\u2019m just wondering whether that 24 versus 30-month improvement at the median is realistic, is that still a goal or can we or should we expect something less? Thanks.","Jackie Fouse","Jim, it\u2019s Jackie. Let me jump in on China first. So, obviously, we are very excited about it because the REVLIMID approval in China is completely incremental for us, our team in China and Asia-Pacific are quiet excited about it. The -- we\u2019ve been in China for awhile now with great infrastructure and people on the solid tumor side with ABRAXANE already. So we\u2019ve the country platform if you will and are looking forward to the launch later this year of REVLIMID in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.","The -- to put it in perspective, I do think that we all have to look at, what other drugs have done in that market and it can take several years for you to get up to $100 million or over $100 million opportunity, which is a very nice opportunity, but let's not get carried away there in the grand scheme of the Celgene portfolio by 2027 that this is going to be enormous, we like it a lot because its incrementally positive adds to incremental growth, it will help solidify the platform there and with more products coming in the future, all those come the thing is we think it's going to be a very nice market for us, let\u2019s put in the perspective with everything else as part of continuing global expansion strategy for all of our product.","Bob Hugin","I think, this is Bob, just, in general as a corporate philosophy where we don\u2019t have experience, dramatic experience in the marketplace, it\u2019s appropriate for us to be relatively conservative in our modeling as to what the potential benefit can be to our long range plan and that\u2019s certainly the case for us in China. So, if any thing to our models, China would be limited risk and potential upside if we outperform our conservative expectation over the next five years?","Jackie Fouse","Really great; I think Mark has a comment on the 020 question.","Mark Alles","Yeah. Again, thanks. We absolutely believe that a different of six months or longer in progression free survival in this very, very important clinical trial is clinically meaningful and we have good contacts from regulatory agencies that a win on the primary end point with all the appropriate secondary end points, the analysis for safety that this would be quiet acceptable.","Jackie Fouse","And I think, so we have time for one last question operator please.","Operator","Our final question comes from Joel Sendek with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead with your question.","Joel Sendek - Stifel Nicolaus","Thanks from me and I\u2019ll make it quick. So on ABRAXANE it looks like you\u2019re not getting much growth out of breast cancer. I'm wondering is that how we should model it or is there still growth available there? And then on the refilling, can you give us -- I know this might be hard to answer, but can you give us any sense as to how long it will take the EU regulators to review the filing once you get it in, especially as you are starting to just talk to them now? Thanks.","Bob Hugin","So let me start with breast cancer, and then I\u2019m going to ask you to clarify the other part of your question.","Joel Sendek - Stifel Nicolaus","Sure.","Bob Hugin","So with breast cancer, what was very important, I think you know and everyone knows, there has been a dynamic window over the last 12, 14 months, following the CLGB breast cancer results that included Avastin in three arms that they trial. The U.S. market has been quite dynamic, trying to sort out between the arms and in the marketplace, what to do.","We were very encouraged that in the fourth quarter and then into the first quarter, the use of ABRAXANE in metastatic breast cancer in the U.S. market has stabilized, and we believe we can reaccelerate from here. Importantly, the rethrough of ABRAXANE gemcitabine in our metastatic pancreatic cancer trial has drawn the attention of the marketplace and investigators to look at the combination in triple negative breast cancer, which is a significant unmet medical need remaining because of the failure of multiple previous strategies to try to treat those patients in a more unique way.","We are pursuing that aggressively and have great encouragement from the same thought leaders involving CLGB trial to endorse the ABRAXANE gemcitabine clinical trial strategy. So we look for that to be supportive of a reaccleration in breast cancer. Your other question I just didn\u2019t hear the beginning of it. Could you ask it again?","Joel Sendek - Stifel Nicolaus","Sure. Just wondering how long it will take post the filing for in EU for us to or for them to make their regulatory decision, whether it will be accelerated given the fact that you are talking to regulators now or whether EU will require a full review?","Bob Hugin","Thanks for the question. I wish I can give you better color on that. But as I said, we are so early with the new data we have. There are a number of dynamics that we don\u2019t have time to get on the cost they, including for example some draft guidance, the European regulators were looking out to adopt over the summer that may or may not have implications for the new data like the data we are talking about on the 115. So, I think it\u2019s just too early to give any color on timing.","Bob Hugin","Let just assumed, I guess the conservative thing to do is assume once we submit standard review.","Joel Sendek - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Jackie Fouse","Thanks, everybody. Thanks for joining us today and we look forward to seeing you all on May, the 6th. Have a great day.","Bob Hugin","Thanks","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participation in today\u2019s conference. This does, concludes the conference.

We're delivering these results in spite of foreign exchange headwinds, seasonal buying patterns, and the dilutive impact of recent business development activities. The significant advances in our clinical programs and the important transactions completed during this quarter bode extremely well for our future. In a few minutes, the rest of the team will review the results of the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year.","Every year at this time, we conduct an in-depth strategic planning review. I thought it would be useful for me to spend a few minutes summarizing this review. We have a clear, focused, and aligned mission and vision, which is to discover, develop, and deliver transformational therapies to patients with unmet medical needs. Our review has revalidated our strategy of building value-added franchises, fueled by internal programs and innovative collaborations which drive near-term and long-term opportunities for significant growth.","In addition to affirming our mission, vision, and strategy, we have rigorously reviewed our operating strategies and performance. Our global operating model continues to deliver tremendous value and provides the foundation for sustained high growth. Though we'll continue to refine our global organizations, which commercialize our products in more than 70 countries, our investments are virtually completed.","We've also reviewed our financial strategies to ensure that our resources are allocated optimally for investments in internal programs, business development opportunities, and assertive management of our capital structure. We are committed to being vigilant stewards of our financial assets.","A significant focus of this process was to ensure that the key drivers of our 2020 and longer-term growth targets are in place. Our recent comprehensive review of current programs and near-term pipeline has strengthened our conviction and our ability to deliver on the 2020 targets. You'll hear about a number of the drivers that fuel our optimism on our 2020 outlook from Jackie, Terrie, and Mark.","As we look out beyond 2020, we are incredibly excited about the future we are building for Celgene. Our organic pipeline and strategic collaborations are laying an impressive foundation for the development of disruptive paradigm-changing therapies.","By the end of next year, we expect to initiate over 50 new clinical trials, doubling the number of our Phase III registration studies, and advancing between 10 and 15 new compounds to the clinic. This acceleration of our pipeline fueled by organic growth and the positive results achieved through numerous collaborations and acquisitions, including the 20 we have completed year to date, offers us the potential for more than 30 new compound approvals over the next 10 years. We look forward to providing more clarity on the extraordinary potential of our pipeline over the coming months.","This review of our strategic positioning, operating performance, and pipeline potential highlights the exceptional near-term, mid-term, and long-term promise of our programs. We're incredibly energized by the opportunity to turn this enormous promise into reality for patients. The state of Celgene is strong, and our future is exceptionally bright.","Thank you. Let me now turn the call over to Peter.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone.","Q3 was another excellent quarter at the top line and the bottom line, and it completes a rather active first nine months of the year. We are building upon this solid foundation of operational performance by making strategic investments in critical areas of research and further strengthening our internal pipeline through business development.","Since the beginning of this year, we have entered into strategic immuno-oncology collaborations with AstraZeneca and Juno in addition to broadening our footprint in the IBD space with the completion of the Receptos acquisition. These programs combined with our internal pipeline represent exciting next-generation growth drivers that are expected to meaningfully contribute to growth beyond 2020. We are able to make these investments for the future given our current operating momentum and the strength of our balance sheet.","So let's turn to the operating performance. As you see in our third quarter results, total net product sales grew 18% to approximately $2.3 billion. The growth was driven by exceptional performances from REVLIMID, POMALYST\/IMNOVID, and OTEZLA. Jackie and Terrie will provide more color on the underlying market dynamics for these products later on the call.","Strong demand for our key products is driving volume growth, which accounted for 16 percentage points of our 18% net product sales growth. In other words, volume growth drove nearly 90% of our revenue performance. There was also a negative 1.5% ForEx impact of approximately $30 million. Based on the year-to-date trends, we are fine-tuning our full-year sales guidance. We now expect REVLIMID net sales of approximately $5.8 billion and net ABRAXANE sales of $950 million to $1 billion.","Third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $1.23, a 27% increase over prior year, reflecting continued acceleration in growth as we deliver a leveraged P&L. You may notice that we reported a GAAP earnings loss of $0.04 per share, which is largely due to the accounting-related charges in our Q3 transactions for Juno, Receptos, and Nurix. A full reconciliation between our adjusted and our GAAP earnings is provided in our earnings press release.","Moving to the P&L, in the third quarter our P&L dynamics were great. As we indicated in our last earnings call, our top line momentum is indeed creating natural leverage on the SG&A line. And gross margin was favorably impacted by product mix, as REVLIMID, POMALYST\/IMNOVID, and OTEZLA combined for a larger percentage of total sales. These P&L shifts improved our adjusted operating margin by 250 basis points to 54.5%. We achieved this improvement while consolidating about a month's worth of Receptos' operations within our financial results.","Looking forward to our expectations for the full-year P&L, we continue to expect the full-year adjusted operating margin to be approximately 52%. As our pipeline grows, we anticipate R&D to grow in Q4 and in 2016, driven by increased clinical trial activity, especially as we initiate the Phase III trials for GED-0301, a broad clinical program for durvalumab across a range of hematologic malignancies, and the Phase III trials for ozanimod in both MS and UC.","In addition, we will see collaboration-related expenses such as milestone payments for the initiation of Phase III programs for luspatercept, AG-221, and potentially for some other rapidly developing programs. Finally, the Receptos operations will be in our organization fully each quarter going forward.","Now regarding taxes, a more favorable mix of U.S. versus international pre-tax income in addition to the impact of the Receptos operating expenses and interest expense from the debt offering drove a decrease in the Q3 effective tax rate. For the full year, we now expect the effective tax rate to be in the neighborhood of 15% to 15.5%.","Adjusted operating income was the primary driver of our bottom line results, accounting for $0.24 per share of the year-over-year increase. The benefit from a lower effective tax rate and diluted share count was largely offset by the increased interest expense associated with the $8 billion debt offering in early August.","Since Q3 represented a partial quarter for the new debt, the impact for a full quarter and for full-year 2016 will be larger. Accordingly, for your thinking about 2016 modeling, we expect total interest expense will be between $480 million and $500 million.","We ended the quarter with approximately $7.5 billion in cash and marketable securities. Now throughout the course of this year, we have already repurchased approximately $2.8 billion of Celgene shares and have $4.3 billion remaining under our authorized stock repurchase program.","To round out our financial performance, we conservatively assess return on invested capital using reported GAAP-based income both with and without cash in the capital base. So short term, our trailing 12-month metrics reflects the impacts of the Juno, AstraZeneca, and Receptos strategic transactions on our GAAP income. Longer term, we believe these investments, however, clearly create the opportunity for meaningful shareholder value creation.","In summary, the operating momentum during the first nine months puts us on track for a strong finish to the year and provides a solid footing as we enter 2016 and, most importantly, work towards our 2020 financial targets.","We are excited about the progress within our pipeline, both internal programs that are advancing and the new programs that we added to business development, which together further strengthen our future beyond 2020.","Thank you. Now I would like to turn the call over to my colleague, Jackie.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Peter. Good morning all.","We're very pleased with our hematology\/oncology 12% product sales growth this quarter or 14% excluding the impact of negative foreign exchange. For our three key brands, REVLIMID, POMALYST\/IMNOVID, and ABRAXANE combined, Q3 growth was even higher at 16% excluding foreign exchange. Our growth continues to be mainly driven by higher volumes coming from strong market share and duration trends.","For hematology, the global launch of REVLIMID in newly-diagnosed myeloma has been highly successful, and we'll look at some metrics around that in just a moment. At the same time, our teams around the world continue their strong execution with the ongoing geographic expansion of POMALYST\/IMNOVID. That expansion is just beginning and the product has a long, strong growth trajectory ahead of it. For oncology, our team is driving solid year-over-year growth for ABRAXANE. And the product continues its international expansion, led by ongoing launches in pancreas and lung.","In support of our mid and long-term growth objectives, we have further advanced our pipeline via internal projects as well as collaboration programs. Luspatercept is now moving into Phase III in both MDS and beta-thalassemia. AG-221 is moving into Phase III in relapsed refractory AML. Our five Phase III REVLIMID trials in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma continue to advance. And we are very pleased with our recent approval for VIDAZA in AML in the EU. Finally, the development program for durvalumab is moving forward with speed across multiple indications in hematology, and the closing of the deal with Juno adds complementary access to our existing pipeline.","REVLIMID's performance is outstanding, and sales growth for the quarter was 14% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. With this performance, we are raising our full-year guidance to $5.8 billion from the previous range of $5.6 billion to $5.7 billion. Volume growth is very strong, especially in the EU as we make our way through reimbursement negotiations related to newly-diagnosed myeloma. With those, we are seeing modest price reductions in line with our internal expectations.","International Q3 growth was all the more impressive given that we had no sales in Russia during this quarter after tender revenues there in Q2, when we had our first sales via the federal tender process. Excluding Russia, international sequential growth was plus 5% and year over year about 11%, or 16% excluding foreign exchange. It's early days for us in the Russian tender process. And in the future we expect Russian tender sales to occur in the second and fourth quarters each year, thereby somewhat affecting the pattern of our overall quarterly revenues.","Both share and duration trends are positive on the heels of extremely successful newly-diagnosed myeloma launches in both the U.S. and EU. In the U.S. we achieved record daily total Rx's in Q3 and have seen a steady upward trend in daily total Rx's throughout this year. We have gained approximately nine share points of new patient first-line share in the U.S. in the past year and are now over 60%. This is driving all-time highs in the total number of unique patients treated as well as strong duration trends, and we have gained about one month of average duration versus one year ago.","In the EU, we are seeing very strong early launch metrics in countries like Germany, Austria, and the Nordics, with outstanding share uptake in first-line myeloma. At the same time, we maintain leadership in second-line and stable share in third-line. In Germany, we have already reached over 20% first-line share in the non-stem cell transplant setting. We just received reimbursement approval in Spain in September and are now launching there, and we still have three major markets to come between now and Q2 of next year, so our large trajectory will continue to be strong.","Looking to the future for REVLIMID, we expect newly-diagnosed myeloma approvals before year end in both Japan and Australia. We anticipate important triplet data presentations at ASH that will further support the backbone position of REVLIMID in the treatment of myeloma and the treat-to-progression paradigm. And we will see our NHL program advancing, with a data readout anticipated from the REMARC diffuse large B-cell first-line maintenance trial in early 2017.","POMALYST\/IMNOVID grew globally 41% excluding foreign exchange, fueled by excellent volume growth coming from increasing duration across all major geographies and growing shares across Europe and Japan, with highly successful execution on our launches in those markets. In Europe, we just received our last major country reimbursement approval for Italy in September. And in Japan, we've had rapid uptake for POMALYST with third-line share already exceeding 20% in just a few months. The success with the POMALYST launch in Japan is setting us up well for the coming newly-diagnosed myeloma launch for REVLIMID. Ongoing launch momentum as well as emerging data on pomalidomide triplet regimens, where duration of treatment effects are increasing, are expected to continue to support strong growth.","ABRAXANE's growth in international markets is excellent, driven by the ongoing launches of pancreas and lung. U.S. Q3 sales reflect sequential customer buying patterns that we have now seen for the past couple of years as well as a highly competitive environment, particularly in lung, as the PD-1 inhibitors are showing rapid share uptake in this indication. In the U.S., the combination of ABRAXANE and gemcitabine has become a standard of care for first-line de novo metastatic pancreatic cancer, and we expect this evolution in Europe as well.","Given where we are with ABRAXANE sales at this point in the year, we are refining our full-year guidance of the product, and now believe it will come in between $950 million and $1 billion. This represents a year-over-year increase at the midpoint of 15%. We see ABRAXANE's future role in immuno-oncology combinations as very bright. Ongoing non-small-cell lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer trials are enrolling well, and we expect to see Phase I data updates for breast at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December.","Phase III data readouts for ABRAXANE in immuno-oncology combinations could start in 2017. In addition, our adjuvant pancreas and ABOUND lung trials are also enrolling well, and we look forward to the potential for expanded label indications in these cancers over time. Finally, we expect updated data from the GeparSepto trial to be presented at San Antonio Breast, and we are exploring regulatory options for label expansions based on the results of this trial.","We're looking forward to the upcoming ASH meeting in December and yet another year of strong presence by Celgene. The depth and breadth of our abstract submission continue to impress, and we have over 120 submissions this year across a wider variety of compounds than ever.","We are particularly excited about key data presentations from the SWOG S0777 trial, including the RVD triplet, and a variety of Phase III trials that will highlight novel combinations with REVLIMID included in a number of triplet regiments. We'll also see data for luspatercept, AG-221, AG-120, and Acetylon's ACY-1215 compound.","There's a growing body of evidence to support REVLIMID's clear backbone position in triplet regimens for the treatment of multiple myeloma, and the data is impressive. We're encouraged by the data coming out for REVLIMID in novel triplet combinations in relapsed refractory myeloma. And we have results, the first results, and you may have seen that the ASH abstracts are now out. We're especially excited to see the first triplet data readout in the newly-diagnosed setting with the RVD\/RD results from the SWOG S0777 newly-diagnosed trial, where PFS for the RVD arm reached 43 months and for the RD arm 31 months. This is the first triplet data readout in this setting, and the data is impressive. The PFS results are unprecedented. Furthermore, OS has shown a positive trend with a hazard ratio of 0.666. We believe these results demonstrate a compelling benefit for patients with myeloma, and we believe they have the potential to significantly impact the myeloma landscape.","Let me close by saying I'm very pleased with the performance of all three of our major brands. Across our myeloma portfolio, share and duration trends are globally positive, and we're in a great position as we move in the 2016 with strong momentum. ABRAXANE's position is solid, and the outlook bright for its place in the emerging immuno-oncology landscape.","We have a number of key catalysts coming over the next 12 to 24 months. These include: REVLIMID and POMALYST\/IMNOVID triplet data; readouts from REVLIMID Phase III NHL trial starting in 2017; ABRAXANE combination immuno-oncology trials advancing, with late-stage data possible starting in 2017; significant progress on our collaboration projects, including those with Agios, Acceleron, and AstraZeneca\/MedImmune. We expect to have a more diversified portfolio of indications starting by 2018 and new products starting by 2019, thus setting us up to meet or exceed our 2020 revenue targets. We look forward to seeing you at ASH.","Thank you very much, and let me now turn the call over to Terrie.","Terrie Curran - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Jackie, and good morning, everyone.","In quarter three, we continued to build strong momentum within the I&I franchise. In fact, we see acceleration in the U.S of both prescriptions and revenues which are ahead of our expectations. Strong results were delivered across all of the launch leading indicators. We're expanding our geographic footprint, with pleasing uptake in the early launch markets within Europe.","Now looking to Asia-Pacific, a positive registration study in Japan sees us progressing to file in the first half of 2016. In addition, key aspects of our registration program for GED-0301 are advancing, and the Phase III trial for ozanimod in ulcerative colitis and relapsing multiple sclerosis are ahead of schedule.","OTEZLA has delivered robust revenue of $135 million in quarter three, and launches are now underway in Canada, Germany, and multiple other European markets. The release of new long-term data from LIBERATE and ACTIVE studies continue to enhance both the efficacy and safety profile of OTEZLA for psoriasis and PsA patients.","Now focusing on the U.S. market dynamics, OTEZLA is significantly outperforming other category launch analogues with a further uptick in growth this past quarter. The DTC TV programming has had a significant impact on brand awareness, driving increased traffic to Error! Not a valid link..com and a twofold increase in patient requests for OTEZLA. OTEZLA continues to lead the PsA and psoriasis markets in new-to-brand share, and as such is rapidly gaining share in the total market.","OTEZLA is not only taking share from biologics, but is also expanding the market, with over 85% of patients being biologic-naive. We're also pleased to see OTEZLA patients have similar consistency to those on biologics, and rates are well ahead of patients treated with oral DMARDs.","So to conclude, demand, revenue, and all other launch indicators are ahead of our expectations, and we anticipate continued strong growth ahead.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Mark Kreston.","Mark Kreston - Celgene Corp.","Great, thank you very much, Terrie, and good morning to everyone on the call.","So you can see that it's really an exciting time for the I&I franchise, and we're also excited about the strong revenue growth behind OTEZLA. In addition to our strong revenue performance, we do remain very focused on operational excellence and advancing our exciting pipeline, so let me begin with an update on our GED program.","We're pleased to announce that we have now initiated the first of two pivotal Phase III trials, CD-002. As previously communicated, this study is a 52-week treat-through design, with the primary endpoint of CDAI [Crohn's Disease Activity Index] remission at week four. Other endpoints included the proportion of patients achieving mucosal healing at weeks 12 and 52, CDAI remission and steroid-free remission at week 52, and importantly, key patient reported outcomes on stool frequency and abdominal pain at week four, week 12, and week 52.","Our second pivotal trial, CD-003, will initiate in a staggered parallel fashion early next year. Completion timing is similar to that of CD-002.","The endoscopy study, CD-001, is actively enrolling, and we expect to complete enrollment by year end. As a reminder, this study has an off-drug observation period up to 52 weeks. We remain on track for data disclosure at a major medical meeting in 2017.","And then finally, we also plan to initiate the proof-of-concept trial in ulcerative colitis by the end of this year for GED-0301.","Transitioning to Receptos and ozanimod, now that we've closed the transaction to acquire Receptos, we've been working very closely with the dedicated and talented people of Receptos. We continue to rapidly advance the development of ozanimod in both multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis. So as many of you may know, the Phase III RADIANCE trial in MS completed enrollment earlier this year. We are very pleased to announce that the SUNBEAM study has completed enrollment well ahead of schedule. Both trials are now fully accrued, and we remain very pleased with our progress in advancing the entire MS program through development and toward registration and commercialization.","In ulcerative colitis, the 32-week maintenance results were presented this past month at both ACG [American College of Gastroenterology] in Hawaii and UEGW [United European Gastroenterology Week] in Barcelona. The data showed that longer-term treatment with ozanimod is associated with sustained and improving efficacy along with a consistent and favorable safety profile. I think it's worth noting that both of these were featured oral presentations at the opening plenary sessions, underscoring the importance of and the interest in these data.","The Phase III registration trial in ulcerative colitis, named TRUE NORTH, already has patient enrollment and randomization underway. And finally, the Phase II trial in Crohn's disease, STEPSTONE, has also been initiated. So you can see that we're very pleased with the progress being made to date and also the highly collaborative and productive efforts between the two organizations.","So in summary, we're very pleased with the strong revenue trajectory for OTEZLA and our results to date for the I&I franchise. We remain highly focused on operational excellence and execution of our strategy going forward. We remain committed to further accelerating the strong U.S. launch performance for OTEZLA, while also driving successful launches throughout Europe, Japan, and beyond.","In IBD, we are aggressively advancing the development of GED, ozanimod, as well as OTEZLA in ulcerative colitis. And our ambition is to create an industry-leading portfolio of highly differentiated novel oral compounds. These are very exciting times for Celgene I&I, with strong operating momentum going into 2016 and beyond.","And with that, I will now turn the call over to Mark Alles.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Thanks very much, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Before we open the call for questions, I'm glad to share with you my perspective on another excellent quarter.","At Celgene, everything we do begins with bold pursuits in science and an unwavering commitment to patients. Our company is unified by our mission to improve and extend the lives of patients around the world. We are successfully executing on our strategic plan to achieve this mission. Our teams are delivering strong operating results, keeping us on track to achieve our robust top line and bottom line outlook for the full year.","Outstanding execution by our commercial teams is driving improvements in key performance metrics, including the market access position for our brands. The significant competitive advantage we have established in the myeloma market continues to expand. In the short term, patients and our business will benefit from the global approvals that we are achieving for REVLIMID in newly-diagnosed myeloma and the expected U.S. and European approvals for multiple novel agents combined with REVLIMID for patients with relapsed and refractory disease.","Longer term, these clinical and regulatory successes put us in an advantageous position to rapidly develop our next generation of therapies for myeloma, including durvalumab, CAR T-cell therapy, the selective HDAC inhibitor ACY-1215, and two new immunomodulatory agents that are advancing into the clinic.","For many patients with solid tumors, the T-cell checkpoint inhibitors and other therapies that currently define the immuno-oncology field have been nothing short of transformative. While the enthusiasm for these products and the science is justified, important questions about patient selection and how to develop the most synergistic or complementary treatments are constantly emerging.","Our partnerships with AstraZeneca, Juno, OncoMed, and others have and will create multiple research strategies to explore and advance next-generation immuno-oncology therapies. By building on the anchoring position we have developed for ABRAXANE in combination with anti-PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies and addressing all aspects of the anti-tumor immune response in oncology and hematology, we intend to develop a much stronger leadership position in this important therapeutic category.","In many respects, the myeloid diseases MDS and AML provide the biologic and scientific proving ground for our dedicated research teams focused on epigenetics, immuno-oncology, and protein homeostasis. In epigenetics, CC-486 is in late-stage trials for MDS and AML. Related to protein homeostasis, CC-122 is moving into Phase I and Phase II studies in hematology. And beyond our marketed immunomodulatory drug REVLIMID in low-risk deletion 5q-minus MDS, we intend to fully explore the clinical potential of durvalumab in a variety of combinations and lines of therapy for patients with MDS or AML.","As Terrie nicely described, OTEZLA is gaining excellent momentum in the United States. Following the approval of country-based reimbursement agreements, we expect similar adoption trends in Europe and other major markets. We have built an outstanding team and the global capabilities to optimize the potential of OTEZLA in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. This investment continues to be validated and should provide substantial operating leverage for our next wave of I&I products.","With the advancement of GED-0301 into pivotal registration trials in Crohn's disease and late-stage trials for ozanimod in ulcerative colitis and multiple sclerosis, we are well-positioned with one of the most promising late-stage pipelines for severe inflammatory diseases.","Longer term, we are confident that our strategy to create and resource a highly unique and comprehensive network of scientists, collaborators, and academic partners will advance bold science, identify new therapies, accelerate development timelines, and add to our high-growth profile. With our partners, we have a shared commitment to identify novel mechanisms of action, new targets, biomarkers, and new molecules leading to highly effective treatments for the right patients.","Let me close by briefly addressing the important debate about pricing. We appreciate that the total cost of healthcare presents a constant challenge to virtually every country, provider, payer, and patient population in the world. But we also believe that therapies providing real value, measured in differentiated clinical outcomes, will continue to be recognized. These are the products that will earn strong market positions and that will be reimbursed for the value they bring to patients, especially patients with the greatest unmet and underserved medical needs. We are completely committed to discovering, developing, and commercializing the most innovative products with the greatest therapeutic value so that all stakeholders can benefit.","Thanks very much.","Robert J. Hugin - Celgene Corp.","There's one additional point I'd like to cover. Today it was announced that Perry Karsen is retiring at the end of the year. Perry has been a valued member of our senior leadership team and one of my most trusted colleagues. He's held numerous positions at Celgene, most recently leading our Cellular Therapy organization. I've thoroughly enjoyed working closely with Perry for over 11 years. I'm deeply grateful for Perry's many contributions to Celgene, his dedication to our company, and his tremendous passion for the patients we serve. We all wish Perry well in his retirement, and I would personally like to thank him for his service and friendship.","Operator, let's now please open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, thanks. Good morning, thanks for the question. I have an IO-based question for Jackie or Mark, and that is two parts. One is you did this huge deal with AstraZeneca on MEDI4736 in myeloma. That could be a huge drug, but we're not going to see data for a while. Is there anything that we could be seeing at ASH there to give us confidence that a PD-1 works well in myeloma and why you did that deal?","And then my second part of the IO question is ABRAXANE has been weak again. You made some comments about PD-1 impacting sales. Are you also losing sales because people are just going into clinical trials? What's going on there, and how should we be thinking about ABRAXANE as a driver given the changes in IO drugs on (36:08) cancer? Thanks.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","Hi, Michael. Thanks for the questions. Let me give them a shot; and if Mark or anybody else want to jump in, please. So with respect to the AZ deal, I think the abstracts are breaking out this morning. We didn't have access to all the data either, so we're looking at them the same as you guys are. The two that I would highlight in the IO space are the REVLIMID-pembro [pembrolizumab] combination and the pom [pomalidomide]-pembro combination. I believe in those abstracts you're going to see overall response rates in the REVLIMID trial of 76%. And in the pom-pembro trial, about 50% with the three near CRs in the pom trial too, very good partial responses and six partial responses, and the four VGPRs in the REVLIMID-pembro trial and nine PRs.","So just in terms of proof of concept, you see that data. You can see the rationale for the combination of IMiDs with checkpoint inhibitors in myeloma. Our AZ-Medi deal is a hematology-wide deal, so we have six trials that either are in the process of being initiated or will initiate next year across all indications, including myeloma. We will be running combination trials, and we'll start most likely with our existing assets of REVLIMID and POMALYST. And we have the ability to look at other novel agents that we have coming through the pipeline and potentially jump quickly with those novel-novel combinations. So I would think the basic rationale is highly compelling. And with AZ having a PD-L1, we think that these combinations may confer some advantages if this plays out. So strong rationale for the deal, obviously.","Quickly with respect to ABRAXANE, in the U.S. particularly, let me just emphasize that the launch trajectory outside the U.S. and what we see ongoing outside the U.S. coming off of a modest base that we'll have quite strong international growth for ABRAXANE as it becomes standard of care with gem [gemcitabine] in pancreas and takes its place outside the U.S. In the U.S., it's a very competitive environment, most particularly with the first wave of IO therapies in the lung indication especially and those single-agent therapies. We think that we've seen a big impact from that first wave.","Now we're all still waiting for the combination data in the IO space to mature, but we are very optimistic about what we are seeing in the early data for the combinations. You've seen a little bit of that in lung, and we expect to continue to see updates there with the trials being run by a variety of companies. And we're optimistic about the potential in breast as well, and you've seen some ongoing developments there. We think we'll see some data updates at San Antonio. So it is a highly competitive environment at the moment. We're holding our own with ABRAXANE in the U.S., but we have some good reasons to believe that the future of the product in these IO combinations is going to be very, very bright.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks, Jackie.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC","Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. As the myeloma paradigm evolves, you mentioned the increasing evidence for benefits of triplet combinations. We'll obviously potentially see the CD-38s enter the market. I'm wondering your thoughts on the impacts to share and pricing dynamics for REVLIMID and POM going forward. Thanks.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","Thanks for the question, Brian. I think we're in a great position because we have a very large and growing body of clinical data behind both REVLIMID and POMALYST. So these are well-known drugs to physicians, and their benefit has clearly been demonstrated in multiple, multiple clinical trials with this huge growing body of evidence behind them. Now as we start to see the triplet regimens read out both in relapsed refractory and with the first one in newly-diagnosed coming from the SWOG trial that you see in the ASH abstracts, we think there's significant support for treat-to-progression with these regimens and for clear benefit from those.","Given the mechanism of action of these drugs, they're highly combinable with a number of other agents, whether it's potentially CD-38, the checkpoint inhibitors. As we've spoken about in others, we think we're well-positioned with our portfolio of assets to deliver strong combinations there. We think that the market could play out with a little bit more segmentation of some of the different patient segments as we take these novel therapies forward and seeing in what patient segments they work the best. And what you see is the IMiDs being backbone of therapy regardless of what the combination is.","With respect to just the cost issue, we feel with the portfolio of assets that we have that we are quite well-positioned. Again, with REVLIMID and POMALYST in particular with that body of clinical data behind them to support them in their position in the marketplace, we think that as others come along, our value proposition is pretty well-established. When you think about the SWOG trial and have a look at that data and that RVD triplet performance in that setting, and then think about the loss of exclusivity date for VELCADE as this plays out, we've got the potential to see some triplet regimens that have significant benefit for patients and will have quite a good value proposition probably that plays out. And then the novel-novel therapies will take their place based on the value proposition that they offer for the patient segments that they are serving.","Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, Jackie.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Eric Thomas Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Maybe just a follow-up comment on the SWOG S0777 trial for Jackie. In terms of the data from a triple-combo regimen that's as strong as this, what kind of, I don't know, thumbnail sketch in terms of commercial potential could you give for us? I know that there's already a fair bit of use of these triple combinations in the front-line setting. But what sort of impact could this have?","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","I think what I would highlight first is, though, since the dissemination of the MM-020 trial results, we have seen continued movement in favor of treat-to-progression as the philosophy adopted by physicians. There's still up to 30% of patients in the U.S. that are not on maintenance therapy. So we think that that's probably the first way to think about this, is continued support for growing duration of treatment and even more physicians moving to that treat-to-progression paradigm.","And then some of the other things that we spoke about with respect to that particular triplet playing out within the landscape is what looks to be a triplet that has very good results for patients. And at some point as things evolve, the cost of that combination could represent quite a good value proposition. We think longer term that's something to keep in mind as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Hey, good morning, thanks for taking the question. I'm just wondering if there's anything you can say on the current duration therapy for OTEZLA and how that's evolved from earlier on in the launch.","And then quickly just on the strategic side of things, it wasn't talked about today. But I wanted to ask you about your recent board appointment of Dr. Julia Haller. I'm just curious if this has any read-through to an emerging interest in ophthalmology, or is there simply other broader strategic intent behind her addition? Thanks a lot.","Terrie Curran - Celgene Corp.","The persistence of OTEZLA we're really encouraged about. After the first month, once patients are acclimated to treatment and deal with access challenges, subsequent treatment is quite good and durable. Persistence today is similar to other biologics, and actually superior to oral demand (45:05). We're actually seeing over time responses are increasing, and so persistence remains very, very strong.","Robert J. Hugin - Celgene Corp.","And just a comment on Dr. Haller, just an incredibly well-respected and experienced clinician and leader in the whole healthcare field. So I wouldn't read anything into any therapeutic focus. But to bring another person of quality on the board that really has such expertise and experience in a broad range of healthcare issues and development of new compounds et cetera, it was just a great opportunity of somebody to bring that kind of expertise to the board. So we're very excited. I think we continue to be opportunistic on where we go, but I wouldn't read anything to the specific addition of her to the board. But we're very excited and glad that she's joined our board.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Mark Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys, thanks a lot for taking the questions; as usual, great P&L management, Peter and Jackie. I have a couple questions. The first, I just wanted to get your reaction to the more detailed data presented by Biogen and Mitsubishi on their S1P1. They believe that their molecule is differentiated from the one you acquired from Receptos in that it doesn't need dose titration at all, and I was wondering if you had perspective on that data that were publicly presented.","And then just a question I ask every few years, as Jackie knows, but I feel that it's due. And that is that year to date, you guys have spent $1.34 billion on upfront R&D costs which have not been recorded in your non-GAAP R&D line. Your non-GAAP R&D expenses have been $1.4 billion. So now we've reached a point where about half of your cash flow out of the company for \"R&D\" is sort of off-P&L. Is this the right run rate we should be modeling going forward? And maybe just given all the scrutiny around accounting across the industry right now, maybe just another opportunity for Jackie or Peter to explain why you do this. And you've been very transparent about it. If you need to figure it out, it's on slide 29. But maybe just help us think about a run rate going forward and explain to us again your rationale for doing this. Thanks so much.","Mark Kreston - Celgene Corp.","All right, great. So, Mark, it's Mark Kreston. Thanks very much for the question on Mitsubishi and our perspective on the data. So I think what's important is a reminder that, as we've gone through the process of evaluating Receptos over a two-year period, we had a chance look very deeply, very comprehensively at the full landscape of S1P therapies, and there are a number. Mitsubishi was clearly one of them, but there's Serono and Actelion. So we felt really very comfortable and very confident when we looked at all the data, at the combination of what we saw. And obviously in diligence, we have been privy to additional data that's not yet public. But we feel very good about the profile, about the differentiation. And listen, it makes good sense. I think we said publicly that Biogen doing that deal, for them that's important. But for us, we really stand by having the right profile.","The other comment I would make, as a reminder though, is that we're also well advanced in Phase III. So there's also a timing component to this program. So we believe that between the data we see and the differentiation we believe in the timing that we've placed our investment in the right place.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","And, Mark, this is Peter. I'll take your second question. And so we are very excited about the future and the potential of having a pipeline that can really set us up for long-term growth. There's no question that we made some meaningful investments this year in the transactions with AstraZeneca, Juno, Receptos. We've spent a lot of time year to date talking about them. We feel very excited about what that means.","And in many ways, if you think about it, AstraZeneca and Juno, those are really foundational step-in opportunities for immuno-oncology. And in many ways, we're working with a couple of companies that have done tremendous work so far, have developed great portfolios, and we wanted to in a sense buy into those transactions. And so I think the way we've positioned them is very appropriate.","As you know, I know we've talked about this in the past. Really when we do some of these in-licensing and collaborative relationships, there's a combination of reimbursing the other party for the great work they've done and in a sense buying into the portfolio they've developed at that point. And then once that transaction is done going forward, we're partners, and we run a lot of those activities through our P&L, whether it be through milestones or the types of trials that Jackie has talked about that we're going to be doing with durvalumab. And so in many ways, we view it as up front we're buying in, and that's very acquisition-like in the way that we treat it. And then once we have that relationship, it's part of our operation. Depending how it's particularly structured, we then run those charges and milestones and so forth through our P&L.","I think there's no question that going forward we may not see this kind of a bolus of spending as much. Clearly we seize the opportunity, as Bob has talked about many times, if we see the right opportunities. It's really a question of the quality and the opportunity that we see. There's no question that immuno-oncology, that space has just opened up tremendously, and we want to be part of it. We are partnering with many different players with our existing assets. But we also wanted to play a role in hematology, leading the charge there, as Jackie talked about. And obviously, Juno is great, great future technology. So in many ways, I'm not sure that we'll see this kind of a trend over every quarter. I highlighted on the Q2 call that Q2 was exceptional. But on the other hand, we will pick the right opportunity, but I think 2015 should be marked as really the year we did a tremendous step-in into the immuno-oncology space.","Mark Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","And if I'm reading the press release right, your guidance implies zero of this in the 4Q. Is that correct, Peter? And I'll drop off, thanks a lot.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Zero of this in the 4Q. So I guess you're asking will there be more deal flow?","Mark Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","You're already at, if I'm reading the press release right, this $1.34 billion you've spent year to date is basically what you guided for, for the full year, this off-income statement R&D spending.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Oh, yes, so it's hard. In many ways we don't really quite guide exactly future transactions and so forth, so it's awfully hard for us to say. But I think look, as we've highlighted in the comments today, we're digesting a lot of things. Actually, we're just thrilled to have this going. AstraZeneca clinical development plan is in great shape, as Jackie talked about. As Mark commented, Receptos is accruing trials in MS ahead of schedule. It's going extremely well. But certainly, everybody is hands-on and very busy. If another opportunity came up, we might be interested in it. But at this point, we're really fully deployed.","Mark Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Okay, congrats to Scott on a much better OTEZLA launch than a lot of people, including me, thought, good job.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Roden of UBS. Your line is now open.","Matthew Roden - UBS Securities LLC","Great, thanks for having me on the call and congrats to Perry on a great run at Celgene. I'm interested in your comments on the recent strategic review and that you have strength and conviction that you can hit your 2020 targets. So it sounds like maybe your view on the 2020 targets might be evolving. Just wanted to see if that's true. And if so, would the new year be a natural time to either update those 2020 numbers, or perhaps would there be an indication to actually roll it forward to 2021 to keep a five-year view out there?","And then also related to your intro comments, you mentioned that the infrastructure investments that you've made are practically complete. So should we be looking for meaningful SG&A leverage over the next few years as you continue to grow revenues on top of that infrastructure? Thanks very much.","Robert J. Hugin - Celgene Corp.","Thanks, Matt. It's Bob, and others will add in, in a moment. I think just on the infrastructure commentary, you know what, I think that we think about the leverage that we've achieved in our organization over the last couple years has been very significant, and Peter and Jackie have continually commented on that. I think we do still have room for that opportunity to bring other products through there. So operationally we're in a great position. It differentiates us from others who want to bring new products to market. And so we think just strategically that those investments were incredibly important and incredibly valuable to our long-term growth and position us extremely well. And I think financially, Peter can add some comments. He already did add some comments on it.","In terms of 2020, any of the targets that we set for ourselves in terms of what we see the potential of our portfolio to achieve, we always are re-examining it as new data and information comes out. When we did the deals in terms of inflammatory bowel disease, we in fact raised fairly significantly the revenue outlook for 2020. I don't want to commit to what we'll do or not do at other conferences that come up. But as we see information that we believe we have an advantaged perspective in a material way, we always look to be as transparent as we can and give that kind of information to let you draw your own conclusions about what you think about the opportunities that we have.","We feel very good about 2020. From a bottoms-up approach, we've looked at it. We've looked at it strategically from external opportunities and challenges. And so we continue to evolve it. We'll continue to examine it. And if there are any types of material changes to it, we'd update you on that.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","And if I \u2013 hi, Matt \u2013 can just jump in and highlight a couple of things particularly that are not included in the current base case model for the hematology\/oncology franchise, and there are some other lesser things as well. But the two I want to highlight, the opportunity for ABRAXANE in immuno-oncology combinations has not been captured in that base case forecast, and the opportunity for things to come out of the AstraZeneca\/MedImmune collaboration has not yet been captured in that forecast. And you can say okay, the latter one is a little bit farther out.","We will at ASH try to give as appropriate a bit more visibility to all of our programs, our development programs. And particularly, we will spend some time at the investor event on the AstraZeneca\/MedImmune program and what that clinical development program looks like. I'll give you little bit more detail for that and what we think the timelines on some of these things could be. As you know, in our base case assumptions, we always assume standard regulatory approvals, and there are some opportunities for potentially acceleration. So we will walk people through that.","Matthew Roden - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Samir Siddhanti - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, this is Samir on for Terence. Thanks for taking the question. For ABRAXANE, given your updated 2015 guidance, can you comment on your confidence level in your 2017 guidance and what needs to happen to achieve it? Thanks so much.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","Thanks for the question. So if we go back to the time of the acquisition, I think we had a range in our forecast for this year of $1 billion to $1.25 billion, and the number for 2017 is $1.5 billion to $2 billion. This year we are going to be just under the lower end of that range. Many years ago when we did that, it actually held up pretty well for quite a while. I don't think we had a full appreciation for the impact of the checkpoint inhibitor class coming to market. Now where we see that, we think we're in a great position and holding our own, particularly in the U.S. We'll have good growth outside the U.S.","It's very possible that when we get to 2017 and when we think about our 2020 targets that we have a different mix of revenues. We're highly confident in the forecast that we have overall for the hematology\/oncology franchise, and the mix between hematology and oncology could be a little bit different.","Again, we have not factored anything into the model for the opportunity associated with ABRAXANE use in combination in the IO regimens. The early data in lung we feel is quite encouraging and are anxious to see that play out. And we're cautiously optimistic or somewhat optimistic, I guess I would say. We just haven't seen enough yet to make a definitive statement about it. But about those combination therapies, the potential in breast, particularly in the triple-negative setting, and none of that's in the model yet because we think it's too early to call, though we could start seeing that data and even usage potentially in 2017.","So again, mix a little bit different, overall heme\/onc, highly confident in our ability to hit our forecast in 2017 and 2020 and, fingers crossed, potentially exceed them.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning, thanks for taking my questions. To the extent that you can answer the question because I know many investors really are wondering what your latest thought would be for the REVLIMID Natco settlement potentially with Allergan, especially now that Pfizer and Allergan are in the play here. Also, we know the fact that the end of the discovery phase has been pushed back again to January of 2016.","And then secondly, maybe this is for Jackie. Now that you have secured reimbursement for REVLIMID in front-line myeloma in two countries in Europe, can you talk about the pricing trends there in Europe, and then whether you're seeing any impact from generic VELCADE in Europe or not? Thanks.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Yes, thanks for pointing out that discovery has been extended on the Natco REVLIMID litigation. There really isn't anything that I can add to what's already been discussed. But as anything new comes up, we'll certainly keep you informed.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","Hi, Ying, it's Jackie. Thanks for the question on Europe. So we have been \u2013 we are very happy with where we've gotten to with the reimbursement negotiations. I just would highlight one more time, I think everybody knows this, but this is a staggered process. So when we think about a launch of a product in Europe, we have early access markets, and Germany is a big one. The other ones are relatively small. And then you go through the process, and so you're not really in full-blown launch trajectory mode until you get all those major countries. So we're still early days in newly-diagnosed in Europe, but it's going extremely well.","What we're seeing so far this year if we look at the year to date, overall outside the U.S. price impact on REVLIMID, it's around 2% to 3%, again, for the nine months year to date, so I think you need to look at these on a full-year \u2013 on a year-to-date basis. And if we look at overall, the price impact in the international environment has been about 3.5%, so we get a little bit of price impact on some of the other products as well, including POMALYST\/IMNOVID, after it's been in the market for a little while. In Europe, the numbers are maybe slightly higher, 0.5 percentage point, so around a 4% price decline across the portfolio in Europe. We had factored that order of magnitude of price decline into our forecast. So we feel like we're right where we want to be.","With the clinical data, we're seeing extremely good share uptake in the front-line setting. And as we showed you in the slide presentation, we're holding share in the second-line and third-line settings as well. So I would say your question on the VELCADE generic impact, not seeing too much at this point in time. And again, we're very encouraged by the emerging triplet regimen data and the way we think this myeloma landscape is going to play out across the globe.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I've got a couple. So OTEZLA, obviously you guys have stepped up commercial investments to raise awareness. But when would you expect to see this decelerate a little bit? In other words, when would you expect to see a little bit more P&L leverage from OTEZLA, particularly in the U.S.?","And then on REV in newly diagnosed myeloma, when you look at the big five in Europe and even Japan for next year, how much of an impact do you think the budgeting process over there will have, or is that really not as much of a factor just given the relatively low share that REVLIMID currently has in newly-diagnosed? Thanks.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Geoff, let me start. This is Peter, and I'll turn it over to Terrie for some comments. So when we talk about SG&A leverage, really a lot of times we're talking about more about building out the infrastructure around the world and then driving great volume and revenue through that infrastructure, and our global teams have done a fantastic job building out with great capability. And then as we roll out other products, they handle it beautifully.","Really at this point, we've got tremendous leverage in the heme\/onc franchise. The I&I franchise is building in Europe but they're getting some leverage as well because we coordinate a lot of that team effort. When we have an opportunity like OTEZLA, though, obviously we're just building our position to market. So I'll turn it over to Terrie, but I think that's not necessarily yet an opportunity or a thought that we would have for leverage really because we're really seizing an enormous opportunity. Terrie?","Terrie Curran - Celgene Corp.","I think we're still early in the launch. But for this early, we really are saying that all of our early metrics are strong, whether you look at share of new patients which is over 35%, our overall share. Our requests for OTEZLA, it's very strong. Some of the investments that we're making are really driving demand and laying a solid foundation for a blockbuster product in the future.","Robert J. Hugin - Celgene Corp.","And, Geoff, it's Bob. Just being involved in some of the investment decisions about it, there is a strong return on investment thesis that underpins all of the investments that we're making and the fact that we've accelerated some of these only because we actually believe it's returning a very attractive investment to us. So I think we're actually ahead of the kind of return that we had hoped to get out of the franchise, and the investments that we're doing are just accelerating that return. So we feel very good about where we're investing and the returns on those investments.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","Just on the other question that you had around governmental budgeting processes, I think it's what was related to in the big five countries in Europe and also in Japan, how we see that in 2016. We still have \u2013 actually, I think there's going to be limited impact from that. I think we know pretty much what the ranges would be for outcomes in the reimbursement negotiations in the big five countries that we still have remaining in Europe. We already have Germany. REVLIMID was in the market before AMNOS (1:04:53). We don't have to go through any pricing review in Germany. We've got the Spanish approval that we just got, so we've started launching the product in Spain in October. And we still have France and Italy and the UK to come over the next two or three quarters, and we're well underway with those discussions.","The value proposition for REVLIMID continues to get stronger and stronger as more data comes out of any of these trials that we're seeing for the drug. So we feel quite good about that and don't think there's anything specific in a given budgeting process that would impact us more than we've already built in.","From a Japan standpoint, 2016 is the every two-year review period, and we would already have taken something into consideration for that in our forecast for 2016 as a potential for a price decline, so that would be built into our numbers already. For the last couple of cycles we have not gotten any price decline, but we'll also be thinking about coming forward with the newly-diagnosed launch in Japan and what that dynamic will be around that as well, and we've built anything around those negotiations into our forecast when you eventually see our 2016 numbers.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got you. Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mara Goldstein of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.","Mara Goldstein - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Thanks very much, a question on ABRAXANE. Do you think you could at least share qualitatively if not quantitatively the split on ABRAXANE between non-small-cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer and breast, and where you see those growth rates at?","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","I don't know that we want to go into that degree of granularity.","Mara Goldstein - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","You can't blame a girl for trying.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","No, I don't blame you at all. I'll let Patrick opine on that a little bit. Let me just say from a dynamic standpoint, though, as you've seen, in that impact patient population group, we've reached 50% share in pancreas in the U.S. And so the AG regimen is definitely a standard of care for pancreas. So once you get to that point, obviously, you have limited impact from further share gains and things like that. So we'll still have good growth. The growth outside the U.S. is very, very good. The one other thing...","Mara Goldstein - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Across all the indications?","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","Across all indications, yes.","Mara Goldstein - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","Maybe more \u2013 it's stronger in pancreas. We're early days of the lung launch, so from a modest base you're going to see strong growth rates in lung. As that ramps up, it will take some time because we have to go through reimbursement there as well. With pancreas, we only have one major EU country left to go, and that's France. We have it in the other four though. We're dealing with the same things that everybody else is in the UK with that situation. And breast is cranking along relatively well outside of the U.S. But again, the growth is going to be good from a modest base.","In the U.S., I think the team is doing extremely well. We've seen impact particularly in lung with the share uptake for nivo [nivolumab] and others, but we also have seen some impact in the other usage of the product outside of those three indications where you've had some other products come to market in ovarian, for example, and we would have seen usage of ABRAXANE go down in some of those other indications.","We are quite excited also about the potential opportunity with our adjuvant pancreas trial that we have going on that's enrolling extremely well; and the ABOUND program across lung, where we should have some data in 2017 starting to come out of that ABOUND program. So lots of great things going on for ABRAXANE. We're in a little bit of a tough competitive environment for the moment, particularly in lung in the U.S., but we're holding our own.","Mara Goldstein - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay, and if I could just ask a different question, and that is on the cellular therapy, not because of Perry's retirement, but since it's topical today. Can you talk about what the strategy is for that and whether that gets visibly bigger inside the company versus outside, and how it lives and exists in the current R&D strategy?","Robert J. Hugin - Celgene Corp.","Thanks for the question. I think it's appropriate, especially with Perry's impending retirement. I think we remain incredibly optimistic about the future for cellular therapy, but we have to prove it. And so we're focused in clinical trials in diabetic foot ulcers, and we're looking at other areas where we think there are legitimate opportunities for us. But it has to be proven. So it continues to be an area of focus for us, but we're certainly not going to be increasing our percentage of investment there until we see some clear controlled data supporting it. But it doesn't change our view that over time we're going to see that as an important component in a wide range of therapeutic areas.","Mara Goldstein - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Newman of Canaccord. Your line is now open.","John Newman - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi, thanks a lot for taking my question. I have a two-part question, if I could. The first is what are you seeing in terms of the compliance on OTEZLA? Is that within the expectations that you had when you launched the product of generally around 40% to 50% in an investigative scenario?","And then the second questions is on pricing. My question is do you see within the industry a desire for a path forward to address the fact that companies are limited in the assistance that they can give to Medicare patients in terms of the co-pay? Thank you.","Terrie Curran - Celgene Corp.","On the first question regarding compliance, now that we've been in the market for some time, we have a significant database that we can look at to look to see how patients are complying and persisting with therapy. What we're seeing playing out is that the compound is being very well tolerated, that the incidence of GI in the first couple of weeks is very low, and that we're having more than 75% of patients comply with therapy at the 12-month point, so very positive.","Robert J. Hugin - Celgene Corp.","And just on the pricing issue, the copayment issue, and as you \u2013 those are all incredibly important issues, and there's clear differentiation between market segments as to what type of activities are permitted and what are not, so there are generally quite clear guidelines.","I do think across segments that patients who have a financial need are well supported, and I think that we've got to do a better job as an industry to ensure that they understand the opportunities that are afforded to them in terms of getting access to medicine and support for copayments. So I think there has been tremendous improvement in terms of patient access from a copayment point of view. And we live with the limitations of one segment versus another, but I think overall, it's not as bad as it could be.","I do think we have to recognize that we've got some structural issues as a society we've got to face here; that some of the specialty tiers and copayments and coinsurance are really discriminatory against people who suffer from serious diseases. And we've seen some improvement in the AIDS tiering of specialty pharmaceuticals, and there are lots of initiatives about oncology patients being discriminated against because of the structure of specialty tiers, et cetera. Lots of issues we've got to deal with, including step edits that we see programs that require patients to go through products that might not be the best for them before they can get the best therapies. There are activities on the state level dealing with that.","So this whole issue, both structurally the industry needs to be more aggressive in supporting the kind of progressive policies that ensure access to innovative therapies for patients, and we must do a much better job of articulating the logic and the rationale behind our investments in innovative therapies, the benefits of that, and the risks that are taken if we don't encourage the kind of investments that need it and access to patients for those innovative therapies. We've got a lot of work to do. I think the headlines are a little bit worse than the underlying substance, but that's no reason that we should take anything but be incredibly serious about what needs to be done both from a perception point of view and substantively fundamentally.","Patrick E. Flanigan III - Celgene Corp.","Operator, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Skorney of Robert Baird. Your line is now open.","Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate you fitting me in. Scott, we've talked a little before about the plans with CC-292, and I just wonder. Coming off of some recent conferences and MS data, particularly around ocrelizumab, just your thoughts on the role of B-cell targeting in MS, and if you think there's any potential to move CC-292 into development in MS given this evolving thought process for MS treatment.","Mark Kreston - Celgene Corp.","Thanks for the question. Maybe just as a reminder, the current program on CC-292 is a BTK inhibitor. It's in rheumatoid arthritis. That's the initial proof of concept. That's the area where \u2013 but we are obviously looking expansively in other autoimmune indications. But right now, the lead has clearly been for proof of concept in the rheumatoid arthritis space.","Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, thanks.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Thank you for the questions. This is Peter. I'll just make some final comments. We're very proud with our work year to date here at Celgene, very excited about what we've set up for our future. Operationally, you've seen today that our top line is strong. It's been volume-driven. It is great market share performance across a number of different fronts, and we've really coordinated the P&L to provide good leverage while still making very, very important investments today and going forward in R&D.","Strategically, I think we all have to see that we've made a lot of moves during 2015 and more to come. We now have a tremendous pipeline of assets to drive. As Bob said in his opening comments, we're shifting a lot of programs now into Phase III. 2016 is going to be a tremendously exciting year as all those programs get rolling. And those are both the deals that we have done and we've brought in assets from the outside, but also our own organic pipeline. Either things that have come from our own research engine or from our collaboration partners are all moving ahead and creating a lot of excitement. So we're looking forward to seeing you all at ASH. We're looking forward to seeing you as we go through the end of the year and finalize our view for next year. And we will have more to talk about that I think is very exciting for the future. So thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. That does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect.

It\u2019s an important and exciting day for us as we announced a very promising addition to our late stage pipeline. The attainment of significant regulatory milestones, demonstrable progress in advancing our internal and external pipeline programs and solid first quarter results.","Our teams across the globe produced excellent results while advancing strategic corporative initiatives. Our commercial teams increased product sales by 19% year-over-year, with total revenue rising by 18% to $1.73 billion. The leverage of our operating model was further demonstrated by the 113-basis point improvement in our operating margin which contributed to a 22% year-over-year increase in adjusted earnings per share.","These excellent results were achieved while absorbing the full impact of generic azacitidine in the U.S. another first quarter specific events that Jackie will review. Based on solid first quarter results and the strong underlying demand across our product portfolio, we\u2019re confident on our outlook for the remainder of the year.","Several important achievements through the quarter strengthened our growth outlook. We announced the U.S. approval of OTEZLA for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis on March 21. In a moment, Scott will review the progress of the launch.","We also announced this morning that we have accomplished the important milestones of submitting regulatory applications in both the EU and in the United States for REVLIMID as a treatment for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.","Tangible progress was achieved in multiple pipeline programs. Partnered programs from Agios and Acceleron were highlighted at recent medical meetings, very promising data were presented at the American Association for cancer research meeting on AG221, the first in class potent inhibitor of the IDH2 mutant protein implicated in multiple malignancies.","Our teams are accelerating development plans right now. Encouraging interim Phase II data were presented at the National Kidney Foundation meeting treating chronic kidney disease with Sotatercept or ACE-11.","We\u2019re advancing our Acceleron collaboration in not only chronic kidney disease but also MDS and beta-thalassemia.","Important late-stage programs studying REVLIMID oral azacitidine and ABRAXANE, numerous indications advanced during the quarter.","Our internally generated early-stage pipeline achieved milestones including the initiation of clinical studies with our JNK inhibitor targeting Fibrotic diseases and the completion of dose range finding studies for CC-220, our new and inflammatory directive image. We plan to initiate Phase II trials in Sarcoidosis and Lupus with 220 later this year.","Exciting new collaborations would abide in FORMA Therapeutics were established, further enhancing our diverse and deep pipeline.","This gives frequent opportunity to be able to add a potentially transformative late stage asset to a pipeline. We are very excited about the potential of GED-0301. 301 is an oral antisense DNA oligonucleotide compound that recently completed the 166 patient multi-center Phase II study in Crohn\u2019s disease.","The phase II data has been submitted to a major medical journal and will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting.","We acquired the rights to 301 from Nogra Pharma Limited, a private pharmaceutical company that specializes in the early stage development of gastrointestinal targeted therapies. They have the track record of having successfully developed a currently marketed product in this therapeutic category.","We believe the 301 has the potential to redefine the standard of care in Crohn\u2019s disease. We plan to initiate a Phase III registration program this year. Our investment in GED-0301 not only reflects our belief in the succession of potential value to patients but also reflects our confidence in the future of our I&I franchise.","We\u2019re energized by the progress achieved during the quarter and are committed to delivering on our goals for the remainder of the year. Jackie, Mark and Scott led their perspective on our results and on the conservable opportunities in the coming quarters.","Let me now turn the call over to Jackie.","Jackie Fouse","Thank you, Bob. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us on our Q1 call. We\u2019re off to a great start for the year and produce results in-line with our plan for Q1. We were very pleased with our product sales performance and saw an acceleration in net growth for the quarter\u2019s year-over-year comparison of 19% versus the past couple of years.","As we exited the quarter, we saw strong momentum across the commercial metrics for REVLIMID, ABRAXANE and POMALYST\/IMNOVID and Mark will speak more about those in a moment.","We are seeing those drivers benefiting Q2 sales as we are now about a month into the second quarter. In addition, we are very excited about the Psoriatic Arthritis approval for OTEZLA that received in March and the I&I team is busy launching the product this quarter. Scott will give you more details on his team\u2019s activities after Mark\u2019s update.","We\u2019re also quite pleased with our overall P&L performance with adjusted earnings per share growing by 22% for the quarter\u2019s year-over-year comparison, faster than our 18% total revenue growth.","We remain focused on shareholder returns and we continue investing for the future in both new R&D collaborations and other opportunities like the late stage product acquisition we announced this morning.","In addition, we bought back $1.7 billion of our own stock in Q1 and obtained approval from our board for an additional $4 billion authorization to continue repurchasing shares.","Here, you can see the acceleration and product sales for the quarterly year-over-year comparison with a 19% growth for this quarter exceeding the rates for Q1 in the prior two years, despite the entry of generic competition to VIDAZA in the U.S.","In addition, our portfolio of sales is more diversified than ever with POMALYST\/IMNOVID, pancreatic cancer for ABRAXANE, OTEZLA to come, starting with revenues in Q2. And more geographies coming into the mix.","We expect to recognize revenues from OTEZLA in the U.S. starting in Q2, as patients make their way through titration packed product and we subsequently see revenue generating scripts.","We have taken a conservative accounting approach with respect to distribution top-line field and for nail or using a sell-through approach recognizing revenues and scripts are filled and we\u2019ll move to a sell-in approach when we have enough experience in this market to feel comfortable with that.","For quite some time, our product sales growth at Celgene has been mainly volume driven. And this quarter was no exception with 16 percentage points or 84% of the 19% growth coming from volume. We additionally saw a global 3% increase from price in the quarter.","At $1.67 for the quarter, fully diluted, adjusted earnings per share grew faster than revenues, up 22%. We produced a strong profit growth while investing in our I&I infrastructure mainly in commercial capabilities and launch preparations for OTEZLA and while investing behind key hematology, oncology launches for ABRAXANE and pancreatic cancer in both U.S. and Europe and IMNOVID in Europe.","Essentially all of the $0.30 year-over-year increase in Q1 earnings per share came from operating income growth.","REVLIMID\u2019s growth was solid in Q1 with particularly strong performance outside the U.S. And the product posted 14% year-over-year growth for the quarter globally and 1% sequentially in-line with our plan.","Brand VIDAZA was impacted by generic competition in the U.S. and this caused the declines in U.S. in total sales for both the year-over-year and sequential comparison. Outside the U.S., VIDAZA\u2019s growth continues to be strong at 14% year-over-year.","Buying patterns by our distributors impacted the sequential international comparison. And finally as a reminder, sales of generic azacitidine are included in other total sales.","On a year-over-year basis, ABRAXANE grew over 50% with similar performance from each of the U.S. and international. Momentum behind the product is excellent following last year\u2019s approvals for pancreatic cancer in the U.S. and Europe.","Sequential growth in the U.S. was affected by buying patterns as with some degree (inaudible), we now recognize that in Q4 of 2013 there was across the board customer buying in advance of higher expected base demand driven by pancreatic cancer. Though the demand metrics was a product that was very good and you will see these in March lines, the level of demand expected going into Q1 was not immediately realized.","ABRAXANE is off to an excellent start in Q2, and we are highly confident in our full year estimates for its sales.","POMALYST\/IMNOVID\u2019s position in relapsed refractory myeloma continues to strengthen and sales grew over 375% as we move into our first full year on the market in the U.S. and as launch ramps up across Europe.","REVLIMID\u2019s 14.1% year-over-year growth for Q1 was 77% volume driven with that growth at 10.8%, plus the 3.1 percentage point contribution globally from price. This growth was very solid in light of the gross to net in typical first quarter dynamics, we often see in REVLIMID\u2019s quarter to quarter sales pattern particularly in the U.S. and was in-line with our payments.","All of the commercial metrics for REVLIMID are quite positive and we\u2019re seeing that reflected in REVLIMID\u2019s performance so far in Q2. Only look back at REVLIMID\u2019s historical sequential pattern, we see that Q1 of this year was in keeping with what we would expect. And we are happy with the global 1% sequential growth over Q4 of 2013.","The key line items in our P&L are performing well. Gross margins improved by 70 basis points versus a year ago and 30 basis points sequentially driven by mix. R&D expenses came down as a percentage of revenues but grew on an absolute basis by 8.5% year-over-year, as we continue to make productive investments in R&D.","Q4 2013 R&D spend included $52 million in collaboration related milestone payments and this is the main reason for the sequential reduction in Q1 expense as a percentage of revenue. The quarterly pattern of R&D spend will be impacted by the timing of clinical trial activity across the portfolio and the timing of milestone payments.","SG&A expenses grew 25.4%, an increase like percentage of revenues for the quarter with our investments in I&I and product launches. We still expect these to come in around 22.5% of revenues for the full year.","Our strong revenue growth in these expense dynamics drove our adjusted operating margins of 50.5% in-line with our full year guidance. Our balance sheet and net cash from operations generation, both remain very strong. As of March 31, we had just over $5 billion of cash on our balance sheet after repurchasing 1.7 billion of our own shares and investing in business development opportunities to support the long-term growth of the business.","In the quarter, we finalized two new R&D collaboration agreements with NantBioScience and Abide, and added a new collaboration to our partnership with FORMA.","Upfront payments for these three deals totaled $309 million. In addition, we\u2019re very excited about our late-stage product acquisition from Nogra Pharma and Scott will speak more about that deal in a moment. The deal includes a $710 million upfront payment upon closing as well as potential regulatory and sales related milestones.","We expect our strong operating execution, business model and capital deployment strategy to generate improving returns on invested capital over time and we have a good track record in this regard.","We use GAAP based income to calculate our ROIC metrics and we show you these on a gross invested capital basis, the dotted lines in our ROIC chart and on a net invested capital basis, excluding cash, the solid line in our chart.","You can see the general trend to improving returns with any given quarter or short period, sometimes impacted by upfront investments and business development activities or short-term cash accumulation.","Our target is to produce sustained improvements in ROIC overcome as one metric to demonstrate the long-term productivity of our R&D and capital investments, the quality of our operational execution and the soundness of our financial strategy.","Our performance continues to be solidly rooted and strong top-line growth and operational execution on the larger and larger base of business with increased diversification in our revenue stream. All of our metrics remain favorable.","We are performing well now and investing for the future with an eye on improving returns and providing value to our shareholders.","Q1 has given us a great start to the year and today we are reaffirming our full-year guidance for both revenues and earnings per share. Thank you.","And let me now turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Alles","Thanks very much, Jackie. Good morning everyone. First quarter net product sales were in-line with our plan up 19% year-over-year to $1.708 billion. Our brand fundamentals are strong. Globally, more patients began therapy in the first quarter on REVLIMID, POMALYST\/IMNOVID and ABRAXANE than ever before. Each of these products have achieved market leadership and have become backbone therapies for the development of additional novel agents were virtually all subsets of multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndromes and pancreatic cancer.","Market share gains and duration therapy increases for REVLIMID and the ongoing global commercial launches for POMALYST\/IMNOVID in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma and ABRAXANE for metastatic pancreatic cancer are key drivers for our full year outlook and beyond.","Early second quarter, product sales trends are very positive. In the first quarter, our teams produced strong results that offset much of the unfavorable impact of three variables. First, gross to net adjustments including the expected seasonal increased rebates for REVLIMID tied to the Medicare of party coverage GAAP.","Second, the continued impact of generic azacitidine sales in the United States and third, buying patterns for ABRAXANE in the U.S. and Japan. At the same time, we made significant progress on multiple high value programs. As Bob mentioned, we submitted the REVLIMID newly diagnosed multiple myeloma regulatory industries in Europe in February and in the U.S. in April, securing worldwide approval for REVLIMID in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma remains one of our most important corporate objectives.","Key clinical trials are being initiated for our in-line and pipeline products. Our research collaboration strategy is beginning to yield active, promising molecules. Among them is the Agios compound, AG-221, a first in class inhibitor of the IDH-2 mutant protein, promising but preliminary Phase I data were presented this month at the AACR meeting.","AG-221 demonstrated high response rates and an excellent safety profile in a molecularly defined group of patients with relapse and refractory acute myeloid leukemia. With our development partner Acceleron, we are advancing both Sotatercept or ACE-536 in beta-thalassemia and MDS. We expect to select one of these agents enter a Phase III study in beta-thalassemia later this year.","Returning to our first quarter results. REVLIMID sales were $1.144 billion, representing 14% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter growth. Key demand fundamentals remain strong in the U.S. Importantly, the average daily number of new patients increased by 7% quarter-on-quarter, an all-time high of more than 34,000 unique patients were treated with REVLIMID in the United States during the quarter.","This large volume of patients on therapy at the start of the year is a very positive indicator of our full-year opportunity. As previously mentioned, sequential quarterly sales in the U.S. were negatively impacted by the expected seasonal increased rebates for REVLIMID.","Led by our team in Europe, quarter-on-quarter international sales of REVLIMID grew 6%. We continue to strengthen the product profile REVLIMID beyond multiple-myeloma. The results of the REVLIMID MDS-005 Phase III study and non-deletion 5Q minus low risk MDS and the MCL-002 randomized Phase II study in relapsed and refractory mantle cell lymphoma are expected during the second half of this year.","We completed enrollment in the REMARC Phase III study testing REVLIMID as maintenance therapy for patients with newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We are on track to complete enrollment in RELEVANCE, our Phase III study of REVLIMID plus Rituximab in follicular lymphoma late this year.","As 2014 could mark another inflexion point for REVLIMID in multiple myeloma as we may start to see the initial data from several Phase III trials with novel agents being developed on the R&D backbone.","The POMALYST\/IMNOVID launch continues to exceed our first full-year expectations. Driven by the U.S. market, sales grew 376% year-on-year and 12% quarter-on-quarter to $136 million. We are very encouraged by the performance of IMNOVID in Europe where key metrics just an adoption curve, similar to or better than the 2013 adoption of POMALYST in the United States.","Momentum should accelerate as reimbursement has achieved in several major European markets from this quarter through the end of 2014 and the start of 2015. We remain on track to submit the POMALYST regulatory industry for the relapsed and refractory multiple-myeloma in Japan by the end of the third quarter.","ABRAXANE year-on-year sales grew by more than 50% to $185 million. However, as Jackie mentioned, the negative impact from quarter-on-quarter buying patterns in the U.S. and Japan contributed significantly to a sequential quarterly decline of 8%.","It is clearer now that the sharp increase in the total number of patients treated per month was ABRAXANE in the United States during 2013 and the anticipation of early 2014 demand led excess inventory to build at the very end of last year.","Demand continued to grow in Q1 2014 but not enough to couple with the offset this inventory built. A similar quarter-on-quarter pattern developed in Japan, causing our partner Taiho to reduce their plans first quarter ABRAXANE orders. We are very confident that we will deliver 2014 ABRAXANE sales consistent with our forecasted $850 million to $900 million.","Following the release of the results from the Phase III study of ABRAXANE plus gemcitabine in metastatic pancreatic cancer and the FDA approval in September of 2013, this novel combination has rapidly become the new standard of care.","In less than one year, the market share of ABRAXANE plus gemcitabine in the first line treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer grew from approximately 5% to approximately 36%. We continue to expect big share of this combination in the United States to exceed 55%. Our experience in U.S. and now in Germany suggest that we should achieve rapid market adoption and share gains across global markets, immediately following reimbursement.","We have successfully initiated our Phase III agilent pancreatic study and our pivotal study testing of ABRAXANE and gemcitabine in triple negative metastatic breast cancer is enrolling very well.","With five weeks to go before the start of ASCO, we are aware of approximately 70 abstracts that have been submitted featuring our in-line and pipeline agents across several major cancers and multiple patient subsets.","We are pleased with the number and quality of the REVLIMID abstracts in multiple myeloma and lymphoma, POMALYST abstracts in multiple myeloma and ABRAXANE abstracts in pancreatic cancer and breast cancer.","In summary, our first quarter results delivered robust year-on-year growth of 19% and were consistent with our 2014 forecast. Key product value drivers, such as market share, duration, commercial launches in International markets and new data that can expand our core indications, are advancing.","And most importantly, we successfully submitted marketing applications for REVLIMID plus low-dose dexamethasone for the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma in Europe and in the United States.","We are executing well, we are very confident in our outlook and we are committed to helping patients with cancer worldwide. Thanks very much.","And I\u2019m pleased to welcome Scott Smith to the call.","Scott Smith","Thank you very much, Mark. And good morning to you all. 2014 has already been a milestone year for Celgene and I&I marked most importantly by the U.S. approval for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis. We have a strong and highly differentiated label. The indication is broad and inclusive for dull patients with active psoriatic arthritis supporting use across a wide variety of PSA patient segments.","Early feedbacks from prescribers have been very encouraging, especially notary inclusion of language confirming and treatment of OTEZLA was also an improvement not only in five new systems of PSA but also an improvement to emphasize some direct license as well as fiscal function patients with active PSA.","Feedback was also strong, OTEZLA could represent a completely new paradigm from the treatment of PSA by providing a product without black box and worrying about malignancies or serious infections nor any requirements of TB testing or routine laboratory monitoring.","We are very encouraged by the initial feedback of OTEZLA for both physician and patient communities. The commercial organization is executed on the launch plans exceptionally well. And we are pleased with the positive momentum generated in a very short period of time.","We are focused on two key near term objectives, one, broad and frequent reach to target physicians and two facilitating patient access to OTEZLA. Our sales representatives were in the field calling on customers within three days of approval and have reached virtually 100% of targets many repeatedly. The total we\u2019ve given over 12,000 OTEZLA details so far in April.","Our account management teams have been engaging with pairs to secure formulary acts of reimbursement, a process that we expect will take 3 to 12 months that is typical for products in this category. We have already achieved our first formulary approvals and are happy with our early progress.","In the meantime, we believe our reimbursement of patient assistant program OTEZLA Support Plus, working with conjunction with Specialty Pharmacy is well positioned to provide assistance to physician\u2019s office to get patients started on therapy as quickly as possible. For patients of OTEZLA Support Plus provides access to a team of advocates including notes focusing on copy assistant and a free drug program for those who are insured.","Our team is well prepared to accomplish their objectives and we look forward to discussing initial results and prescription trends over the next few months.","We believe Celgene and I&I is well positioned for significant growth in the coming years. Following last month\u2019s PSA approvals, we anticipate a U.S. survives this approval of OTEZLA in September.","In Europe, we expect to combine PSA to survive this opinion by year end with an approval in Q1 2015. We are also focused on geographic expansion beyond the U.S. and EU. Our Phase III registration trend is rapidly enrolled. And we anticipate a submission in 2015 and approval in 2016. In addition, we have initiated our global expansion plans for OTEZLA anticipate approvals in Canada, Australians with one over the next six to 18 months.","We believe OTEZLA has the potential to have broad utility across a spectrum of inflammatory diseases. Top line results from our Phase III Ace trial are expected later this quarter. We will also initiate a Phase III trial of the chest disease and Phase II trials of OTEZLA and IBD and atopic dermatitis later this year.","A key objective for us in 2014 is to enhance and accelerate the I&I portfolio. We are encouraged about the potential of other Phase II compounds in the pipeline specifically Sotatercept and multiple myeloma and CCT-20 and I&I specific index.","Furthermore, today\u2019s announcement of our acquisition of GED-0301 from Nogra is very, very exciting. This therapy truly fits of our mission to bring innovative treatments to patient scenarios of high unmet medical needs.","We believe that the 301 with the unique mechanism and profile has the potential to significantly transform the treatment of Crohn\u2019s disease, a chronic disabling disease that affects over 1 million patients worldwide.","Exciting results were seen in both Phase I-b and 166 patients Phase III trials from consistently high response rate and rate of remission after just four weeks of trading. Data from the Phase II program should be available shortly through publication as well as presentation at appropriate medical meetings.","As Bob stated earlier, we will work aggressively towards meeting the Phase III trials later this year. We are very pleased to have reached agreements to develop and commercialize these Phase III compound.","These are exciting times for Celgene and I&I, our team is working passionately to help ensure we can bring that not only to OTEZLA but other transformational treatment options to patients worldwide in the near future.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn it back to Bob.","Bob Hugin","Thank you, Scott. And thank you Mark and Jackie. I hope you can sense our enthusiasm and optimism about the future of Celgene. Our teams around the world are committed to maximizing the significant potential of our deep and diverse portfolio.","We are well positioned to achieve our key 2014 milestones and to deliver on our long-term targets. Thank you everyone for joining us this morning. Operator, please open the line for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of John Sonnier of William Blair. Your line is now open.","John Sonnier \u2013 William Blair","Hi, thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the progress and in particular the filing, the REVLIMID filing in Europe. And I\u2019m wondering if you are able to give us any granularity on what the breadth of that filing looks like any age limits, transplants, status, etcetera?","Mark Alles","Thanks for the question John, its Mark. As we\u2019ve said, our base case is that we would get a label for transplant ineligible patients and by definition elderly patients. But we\u2019re at the start of the process and we\u2019d still be looking to get the broadest possible label.","John Sonnier \u2013 William Blair","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Roden of UBS. Your line is now open.","Matt Roden \u2013 UBS","Great. Thanks very much for taking the question, good morning. I realized you maybe a little bit constrained in what you can talk about with the NATCO situation. But I was just wondering if you can talk about how a market outcome would actually impact the way you\u2019re dealing with the challenger? And is there any outcome in your opinion from the market and that could swing a resolution one way or another?","Bob Hugin","Thanks for the question Matt. Obviously, in litigation we\u2019ll limit about what we can say. We have spent a long time building expensive intellectual property estate for REVLIMID. We intend to vigorously defend our rights. And we\u2019re confident about the outcome and we don\u2019t believe there is anything in the near-term that will be this positive on the case through market hearing. But we\u2019ll let you know as that, progresses.","Matt Roden \u2013 UBS","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenbaum of ISI Group. Your line is now open.","Mark Schoenbaum \u2013 ISI Group","Hi guys, thanks a lot for taking my question. I had a couple of questions on OTEZLA if I might or just one question really, just sort of sounds like two. But first is, Scott, is it possible that you could actually get the payers to require the patient\u2019s step through OTEZLA, new patients step through OTEZLA before receiving CNS.","So, I just like you to talk through that how realistic is that as a possible goal for the franchise that would obviously be I think correct me if I\u2019m wrong, pretty transformative for adoption. And then just a quick one, a yes or no, are you aware or do you plan on sampling?","Scott Smith","So, just to answer the first question. Certainly our mid-to-long term goal is to get at advantage position that\u2019s better than head of CNS and the certain number of plans. Right now for 2014, we\u2019re really focused on solidifying the initial footprint, making sure that we\u2019re a non-disadvantage position. And then if we can move that forward to more advantage position, longer term that depends on how much demand we can drive in the volumes drive and how well we execute.","But certainly our mid-to-long term goal is to be in an advantage position relative to CNS in the number of plans, in the mid-term.","The second question, we are sampling titration packs at the moment. These are patient starter kits, 14 days requirement to get patients. That\u2019s the focus of our sampling right now is initiation of patient trials. So that\u2019s being done at the physician level.","Mark Schoenbaum \u2013 ISI Group","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Porges with Bernstein.","Geoff Porges \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Hi, I think I\u2019m on the call. Quickly, just housekeeping, could you give us a sense of exactly what the swing in ABRAXANE was between Q4 and Q1 and whether the Q1 results actually reflect demand or whether there was some shortfall?","And then Jackie, could you just comment how are you accounting for the fluctuations in the value of the equity positions that you\u2019ve accumulated. Do you market-to-market or do you just cater on the books at the acquisition cost? Thanks.","Jackie Fouse","Yes Geoff, let me start with the second question. So, if the incentives are public companies these stakes are mark-to-market at the end of the quarter. However, the gains on those flow-through other comprehensive income and not through the P&L. If we would have a sustained loss on any of those, we would take that loss through the P&L.","On the private company equity stakes, those are also run through valuation models and tested for impairments essentially. And those, if we have gains on those, they will not run through the P&L unless we sell the stakes. And if we have losses on them they are taken through the P&L. So, it\u2019s a pretty conservative accounting treatment.","Geoff Porges \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Well, Jackie is that through the pro forma P&L or just the GAAP P&L?","Jackie Fouse","Both of them.","Geoff Porges \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Okay, thanks.","Mark Alles","The first part of the question Geoff, its Mark. The swing in inventory we estimate to be in the $15 million range, but it\u2019s not exactly clear. But it\u2019s in that range. And then, as you saw on the slide that I presented, the first quarter patient demand curve moves sideways a little bit but as you see in March, the last data point, it has returned to growth. So, it\u2019s a little bit of a combination, mostly the inventory swing, a little bit of sideways demand curve but it\u2019s back on track.","Geoff Porges \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Robyn Karnauskas \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi guys, congratulations on the performance. So, I guess, I just want to ask a little bit more about the pipelines, and very active in business development. So, first of all, I think we\u2019ve been trying or answering for a while, maybe you can talk a little bit about what gives you comfort and then nothing is in for 301?","And then a broader question around pipeline acquisition, when you\u2019re thinking about adding value to the company, do you have peak years in mind, like when do you see your multiple products, when do you see these really peaking or really add value to the company? Thanks.","Scott Smith","Relative to the other world, antisense of drugs which have gone through a variety of different places. I think you see here the coupling of the antisense technology with delivery system that delivers the drug, right on site and they got for absorption at the side of the path of physiology.","But these and then when you see the clinical data, the Phase II data, you can see very robust response. And we\u2019re looking forward to getting that data. But clearly the data, the clinical data and the evidently look at gives you a feeling of the magnitude of effective.","Jackie Fouse","Robyn, its Jackie. Just on the top line question and I think the timing of contribution of revenues. Just as a reminder for everybody out to 2017, the numbers that we\u2019ve given you, I think you have very good visibility to \u2013 the drivers behind the growth embedded in those numbers.","And we\u2019ve highlighted on numerous occasions, some of the things that could happen over that timeframe that would lead to revenues that are not included in our financial model. And I would say the last sort of item on the check-list there was the filing for REVLIMID newly diagnosed in both U.S. and Europe which is now done. And then we\u2019ll see those approvals come.","So, when you think about that I think it\u2019s pretty clear what\u2019s driving that and what potential upside may. These, when we look at other major indications that could come or REVLIMID for example and Non-Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma, when we look at the late-stage product acquisition that we announced today.","All of those things would be contributing after 2017, so they could start to kick-in in somewhat meaningful way in 2018, 2019. ACE-11 is another one that we haven\u2019t talked too much about from coming simply. It could come out in that \u201819, \u201820, \u201821 timeframe. And all of those products then would be contributing significantly to growth beyond 2017 while REVLIMID and ABRAXANE another products are continuing to grow. They expand from an indications standpoint. So we\u2019re really trying to have things come into the portfolio and layer in nicely with respect particularly to that sort of mid stage timeframe that would be kind of 2018 to 2021.","Robyn Karnauskas \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt from Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen & Company","Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask a few more about GED-0301. Was this a competitive auction and can you talk about what stimulated your interest and was it just the Phase II data or is there something about the target or the indication or something else that you guys had your eyes on? And lastly, do you have the necessary IT, and this is an antisense?","Bob Hugin","Yes, just to maybe answer the second question, certainly Crohn\u2019s disease is a target IBD in general that we\u2019ve been very interested in. We will be initiating as I stated in the prepared remarks and a program in IDB with OTEZLA that we think has the right profile. Very significant unmet medical need particularly in Crohn\u2019s where the remission rates from TNS therapy are very, very low. Patients don\u2019t maintain that remission very long.","So there really is need for new approaches and new therapies there. Relative to the other question.","Jackie Fouse","It was a competitive process and I think it would be right to characterize that as having been highly competitive.","Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen & Company","And the license?","Mark Alles","We believe that there is appropriate installment IP through a significant period.","Bob Hugin","Significant diligence on that as part of the whole process.","Mark Alles","Yes, we feel quite good about the RP and there are some differences that we could see with respect to extensions and things like that. But it would go beyond the 2027 timeframe.","Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen & Company","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Geoff Meacham \u2013 JPMorgan","Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions, just a couple of related ones on the REVLIMID filing in Europe. Do you guys expect any benefit from the prior review or this new filings, this is so completely different. And then on the new \u2013 what\u2019s the next step I guess filing the recent nice guidance for REVLIMID of the U.K., does this impact for you guys, is this just less relevant now that you have the first line filing in the Europe in the book? Thanks.","Jackie Fouse","Hi Geoff, its Jackie. So, on the timing for the review, we\u2019ve assumed that it would be standard review time and go to full timing cycle for purposes of the financial model in both the U.S. and Europe. So if it happens a little bit after the net that\u2019s very believe assume that they\u2019ll take the full standard review time.","Mark Alles","Geoff, its Mark. This one will be clear we\u2019re talking about the recent headline from nice about REVLIMID (inaudible) in these reimbursement correct, that\u2019s what you\u2019re referring to?","Geoff Meacham \u2013 JPMorgan","That\u2019s right, yeah.","Mark Alles","Right. So, it\u2019s a great question. Thank you for it. We had thought to expand the utilization of REVLIMID and the reimbursement for REVLIMID to a more second line population under the nice reimbursement umbrella. This was not a newly diagnosed discussion at all.","In that setting and as part of the process that\u2019s ongoing, nice issues, their declaration that it was not cost effective at that time. We continue to go through this process and are optimistic that notwithstanding the newly diagnosed indication and approval later, that we could expand utilization and reimbursement for REVLIMID in the U.K. to second line. So that\u2019s ongoing.","Bob Hugin","And just as a reminder, we received the same preliminary negative opinion before we got the very positive position we have with nice for REVLIMID today.","Mark Alles","Correct.","Geoff Meacham \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber of Citi. Your line is now open.","Yaron Werber \u2013 Citi","Great. I have two questions. Jackie, first one is for you. Just give us a little bit of a sense, it looks like R&D I believe you got to need to potentially ramp up a lot into the backend of the year and SG&A then. I\u2019m just trying to understand exactly how do you get there from here and SG&A will have to go down and R&D has going to have to go up to hit your guidance. How do you get there?","And then two, I don\u2019t know if you can answer it with, when you look at what NATCO, their own IP that they filed relating to their essentially anhydrous Lenalidomide that the one without water. It actually speaks to the form A, which is one of your polymorphs. And so, it\u2019s specifically the anhydrous polymorph.","You guys are also alleging or you\u2019re using the form B, which is having the hydrate. So what\u2019s going on, I mean, they\u2019re saying that they don\u2019t have water in their polymorphs that you guys are asserting your polymorph that does have water. So give us a little bit of sense kind of where you\u2019re going with this, if you can. Thank you.","Jackie Fouse","Thanks Yaron. So, with respect to the timing out of the expenses, I mean, I think we had always characterized the SG&A is very likely being frontloaded to the early part of this year given the timing of the investments and the I&I unit and the build up, we think that we needed to do there ahead of OTEZLA approval. So you see that reflected in the numbers.","And as well of the timing on the loss related expenses for the other products that we\u2019ve discussed in the hematology oncology area. So you got pretty significant frontloading of the expenses in SG&A. And the revenues will be accelerating over the course of the year as Mark mentioned in his comments. And that\u2019s how we think that that is going to play out to get us to the full-year guidance number of 22.5% per SG&A versus where we are today.","On the R&D expense side, again, I think that it looks a little bit light at the beginning of the year, especially coming out of the end of last year when we had a pretty significant number of milestone expenses in there. We do include collateral \u2013 collaboration related milestone payments in our adjusted P&L. And we had a lot of those in the fourth quarter.","The absolute dollars still grew 8.5% and we\u2019ve got a big base of R&D spend and a big portfolio where you have some clinical trial activity ramping down some other ramping up. And that\u2019s all taken into consideration in our forecast and we\u2019ll see how that plays out over the course of the year. But we\u2019re at where we expected we would be with that.","With respect to the NATCO question, I mean, that was a pretty detailed question there, some things that we really can\u2019t comment that much on given the ongoing nature of the process and the impending market hearing. But there is some things that we\u2019re happy to take up offline in terms of the specific patent coverage and things like that if that\u2019s okay.","Yaron Werber \u2013 Citi","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond of Robert Baird. Your line is now open.","Chris Raymond \u2013 Robert Baird","Hi, thanks. Just a question on POMALYST. So, with the U.S. being sort of flat, I guess maybe down a little bit sequentially quarter-on-quarter. I\u2019m just kind of struck by the fact that this is two drugs now when you take POMALYST and Kyprolis that are indicated for later lines of therapy and multiple myeloma that were down sequentially. Is that just, are you seeing something broader in the market or is that just a coincidence or is there something else going on? Thanks.","Mark Alles","Thanks for the question Chris, its Mark. I agree with you, the third plus fine market seems to have consolidated a bit here in the last let\u2019s say three to four months. That said, I wouldn\u2019t draw any conclusions about the uptake of POMALYST.","We see great patient demand, physician experience on, in particular the response rate and then the safety profile where we see duration increasing nicely. It\u2019s something that I think over this year will realize potentially some upside. And the reason is clear. The patient base is growing as duration and you\u2019re very familiar with the sort of REVLIMID would be better than expected. And we are seeing early signs of duration will be better.","We think not only will we achieve our base kits for the year but there might be upside. But I think for POMALYST, the dynamics are good. We did see a little bit of sideways movement here but we\u2019re very, very optimistic based on patient experience, physician experience and our own analysis of what\u2019s happening with duration.","Chris Raymond \u2013 Robert Baird","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Howard Liang of Leerink. Your line is now open.","Howard Liang \u2013 Leerink","Thanks very much. I got a question on the two REVLIMID and Rituxan, our square study that you\u2019re initiating. Can you talk about the considerations that one and two, starting in these files was the initiation based on anything from the current files including the phase, current Phase III studies remark and relevance?","Mark Alles","Sure, I\u2019m not exactly sure I understand your question. But we have for, as you know for many, many years believed that the combination of REVLIMID plus Rituxan as a chemo free approach to the treatment of all histologic subsets in lymphoma is a major advance to the treatment of disease.","So, the remark study first is building on the maintenance paradigm to try to extend the benefit of Rituxan based therapy. In this case, our job \u2013 we\u2019re very excited about, this is the large study, it\u2019s fully enrolled. And if one tracks the biology of what would be expected to happen with these patients at high risk of relapse after responding to art shop, we would be looking for readouts perhaps earlier than expected. And remember the control on placebo.","With respect to REVLIMID Rituxan in follicular lymphoma again being chemo free for these patients within the disease, we think it brings a very effective safe approach of treating patients over time. And we think the combination is going to be quite good.","So, optimizing REVLIMID\u2019s clinical potential as a single agent, were in combination with antibodies, Rituxan, other antibodies is a high clinical priority and we\u2019re very excited about the future.","Howard Liang \u2013 Leerink","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Josh Schimmer \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Thank you. Few questions from now serious who believes that the retrofit method of using patents in Europe may be at risk here, so maybe you can give us a sense of the current status expectations for 2014 updates, address these concerns for us? Thank you.","Jackie Fouse","Josh, it\u2019s really hard to hear you. Could you say that one more time please?","Josh Schimmer \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Sorry, can you hear me better now?","Jackie Fouse","A little bit.","Josh Schimmer \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Sorry, phone problems. So I had questions from investors who believe that the REVLIMID method of used patents in Europe may be at risk this year. So perhaps you can address their current status, expectations for 2014 and address those concerns?","Bob Hugin","We are taking a long time to build the portfolio. Internationally we feel very confident about where we are with those patents. And there is going to be challenges from time to time with our patents. We feel very confident about where we stand and that they will be enforced above and we\u2019ll achieve the outcomes that we expect.","Jackie Fouse","Yes. I mean, the patents are continued to be enforceable during this process. So I think that\u2019s one thing to keep in mind. And so far, other grounds that have been put forth and the original proceeding were not found to be sufficient for in-depth validation of the patent so.","Josh Schimmer \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Okay, thank you.","Jackie Fouse","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Brian Abrahams \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Hi, thanks for taking my questions, just couple on 301. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the timelines and potential costs for Phase III program, clarify, is that already incorporated in your long-term guidance?","And then, maybe just generally speaking over the long-term based on the remission response rate you\u2019re seeing so far here. Do you envision this being positioned as suitable replacement for biologics or more an earlier line option sort of where you\u2019re positioning POMALYST and psoriatic arthritis? Thanks.","Jackie Fouse","Hi Brian, let me start with the cost question and hand it over to Scott. So, probably the total development cost and we\u2019re so working through the plan and we\u2019re filing the numbers a little bit. So, I would say these expense range I\u2019m going to give you is probably on the conservative side until we know a little bit more. But it would be multi-year expense, about five years of $250 million to $300 million.","So, it\u2019s on a per year basis, it\u2019s quite a digestable number in the grand scheme of our overall portfolio because it is new. I can\u2019t tell you that it\u2019s specifically included in our long-term guidance. But what I would say is we estimate those that portfolio of R&D expense over in the long period of time in such a way that an amount like this is probably absorbable within what we\u2019ve already gotten in the financial model.","Scott Smith","And in terms of the structure of the Phase III program I think we would like to work aggressively to initiate by the end of this year. And we\u2019re thinking about that the data in itself is \u2013 we\u2019ve noted is very striking and very different than anything you see in the market today.","We think that can help enrollment, as well we get an opportunity to get that out. And in terms of positioning, you\u2019d like to work through sort of the normal Phase III trial before you fix some position. But certainly we see, because of the overall nature of the drug, because of the type of efficacy we see because of the differentiated side-effect profile that you see relative to Remicade and other traditional agencies here.","We see an opportunity for it to be used in the pre-biologic space aggressively somewhat to the opportunity we see for OTEZLA. I mean, we can talk more fully about it when the deal is out there and in the world, I can\u2019t right now. But I think it will be striking in obvious as to what direction we\u2019re going to take the model care when we get the chance to get the data out.","Brian Abrahams \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Michael Yee \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Hi, great thanks. In regards to business development you\u2019ve done a ton of deals, 21, 22, 23 cut them all. But this one was particularly large at $700 million plus upfront. Can you talk to your appetite for business development that\u2019s even more I guess numerically this year in the dollar business than last year? Where do you think it\u2019s sort of going, I\u2019m sure you can\u2019t have a specific target number but maybe you can talk rather about your appetite and where that\u2019s going to be going over the next year or so?","Bob Hugin","Thanks for the question. We don\u2019t have a target for what we plan to do going forward this year or future years. We certainly do understand the financial constraints of what we want to be able to do, what we can achieve. But it\u2019s really driven by the opportunity that we fundamentally believe having a strong internal research capabilities gives us insights into programs that would really extend those franchise and really produce synergies that we can then really build campaigns in different areas to produce disruptive technologies and breakthrough therapies.","And so, it is fundamentally driven from an internal perspective where we believe a transformational impact on patient can be achieved. We then have to put what\u2019s out there in the context of what we can financially support etcetera. But so far, the opportunities as we\u2019ve seen them have been supportable under the financial model that have been built for Celgene appropriately.","Obviously, late stage assets are going to be more expensive than earlier stage assets. But when you find one that like this one that we believe can be really transformative so the way the medicine is practiced and this unmet area of medical need, we\u2019re going to act on them. And but again, we don\u2019t have many things that we\u2019re looking at today. But we\u2019ll be opportunistic as we see things arise.","Jackie Fouse","And I think consistent with that and what we\u2019ve talked about and done in the most recent past is, it can be a combination of collaboration agreements that you saw that couple of ones that we did in the first quarter as well as what we would characterize as both on maybe the wrong word. But more modest sized acquisition this deal has the nature of an acquisition of a product. And yeah, it\u2019s a little bit more of an upfront amount.","But if you think back to the average acquisition that we did a couple of years ago, it was much, much, much earlier for $350 million upfront. I think you can put it in perspective and it\u2019s got as that we see the data. I think you\u2019ll understand why we were so interested in this acquisition.","Michael Yee \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Matthew Harrison \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great. Thanks for taking the question. I want to ask a follow-up on ABRAXANE. It looks like from a market share chart that you gave that your market share penetration is starting to flatten out a little bit. But you also pointed to that your expectations that market share will be above 50%. So, I just wonder if you could talk a little bit about those dynamics and then maybe just talk about the country-by-country rollout in Europe? Thanks.","Mark Alles","Thanks for the question. Certainly a dynamic growth rate on share and patient volume over about a one-year period. So it\u2019s not surprising that there was a little bit of a sideways trends going into Q1. On pancreatic cancer and lung cancer we have two growth drivers. Pancreatic cancer, we are being used almost exclusively and performance status patients who are in the zero to one category.","We\u2019re using patients where ABRAXANE gemcitabine and the data that we produce offer an idea match. The expansion of the opportunity isn\u2019t to performance side of patients who are not as, let\u2019s say well off. And we see that happening and we do some research to support that.","In addition, we had as I said, opened our agilent pancreatic cancer trial in the quarter. And we think that this segmentation clinically and in the market will continue to see very, very nice up-tick in pancreatic cancer.","In lung cancer, our program for Squamous Cell Non-small Cell Lung Cancer is boosted by a medical fair sponsor trial of maintenance ABRAXANE in the studying of Squamous Cell Non-small Cell Lung Cancer. And that program is ongoing.","In addition, the tenacity program, again ABRAXANE gemcitabine and triple negative metastatic breast cancer is an important way to think about the future of the brand also. So, we\u2019re going to have periods where we don\u2019t have the dramatic growth that you see historically, but we have high hopes that the brand will grow and become a blockbuster in our portfolio. And the clinical programs and the execution are there to make that happen.","Jackie Fouse","I think we have time for about three more questions. So if we can \u2013 if they are really fast, then we can take another one. So let\u2019s probably target three more questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Ravi Mehrotra \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I was looking on focusing on 301. Scott, I know you gave us a little bit of Phase II color and I know that we\u2019re going to see the data a little bit more. But I guess, everyone is just trying to tie-up the highs and paid. You talked about higher remission and response rate.","Was there something else in that phase to such just fast onset of action? I think you said four weeks, three, and then it\u2019s just to say, is it to face it that they talked about before they were treated for two weeks and measured maintenance of four. I guess, I\u2019m trying to say is, is response rate in the speed of response actually driver for your optimism here?","Scott Smith","So I think both, thanks for the question. I think both of those were key drivers here, response rate, high number of patients into remission. How quickly that remission was achieved. And then the duration of that remission like I said, durability of response were three important things to be looked at.","And again, we\u2019ll have to \u2013 we could take a look at the data but it is very, very different than you see in the marketplace today. And I think there is a completely different benefit risk in this product. They will see the existing marketplace today.","Safety plays into it as well, because of the absorption nature you see a very different safety profile emerging. So a combination of all those things together, sort of led us to believe that this could be really a transformational asset in the same market space.","Ravi Mehrotra \u2013 Credit Suisse","All right, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joel Sendek of Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is now open.","Joel Sendek \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Hi, thanks. I have another one with 301. I\u2019m wondering if the \u2013 the size of the payments and the continued payments as well, which suggest that the royalty rate would be relatively well. If you can just give us some sense of that?","And then in the side, towards the end where you say it could meaningfully diversify whole revenue in 2019 and 2020. I guess, I would \u2013 I just want to be clear you\u2019re not saying that the driver wouldn\u2019t come on the market until 2019, presumably you could get it on before then, if you can just give us some clarity on that? Thanks.","Scott Smith","Yes, just sure maybe on the second first, this is Scott, thanks for the question. We\u2019ll obviously try and develop the drug as quickly as we can. We need to get it up and because we could get the studies up and going, we can see normal rates working as quickly as we can. Well, 2018, \u201819, \u201820 we can provide more clarity on exactly that one to be finalized, they get more interactions and have the finalized Phase III plan. So we\u2019re initiating. So in some time we can give you some more clarity on the exact time when we expect to have the data launch in that.","Jackie Fouse","And just with respect to the royalty rates, and they are double digit but and they\u2019re tiered. We would consider them for customary for particular, this particular market.","Joel Sendek \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Mike King of JMP Securities. Your line is now open.","Mike King \u2013 JMP Securities","Yes, thanks for squeezing me in guys.

And then where are we with regard to readouts and topline for OTEZLA for Ankylosing spondylitis and CC-46 for AML?","Mark Alles","Mike, its Mark. And I guess the question goes to Scott on the PDUFA for ABRAXANE duly diagnosed in U.S. As soon as we have the PDUFA date, I\u2019m sorry REVLIMID.","Mike King \u2013 JMP Securities","REV yes.","Mark Alles","REVLIMID, and newly diagnosed myeloma.

The press release reporting our financial results in addition to the presentation for today's webcast can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the corporate website at www.celgene.com.","Joining me in the room today with prepared remarks are: Mark Alles, our Chief Executive Officer; Peter Kellogg, our Chief Financial Officer; Michael Pehl, Global Head of our Hematology\/Oncology franchise; our Global Head of the Inflammation and Immunology franchise, Terrie Curran; and Scott Smith, President and Chief Operating Officer. Also available for the Q&A portion of the call are: Bob Hugin, our Executive Chairman: Jay Backstrom, our Chief Medical Officer; and Rupert Vessey, Global head of our Research & Early Development group.","As a reminder, during today's call we will be making forward-looking statements regarding our financial outlook in addition to regulatory and product development plans. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those forecasted. A description of these risks can be found in our most recent 10-K on file with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we undertake no duty to update or revise them. Reconciliation of the adjusted financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available as part of the earnings release.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mark.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Patrick. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate the opportunity to review our second quarter operating results with you and to discuss the meaningful progress we have made advancing multiple strategic imperatives expected to add to our opportunities for longer-term growth.","Our second quarter results were outstanding and a strong indicator that our constant focus on operating excellence and innovation has us extremely well positioned to achieve or exceed our full-year 2017 financial targets and continues to support our 2020 outlook.","Given the significant momentum of our blockbuster medicines and the expanding leverage of our business model, we are raising our 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $7.25 to $7.35, up from our previous target of $7.15 to $7.30. Following my comments, Peter will provide a complete review of our Q2 results and outlook for the full year.","Our multiyear strategy to build, strengthen, and expand our hematology and oncology franchise is delivering and accelerating. During the first half of the year, we made excellent progress advancing our portfolio of late-stage clinical trials, which Michael will highlight later in the call.","We continue to expect FDA approval of IDHIFA by the August 30 PDUFA date. This important new medicine will offer a targeted subset of patients with acute myeloid leukemia a desperately needed new treatment option and add a third product to global myeloid disease franchise.","At the beginning of this month, we significantly enhanced our oncology franchise by establishing a collaboration with BeiGene and acquiring the rights to BGB-A317, a PD-1 antibody in development for solid tumor cancers. BGB-A317 is a vital addition to our research efforts focused on cellular immunotherapy. It joins our growing pipeline of T-cell-targeted therapies, including our PD-L1 FUSION program in hematology with our partner AstraZeneca, JCAR017 for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, bb2121, our BCMA-targeted CAR-T program, and CC-93269, the T-cell bi-specific antibody targeting BCMA that we acquired from EngMab late last year.","At the same time, we are making remarkable progress in protein homeostasis, deepening our understanding of the function proteins play in disease. We continue to leverage our scientific leadership in this area to establish new collaborations and advance key programs. During the quarter, encouraging clinical data in lupus supported the announcement of CC-220 into Phase IIb development for this large and dramatically underserved patient population. Our novel cell mod for AML, CC-90009, continues to progress through Phase I development. We are also preparing to file an IND for CC-92480, a differentiated cell mod specifically designed for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma.","To extend and diversify our protein homeostasis platform beyond our current programs in cancer and inflammation, we recently decided to expand our FORMA collaboration to include a specific focus on neurosciences. This complements the work we are doing with Evotec to screen our cell mod library across a range of neuro-degenerative diseases. These programs add to the three INDs filed during the first half of the year and represent just some of the significant investments we continue to make to build and diversify our high-potential pipeline.","Just four years ago, positive Phase III data for OTEZLA in psoriatic disease supported and accelerated our strategic decision to build a global inflammation and immunology franchise. Today, Terrie will review how our second quarter results and accomplishments have OTEZLA, already a blockbuster, well positioned for sustained high growth. Terrie will also highlight the progress we are making with other potentially transformational therapies in late-stage development for patients with multiple sclerosis and patients with serious inflammatory bowel diseases.","Midway through 2017, we have achieved or advanced a number of the ambitious goals set at the beginning of the year. We remain committed to discovering, developing, and commercializing medicines with the greatest value proposition for patients, healthcare systems, and society. This cycle of innovation provides the fuel for us to build opportunity and optionality expected to drive our growth now and for years to come. Scott will conclude our call by providing his perspective on the tremendous progress we are making and by highlighting the significant milestones remaining for the second half of the year. These are truly exciting times at Celgene.","Thanks again for joining us today, and please welcome Peter to the call.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone.","Our first half results have been excellent on the top and bottom line. Once again, Celgene delivered great results with operational excellence, and we continued to invest in our business, most recently through the strategic collaboration with BeiGene to deliver a novel anti-PD-1 antibody for solid tumors. Growth across the portfolio continues to come from volume, with strong duration, share and uptake trends.","Our managed care strategy for OTEZLA is beginning to deliver, as Terrie will tell you later. Our continued focus on operating leverage allows us to raise our full-year 2017 adjusted EPS and operating margin guidance. We now expect our operating margin guidance to increase an additional 50 basis points to now approximately 57.5%, which drives adjusted EPS to be in the range of $7.25 to $7.35 per share that Mark just mentioned.","Turning to the Q2 performance, net product sales grew 19% year over year to nearly $3.3 billion. We saw strong growth across the portfolio, particularly from REVLIMID, POMALYST, and OTEZLA. Volume continues to be the main driver of our growth, with 16 of the 19 total percentage points of growth coming from product volume. There was a modest contribution from price, partially offset by foreign exchange. We expect some further foreign exchange headwinds to continue in the second half of 2017 and into 2018, as we move past our more favorable foreign exchange hedges from prior years. All of this of course has been anticipated and factored into our near and long-term guidance.","Our performance on the bottom line continues to be strong. Adjusted earnings per share reaccelerated and grew 26% year over year. The main driver of bottom line growth continues to be operating income, which contributed $0.46 of the $0.38 per share increase. Financial factors, on the other hand, including tax rate, had a negative $0.08 per share impact. OIE was negatively impacted by impairments recorded on equity positions, and also hedging-related expenses impacted the bottom line.","Turning to the P&L, the adjusted operating margin improved 490 basis points year over year to 59.5%. R&D spending increased year over year, but not quite at the same rate as revenue growth. The timing and pace of clinical activity is expected to increase in the second half of 2017 as we initiate pivotal programs for key pipeline assets and make go\/no-go decisions for proof-of-concept trials on early-stage assets. We continue to see great leverage from SG&A on our established commercial and global support infrastructure.","We ended the quarter with $10.1 billion in cash and marketable securities, and we continue to have the flexibility in our business with strategic collaborations, as we've done in the first half of this year, and to bring value to shareholders through share repurchases.","To round out the view of our financial performance, we also carefully assessed our return on invested capital performance. The methodology we use examines our ROIC both including and excluding cash balances in our capital base. As you can see, our steady growth and P&L performance has consistently increased our ROIC metrics, only interrupted by occasional key strategic pipeline acquisitions.","Our acquisitions in recent years have focused on exciting pipeline assets that further build our foundation for long-term growth, success, and returns to shareholders, albeit on a delayed basis given their pipeline nature. The largest of these acquisitions, for example, is the 2015 Receptos acquisition. Note the ROIC growth since that acquisition does not yet include commercial contribution or ROIC benefit from ozanimod, which we expect will begin to have a positive effect in the next few years.","So now let's turn to the 2017 guidance. Based on our operational excellence in the first half of 2017 and our expectation for this momentum to continue, we are increasing the expected operating margin by 50 basis points to approximately 57.5%. and please note this full-year outlook represents a 250 basis point increase over our 2016 full-year actual. Additionally, we are increasing our expected adjusted earnings per share to a range of $7.25 to $7.35 per share. Other guidance items remain unchanged, a great quarter.","Thank you, and I'd like to turn the call over to my colleague, Michael.","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone.","The Hematology & Oncology franchise had an excellent second quarter. We delivered a strong sales performance, with 16% year-over-year growth and an impressive 7% sequential growth. In addition, we made great progress with our near and mid-term pipeline.","REVLIMID continues to have outstanding performance, with increases in share and duration across key markets. POMALYST\/IMNOVID grew significantly through increasing treatment duration across all geographies. Finally, ABRAXANE remained stable overall, with continued leadership in pancreatic cancer around the globe.","We are awaiting U.S. approval of IDHIFA, our oral targeted IDH2 inhibitor for relapsed refractory AML in August. We made significant progress in the quarter with our near-term pipeline and future growth drivers, completing enrollment into four Phase III trials.","We're very excited about our collaboration with BeiGene for BGB-A317 in solid tumors, which significantly accelerates our solid tumor strategy and broadens the potential of our growing immuno-oncology portfolio.","And finally, we made great progress toward initiating multiple pivotal programs, from marizomib in glioblastoma, bb2121 in relapsed refractory myeloma, JCAR017 and CC-122 in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, luspatercept in front-line low-risk MDS, and durvalumab in myeloma, MDS, and AML.","REVLIMID sales in the second quarter increased 20% year over year and an impressive 8% quarter over quarter. In the U.S., we had an excellent 26% year-over-year and 10% sequential growth. U.S. growth in quarter two was mostly volume-based, driven by further market share increases in newly diagnosed myeloma and the continued increase in treatment duration.","REVLIMID growth outside of the U.S. was 9% year over year and 4% sequentially. The year-over-year growth rate was impacted by the Russia tender we had in Q2 2016, as we would see twice the same year-over-year growth without the impact of last year's Russia tender. Year-over-year and sequential international volume growth was 17% and 4% respectively, driven by the strong increase in newly diagnosed myeloma market share and treatment duration in the EU, Japan, and Canada.","We've seen over the past quarter some volatility in international sales patterns for REVLIMID. As we have explained previously, this was driven by distributor buying patterns, including the Russia tender and clinical drug supplies. However, when we correct for these factors and look at the true in-the-market sales trends, we see the steady progress of increasing volume and net sales that matches the strong uptake we are seeing in newly diagnosed market share.","The international markets have not reached peak share in the newly diagnosed non-stem cell transplant segment, and we also have not had enough time yet to see the full impact of duration. In addition, we are just initiating stem cell transplant maintenance launches in countries with reimbursement, and see reimbursement and uptake of novel triplets in relapsed refractory myeloma in multiple European markets. All these drivers will ensure continued growth in 2017 as well as through 2020.","We are awaiting the results of our (15:03) indolent lymphoma trials, including AUGMENT in relapsed refractory indolent lymphoma and RELEVANCE in front-line follicular lymphoma by year end. We are pleased with the rapid complete enrollment of our (15:14) ROBUST trial in first-line ABC diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and expect data next year.","Finally, we are preparing to submit an sNDA for RVd in first-line transplant and non-transplant patients in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2018. The slight delay versus previous plans was due to additional regulatory authority data review requests.","POMALYST\/IMNOVID net sales continue to grow across geographies, with 23% year-over-year and 7% sequential growth. In the U.S., POMALYST net sales grew 30% year over year and 12% quarter over quarter. As I mentioned during the first quarter call, the underlying demand for POMALYST in the U.S. is very strong, and the second quarter saw 7% sequential growth in prescriptions. POMALYST continues to maintain a leading share in third-line patients and duration is increasing. We believe that the recent FDA approval of POMALYST in combination with daratumumab for relapsed refractory myeloma will be a key driver for our POMALYST performance.","Outside of the U.S., POMALYST\/IMNOVID continues to grow, with 13% year-over-year growth and 2% sequential growth. Importantly, international sequential volume growth was 6% outside of the U.S., driven by strong third-line-plus share and continued duration gains in all geographies, including Europe and Japan. Finally, as mentioned on our Q1 call, the Phase III OPTIMISMM trial in combination with bortezomib second or later treatment lines completed enrollment, and we expect data in 2018.","ABRAXANE continues to maintain stable demand overall. ABRAXANE net sales grew 2% year over year and 8% quarter over quarter. ABRAXANE U.S. sales decreased 8% year over year. U.S. ABRAXANE clearly maintained its leadership position in pancreatic cancer, but we are seeing the impact of quarterly buying patterns and increasing use of novel agents in non-small-cell lung cancer and breast cancer. Outside of the U.S., ABRAXANE grew 25% year over year, with continued growth in pancreatic cancer.","We anticipate multiple growth drivers in future for ABRAXANE. We expect results of the APACT adjuvant pancreatic cancer trial to be available by the end of 2017, and the pivotal ABRAXANE\/ TECENTRIQ combination trials in non-small-cell lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer will read out in 2018.","We are very excited about the recent announcement of our new strategic immuno-oncology collaboration with BeiGene. As outlined in our press release, we are acquiring worldwide rights outside of Asia excluding Japan to develop and commercialize BGB-A317, an advanced clinical stage PD-1 inhibitor for solid tumors. We believe that BGB-A317 is potentially differentiated and provides us with the ability to combine a checkpoint inhibitor with our broad immuno-oncology portfolio in order to accelerate the development of best-in-class I-O combinations for multiple solid tumor indications.","BGB-A317 complements our growing I-O solid tumor portfolio, enabling us to target selected tumor types through activating T-cells and macrophages, enhancing T-cell function and depleting inhibitory T regulatory cells.","In hematological malignancies, we feel that the I-O portfolio of Celgene is equally uniquely positioned through our existing IMiDs and future cell mods, our ongoing FUSION PD-L1 development program with our partner AstraZeneca, our accelerating CAR-T and bi-specific T-cell engager programs against BCMA and CD19, as well as the opportunity to activate macrophages in T-regulatory cells in targeted malignancies.","In summary, we had another great quarter for the Hematology & Oncology franchise. We had excellent sales performance and we achieved many key clinical milestones. Near-term growth drivers are in place. We are expecting U.S. approval of IDHIFA in IDH2 relapsed refractory AML in August. And we are actively working with commercial payers in the U.S. to ensure patient access to IDHIFA immediately following approval.","For REVLIMID, we are just at the beginning of our stem cell transplant maintenance launch and are awaiting data by year end for our two Phase III trials in indolent lymphoma. We completed enrollment in four Phase III trials for REVLIMID, luspatercept, and CC-486, and we are preparing to initiate pivotal programs for many additional assets by the end of this year.","Finally, we're working to maximize the potential of BGB-A317, a single agent in combination with targeted agents, chemotherapy, and our novel and differentiated I-O pipeline assets through our comprehensive global solid tumor development plan that we look forward to sharing with you in more detail later in the year.","Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Terrie.","Terrie Curran - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Michael, and good morning.","Q2 was an outstanding quarter for Celgene I&I, highlighted by significant sequential growth for OTEZLA. Q2 OTEZLA performance indicators continued to strengthen and market share and prescriber adoption increased significantly in both U.S. and internationally.","We announced positive results from RADIANCE, our second Phase III trial for ozanimod in MS, and are on track to file the U.S. NDA by year end. We are very pleased with the progress of the program and look forward to the data being presented in an upcoming major medical meeting. Additionally, progress continues for GED-0301 and other important pipeline programs.","Global OTEZLA net sales for Q2 were $358 million, which represents growth of 49% year on year and 48% versus Q1, revenue being driven by continued gains in treatment adoption, geographic expansion, and improved market access. With reimbursement now secured across key European markets and Japan, uptake is accelerating rapidly. Ex-U.S. sales have more than doubled versus last year.","In addition, we have advanced multiple future growth drivers for OTEZLA, namely initiating enrollment of the Phase III scalp psoriasis trial and completion of enrollment in both Phase II study in ulcerative colitis and Phase III trial in Beh\u00e7et's disease. As a result of continued strong commercial execution, we anticipate continued revenue growth through the second half of the year and expect full-year revenue to be in the lower half of the guided range.","In the U.S., OTEZLA experienced a rebound in revenue, underpinned by strong brand fundamentals. We saw an increase in script volume and continued to command a significant leadership position for new-to-brand share in both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Additionally, while it is early, we're pleased to see accelerating growth in the plans we have contracted with to remove biologic step edits.","In two markets where OTEZLA was recently launched, France and Japan, uptake is already exceeding competitive benchmarks. In France, we achieved a differentiated access position that enables physicians to prescribe both within and beyond the hospital setting, resulting in OTEZLA surpassing all recent launched analogues in the category.","In Japan, unlike biologics, OTEZLA can be prescribed by community dermatologists, which is fundamentally disrupting the treatment paradigm. In just three months since launch, OTEZLA has gained 38% of new-to-brand switch patients in this setting.","Now turning to ozanimod, the global multiple sclerosis market is substantial, with a current value more than $22 billion. As of 2016, oral therapies represented nearly 40% of the market value, and that segment is expected to continue to grow, fueled by the introduction of ozanimod. Today the market is composed of multiple blockbuster brands. However, each therapy is associated with significant tradeoffs. Substantial unmet needs remain for an oral therapy that balances efficacy, safety, and tolerability.","We're highly encouraged by the results we've seen in both the SUNBEAM and RADIANCE pivotal trials for ozanimod in RMS. The studies achieved efficacy endpoints demonstrating improvements in annualized relapse rate, the number of T2 and gad-enhancing MRI lesions compared to AVONEX. Safety and tolerability findings are consistent with prior studies and continue to support a differentiated profile. Disability progression versus AVONEX was not significant due to a lower rate of progression across both treatment groups in the trials. As a reminder, no oral therapy has demonstrated a disability advantage versus an active comparator to date.","Ozanimod has the potential to offer a unique combination of high-end oral efficacy with a favorable safety and tolerability profile versus established disease-modifying drugs. Given its emerging clinical profile, we expect ozanimod to compete broadly for market leadership.","In summary, Q2 was a quarter of significant advancements and strong growth in the I&I franchise. OTEZLA continues to gain momentum in the core segments of our business while accelerating geographic expansion and driving future lifecycle growth opportunities. We remain focused on progressing our next-generation growth drivers, ozanimod and GED-0301, and look forward with anticipation to multiple data readouts in the next 12 to 24 months.","Thank you for your attention. I'd now like to turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Andrew Smith - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Terrie.","As the team just highlighted, we've made tremendous progress against most of the key milestones we identified at the beginning of the year. The growing momentum across our businesses and increasing leverage inherent in our operating model has us well positioned for the remainder of 2017 and beyond.","Coming off 20% year-over-year growth and a $2 billion quarter, we are expecting numerous catalysts over the next nine months to propel REVLIMID's next wave of growth. These include the ongoing launch and reimbursement in key geographies for the transplant-eligible maintenance indication, data from our AUGMENT and RELEVANCE trials in lymphoma, and the sNDA submission of RVd in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, targeted for the first quarter of 2018.","Additionally, we have completed enrollment in Phase III studies across six distinct diseases and five different assets during the first half of 2017. Three of these trials involve new therapies, CC-486 in AML as well as luspatercept in MDS and beta thalassemia.","In the coming weeks, we expect FDA approval of IDHIFA, our targeted therapy for patients with IDH2 mutated AML. Last week I was with our partners at Agios and our hematology commercial teams. They are energized and ready to launch. IDHIFA will be our eighth commercial product and first of what we expect to be many products originating from our collaborative research model.","We are seeing tremendous momentum in our I&I franchise as we continue to expand the utilization and access of OTEZLA globally. Importantly, the first half of 2017 saw the delivery of two positive pivotal trials for ozanimod in RMS as well as continued strong execution of our pivotal IBD programs, GED-0301 in Crohn's disease and ozanimod in UC.","While our teams around the world are focused intently on delivering our near-term objectives, we continue to invest to grow our business for the long term. In the next five months, we plan to initiate pivotal programs for a number of potentially transformational novel late-stage assets, which are expected to drive our growth through 2030.","Importantly, the BeiGene transaction provides us with both a local commercial partnership for China and a PD-1 inhibitor already in advanced clinical development for various solid tumor indications. BGB-A317 will be a cornerstone for novel immuno-oncology combinatorial development across our portfolio of assets. The deal is expected to close by the end of the third quarter. We are very excited about the opportunity for BGB-A317 and our entire I-O portfolio.","I hope you can sense our energy and enthusiasm. We are committed to optimizing the significant potential and promise of Celgene. Thanks to the work of my 7,000 colleagues around the world, we are incredibly well positioned for the future.","Operator, please now open the line to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Michael Yee from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC","Hey, thanks. Good morning and congrats on a good quarter. I wanted to ask on the BeiGene deal, of course new recently, and how that might change your interest in not only your early-stage assets for I-O but potentially looking externally as well. So I guess maybe you could expand a bit on the clinical strategy for BeiGene and whether or not you have sufficient assets here to develop a big enough I-O platform. Thanks.","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","Hi, Michael. This is Michael. Thanks for the question. So let me start by saying that we are really excited about having the opportunity to develop this asset, as it is extremely well characterized. It's in late-stage clinical development, and more than 500 patients have been treated. And it may also offer the opportunity, at least from pre-clinical models, to be differentiated, and clinical data will show that.","We think we have a great opportunity to use this asset to bring forward our I-O strategy and our solid tumor strategy. As we think that through deep translational work and understanding of the tumor but also the immune system, we will be able to come up very tailored and very thoughtful and logical combinatorial therapy. In that sense, I think our pipeline is extremely well positioned, as we cannot just go for activating T-cells. We can also alter T-cell function. We can go after T-regulatory cells. We have the opportunity to activate macrophages. And then, of course, we are really working heavily on cellular immunotherapy. So what we think is that we have all the ingredients for a very thoughtful and science-led approach and going into the right patient segments with the right combinatorial approaches.","What you heard us saying is the plan that we are starting to work on is going be very comprehensive. It will have monotherapy, combinatorial approaches where we're also, of course, looking into potential targeted therapies, chemotherapy, and thoughtful I-O\/I-O combinations. We're not ruling out any combination at this moment of time, but we feel we are extremely well positioned with the pipeline that we're having.","Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC","So just to follow up, do you think by ASH we would have a plan laid out for what studies you had started and the timelines on that?","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","I think we are confident that we can provide a very thorough update to you at ASH, yes.","Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC","Perfect.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Michael, hi. It's Mark. Just to follow a little bit on Michael's great description of where we are and what we're thinking, it's very clear that this year so far, the PARP class has become really well established in multiple solid tumors as maintenance therapy, for example, in ovarian cancer and some other really encouraging areas.","When we think about the ability to take BGB-A317 into all of our internal combinations that Michael spoke so nicely about, it's very clear to us that the landscape for combinatorial work across multiple parties, including now the PARP class, comes into focus. So we're looking forward to closing the deal. As Scott pointed out, we're not yet closed, but I do think by the end of the year we'll have a comprehensive research approach that is fast to market, differentiated, that learns from everything that's going on today, even today, and that clearly mechanisms like PARP will be included in that program.","Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, I think you mentioned it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Citi. Your line is open.","Robyn Karnauskas, Ph.D. - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask you a little bit about CC-220's strategy in lupus, and now you've announced I think CC-122 in MS. Maybe give us some thoughts. I know lupus is a really hard market, but give us your thoughts on the data. And what gives you the confidence that Phase III will be successful and how you think it could be positioned in this space? Thanks.","Terrie Curran - Celgene Corp.","I think CC-220 is a novel oral immunomodulatory compound. I think lupus, there's a large unmet need for \u2013 there really are no treatments in this area. I think if we look at the clinical data, we're very encouraged by the Phase IIa program. It really was a dose-blending study to look at three escalating doses, and we're really encouraged by the results that we see in all of the components of the trial there, and very pleased that we're now moving into Phase IIb.","Scott Andrew Smith - Celgene Corp.","So if I can just comment as well \u2013 thank you, Terrie. That particular Phase IIa study was quite data-intense. We looked at a number of different endpoints from a number of different angles. It was very encouraging across the board. It's an early study, but we certainly saw activity on a number of different endpoints, and we're very encouraged by what we saw. There seemed to be coming out of that Phase IIa study a nice benefit\/risk profile. All the them need to be confirmed in later-stage development, and so we're moving there. But you're right. It's a very complex disease but one in which there's tremendous unmet medical need, and I think we have some pretty exciting initial data.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Raymond from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks, just a two part question I guess on REVLIMID ex-U.S. So it looks like you're guiding to French reimbursement in front-line use this quarter. I'm just curious if you could clarify. Has there been a measurable expanded access program? And could we expect any true-up for that once the reimbursement is formalized?","And then maybe an extension of that, you give a really nice chart of patient share progression in the front-line non-transplant setting, but I think you said before and I think you said on this call that Europe is still a big duration opportunity. Could you maybe provide some detail there? What's the average duration in the U.S., and what's the gap I guess between Europe and the U.S.? Thanks.","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","Hi, Raymond. This is Michael. Thanks for the question \u2013 Chris. Starting with France, before you get reimbursement, there is some access opportunities in France, but they are limited, so by no way comparable to a situation where you have a price and you can promote.","So we see some very limited uptake at this moment of time in France, but of course we expect a very marked change once reimbursement has been gained. We are confident that we can achieve this in Q3. We are working very closely with the payers. Of course, it's a large segment, and we have I think very constructive discussions about that. So the slide that you, by the way, also saw is a composite, and it has France in there without reimbursement at this moment of time. So we think that's going to change very nicely once we have achieved that.","When we're thinking about treatment duration, which is another major opportunity, we are at this moment of time roundabout 14 to 15 months in Europe. And just don't forget, the change of treatment duration of REVLIMID as compared to second-line is something that needs to build up over time. So we're been launching one to two years ago starting with Germany, and then we got other reimbursement countries. What you see with the 14 to 15 months is still very much driven by treatment duration that we traditionally saw by second-line, and we need to overcome this once the countries have been getting reimbursement in order to get to these longer treatment durations that we see in the U.S. Our treatment duration is way above 20 months.","The other key element, just to round it, is the triplets, which of course are much more used in the U.S. at this moment of time. But Europe is picking up, and we got reimbursement of triplets in a couple of markets, so we're going to see this effect coming in Europe as well. Over time, I think treatment duration will become very similar.","Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoff Porges from Leerink Partners. Your line is open.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much for the question and congratulations on the very strong results. I have a question for Peter or perhaps Scott. Spectacular operating margin performance in the quarter and the guidance going out to high 50%. And when we look ahead, you have two CAR-T programs, two checkpoint antibodies, multiple programs in new indications such as inflammatory bowel disease. Are you confident that you can maintain your operating margins at this range and still fund all those opportunities, or should we be cautious about that outlook? Thanks.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Hi, Geoff. It's Peter. Let me take it. First, I'll talk to the financial outlook, and Scott maybe can add some comments after. First of all, thanks for the question.","And I just would remind everybody that we really made a focus on building the pipeline. And in all of our projections, we've indicated while it's not precise that we would seek to have research and development as a percentage of revenue be roughly maintained as we roll forward. That's a high priority for us, and of course we add to that all the other external collaboration efforts with all our portfolio partners. So if you think about it and you think about our guidance, let's say just through 2020, and obviously it can go beyond that, we're seeing very stout, very strong high teens at least top line growth. So it means our R&D budget is growing at least that fast as we go forward.","Additionally, we have talked a lot about that we've got 18 late-stage trials that are wrapping up and reporting out. And while there's certainly some carry-forward work in a lot of those programs, it's not quite the same scale probably as spend. So in a sense, we have some of our existing R&D budget probably opening up.","So I think we are very comfortable, quite frankly, in being able to support all the programs that you mentioned and others. I think that the ones you mentioned are obviously very high profile, highly visible. I would say that a lot of work that Rupert and the franchise have been doing just a little bit earlier when I commented on actually opening up pivotal trials and so forth, it is really exciting for us going forward.","I think we'll continue to see nice P&L leverage from SG&A. Obviously, you've seen that already, and that's while we've been building out the I&I commercial footprint in Europe and now also in Japan. And so obviously, the leverage we get is tremendous. And while we still have more build-out in the GI space and MS, I think the math will work that the G&A leverage and the leverage of our existing commercial infrastructure will allow SG&A to continue to be very efficient.","And then obviously as we get to the back end of the decade, you might start to see a little bit of additional cost of goods as a percentage of sales as we launch some of our newer PARPs because some of them, as you know, are proteins or oligonucleotides or CAR-T and so forth, and they may have slightly higher cost of goods. We've put that all into our guidance and certainly feel very comfortable that certainly through 2020 and beyond we're in great shape on margin. I do think we probably got to the high-50% in Q2 a little faster than we thought. But as I mentioned, we do expect to see a little step up in R&D, the pace of spending, let's say, in the second half. All of that's been factored into our guidance. So thanks.","I think overall, it's an exciting time. I think we are building up capabilities at the same time as we're executing on these programs. We've made a lot of key additions to our organization, and we feel very good about everything from the research and development efforts to the broad portfolio of development programs as well as our global footprint and our ability to support it from a tech-ops and manufacturing standpoint. So it's all coming together I think really nicely for us. Thanks.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Great, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Schmidt from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks. I think this might be for either Scott or Michael. I think it was Scott who said he'd been spending some time recently with the folks at Agios. So this question is just on the upcoming approval of IDHIFA. Can you give us a sense of the size of the market opportunity there and what your approach might be on commercializing the drug? Thanks.","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","So thanks for the question, Eric. We really wanted to start with our excitement about the ability to bring our first partnered asset from our distributed research model to approval and also, by the way, our first asset with a companion diagnostic. The other thing that of course is very exciting for us is the fact that relapsed refractory AML in particular is a patient population where their medical need is very high.","Talking about the patient population in specific, IDH2 mutated relapsed refractory AML is our starting point patient population, so the relapsed refractory AML population that exists, and around about 10% to 15% of these patients have this mutation. And the way to move forward from a strategic standpoint here, apart from of course having a great launch in a patient population with a high medical need, is in parallel developing IDHIFA in first-line AML. Now different to relapsed refractory AML, this is going be a combinatorial strategy. We have two Phase II trials ongoing, one with 7+3, the other one with VIDAZA. They're going to both read out by the end of the year, and that allows us then to make decisions about our future development program.","The true commercial opportunity for this asset is really in this population and through long treatment duration. But it's great to have this very first exciting step for those patients with monotherapy in relapsed refractory AML, and we're very confident about our launch preparations.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike King from JMP Securities. Your line is open.","Michael G. King, Jr. - JMP Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. Let me add my congratulations on the solid execution, another question regarding growth in duration of therapy. I just wondered if \u2013 I know it's not your product, but the ASPIRE label for KYPROLIS and the improvement in PFS that was seen over VELCADE, just wondering about your thoughts about perhaps uptake of KYPROLIS in more early-stage regimens, triple combinations, and what effect that may have on future duration? Thank you.","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","Hi, this is Michael. I think this is an interesting question in the context of the fact that in the U.S. in particular but now also in Europe, triplets are really gaining a lot of traction. And of course, not all triplets are created equal. If you combine an IMiD with a proteasome inhibitor, that serves certain patient populations. If you combine an IMiD with an antibody, other patient populations may be served well.","I think as a general comment, what you can achieve by combining an IMiD with either a proteasome inhibitor or antibody goes way beyond what you can achieve with doublets, positive for patients, but then certainly also positive for us as a company because REVLIMID treatment duration increases big time. And the same, by the way, is true if you combine pomalidomide with other assets.","So I think that's a key reason why triplets are getting so much traction. I would really make a statement of it depends which triplets you are using from the exact patient that is sitting in front of you in the office.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoffrey Meacham from Barclays. Your line is open.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for the question, and I also want to offer my congrats on the quarter. Just on ozanimod in MS, I wanted to get any updated perspective that you guys have on the commercial strategy. Obviously, we're going to see data later on this fall, and I suspect you're going to probably have the ability to talk a little bit more openly about it. But I just wanted to get what's on the critical path commercially pre-filing? And then when you think broadly about the MS opportunity, Biogen just recently discussed having value-based pricing, so maybe just give your perspective on the long-term pricing in the market. Thanks.","Terrie Curran - Celgene Corp.","Thanks, Geoffrey. So I think first of all, we're on track to file by the end of the year. I think from a market opportunity, we really do see the MS treatment paradigms favoring increased use of oral therapies, and there is an unmet need for MS indication for an oral therapy that's both efficacious and tolerable. And what we see is that ozanimod may offer a differentiated profile that balances efficacy, safety, and tolerability relative to oral therapies that are currently in the market.","So this feels like a space that really is the sweet spot for Celgene. There's a small prescriber base. About 3,000 physicians in the U.S. prescribe 80% of treatment. So what's on the critical path for us right now is really establishing both our medical and our commercial organization, engaging with the market access folks, and looking at our pricing strategy. Clearly, it's too early for us to define our pricing strategy. We're going to watch closely as the market evolves over the next 12 months to determine what will really maximize the value of that asset but also maximize the position in treatment for ozanimod.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Salim Syed from Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.","Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. And this is another question on ozanimod, following on Geoff. Previously, you guys have guided to $4 billion to $6 billion for MS and UC, with the vast majority in UC. So if I'm interpreting that correctly, assuming the midpoint, you'd give UC about $3 billion and MS $2 billion. TECFIDERA does $4 billion. I'm just wondering. Are you guys being conservative in your guidance here, or do you plan on updating this at some point, just your thoughts on that, please? Thank you.","Terrie Curran - Celgene Corp.","So we see $2 billion to $3 billion in each of the indications. I think if you look at the emerging data in both MS and UC, we really do have not only a novel compound but a differentiated compound, both being oral as well as having a unique balance of safety, efficacy, and tolerability. So at this point in time, obviously we're continuing to assess the competitive landscape, but at this point we're continuing to guide to $2 billion to $3 billion for each of those indications.","Scott Andrew Smith - Celgene Corp.","Thanks you, Terrie. This is Scott. Again, the original guidance, to reinforce what Terrie was saying, was we were thinking $4 billion to $6 billion in total, relatively equally divided between the two indications ahead of Phase III data. We believe as we move also positive data and move into Crohn's, that could be upside from the $4 billion to $6 billion that we talked about earlier. That $4 billion to $6 billion was simply UC and MS. And as we hopefully move forward into Crohn's as well, that would provide upside to the model.","Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have a question on ozanimod. So based on your read of the Phase III data, do you believe you will have a differentiated label from GILENYA?","And then also, around that topic, it sounds like you won't have a renewed focus on neurology. So what's your focus for future BD strategy around building a neurology business? Thank you.","Terrie Curran - Celgene Corp.","Okay, so maybe I'll answer the first part, Ying Huang, regarding differentiation. Then I'll ask Scott to focus on BD, or Rupert.","So I think if we look at the Phase II data, and you'll see in more depth the Phase III data later this year, I think we see a profile that really is differentiated, being a specific S1P1. We're really seeing that come to light in terms of the both the tolerability as well as the safety profile across a number of different parameters. So yes, I think we'll clearly be very well differentiated versus GILENYA.","Rupert Vessey - Celgene Corp.","Hi, this is Rupert Vessey. I'll talk to you a little bit about earlier neuroscience efforts. So where we are with this right now, our initial steps have been to build a small and highly competent neuroscience team. We believe that the platforms that we have inside the company, which are clearly very focused around immunology \u2013 you've heard a lot, mostly you were there, at least many of you were at our (49:34) deep dive on protein homeostasis. These are core elements of neurogenerative diseases. And what we're doing is setting up the appropriate collaborations through business development activities to look for opportunities that we may already have that can be taken into these areas of great unmet need.","We're also, of course, pursuing strategies that are more conventional in terms of business development to look to build out nearer-term opportunities, and that's an ongoing and active process, and I'm sure you'll hear more from us over time.","Scott Andrew Smith - Celgene Corp.","And this is Scott. Just to add on to the comments, we feel very, very good about the data that's emerging for ozanimod and looking forward to getting it out. We believe that it provides an anchor for our neuro franchise in the future, a good anchor product, multiple potential indications. But the first indication in MS we think we're going to have when the data comes out, we think we're going to have the right kind of value proposition to really have an anchor in that business and then look for other opportunities to continue to build, as we always would.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Somaiya from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please check that your line is not on mute.","Patrick E. Flanigan III - Celgene Corp.","All right, Crystal, let's go ahead and go to the next caller.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I was hoping that you could just spend a couple minutes reviewing your strategy in BCMA. And also just in talking to us, you obviously have three different assets there and how you think those assets are going be positioned as well as where you think you might be able to expand CAR-T beyond just the very relapsed setting. Thanks very much.","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","Hi, this is Michael. Thanks for the very good question. The starting point of the positioning of course is the clinical data, and you also have the very positive results that we've been showing at ASCO. You can't get any better than a 100% response rate in a partially penta-refractory population. And many of these patients have CR, so even a MIB-negative disease.","So the starting point for the development of CAR-T is definitely taking the late-line population that has no additional treatment option. We are at this moment of time going into an expansion phase with bb2121 with the dose that we've been choosing, and we feel we can go right into a pivotal program.","There is more opportunity, of course, for this asset when we're thinking about patient segments in multiple myeloma that are currently underserved, for example, patients who are relapsing very fast after standard therapy, for example, patients who have a genetic profile, risk patients. And those patients usually have a life expectancy of three to four years. Those are patients to think about.","At the end of the day when you think about curing a patient population, you need to go into the first-line population. We're thinking about that as well. We will be very selective. There is a huge effort ongoing to really making sure that we can define high-risk patients in a way that regulatory authorities are going to appreciate the effort, but we feel that there is a role of this technology in the first-line setting as well.","Our bi-specific antibody is really complementary to this effort for a couple of occasions. You need bridging therapy for CAR-T patients. You need to bring the initial cell count down before you can go CAR-T. You may not achieve a CR but only a PR, and then you can use bi-specific antibodies. So these different assets are very complementary, and they don't exclude themselves. There's certainly a population of elderly, frail patients where CAR-T may not be an option, and a bi-specific antibody may be optimal. So we're really thinking very, very comprehensively.","I would just add when we're looking at BCMA as a target, which is a great target, it's not always thinking about options by excluding themselves. I think what the whole field is showing, the combinatorial approach is often the approach that makes the most sense, and that's what we have in mind.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","The other comment that Michael and I would make \u2013 it's Mark \u2013 is when we think about the antibody, the flexibility of the antibody beyond just myeloma, because we know that this antigen presents itself in several blood cancers for the antibody, would provide us a therapeutic option for CAR-T would likely be limited to myeloma. But the antibody could have a lot more application across multiple blood cancers.","Patrick E. Flanigan III - Celgene Corp.","Great. So, Crystal, we're bumping up against the hour here. I know there are multiple other conference calls that are going to start. So we have time for maybe two more callers, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question and fitting me in. I wanted to follow up on the recent BeiGene collaboration. You mentioned a couple of times on the call that you believe this asset could potentially be differentiated based on pre-clinical findings. So I was wondering if you could talk about the characteristics or the data you've seen that give you the confidence to make that statement.","And then just along those lines, do you see any enhanced opportunity here with this morning's news on the MYSTIC trial? I assume it's too soon to say too much on that front, but I figured I'd still ask anyway. Thanks.","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","Great questions. Starting on the molecule, and I think we've been really choosing our words very carefully, as we said, potentially differentiated, and this potential differentiation is really based on pre-clinical observations. This asset has a silent Fc receptor that may actually lead to less interaction with inhibitory immune cells or other immune cells that you don't want. In pre-clinical models, there is an advantage, but this needs to show in the clinical models.","What's really exciting for us and why we feel that our whole program can be differentiated is two things, and that also refers to MYSTIC. A), the breadth of our pipeline, which is not just including T-cell activating agents, but we have many, many other opportunities including cellular therapy to go after the patient populations that we want to go after. And B), and I think that's a bit of learning of MYSTIC, we really need to make an effort to fully understand which combination should go into which patient population and how we can better predict as to which other patients are really profiting from the therapy. PD-L1 may not be the sole answer here. I think this later point is nicely shown by the FUSION program that we are running where we really have a deep translational effort, and that's exactly what we're going to do with BGB-A317 as well.","So I personally believe that while it is great to have a pre-clinical hint to differentiation, the true differentiation comes through the translational program and the combinatory approaches that we're going to use.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sure, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alethia Young from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in and congrats on the quarter, just one for Michael. I wanted you to talk a little about the luspatercept opportunity coming up with MDS and beta-thalassemia, and then maybe the potential opportunity to leverage your sales force, rest of world as well. I feel like we're heading into the next six or nine months where we'll get data there. Thanks.","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","As you know, I'm a huge fan of luspatercept. I'm always saying this. But I think we have created a wonderful starting point with two fully recruited Phase III studies in a later-line MDS, low-risk MDS population where we have a nice marker to identify those patients who have the highest likelihood to respond and in beta thalassemia starting with patients who are transfusion-dependent. And we're going to get these top line results by the middle of the year.","And we really see this as a starting point for this asset, because what we are trying to do in the second half of this year is a couple of things. A), we've been showing to you data in an early-line low-risk MDS population which look really intriguing and, by the way, also intriguing in RS-negative patients. So what we're just doing at this moment of time is we're recruiting some of these patients so that we can make a pivotal decision for an early-line low-risk MDS study, which we call COMMANDS, by the end of the year. That offers a huge opportunity for us.","Second big opportunity that follows in beta thalassemia is of course the non-transfusion-dependent patients, and we will look forward to that.","Third big opportunity is myelofibrosis, where we saw really intriguing results with a system molecule. We want to repeat this and have a really good translational program and also combinatorial approach so that we can make a pivotal decision on myelofibrosis by the end of the year. If only some of these opportunities are hitting, luspatercept is going to be a huge drug.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","So this is Peter. Thank you, Michael, and thanks, everybody on the call, for the great questions, a fantastic quarter. We delivered outstanding results in the second quarter and have great momentum to finish up the year in great shape. But even more important for all of us in the room here, while we continue to drive great top line growth, great bottom line growth, and P&L leverage, we are also significantly advancing our pipeline and executing on key strategic initiatives that really set up the platform for long-term growth through 2020 and into the whole next decade. And I think you can see a lot of questions we had today, quite frankly, are about the assets that are going to drive us past 2020 and really create a tremendous growth story for us, and that's what we're all working hard on.","So thank you for your support, thank you for your interest, and enjoy the summer.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

I would like to remind you this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Patrick Flanigan, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations at Celgene.","Patrick E. Flanigan III - Celgene Corp.","Thanks, Kat, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter earnings conference call. The press release reporting our financial results, in addition to the presentation for today's webcast, can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the corporate website at www.celgene.com.","Joining me in the room today with prepared remarks are Mark Alles, our Chief Executive Officer; Peter Kellogg, our Chief Financial Officer; Jackie Fouse, our Chief Operating Officer; Michael Pehl, President of our Hematology & Oncology franchise; and Scott Smith, President and Global Head of our Inflammation & Immunology franchise.","As a reminder, during today's call we will be making forward-looking regarding our financial outlook, in addition to regulatory and product development plans.

Alles - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Patrick. Good morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. I'd like to begin by welcoming Michael Pehl to our call in his role as President of our global Hematology & Oncology franchise. Michael brings over 25 years of industry experience to his leadership position and joined Celgene in 2006 as the first General Manager of our German affiliate. Michael has made significant contributions to our company in roles of increasing responsibility, including Head of our Hematology business in Europe and Head of our global Hematology & Oncology marketing group. Welcome, Michael.","We appreciate the opportunity to review our second quarter operating performance and the progress we have made advancing major corporate objectives with you. Guided by our strategic imperatives, our global teams are driving outstanding results and achieving key financial, regulatory, clinical, and commercial milestones that Peter, Michael, Scott, and Jackie will discuss with you today.","Against virtually every metric, our second quarter was outstanding. This momentum, combined with the leverage our business model continues to generate, improves our full-year outlook such that today we are raising our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5.70 to $5.75, from our earlier target of $5.60 to $5.70 and are guiding to the high end of our current net product sales range of $10.75 billion to $11 billion. Peter will provide much more detail about our second quarter financial performance and improving outlook in a few minutes.","Our management team is committed to delivering exceptional results each quarter while we continue to invest in and advance opportunities expected to maximize the potential of our commercial franchises and build strong and diverse platforms for long-term value creation. We believe this balance was well-represented in the quarter. For example, at ASCO and at EHA, new clinical data were presented that cemented REVLIMID's position as a standard of care for myeloma patients. In just the past year, five novel agents have generated significantly better clinical outcomes in multiple myeloma when combined with REVLIMID. These new data and real-world patient outcomes are adding to the momentum of our global myeloma franchise.","As you will hear from Scott, our investments in the commercialization of OTEZLA continue to drive it to leadership positions in the U.S. psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis markets. And its global expansion is accelerating as we complete launch preparations in major European markets and Japan.","Recognizing the inherent challenges associated with clinical development, we continue to advance high-potential pipeline programs to diversify our opportunities. Earlier this week, we announced that based on the interim overall survival analysis of the REMARC study testing REVLIMID as maintenance therapy for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, we currently do not plan to seek approval for this indication. However, given the optionality and diversity of our late-stage programs, we remain confident in our mid- and long-term growth potential and profile. One of these programs is GED-0301, where later this quarter we expect to have the CD-001 12-week endoscopic data. Scott will discuss our progress developing GED-0301 and our I&I pipeline later during our call.","Through our internal research capabilities, and with our exceptional partners, we have created and continue to add new platforms expected to improve our opportunities for longer-term growth. Since the beginning of the year, we have filed four investigational new drug applications for Celgene-developed products, entered into a number of important collaborations, and advanced key clinical programs with our partners. Last week, we announced a new collaboration with Jounce Therapeutics, adding to our differentiated opportunities to identify and develop novel immuno-oncology therapies. Our work with Jounce is expected to meaningfully add to the progress we are making with our immuno-oncology partners Juno, bluebird bio, Lycera, and AstraZeneca. And our expanded relationship with Agios will investigate potential new therapies based on immune cell metabolic pathways that are expected have applications for the treatment of cancers as well as inflammatory disorders.","These examples highlight just some of the progress we are making with our efforts to discover and advance tomorrow's transformational therapies and create a better future for patients in need. We look forward to updating you on the progress of our research and key late-stage programs throughout the second half of the year. Despite continued global economic and political uncertainties, our business momentum has never been stronger. We continue to invest in late-stage clinical trials to optimize the value proposition of our existing portfolio, advance our mid- and late-stage pipeline, and add promising alliances to our internal research efforts.","These are very exciting times at Celgene. Thank you very much, and please help me welcome Peter to our call.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone.","In Q2, we continued to build on the momentum from the first quarter and execute across our portfolio. Our strong top line growth is driven by volume, with exceptional performance from our core products. Our bottom line is driven by careful P&L management, while we continue to invest in our innovative R&D portfolio. Our performance this year has led us to raise our adjusted diluted EPS range, as Mark said, to $5.70 to $5.75, to guide net product sales to approximately $11 billion, and REVLIMID sales to approximately $6.8 billion for 2016.","Turning to our second quarter top line results, we continue to see impressive, industry-leading growth. Our year-over-year growth for net product sales was 22%. Now, Michael and Scott will discuss the underlying demand for this performance later in the call. The driver of our top line growth continues to be volume. Volume accounted for 16 of the total 21.8 percentage points. Our bottom line growth continues to be strong, and adjusted earnings per share grew to $1.44 per share. Our year-over-year 17% growth was achieved despite higher R&D expenses related to our numerous late-stage programs, our acquisitions of Receptos and Quanticel that closed in the second half of 2015, and the decision to opt in on several collaboration programs over the past year.","Turning to our P&L, we continue to have exceptional performance. The adjusted operating margin improved 330 basis points year over year to 54.6% for the quarter. Quarter over quarter, we saw a 60 basis point improvement. We continue to see excellent leverage in SG&A, which from a margin perspective offsets our R&D investment. Operating income drove $0.35 per share of the $0.21 per share bottom line growth. Financial levers had a total negative $0.14 impact, which includes the additional interest expense from last year's bond offering.","We ended the quarter with approximately $6.4 billion in cash and marketable securities. For the first half of 2016, we purchased nearly $1.8 billion of our outstanding shares. And in June, an additional $3 billion for share repurchases was authorized, leaving us with a total authorization level of approximately $5.1 billion.","Based on our exceptional first half performance and strong momentum, we are updating our 2016 guidance for REVLIMID net product sales, total net product sales, adjusted operating margin, and adjusted diluted EPS. Now, our prior guidance for POMALYST, ABRAXANE and OTEZLA net product sales will remain unchanged. As mentioned earlier, we are guiding to full-year REVLIMID net product sales of $6.8 billion, from the prior guidance of $6.7 billion, and this is due to the strong uptake seen year to date. Our continued management of the SG&A line allows us to raise our adjusted operating margin guidance for the year by 50 basis points to approximately 54%. We now expect our adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.70 to $5.75. We are also updating our diluted share count from 811 million to 806 million due to our first half share repurchases.","Our first half performance has been superb, and we anticipate continued great commercial momentum. Looking ahead, we are also excited for the next phase of drivers to extend our future growth.","Thank you. And now I'd like to turn the call over to my colleague, Michael.","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone.","Before we start, let me take the opportunity to thank our hematology and oncology teams across the globe for their great work in delivering a truly outstanding second quarter. We have made significant progress in further maximizing the opportunity of our existing assets and in advancing our development programs and pipelines across assets and diseases.","Our Q2 financial results are extremely strong, with 16% year-over-year revenue growth and 9% sequential growth. The REVLIMID NDMM launch is highly successful across all geographies. We expanded reimbursement across key markets and saw positive uptake in duration trends in the markets where we have reimbursement.","POMALYST\/IMNOVID continues to grow globally, with strong market share and duration results.","ABRAXANE had a positive quarter around the globe, despite the uptake of novel agents in breast and lung cancer. We are maintaining our U.S. leadership position in pancreatic cancer, and our pancreatic market share is growing in reimbursed markets outside of the U.S.","There was a very positive flow of data supporting our key in-line brands. Impressive clinical results of REVLIMID in NDMM maintenance, in combination with daratumumab in relapsed\/refractory myeloma, as well as ABRAXANE combination data with checkpoint inhibitors, have been presented at the ASCO and EHA meetings in June.","Our pipeline is advancing substantially, including our AG-221 and luspatercept pivotal studies. We are very pleased with the progress of our I-O programs. We have opened additional trials of the FUSION program for the (12:42) and hematologic malignancies and made progress with our CAR-T partnerships with Juno and bluebird bio. Finally, our next-generation CELMoDs are moving forward in the clinic.","REVLIMID delivered outstanding results in Q2, with 18% year over year and 8% sequential revenue growth. All key performance metrics are strong globally, and the majority of the growth is coming from volume. The U.S. NDMM launch continues to produce significant share and duration gains. U.S. year-over-year growth in TRxes for the quarter was 16%, and NRx growth was 17%. We have made steady progress with reimbursement in Europe and expect to have reimbursement in additional markets, such as Italy, by the end of 2016. NDMM share continues to grow in reimbursed markets in Europe, as well as in Japan, and is in line with our expectations.","As we discussed during our Q1 earnings call, the momentum for REVLIMID in multiple myeloma is extremely strong, supported by multiple drivers such as the ongoing NDMM launch, the growing evidence for continuous treatment, and multiple triplet readouts and approvals in the U.S. and in Europe. Additional momentum in myeloma beyond 2016 will be generated through our ongoing and planned SCT maintenance submissions in Europe and the U.S., as well as the recent publication of Rd plus daratumumab data in relapsed\/refractory myeloma, with an estimated progression-free survival of well over 14 months.","As we look forward for REVLIMID beyond myeloma, lymphoma will be a major growth driver by 2020 and beyond. As Mark mentioned, earlier this week we provided an update on the REMARC trial evaluating REVLIMID as maintenance therapy in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, responding to first-line R-CHOP therapy. We are working closely with our partner LYSA to analyze the data and look forward to presenting the results at a major hematology conference later this year.","The REMARC study is part of a broad REVLIMID program focused on multiple NHL histologies and patient segments. While REMARC evaluated a unique clinical strategy of using REVLIMID as maintenance monotherapy in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, the other four Phase III studies are testing the combination of REVLIMID with rituximab, or rituximab-based combination therapies, in follicular lymphoma and first-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients with the ABC subtype.","We feel that the evidence created through multiple Phase II studies in those settings is very robust, supporting strong value propositions, unique mechanisms of action, and a good likelihood of success for the RELEVANCE, ROBUST, and AUGMENT trials. Results from the RELEVANCE and AUGMENT trials are expected next year. Our 2020 REVLIMID financial target includes between $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion in sales for lymphoma. We designed this range to be independent of the success of any one of the five Phase III trials.","POMALYST\/IMNOVID delivered a strong 35% year-over-year and 16% quarter-over-quarter net sales growth. We have leading market shares in the U.S., launch markets in Europe and Japan continue to see share gains, while duration is increasing globally. Despite the growing number of relapsed\/refractory myeloma treatment options, we see a stable third-line share and an increasing second-line share for POMALYST, which is driven by earlier usage directly after REVLIMID and in combination with traditional and new agents, further enhancing value proposition and clinical benefits.","We recently received FDA approval for a POMALYST label update in patients with renal impairment, which will allow us to better educate on the usage of POMALYST in this patient population. We have received a positive CHMP opinion for a similar label update for IMNOVID in Europe. Our development programs for POMALYST\/IMNOVID in multiple combinations continue to advance. This includes our Phase III MM-007 trial in combination with bortezomib in second or later treatment lines, as well as ongoing Phase I\/II combination studies with daratumumab and durvalumab.","ABRAXANE had a solid performance in the second quarter, with 2% year-over-year net sales growth and 11% sequential growth. In the U.S., ABRAXANE maintained its leadership share position in metastatic pancreatic cancer and continued to stabilize in breast and lung cancer, despite competition from other agents. ABRAXANE net sales outside the U.S. grew 2% year over year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and despite some slight headwinds from price and distributor buying patterns. It's important to note that many recently reimbursed markets have not yet reached peak shares in pancreatic cancer.","I'd also like to remind you of the long-term opportunities for ABRAXANE. Data for ABRAXANE in combination with Tecentriq in triple-negative breast cancer were presented at ASCO, adding to the highly encouraging clinical evidence for I-O ABRAXANE combinations reported a couple of months ago for non-small cell lung cancer. I-O ABRAXANE Phase III trials in non-small cell lung cancer and triple negative breast cancer are set to read out in 2017 and 2018, respectively.","In addition to the development programs that I have described for our in-line brands, I am very pleased with the progress we are making in advancing our broad and deep earlier and later-stage pipeline. Let me focus on a couple of key programs and assets. The enrollment of the Phase II expansion study of AG-221 in relapsed\/refractory AML is completed, and the Phase III study in relapsed\/refractory AML is on track. Our luspatercept collaboration with Acceleron is rapidly moving forward, and our expected Phase III trials in patients with lower-risk MDS and beta-thalassemia continue to enroll well.","I'm particularly excited about the progress we've made with our I-O pipeline. The durvalumab FUSION program is now enrolling six trials in multiple hematological malignancies in combination with many Celgene assets, including POMALYST in relapsed\/refractory myeloma, REVLIMID in newly diagnosed myeloma, daratumumab in relapsed\/refractory myeloma, multiple assets in NHL or CLL, with Vidaza in high-risk MDS and AML, and with CC-486 in high-risk MDS.","In April, we opted into the CD19 CAR-T program with Juno and made good progress with our respective development programs for Europe. In the first quarter of this year, we opted into a bluebird BCMA program. This program continues to advance and, in conjunction with durvalumab and our next generation CELMoD, will be an important cornerstone on our way to the cure for multiple myeloma.","Finally, I'd like to highlight the progress we've made in substantially advancing our understanding of protein homeostasis over the past few years, which has put us in a position to investigate multiple new and potentially more effective next-generation CELMoDs in targeted, higher-risk patient segments. We have our CC-122 program enrolling into multiple proof-of-concept studies in several indications, both as monotherapy and in combination with new agents. And we have other candidates coming that we will tell you more about as we make progress.","To summarize, we had a great second quarter for the Hematology & Oncology franchise on all fronts. As Peter mentioned, our strong momentum has given us the confidence to raise our REVLIMID revenue guidance to approximately $6.8 billion. The strength of the entire portfolio makes us believe that we will hit the high end of our revenue range for 2016. Our clinical programs are advancing nicely. The RELEVANCE and AUGMENT follicular lymphoma trials will read out in 2017. The POMALYST\/IMNOVID MM-007 pivotal study will provide results in 2018. And we have ABRAXANE opportunities in adjuvant pancreatic cancer and with I-O combinations that will be reading out in 2017 and 2018. Finally, our earlier pipeline is moving forward substantially, especially in I-O and protein homeostasis. We have a lot of confidence in accelerating momentum in our near-term and long-term opportunities and are on track to deliver on the 2020 target for our franchise.","Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Scott.","Scott A. Smith - Celgene Corp.","Thanks, Michael. Good morning. Q2 was a strong quarter for Celgene I&I. In Q2, we saw revenue growth accelerate throughout the quarter in both the U.S. and the EU. Leading indicators of demand remained strong in the U.S. and throughout Europe.","In Q2 we received the top line results for our atopic dermatitis Phase II proof of concept study and are evaluating next steps. We also advanced the development pipeline by taking important steps forward in the GED-0301 and ozanimod programs, as well as with other early- to mid-stage clinical programs.","Global OTEZLA net sales for Q2 2016 were $242 million. This represents a 170% year-on-year increase and a 24% quarter-on-quarter increase. The majority of revenues continue to be derived from the U.S., but we are seeing strong metrics in the launch countries in Europe. We are pleased with the emerging access footprint for OTEZLA globally. We have now achieved favorable reimbursement decisions in 14 countries in Europe and expect to conclude discussions in most of the remaining countries in Q3. This progress in Europe, together with an expected approval in Japan by the end of this year, should represent a significant source of revenue growth for OTEZLA in 2017 and beyond.","Now looking specifically at the U.S., physician campaigns and a refreshed consumer campaign are driving increases in brand awareness, patient requests, and trialings. Persistence on OTEZLA continues to lengthen as equivalent to biologic therapy at one year. OTEZLA also continues to lead all other branded therapies in new-to-brand share.","The PsA and psoriasis markets have grown significantly over the past few years, driven in part by new launches of products with novel, non-TNF MOAs. If we look specifically at these more recent launches, we can clearly see from the graph that OTEZLA has not only been a leader in growing the market but has also captured a strong and growing TRx leadership position.","We are aggressively advancing the ozanimod development program. As discussed previously, the MS pivotal trials are fully enrolled, and the ulcerative colitis pivotal Phase III trial, TRUE NORTH, is enrolling patients worldwide. During Q2, we saw significant data readouts for ozanimod, including presentation of the Phase II TOUCHSTONE histologic data at the DDW meeting in May, and, importantly, the publication of the full TOUCHSTONE Phase II data in the New England Journal of Medicine.","In Q2 we also completed enrollment of CD-001, the endoscopic trial for GED-0301. We expect to get initial top line data for the 12-week portion of this study in Q3. We intend to make these data available in the second half of 2016 at a major medical meeting. As a reminder, the objective of the 12-week portion of this study is to evaluate clinical response, clinical remission, and endoscopic improvements at an early time point. This trial targeted to enroll a patient population with advanced or serious disease confirmed by both CDAI and endoscopy at baseline. This is a multi-national site study with approximately 80% of patients in the world coming from North America.","The large Phase III pivotal trial CD-002 continues to enroll, and we have over 150 sites around the world now active. Additionally, the Phase II proof-of-concept trial of GED-0301 in UC is now fully enrolled.","Q2 was a quarter of tremendous progress for Celgene I&I. The execution of the OTEZLA launch has put it in a position to be a blockbuster contributor to the Celgene portfolio this year and beyond. We also moved all major development programs ahead through important milestones. These programs will be major contributors in driving strong growth through 2020 and beyond. We are very excited and optimistic about the future of OTEZLA and the rest of the I&I portfolio as we move into the second half of 2016.","Thank you very much for your attention, I'd now like to turn the call over to Jackie.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Scott. As you've heard, our teams around the world delivered excellent performance during \u2013 in the second quarter. We're well-positioned to finish the year strong and move into 2017 with great momentum. This is the case for our commercial, operational, and financial performance, as well as our clinical regulatory and research performance.","Looking at the 2016 milestones we laid out at the beginning of this year, we see that we are outperforming on our financial targets, as reflected in our updated guidance today. Our commercial and operational positions have never been better and set us up extremely well to deliver on our ambitious growth objectives from now to 2020.","Our franchise teams are driving strong positive commercial trends across our key products and major geographies, and our global operational teams are delivering exceptional performance and helping to drive our operating profit growth. REVLIMID, POMALYST\/IMNOVID, and ABRAXANE have already attained blockbuster drugs status, and OTEZLA is on its way to hitting the $1 billion annual revenue milestone this year, thus becoming the fourth blockbuster in our portfolio.","All four of these drugs have bright future growth prospects and unique profiles in their therapeutic areas. The growth potential across our existing product portfolio from ongoing geographic expansion remains ahead of us and is only one of the factors driving our growth as it contributes alongside enhanced value propositions and ongoing label expansions for our marketed products, as well as new product approvals to fuel our expected 18% revenue constant annual growth rate from 2016 to 2020.","Our regulatory teams are delivering on key submissions globally, and some new approvals have already been achieved. Our clinical teams are advancing our pipeline projects with milestones hit across a succession of trial initiations, enrollment achievements, and data readouts.","Our research and early development teams are producing new drug candidates for IND submissions and making progress on the early-stage trials that allow us to advance compounds into a later stage development. Building on the success achieved to date, we enter an exciting multi-year period when we will see numerous Phase III trial readouts.","By year-end, we expect new data and major medical meetings for some of our 2016 trial readouts. Looking ahead to 2017, we anticipate readouts for Hematology\/Oncology for REVLIMID in follicular lymphoma and for ABRAXANE and both non-small cell lung cancer and adjuvant pancreatic cancer, as Michael mentioned.","Turning to I&I, we expect to see Beh\u00e7et's data for OTEZLA and two trials for ozanimod in multiple sclerosis. And there's more in 2018, when for Hematology\/Oncology, we will have data for ABRAXANE in triple negative breast cancer and POMALYST in second-line multiple myeloma. For I&I 2018 will bring three trial readouts in the IBD space, two in Crohn's for GED-0301 and one for ozanimod in ulcerative colitis. These are all major trials and potential major catalysts. This portfolio of trials gives us several high-quality shots on goal for products and indications that can significantly contribute to future our revenue growth and diversification.","To conclude, I would also point out that in addition to what is shown on this slide, we have even more information flow during the remainder of this year. As Scott mentioned, we expect to share 12-week data from the GED-0301 endoscopy trial in the second half of the year. As we deliver on our milestones, we will see a number of Phase II trial readouts from now to the end of the year. We also look forward to important data presentations at medical meetings, including UEGW in October, ASH in December, and San Antonio Breast in December. And we will kick off a new R&D deep-dive series with an investor\/analyst event in September. Our first topic will be protein homeostasis and where we think the science can take our new product development programs in that area.","Our teams have put us in a fabulous place so far this year, and we have even more to come before year-end and great things ahead in 2017, 2018, and beyond. With that, I thank you for listening, and I now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question today comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. Thank you for taking the question. Congratulations on the progress. So I'm curious as to what kind of impact the Darzalex launch is having on your multiple myeloma franchise, especially pom. And, given the combination data that's being generated in the other studies that are ongoing, do you see the momentum building for that product as more of an opportunity or a threat for your IMiD franchise? Thanks.","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","Yeah, thanks, Cory. This is Michael. Thanks for the question. So, with what we've been showing you, I think it's very clear that we have a very good momentum for pomalidomide across the globe, and it's coming from a couple of factors, starting with the fact that there is a need for a product that is oral and effective and well-tolerated in the later-line patient population. That is the first point, which I think leads to some prescriber preference for using such an oral, very effective drug in that patient population as compared to an IV drug. But I think that's only part of the story. What we are seeing with pomalidomide is that it's moving up. It's moving up in third line, it's moving up even in second line, directly after REVLIMID, and we start to see a lot of combinatorial use, which has a very positive effect on the clinical benefit that we see on the outcomes of patients, but most importantly also on treatment duration.","So we actually don't see the situation that is building with CD38 and pomalidomide as competitive; we actually see it as complementary. The two drugs go extremely well together, and what we're seeing at this moment of time is a lot of combinatorial use.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the quarter. Wanted to ask you guys about the REV and other lymphoma indications, specifically how you guys think about cost-benefit for the REV-Rituxan combos. Since Rituxan's highly effective and reasonably priced, what does that do, if anything, to the hurdle you'll need to see for the REV combos going forward? Thanks.","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","So, yeah, thanks for the question. This is Michael. So I think you're referring to the combinatorial studies that we're doing in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma in combination with rituximab. The studies are actually set up in a way that they are with comparing with the current standard of care. So in case of induction of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, that's R-CHOP, which has been standard of care for induction for quite a while. And the study has been really set up in order to provide a huge improvement of outcome. What's also probably important to note that in this study in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma there's a limited treatment duration, so we are expecting a very marked outcomes improvement while at the same time there's a limited duration of treatment.","The situation in follicular lymphoma is building from the observation and the fact that the standard of care at this moment of time is mostly chemotherapy, with or without rituximab, or rituximab alone. We have an elderly, frail patient population in follicular lymphoma that is absolutely not tolerating chemotherapy well, whether it's (33:54) based or whether it's CHOP-based, or R-CHOP based. So there's a true need for improvement of treatment of this patient population. Again, we feel the studies, which are randomized studies, have been set up in a way that they're representing a true improvement of standard of care and the outcomes of these patients. That should translate in a very positive reimbursement situation for us.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got you. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, thanks for the question. Question for Mark or Scott on the GED-0301. You mentioned it a couple times as a key growth driver and as a catalyst. Just wanted to understand your current thinking on the endoscopy data, specifically how you think about the relationship versus CDAI, what specifically you're looking for in that study to increase or decrease our confidence on that program, and how confident are you on that data? Thanks so much.","Scott A. Smith - Celgene Corp.","Thank you for the question, Michael. So the study is ongoing. I do not \u2013 we haven't seen data. The 63 patients are not through the 12-week portion of the data. What we're querying and what we're looking at are three basic things there: clinical response, clinical remission, and then endoscopic improvements during that 12-week timeframe.","The study's also looking at a slightly different patient population than was looked at in the IGON-2 study. It is a relatively severe population, and there's confirmation of baseline of disease, both by CDAI and by endoscopy at baseline. So that's sort of a difference, or a hurdle, that other studies have not necessarily engaged in. But what it does is it ensures the disease state of the patient at the time of dosing; then we're looking at 12 weeks. So it's an exciting study for us. It's very data heavy. We should learn a lot about GED from that particular study. And we look forward to getting the results out in the second half of this year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks. Peter, could you just discuss what's going on with the share count? I know you raised the guidance for the share count last quarter; now you lowered it, and it looks like your guidance for the rest of the year assumes share count goes back up. So I was a little confused there. And then, Scott, just a quick one on atopic dermatitis, OTEZLA. It looked like the slides had a check next to that Phase II study? Does that mean the trial that you have in-house data on is actually positive? Thanks.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Hi, Eric. Good morning. So you're right, basically we did have a strong share repurchase effort in the first quarter, and then also we followed on a bit in the second quarter. And so our updated share count for this year really just reflects the full-year calculation of share count on that basis. So clearly the entire biopharma sector, particularly biotech, was down in the first quarter, which we all talked about at that time. And we saw our stock price down in the $90s, and so we took advantage of that and used our capacity to get some shares, and has, for the short term, reduced our share count.","When we go out to 2020, which is I think what you're referring to, we've also provided obviously a basis for that guidance that we gave, and that was a share count of 830 million. And basically what we were trying to do is kind of level-set for everybody, look, on this basis, this is what the P&L should look like on an earnings-per-share basis. So obviously it's a long time between now and 2020, so I think there's also things coming.","And the last thing is just in 2027, remember \u2013 in 2017, rather, there is some accounting changes which I could get into off-line, which do have some impact on share count. So all those factors come into play, but in general I think for 2016 we're just trying to help investors think about what they should see as we come in towards year-end on a share count basis.","Scott A. Smith - Celgene Corp.","Thanks for the question. Relative to atopic dermatitis, yes, we just got that data in. It's a relatively small proof-of-concept study \u2013 again, somewhat data-heavy, lots of different things that we're looking at in that study. The study did enroll a very significant cohort from Japan, where it is a very significant disease. And so we've got that data. We're working through it, and we're working on next steps. We're going to make the fullness of that data available to everybody, but right now our focus is understanding the data and working on our next steps.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks very much for taking my questions, and congratulations on the strong quarter. A question on REMARC. I realize you're still probably diving into all the details there, but I'm wondering if you had any initial take as to why you might've seen benefits on PFS without concurrent overall survival benefits. Was it just an issue of the magnitude of PFS not being clinically meaningful enough; are there other potential mechanistic explanations? And as you look at the data, how does it potentially increase or decrease your level of confidence in the other lymphoma studies, recognizing of course that they're testing slightly different indications? Thanks.","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","Yeah. Hi, Brian. This is Michael. Thanks for the question. So as you rightfully said, we are really in the midst, together with our partner LYSA, to analyze the data, and we're going to make sure that we're going to have to submit those data to major medical congress at the end of the year. So answering the question of the why is definitely following the analysis, and I hope we will provide a very robust update by the end of the year on those data.","The other part of your question was about the correlation of this data with the rest our lymphoma program. And I was trying to highlight in my transcript is the fact that there's very different patient segments and very different combinatorial strategies in our program. So the REMARC study was really done in an elderly first-time use, large B-cell, high-risk population after R-CHOP, and that was a maintenance therapy. That's very different from the rest of our program. You may recall that the ROBUST study is an induction study in an ABC subtype, and then we have two other important pivotal studies in follicular lymphoma \u2013 again, totally different biology and threat (40:33) combination, so I think it's definitely wrong to draw any conclusions from REMARC when we are looking at our other studies.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for taking the question. Scott, could I just ask you to help us a little bit on the primary endpoint for the GED study? I know it's sort of a composite that includes endoscopy (41:07) but also has some other components. Can you just walk us through how we should think about those components and how we should think about any of those scorings relative to what you might see in TNFs or other agents? Thanks.","Scott A. Smith - Celgene Corp.","Thanks for the question, Matthew. I assume you're talking about CD-001, the endoscopic study. The endpoint there would be change from baseline in endoscopic scope (41:31) score, which is the primary endpoint there. There are a number of exploratory endpoints that would come and that we would look at as well. There's been a lot of discussion in the environment over the last 24, 18 months relative to what should you expect in Crohn's disease relative to endoscopy.","And sort of the way that this has evolved is at the early time points, whether that's week 10, week 12, people are basically looking for a 25% change in baseline in your SES-CD scores. By the time you get out to week 24, people are looking at 50% improvements in the SES-CD scores. And then it's \u2013 when you get out to around a year, 52 weeks and beyond, the people will really look at what we call endoscopic remission or mucosal healing. That's when you expect to see that being significant.","So it's following sort of a time sequence. You expect to see, in an effective drug, strong signs of a response early on, and then you expect to see from an endoscopic perspective the mucosal of the GI tract getting better and better over time leading to different (42:43). But basically, 25%, 50%, and then mucosal at 52 [weeks] is the way that the environment is evolving right now.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Citi. Your line is open.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So this is a follow-up question on endoscopy for Scott. So is there any scenario where when you get this data set, that you would think stopping the Phase III trial, or amending the Phase III trial? And just to understand a little bit more about what you're saying about really seeing significant mucosal healing by 52 weeks, like, what have we seen with other drugs at 12 weeks on SES-CD? What kind of healing do we have by then? And how would you describe it? Is it a trend? Have you seen situations where there's none, but you get more at 52 weeks? Just trying to understand really how much \u2013 what information is there out there about the timelines for mucosal healing by 12 weeks versus the 52 you just mentioned? Thank you.","Scott A. Smith - Celgene Corp.","Thank you very much, Robyn. I can't thoughtfully respond to the first part of the question, because the study's not completed and I haven't seen the data. It is not unusual for large studies to have protocol amendments and some minor changes to statistical plans and things during the course of the execution of the study. I've never personally been involved in a study that had no amendments at all from start to finish. So some minor amendments can happen for a lot of different reasons. Specific to this case, I haven't seen \u2013 the study's not complete. I haven't seen the data. So I can't thoughtfully comment on whether there's anything there which would lead us to change. But at this point, we don't believe that there's anything that we see that would lead to major changes in the program.","Relative to what to expect, this is where it's a little bit different to take a look at comparables in the external world. Very few other companies use SES-CD as the main endpoint to look at endoscopic healing. There's been an evolution in time of what endpoint you should use. Some of the older studies had different endpoints.","And the other thing that I think is very, very important when you look at the data from GED or any new entity in Crohn's disease from this point forward, is we're starting to do baseline endoscopy so that we can confirm that there actually is mucosal involvement at baseline. The prior studies didn't do that, and some of the patients didn't have any lesions when they went into the study, maybe didn't have Crohn's disease. And that was one of the development challenges in Crohn's disease. The way to get around that is confirm active disease at baseline.","So this is a little bit different study. It's more rigorous from that perspective, making sure that there's a mucosal involvement and mucosal damage and then taking a look at, with the SES-CD, an endpoint which is different than endpoints that have been used in the past. So it's a pretty stringent study that's going to give us a really good idea of what's going on in terms of not only signs and symptoms in this population, but really importantly what's going on from an endoscopic perspective.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore Group LLC","You guys are never supposed to call on Robyn before me. She worked for me.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Hey, Mark, your line is open.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore Group LLC","Yes. No, I know. I was just kidding around. I'm sorry about that, guys. Can you hear me now?","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","We can hear you now.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Please never call on Robyn before me. It's just weird because she worked with me. And, by the way, I just want to say congrats to Scott on the success of OTEZLA. A lot of skeptics out there, including me. It's annualizing at $1 billion.","But I would like to go back to Robyn's point. I mean, when we get this data from the endoscopy trial, if we do work on this, will we be able to correlate the magnitude of mucosal healing with a clinical outcome? Is that even possible here? Because that's what people are going to try to do. They're going to look at it and say is the magnitude of mucosal healing great enough that we could reproduce the Phase II data that were so wonderful.","And then John (47:18) has a question, John Miller. John (47:19) you're on mute, too. We have a mute problem.","Scott A. Smith - Celgene Corp.","So can I answer the initial question? So you will see in CD-001 both a clinical response from a CDAI perspective and clinical remission, so you can compare that to what you saw on a slightly different patient population in the IGON-2 study. The relative correlation between what you see in the mucosal (47:49) signs and symptoms, and real healing has been an area of major debate, particularly in Crohn's disease. Much clearer in UC. In Crohn's disease, it's been an area of major debate. There was a couple of recent review articles looking at all the data that are out there and that sort of provide a good picture, but the only correlation that's sort of arisen, that I'm aware of that you can see is if you get control from a signs and symptoms perspective early and you start to see some improvements in the mucosa, it generally leads to a positive effect when you get out to week 52.","And so that's basically what we're looking for in new Crohn's treatment: signs and symptoms, significant remissions, and signs that it's actually starting to work at the early time points, You're seeing endoscopic response or endoscopic improvement, and those things together yield a high \u2013 or a probability of a patient being in long-term remission and getting true endoscopic healing at those longer time points.","Unknown Speaker","Great. Thanks, guys. This is John Miller (48:55). I got to ask about the new regulations and especially with regard to up-fronts and licensing payments and the way that you structure these deals. I understand you've said you don't expect much of a difference, but can you really continue to exclude those from your non-GAAP metrics under the new regulations?","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Yeah, hi, John. (49:17)","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore Group LLC","Jackie, you like how I make my associate ask that?","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","Yes.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Yeah. So thanks for the question; this is Peter. So I think we believe that our treatment of strategic collaboration transactions, where the portion of an upfront is related to the acquisition of rights, is excluded from non-GAAP, is appropriate. The acquisition of rights is unique to the formation of the collaboration; it's very strategic, and it's not part of our ongoing operations. Of course subsequently, after that collaboration is formed, all other ongoing operating costs of the collaboration, whether they be development costs, they be milestones, they be royalties, co-commercialization \u2013 all the ongoing operational activities that we do together with our collaborator are included in our non-GAAP presentation.","So I think that's way we've always thought about it. It's very hard to forecast strategic transactions. It's something where I don't think many companies talk about what M&A deals they're going to do next year or what collaboration activity they're going to do. And there are many, many reasons that we could talk about in terms of how to think about this and how it makes sense. But in the interest of time now, since we're almost on the hour, I won't drag you through all of that at this point.","But in the interest of time, our approach has been consistent for many years. It's not uncommon across the industry. Many companies have the same approach. And, importantly, we're fully transparent on all the factors we have in our GAAP-to-non-GAAP presentation, always have been. And so anybody who wants to particularly look at it slightly differently certainly is able to do that, and that's fine. So at this point really we feel we're right on track with where we've been. Now, I will mention...","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore Group LLC","Peter, have you talked to the SEC yet?","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","I'm sorry?","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore Group LLC","Have you had a conversation with the SEC?","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Well, obviously we're always talking to all the government agencies, the SEC and everybody else. So some of those ongoing dialogues occur over lots of different topics. Basically if something comes out of that that would be actionable, we'll communicate that, but at this point really there's not much to talk about.","Patrick E. Flanigan III - Celgene Corp.","Hey, Mark, we've got 12 other analysts who are trying to ask a question. So I'm going to ask that you go back into the queue.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore Group LLC","Yeah, I'm sorry about that.","Patrick E. Flanigan III - Celgene Corp.","And, Kat, I think we're ready for the next caller.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Katherine Breedis with Stifel.","Katherine Breedis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, thank you very much for taking the call. Hello?","Patrick E. Flanigan III - Celgene Corp.","You're live. Yep. Go ahead and ask your question, Katherine.","Katherine Breedis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great, thank you. Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question. As a follow up on the GED-0301 Phase II endoscopy study, are you planning to present other biomarker data of mucosal healing, such as fecal calprotectin and fecal lactoferrin? I think that'll help provide additional color on the benefit of the therapeutic form of mucosal healing.","Scott A. Smith - Celgene Corp.","Yes, we are collecting those biomarkers, and it should be part of either the oral presentation or a publication at some point in time. But we are collecting them.","Katherine Breedis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks for taking the question. With so many Phase III data readouts between now and 2018, maybe you can help characterize which ones you think are higher probability of success, which you think carry a high or higher risk, and where would you put 301 in that spectrum? Thanks.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","Josh, hi, it's Jackie. I'm going to jump in and speak on behalf of both franchises, but if the franchise heads want to come along after me that's great, too.","We're not going to sit here and outline successes or probabilities of success of these trials. I think the point is when you look at the portfolio of trials that we have for both franchises and combined, what you see are a significant number of Phase III trials and a significant number of Phase II trials coming along behind those, where you can find proof-of-concept data in a number of settings that support the therapies being studied. This is going to evolve over time, but we've got some programs that by the very nature of where they've moved to in Phase III over the course of time have become de-risked. And we're very excited about the totality of the portfolio, the indications being studied, the products that are in there, and the potential that they hold to come in and give us significant diversification and significant support to our revenue growth and upside potential over time.","So what's extremely exciting is you're going to have this endoscopy data relatively soon. And then there's, as we mentioned, a lot of information flow from now to the end of the year. And we will start in the second half of the year to see momentum going into 2017. And you're going to see these follicular trials read out beginning in the first half of 2017. And Michael did an extremely thorough job of outlining why we think that we will see success with those treatment regimens and what the differences are versus the REMARC trial. So we feel great about it and are looking forward to having some of these things start to read out.","Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Newman with Canaccord. Your line is open.","John Newman - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. I will not ask about 0301 since you've had a lot of those. My question is on ozanimod. In terms of the work you're doing in multiple sclerosis, when you brought in the asset, you did make some comments regarding commercialization. I'm just wondering if you are still considering the possibility of marketing that product on your own in MS or if it's more likely that you would consider a partnership. Thank you.","Scott A. Smith - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, John. Where we are right now, we would always \u2013 similar to what we did with OTEZLA, we would always take a look and have some discussions and see what's in the environment. There's been a lot of interest in ozanimod in MS, and a lot of companies and others have reached out to us. The way that I would look at this is that you would like to see the fullness of the program and the Phase III data before finalizing any decision on how you're going to commercialize and any of the commercial aspects, including pricing and partnering and our other things.","So we're going to get that data, and we should have a good view on that in first half of next year. But we feel confident if we make the decision to go ahead and go it alone, we feel very confident that we can do that very successfully. We're doing that right now currently with OTEZLA. It's a very \u2013 relatively tight specialty group of physicians. It fits what we do at Celgene. So if we looked at the data and made an organizational decision to move forward alone, we feel very confident that we would be able to do that. We would also look to talk to partners as well, if that made sense in terms of the overall value of the asset and the reach to patients worldwide.","Patrick E. Flanigan III - Celgene Corp.","Great. Thanks, Scott. So we're approaching the hour, and I know there are other calls this morning. So why don't we take one question and then we'll wrap up here. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question for today will come from the line of Chris Raymond from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Patrick E. Flanigan III - Celgene Corp.","Hey, Chris? Your line is open. All right, Kat. Why don't we go to the next caller?","Operator","All right. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Yatin Suneja with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Patrick E. Flanigan III - Celgene Corp.","All right, it seems like we may be having some technical difficulties on our end. Why don't we just go ahead and wrap it up?","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","So, yeah, thanks, everybody, for being on the call with us today. Just a couple of things before we close.","I think what you're seeing is simply outstanding execution across the franchises that is the culmination of a lot of years of strategic thinking behind everything that we're doing as well. So lots of exciting data to come for I&I. We've got multiple new products going to read out soon, multiple new indications.","For Hem\/Onc, just one thing that I wanted to close with, with respect to the myeloma franchise, is we're in quite a unique position both with respect to our existing assets, as well as those that are coming through the pipeline that you'll hear more about over the course of the remainder of the year as we have our deep dive event and some other things over time. But we're the only company with multiple products in multiple myeloma that are positioned very uniquely across the spectrum between relapsed, refractory, and newly diagnosed, with backbone therapies for REVLIMID and POMALYST\/IMNOVID that are combining with everything. And I think that's something to keep in mind. We see a lot of potential, very positive momentum, based on the data that we've seen so far, both in the relapsed\/refractory setting for combos, as well as the newly diagnosed setting for combos, irrespective of which novel agent is coming along.","So everything's looking great. Thank you very much. Thanks again to our teams for a great second quarter, and we will talk to you soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

I would like to remind you this call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Nina Goworek, Executive Director of Investor Relations at Celgene.","Nina Goworek - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Crystal. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. The press release reporting our financial results, in addition to the presentation for today's webcast can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the corporate website at celgene.com.","Joining me on today's call with prepared remarks are Mark Alles, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; David Elkins, our Chief Financial Officer; Terrie Curran, Global Head of our Inflammation and Immunology franchise; Nadim Ahmed, Global Head of our Hematology and Oncology franchise; and Dr. Jay Backstrom, our Chief Medical Officer. Also available for the Q&A portion of the are Dr. Rupert Vessey, Global Head of Research and Early Development Group; and Jonathan Biller, our General Counsel.","As a reminder, during today's call we will be making forward-looking statements regarding our financial outlook in addition to regulatory and product development plans. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those forecasted. A description of these results can be found in our most recent 10-Q on file with the SEC.","These statements speak only as of today's date and we undertake no duty to update or revise them. Reconciliation of the adjusted financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure are available as part of the earnings release.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mark.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Nina, and welcome to the Celgene Investor Relations team. It's great to have you.","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We appreciate the opportunity to review the outstanding results from our third quarter and the sustained progress achieved on critical corporate objectives. Across functions and geographies, Celgene teams produced excellent business momentum leading to strong financial performance. This includes volume driven growth across brands and rapid adoption in key markets around the world. David, Terrie and Nadim will describe our commercial performance in detail later during the call.","This momentum gives us increased confidence in our outlook for the full year which, again, supports raising our 2018 guidance. Total revenue is increased from $15 billion to $15.2 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share is raised from a range of $8.70 to $8.75, to a range of $8.75 to $8.80.","We have also generated a series of clinically meaningful data in new settings or combinations for existing products, such as the recently announced Phase III studies for OTEZLA and REVLIMID. And Phase III results published in the New England Journal of Medicine for ABRAXANE and REVLIMID. These data are expected to significantly add to the already well-established value propositions of our medicines globally.","Importantly, we are making meaningful progress advancing our late stage pipeline to high value inflection points over the next 12 to 18 months. Later in the call, Dr. Jay Backstrom will provide a regulatory update on these potential blockbusters, ozanimod, fedratinib, luspatercept, liso-cel and bb2121, all expected to launch by the end of 2020.","We are excited by the breadth and depth of data featuring our existing products and promising hematology pipeline expected at the American Society of Hematology meeting in early December. During his prepared remarks, Nadim will preview key abstracts we expect to be presented at one of the most diverse and forward-looking ASH meetings in Celgene's history.","Led by Dr. Rupert Vessey, our increasingly productive Research and Early Development team, along with our external collaborators are making significant headway. In September, members of our senior management team and I met with dozens of scientists working across our major research centers of excellence. They are inflammation, epigenetics, immune-oncology, protein homeostasis and neurosciences. Important and promising new programs are emerging from these research teams with encouraging signals of activity which will soon form the basis for our next generation mid-stage pipeline.","So far this year, we have filed five INDs for molecules with novel mechanisms of action. After multiple years of advancing an average of eight INDs per year, we have identified a group of highly promising agents with the potential for a first marketing approval as early as 2022.","Coupled with the continued growth of our in-line brands and anticipated launches for five key late-stage products, this next wave of innovative compounds gives us renewed confidence in our longer term outlook. We look forward to sharing more about our progress in early research and development during our investor event planned for ASH.","As our growing pipeline advances, exquisite clinical development becomes an even greater strategic imperative. To enhance and ensure success, we have created a dedicated mid- to late-stage clinical development function led by Dr. Alise Reicin. Alise joins us from EMD Serono, where she has outstanding experience in global drug development that spans important indications in cancer and immunology and inflammation.","The appointment of Dr. Reicin is part of a deliberate effort to strengthen the executive leadership team and to position Celgene for greater long-term success. Specifically, this structure more completely aligns with our strategy and mission to discover, develop and commercialize innovative therapies for patients with unmet medical needs. We are very excited to welcome Dr. Reicin to our team.","In 2018, industry leading operational performance has enabled us to continue acquiring high potential programs, advance our portfolio of promising late-stage assets and accelerate our internal discovery and early research pipeline. We are delivering now and investing in the pipeline and people for Celgene's future.","Thanks again for joining us today, and I'll now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, David Elkins.","David V. Elkins - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Moving to slide 7. In the third quarter, we saw continued momentum with top-line growth of 18% year-over-year. Importantly, 15 of the 18 percentage points of net sales growth came from volume. We continue to drive operating leverage with strong year-over-year adjusted EPS growth of 20% resulting in an EPS of $2.29.","Due to the strong growth and positive momentum of our underlying business, we are raising both our top line and bottom line full-year guidance. Of note is the strong performance of OTEZLA which leads us to raise the full year OTEZLA sales guidance from approximately $1.5 billion to approximately $1.6 billion.","We continue to advance a pipeline and prepare regulatory submissions for our next wave of product launches. In 2018, we expect to invest $3.6 billion in research and development to support the future growth of Celgene. As we think about capital allocation going forward, we are prioritizing investment in internal research while also looking for innovative best-in-class external products and therapies to add to our portfolio.","In summary, based on our solid performance in the business combined with investments in our pipeline, we are reaffirming our 2020 outlook of $19 billion to $20 billion in total revenues and more than $12.50 in adjusted EPS at constant currency.","Turning to our strong Q3 top-line performance on slide 8, total product net sales grew 18% year-over-year to $3.9 billion. The growth was primarily driven by a volume increase of 14.7% and price contributing 4.3%, slightly offset by 0.5% negative impact of currency headwinds. As Nadim will share with you later, growth in our Hematology and Oncology franchise came primarily from volume gains across multiple brands and geographies, while Terrie will share that OTEZLA growth was driven by volume increases across multiple geographies as we continue to expand access and utilization.","Moving on to adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter on slide 9, EPS increased 20% year-over-year to $2.29. This was driven by the strong top line growth with sales volume contributing $0.48 of the operating income increase, partially offset by increased expenses related to the acquisitions of Juno and Impact, as well as investments in our pipeline in collaborations. These net to the $0.20 operating improvement seen on the slide.","Other income and expenses was negatively impacted by increased interest expense due to the higher level of debt primarily related to the Juno acquisition. Lower share count contributed $0.27 to adjusted EPS growth for the quarter bringing adjusted EPS for the quarter to $2.29.","We now turn to our key adjusted P&L line items on slide 10. Product gross margin was in line with our expectations at 96.2%, down 40 basis points year-over-year primarily due to raw material charges incurred in the quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenue increased 320 basis points year-over-year to 24.4%, a $948 million increase. Again, the increase in R&D is primarily due to the acquisitions of Juno and Impact, plus the investments in our projects with our partners, Beijing and bluebird bio, as those projects progress, and the acceleration of our investments to prepare fedratinib for regulatory submission.","Note that in Q2, we shared that we expected $90 million in potential milestones in Q3. However, $30 million in milestone payments are now expected to be incurred in Q4 and this has been contemplated in our full-year guidance.","Now turning to SG&A, there's an increase of 60 basis points year-over-year as a percentage of revenue, mainly driven by the addition of Juno and the associated integration costs.","The net result is 420 basis point year-over-year reduction in the operating margin to 55.3% which is contemplated in our updated 2018 financial guidance. And as you will see, the tax rate is broadly in line with our expectations at 16.7%.","Now on to Q3 cash flow on slide 11, we continued to generate significant free cash flow with $1.9 billion in quarter three. We ended the quarter with $4.4 billion in cash and marketable securities.","With respect to our share repurchases, we settled the ASR that commenced in the second quarter. The total share repurchases for the ASR was 24 million shares. For quarter three, our average diluted share count was 720 million shares. For the full year, we continue to expect an average diluted share count of about 735 million, as communicated in our previous guidance.","Lastly, on slide 12, to summarize, we're updating guidance to reflect the strong performance that Terrie and Nadim will describe in more detail. Total revenue is being raised by approximately $200 million, from $15 billion to approximately $15.2 billion. Based on the strong Q3 results, we are also increasing full-year guidance on OTEZLA sales from approximately $1.5 billion to approximately $1.6 billion.","As we continue investment in the progression of the pipeline and fund milestone success payments, our expected operating margin will decrease 50 basis points to 55.5%. Overall, we are confident in the business outlook and are raising adjusted EPS guidance to $8.75 to $8.80. All other guidance remains unchanged.","As we head towards year end, we wanted to update you on changes we plan to implement related to preannouncing earnings at JPMorgan conference. As in the past, we'll be sharing 2019 guidance at the JPMorgan conference. However, due to tight timelines between year end and the conference, we will not preannounce 2018 earnings at the conference.","Thank you, and I'd now like to turn the call over to Terrie.","Terrie Curran - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, David, and good morning.","The Inflammation and Immunology franchise had an excellent third quarter with 40% year-over-year OTEZLA sales growth. We're seeing strong momentum driven by worldwide volume increases, as we continue to expand access and pre-biologic utilization.","We're committed to investing in future growth drivers for OTEZLA and have advanced multiple lifecycle development opportunities leading to two recent milestones, the positive data readout of our Phase III STYLE study in scalp psoriasis and the sNDA submission of OTEZLA in Beh\u00e7et's disease, which I will cover in more detail later in the call.","We're actively advancing key launch readiness preparations for ozanimod as we build out a world-class team with deep multiple sclerosis experience. We've made significant progress in the regulatory filings for ozanimod in the U.S. and Europe and are on track to submit both applications in Q1 of 2019. More information on the regulatory submissions will be provided by my colleague, Dr. Jay Backstrom.","We also announced positive 52-week results for the open-label extension of the Phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled HEROES trial evaluating RPC4046 in eosinophilic esophagitis, a disease for which there are currently no approved treatments.","Now dialing deeper into Q3 results, global net sales for OTEZLA were $432 million, representing 40% growth over the same period in 2017 and 15% growth over the previous quarter. In the U.S., sales also grew by 15% over Q2, driven by volume. While quarterly script growth reflected typical seasonality over the summer months, we also saw channel inventory build of approximately 30 million to 35 million during the quarter, which contributed to our strong revenue.","We have developed a solid position for OTEZLA in the U.S. pre-biologic patient population. Despite new competitive entrants, OTEZLA continues to lead share of new-to-brand treatment-na\u00efve patients, and over 85% of our moderate to severe plaque psoriasis business comes from the pre-biologic market.","While growth in international markets was flat compared to previous quarter due to expected seasonality, we continue to see strong performance in key international markets such as Japan and France. We are very pleased with the positive sales momentum and continue uptake of OTEZLA globally. As such, we're increasing our guidance for 2018 to $1.6 billion.","With respect to lifecycle management activities, as I mentioned earlier, we were pleased to announce this month the positive results from the Phase III STYLE study in scalp psoriasis. OTEZLA achieved highly statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of the Scalp Physician's Global Assessment response, and in the secondary endpoint, a reduction in the whole body itch numeric rating. Scalp psoriasis affects up to 80% of plaque psoriasis patients and is considered to be a difficult-to-treat area, often managed with topical treatments that can be quite burdensome for the patient. The results of the STYLE study have the potential to further solidify our positioning in the post-topical pre-biologic segment.","Additionally, consistent with our commitment to provide treatment options for patients in areas of high unmet medical need, we recently submitted the sNDA for ulcers in Beh\u04abet's disease in the U.S. and we plan to submit the Japan filing in Q4 of this year.","Key to our growth strategy is positioning OTEZLA earlier in the treatment paradigm for psoriasis patients. To that end, we're initiating several studies, including the Phase III ADVANCE study in mild to moderate plaque psoriasis as well as two studies in moderate psoriasis in Europe and Japan. We're very optimistic that OTEZLA will be able to produce meaningful results in expanded patient populations. The combined development activities for OTEZLA are associated with approximately $500 million in revenue at peak.","Now turning to ozanimod, we remain committed to maximizing the compound's potential within the context of our overall portfolio. Based upon encouraging results we saw in our Phase II study of ozanimod in Crohn's disease, we've initiated a Phase III trial for this indication. We also continue to enroll patients in our Phase III ulcerative colitis study, which is on track to complete enrollment in mid-2019. We're enthusiastic about ozanimod's potential and continue to assess further lifecycle development opportunities.","We believe that our commercial performance combined with our clinical development program has created a solid foundation for continued growth. The future of the Inflammation and Immunology franchise is bright, and we're excited by the outlook for years ahead.","I'd now like to introduce my colleague, Nadim Ahmed.","Nadim Ahmed - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Terrie, and good morning, everyone.","The Hematology and Oncology franchise had a robust third quarter with revenue of $3.5 billion at 16% year-over-year growth. REVLIMID and POMALYST\/IMNOVID continue to drive our overall growth with volume gains across brand and geographies. Our in-line brands continue to deliver strong growth and we see many near-term growth drivers. We are on track to make global regulatory submissions in the first quarter of 2019 for the Phase III AUGMENT study with the R2 regimen in patients with relapsed refractory indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.","We are encouraged by the recent multiple positive Phase III studies of ABRAXANE-based immunotherapy combination regimens, including data presented at ESMO last week. This year's ASH will highlight the significant advancement of our pipeline which I will cover later in the presentation. Our development plans for bb2121 continue to progress in earlier lines of treatment.","Finally, we are advantaging our plans for fedratinib as a potentially important therapy addressing a significant unmet need in patients with myelofibrosis, a disease for which there is currently only one approved therapy.","REVLIMID had a very strong third quarter, with global sales growth of 18% year-over-year. In the U.S., the brand grew 22% year-over-year, as treatment duration continues to increase. We saw robust growth driven by continued uptake in the front-line non-stem cell-eligible and post-stem cell transplant maintenance segments, as well as the continued increases in duration from the use of REVLIMID-based triplet regimens.","Outside of the U.S., REVLIMID net sales grew 9% year-over-year with 18% volume growth. Year-over-year growth was impacted by the Russian tender, which occurred in Q3 2017 and did not occur in Q3 of this year. In addition, the combination of the Russian tender and clinical trial revenue which occurred in Q2 of this year resulted in a net gain of approximately $100 million in Q2 over Q3. Underlying demand continues to grow outside the U.S., with growth in REVLIMID share in both front-line non-stem cell transplant and post-stem cell transplant maintenance patients.","Duration also continues to increase with the impact of REVLIMID-based triplets. POMALYST\/IMNOVID net sales increased by 23% year-over-year. In the U.S., POMALYST net sales grew 34% year-over-year, driven by the continued adoption of the triplet regimen of POMALYST, daratumumab and dexamethasone for relapse refractory myeloma. Outside of the U.S., POMALYST\/IMNOVID revenue grew 5% year-over-year with volume increasing by 13%, in spite of competition from new entrants including REVLIMID-based triplet regimens. Similar to REVLIMID, we expect to see additional POMALYST share and duration gains through the use of newer POMALYST-based triplet regimens.","This week we also announced positive results from the Phase III ECOG E3A06 study in smoldering myeloma where REVLIMID met the primary endpoint of a significant improvement in progression-free survival. We look forward to seeing the results at an upcoming medical meeting.","In terms of key growth drivers, we expect data readouts of REVLIMID-based triplet regimen in the front-line setting of multiple myeloma through 2018 and 2019, reinforcing the importance of REVLIMID as a standard of care in the front-line setting.","In addition to the approval of REVLIMID in follicular lymphoma, we await the results of the REVLIMID ROBUST trial in first-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. ABRAXANE net sales increased by 15% year-over-year. In the U.S., we saw a 17% increase year-over-year in third quarter revenue. Outside of the U.S., ABRAXANE also had strong year-over-year growth of 12%. Much of the global year-over-year growth for ABRAXANE was driven by customer buying patterns. Excluding buying patterns, underlying growth was approximately 5%. We look forward to the ABRAXANE data readout for the Phase III apact adjuvant pancreatic cancer trial. This is an event-driven trial and we continue to monitor the status of patients.","This year we have seen multiple positive Phase III studies of ABRAXANE in combination with checkpoint inhibitors, including last week at ESMO as well as recent publications in the New England Journal of Medicine.","The IMpassion130 study is the first Phase III study to demonstrate a significant progression-free survival advantage in the 15% of breast cancer patients with triple negative disease. The combination of ABRAXANE and immunotherapy has also shown positive results in multiple Phase III studies for the first-line treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer, especially in squamous cell disease.","ASH this year will highlight the progression of our pipeline across a wide range of hematologic diseases with the first data readouts for many of our assets. With our partner, Acceleron, luspatercept will take center stage, as we expect to see the results of two highly positive Phase III studies across two distinct diseases, MDS and beta-thalassemia. We continue to advance our position in cellular therapy with multiple first-time data readouts anticipated from our CAR T pipeline.","Along with our partner bluebird bio, we expect to see the first results of the Phase I bb21217 trial in heavily pretreated patients with relapsed refractory myeloma. With JCARH125, we anticipate the first results of the Phase I, II, EVOLVE trial in heavily-pretreated patients with relapsed refractory myeloma. We expect to see the first liso-cel data in CLL patients with heavily-pretreated relapsed refractory disease.","Finally, we expect to see the first-time presentation of the AUGMENT Phase III study results of the R2 regimen in relapsed refractory indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and we look forward to sharing more of these exciting data with you at the ASH Congress.","In summary, the Hematology Oncology franchise had a strong third quarter in 2018. We are very pleased with our sales performance with strong volume growth across brands and regions. At ASH this year, we have the opportunity to present multiple first-time data readouts from our pipeline across a wide range of diseases, including several positive Phase III studies, as well as the advancement of our CAR T portfolio.","Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Jay.","Jay T. Backstrom - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Nadim, and good morning.","We continue to make excellent progress toward advancing our five near-term programs. Ozanimod, fedratinib and luspatercept remain on target for regulatory submissions starting from the end of this year through the first half of 2019, and we continue to advance the preparation of the BLAs for our two CAR T programs, bb2121 and liso-cel, while also moving forward with our broader development programs.","I would like to provide an update on our regulatory submission activity starting with ozanimod. Over the past six months, we have systematically advanced the nonclinical and clinical pharmacology plans that we discuss with health authorities designed to fully characterize the major active metabolite of ozanimod, CC-112273. Included in the clinical pharmacology plan, our drug-drug interaction studies to assess if the metabolism of ozanimod is affected by inhibition or induction of cytochromes 2C8 and 3A, and if there are potential interactions with tyramine and pseudoephedrine. None of these drug-drug interaction studies are required at the time of submission, but they will help inform product labeling and enhance the opportunity to include the broadest possible patient populations.","We continue to engage with health authorities for ozanimod and look forward to our upcoming health authority interactions in November as we progress submission activities. Overall, the NDA and MAA for the relapsing multiple sclerosis indication are on track for a Q1 2019 submission. And as Terrie highlighted, the TRUE NORTH ulcerative colitis trial is on target for completion of enrollment by mid-2019 and the Crohn's program is underway.","Turning to fedratinib, we are pleased with the progress that has been made with the fedratinib NDA and remain on track for completing this work by year-end. In addition, we have upcoming European Health Authority meetings that are an important part of our activities leading toward the submission of the MAA planned for next year.","As we previously announced, the enrollment for TRANSCEND, the pivotal study for liso-cel in relapsed refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, completed earlier this summer and we continue to collect follow-up information for this registration study. Duration of response is important information for physicians, patients and health authorities and will form an essential part of the submission package. We plan to have follow-up information of at least nine months on all patients treated in this study with the intent to characterize duration of response and reflect this information in labeling. Given the time needed for this data to mature, we are adjusting the timeline for the expected approval from end of year 2019 to mid-2020.","In addition to the longer follow-up for duration of response, the submission package will include efficacy and safety data for relapsed refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, as well as other subtypes, including primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma providing the opportunity for a further differentiated label. As a reflection of the potential of liso-cel in relapsed refractory and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, we look forward to sharing data from the ongoing Phase I, II trial at ASH.","The luspatercept program continues to move forward nicely. Our regulatory and clinical teams are well underway with the preparation of the regulatory submission for the MDS in beta-thalassemia indications and we remain on track for a submission in the first half of 2019.","The front-line COMMANDS study evaluating luspatercept in ESA na\u00efve, very low, low and intermediate risk MDS is open for enrollment and we look forward to sharing the results of the two pivotal Phase III studies, MEDALIST and BELIEVE at ASH.","Finally, with respect to bb2121, the program remains on track for a potential 2020 approval with the KarMMa study expected to complete enrollment later this year. In addition, the bb2121 team continues to advance the broader myeloma program to earlier lines of treatment, including KarMMa-3, a randomized Phase III study in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma in patients who have received at least two prior lines of therapy, and the MM-002 Phase II study which includes a high-risk cohort who have failed one prior line of treatment.","In closing, our teams have excellent momentum and remain dedicated and focused on advancing the next wave of innovation, starting with these five near-term programs.","I now will turn the call back over to Mark.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, David. Thanks, Terrie, Nadim, and thank you very much, Jay.","As my colleagues have shared, Celgene's fundamentals are strong, including robust commercial performance, a broad transformative pipeline, and a strengthened management team. We look forward to reporting on and realizing the benefits of several near-term catalysts, starting with an extremely promising ASH meeting in just a few short weeks.","Thanks again for joining us today and, operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Your line is open.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question and congrats on the quarter. Jay, on the JCAR017 filing, I was waiting for duration response data based on regulatory feedback, or was it a strategy just to have more differentiation at launch? And could you add less mature data in earlier lines of DLBCL in the filing?","And then a bigger picture question for Mark; when you think about diversifying REVLIMID concentration risk, that's obviously one of the most important questions with investors. On slide 24, you have five new products expected to launch. The question is, how many additional new assets do you feel like you need to help diversify REVLIMID? I guess more of a question of pace of BD versus expanding the indication base of what you have today. Thank you.","Jay T. Backstrom - Celgene Corp.","Hi. This is Jay. I'll start. I think from FDA feedback and other health authority feedback, there is a minimum expectation for duration. Often, that's six months or greater. As we looked at our program, the nine-month duration obviously facilitates FDA review, but also I think does provide some competitive advantage to that information. And as we gather data, we will continue to have, frankly, quite a strong safety database which will go into the submission as well.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Thanks, Jay. So, Geoff, it's Mark. Thank you for the question on the bigger picture. I'm glad you picked up on the big five that we're talking about because the combined peak revenues of those five, as we look at them, largely offset what would be the complete loss of REVLIMID's revenue. So not just a peak in a given year, but over time it would replace most of what REVLIMID contributes in a year.","Remember how the settlement that exists for REVLIMID works. It erodes from early 2022 through then full generic in 2026. So this overlap of these five assets, the slow erosion of what would be REVLIMID's current profile in the settlement with Allergan\/Teva; of course it's Teva now. We see a nice replacement of those revenues from the big five. And that's why the end of 2020 is such an important window for these five assets to be approved for their first indications.","In addition, you heard us refer today to a wave of innovative products coming out of Rupert's shop in early research and development. We're getting very excited about a small group of those assets where we think we have a first approval opportunity by the year 2022. If we're really careful and specific, one or more of those might be able to come out even before then, but we'll wait and inform you about that later.","On the BD front, we'll continue to look for opportunity. At the start of the year, as you well know, we did two transactions to bring in fedratinib and of course Juno, as we talked about today. Not only do we have JCAR017 for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and other subsets of lymphoma, but here it is coming forward in CLL. So we think that the Juno transaction is more about a portfolio approach as opposed to just a drug, a pipeline approach.","So we will continue to be opportunistic on the BD front. I think the combination of our existing products, not just REVLIMID, the next five, the next wave of organic R&D, and then ongoing BD should put us in a very, very good position to manage what is the REVLIMID concentration risk. Thanks, Geoff.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering if you could comment on thoughts on longer-term margins here. Obviously, you've highlighted a lot of the newer products coming on board over the next several years. Some of these are partnered, some of these are cell therapy drugs. And so just wondering as you think about the mix shift on your margins, can you maybe just give us your high level thoughts on that? Thank you.","David V. Elkins - Celgene Corp.","Overall, we don't guide margins longer term. As you can see though with the pipeline that we have, both mid-stage and late-stage, we continue to invest from a research and development perspective, and you saw those increases come through and in the nearer term, as you saw with our cost of goods sold pretty much staying in line with our expectations. But generally speaking, we don't guide our margins over the longer term.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","I just would add that of course we reaffirmed 2020 on the basis of top line and EPS again today. So at least through the window that we have spoken about, margins remain very good.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alethia Young from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Alethia Young - Cantor Fitzgerald","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the quarter. I had a question on fedratinib. Basically, if you can, just walk through for us what's left with the things that you have to do until the filing, and then maybe discuss how you think about a regulatory package in Europe versus the United States. Thanks.","Jay T. Backstrom - Celgene Corp.","Hi, this is Jay. So your typical preparation of the NDA is putting all the summary documents together, so we're working to complete that work. The data will be based on both JAKARTA-1 and JAKARTA-2. We plan to include that in the submission, and we look forward to health authority interactions which ultimately will determine what the final labeling will look like.","Alethia Young - Cantor Fitzgerald","Do you have any theory on maybe how the conversations with the U.S. versus Europe will go? Are there certain things that we should think differently about with those two regions?","Jay T. Backstrom - Celgene Corp.","No, in the regions, there are a lot of similarities and some differences. We've obviously already engaged in FDA. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're looking forward to our upcoming interactions with the European health authorities.","Alethia Young - Cantor Fitzgerald","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Your line is open.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. First, you reaffirmed 2020 guidance, and my question is, is it fair to assume that you're reaffirming the top line guidance as well? And I don't know if you're getting even more granular by the line item in top line, so just wanted to ask that first.","Second, ozanimod DDI trials, I'm just trying to understand why are they not relevant for an upcoming resubmission? And then finally, am I correct in hearing that the tone is a bit guarded on fedratinib on this call?","David V. Elkins - Celgene Corp.","So I'll take the first question regarding the longer-term guidance. All we're doing is reaffirming the guidance that was already out there. Top line, $19 billion to $20 billion, as I said earlier, and then on EPS, greater than $12.50 at constant currency. So we don't guide individual line items. We're just reaffirming the guidance that was out there.","Jay T. Backstrom - Celgene Corp.","This is Jay. So I'll just start with fedratinib. There's no lack of confidence for that. The confidence is high. We have a positive Phase III study; JAKARTA-2 data is exceedingly interesting. So we're moving forward as quickly as we can to get the NDA in as I mentioned.","And then with respect to the DDI, what we're just trying to clarify is that all information is relevant, right? So these drug interaction studies are important to inform labeling. They often can guide toward whether dose adjustments are needed. But they're not necessarily required for the submission to accept for filing for FDA to begin their review.","And so our plan through our engagement with the agencies would be to provide as much as we can up front and have the opportunity during the review to contribute to the labeling discussions with those additional data. So that's part of the strategy which we're working tirelessly to implement.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Citi. Your line is open.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess questions \u2013 I have two questions on CAR T related. So just first, we're hearing still there's some pushback in the Medicare space, even with the NTAP on reimbursement and some doctors preferring \u2013 saying that you really need to lower the price and have a lower price and have more uptake there.","And that's my first question, is do you think that's going to happen or that could happen realistically, that you can get lower price and can penetrate that Medicare population?","And then the other part of the CAR T question is there's a lot of other BCMA CAR Ts being developed that could have longer durability, could have a different safety profile and they're happening fast. And just how do you stay ahead of that, the competitive landscape, with your programs? How do you think about that? Thanks.","Nadim Ahmed - Celgene Corp.","Robyn, thanks for your question. This is Nadim. So let me start with the second question first. So in terms of the BCMA approach, I would remind, again, that we \u2013 in terms of BCMA, we have both a CAR T approach as well an antibody approach. So I think we feel good that we have a multi-modality play here in a target that now has become very well validated.","In terms of bb2121, we're ahead, first in class, and the plan is to be best-in-class. So as you heard from Jay earlier, we're rapidly expanding into earlier lines of development. At the same time, 269, our T-cell engager, is in the clinic. So we feel, across our multi-modality play, we're in a very strong position as it pertains to CAR T.","Now, your question around CMS, of course there's a macro level of making sure we respond to an environment where we continue to provide the value of our medicines and the challenges that are out there on cost and pricing, but I think CMS has been very actively engaged in the CAR T space and they've looked at creative ways to whether you use NTAP or other mechanisms.","And so I feel very good about moving forward, how CMS is actually contemplating reimbursing in the CAR T space, as well as the commercial payers. So we're feeling very good about this space in the future.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Robyn, it's Mark. If I could just add one comment to what Nadim very, very nicely laid out in terms of our multi-modality approach. The other reality is that we think with bluebird bio, bb2121 is markedly ahead in its development in relapsed myeloma and collectively, we are working with them to aggressively move to earlier lines of therapy.","So I think data will always dictate what happens in the clinical trial landscape and then ultimately what shapes markets, as you well know. So we continue to feel great about what's happening with bb2121 and we're doing what we can, along with our partner, to move it to earlier segments of myeloma, which, once the data would be established, once labeling would occur, if one assumes success, it becomes very difficult for follow-on approaches in the absence of head-to-head trials. It is a strategy to be first with what we think is currently best-in-class.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges from Leerink. Your line is open.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you very much for the question. Maybe David, since you've sort of been in the position now for a few months, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about your views on capital allocation. Looks like there's been over $20 billion in share buybacks over the last five years and much of that price is significantly above the current stock price.","So first, could you give us your views on how you assess the value of that share buyback and then how you think about that going forward, particularly in the context of a dividend? And then perhaps you could also give us a sense of how you're viewing the $4 billion in R&D spend that you're effectively tracking towards now. How do you assess the value of that and decide on whether that should continue to grow at the pace that it's been growing? Thanks.","David V. Elkins - Celgene Corp.","Well, thank you for the very comprehensive question, but let me try and take those in order. The first one, capital allocation, how we approach that, first and foremost, as I know Peter previously had said and Mark has said, is our number one priority is investing in the business, both our internal research and development programs as well as looking for the best science externally and funding our collaborations as well, which has been extremely successful for us if you look at the next five products that we talked about on the call today, but most of those are coming from our external collaborations. So, it's a very important part because we're agnostic on where the science comes from. We're just looking for the best science.","At the same time, however, we're not looking to build up excess cash reserves. And if opportunities aren't present, then we'd look to return that cash to our shareholders through the form of share repurchases.","Today, we still believe that it's the most efficient way for us to return cash to shareholders. And currently, we have no intention of beginning a dividend. So, hopefully I answered those couple of questions.","As far as research and development is concerned, we go through a very rigorous process both on early stage, but as well as on late stage evaluating our projects, looking at the probability of success, as well as the return on invested capital that we get for those. And that's a continuous process. We engage in that process through our annual strategic planning process as well and share that with our board, and we constantly look back on our successes and whether or not they're delivering to our expectations. So, very robust process from that perspective and I think you've seen the successes in the pipeline, particularly the next stage of products.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Yee from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC","Hi, there. I have two quick ones. One was expanding on BCMA not just CAR T but perhaps comment on your perspective of comparing CAR T to other modalities such as bispecifics, which has obviously made a bit of a splash recently and just perhaps give us your perspective about how you're thinking where each of that fits in or particularly, when will you have some of your bispecific data to compare?","And then, my second question was more financial. Now that we have a new CFO in place, perhaps has there been any thought about the 2020 guidance? And I think everyone feels quite comfortable with that, but at what point does the company think about longer-term guidance? Or what are the steps or what are the things that have to happen to think about when that's even a scenario? Thanks so much.","Nadim Ahmed - Celgene Corp.","Michael, thanks for your question. Nadim here. I think an important point to point out, which is why we've taken the multi-modality approach to BCMA, I think we feel very strongly that both modalities can co-exist together. So, there'll be patients for whom a CAR T approach will be first and foremost. But remember, there'll also be patients that continue to relapse. So, I think when you think about relapsed patients, when you think about more frail patients, then an antibody approach may be ideal for those patients. So we feel that both approaches can tackle a broad range of patient segments. So, we feel very good about that. And in terms of your question around our bispecific, it's currently in Phase I. And then once we reach a dose and we feel comfortable with the data, of course, we'll present the data as the opportunity presents itself.","David V. Elkins - Celgene Corp.","Thank you. Yes. And thank you for the question on long-term guidance. Look, long-term guidance and the way we look at that is it's the exception and normally you would not provide that because there's too many external factors, whether they be political, economic, currency, that create problems for everybody, make it very difficult seeing beyond one year. There are exceptions where that is made. And once that guidance is out there from my perspective, you deliver against that guidance. But as you look going forward, I would not expect us to do long-term guidance, because there's not a need right now. We have the 2020 guidance out there that we reaffirmed today that we feel confident in being able to deliver. But going forward, we would just do normal annual guidance.","Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC","I agree with you, and I think a lot of us should agree with you. Appreciate that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I also have a two-part question following up on BCMA. So given that you're expecting to provide a first look at JCARH125 at ASH this year, curious about your latest thoughts regarding the path forward for having three CAR T BCMA programs, this and the two with bluebird. Do you see space for two or more in your portfolio? And then, the follow-up is along these lines of your updated plans for JCAR017 or liso-cel, how much do you plan to wait on duration for the pivotal bb2121 KarMMa study, given the obvious different competitive dynamics here where you're clearly well in the lead on the BCMA front? Thanks.","Nadim Ahmed - Celgene Corp.","Okay. Thanks, Cory, for your questions. So, I think, again, reiterating in the space of BCMA CAR Ts, bb2121 is the furthest ahead in terms of our program, and so we're going to make sure we continue to accelerate the development, move it into earlier lines, as we discussed before. We have both JCARH125 and bb21217 at ASH. Of course, we're excited that those data will be at ASH, but the data are very early. Both of those assets are in Phase I. So our efforts at the moment are really focused on developing and accelerating bb2121. Once we have a further idea of how the profile for JCARH125 and bb21217 emerges, I think we can talk about positioning at that point in time. But right now, our efforts are focused on bb2121.","Jay T. Backstrom - Celgene Corp.","This is Jay. With respect to the regulatory submission and duration of response and follow-up, we're going to follow a similar path with that. I think the longer duration is important. If you think if we complete our enrollment this year and we're targeting 2020 approval, that would give us the opportunity to have at least nine months or more for those patients as well. And again, that's really meaningful. Durable CR is really important for these submissions.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Brian Abrahams - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi there, thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter as well. A question on smoldering myeloma. Should we expect any meaningful impact of that data on REVLIMID uptake? And could we foresee that becoming standard of care in a certain subset of individuals? What would be the timeline for inclusion in NCCN guidelines and the reimbursement dynamics there?","And then on OTEZLA lifecycle plans, it looks like maybe there was a setback with the once-a-day formulation. Can you speak to that a little bit? And then how important are other combinations with other targeted meds or other initiatives for extending exclusivity of the OTEZLA franchise longer term? Thanks.","Nadim Ahmed - Celgene Corp.","Thanks for your question, Brian. So, I'll take the one for REVLIMID in smoldering myeloma. So, a couple of things to point out. So of course, we had the Spanish PETHEMA study that was published a couple of years ago in the New England Journal of Medicine. So this high-risk group of smoldering myeloma, a lot of physicians now are tending to treat these as active myeloma patients. So some of these patients already clinically are falling into the active disease space and are being treated as such.","The other important aspect of this specific study was these patients were treated without dexamethasone, which is meaningful from a quality-of-life perspective in this group of patients. So overall, smoldering myeloma represents a relatively small opportunity compared to overall all of myeloma, but these data are clinically meaningful for these patients.","Terrie Curran - Celgene Corp.","Thanks for the question regarding once-a-day or QD. Yes, you're correct. We have withdrawn the QD formulation submission, and this decision was taken by Celgene to allow additional time for us to really evaluate our manufacturing strategy and really reassess the plan for the formulation. I think importantly, it's really critical to note that in the time that we've been working on the QD formulation, we've initiated another \u2013 really a lot of additional lifecycle studies that I outlined in my spoken comments, scalp, pediatric, mild to moderate PSO that we really believe have a much greater upside to deliver revenue beyond 2020.","In terms of the combination, we're looking at earlier combinations with ozanimod for multiple indications.","Brian Abrahams - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, thanks for taking my questions. I have one question for Nadim on the MDS data at ASH. What is considered clinical meaningful response difference between luspatercept and the control in your mind? And then secondly,","I want to ask a question about the donut hole rule change in 2019, because as a company you have to pay for 70% while the patient is in the donut hole for Medicare Part D. Can you help us quantify the financial impact to REVLIMID in 2019? Thank you.","Nadim Ahmed - Celgene Corp.","Thanks, Ying. So with the MDS data, obviously I'm not going to disclose the data, because the abstracts will be released next week. But I do think we have publicly stated what the hypothesis for the Phase III study was and that was looking at a difference of 10% versus 30%.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Hi. It's Mark. David may want to comment as well on the second part of your question. You're right that the current conditions call for the donut hole liability for manufacturers to go from what historically was 50% to 70%. I think that that's still under consideration by many of our legislators, as that change was really a consequence of a scoring difference that happened in other spending legislation.","So I think there's still a window here where that could be reviewed and in other must-pass legislation before the end of the year. There may be a consideration for that to be changed. That said, we've modeled very carefully what a change like that would look like because it is current law. And that has been built into our outlook, as David described earlier today. Thank you.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Carter Gould from UBS. Your line is open.","Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I had a couple quick ones on luspatercept and liso-cel that you featured more prominently in your comments. So I guess first on COMMANDS, I know the study has been delayed once. It seems like it's taking a little while to get started. Just looking for some more color there.","And then, Nadim, you mentioned, obviously, abstracts next week. Should we expect quantitative details from MEDALIST in the abstracts, or is that something we'll have to wait till December for? Thank you.","Nadim Ahmed - Celgene Corp.","So let me take the last question first, Carter. So the abstracts will contain some information, of course. Of course, not all the information in a presentation, if the abstracts were being accepted as a presentation. So I'd say look out for the abstracts next week.","Jay T. Backstrom - Celgene Corp.","Yeah, and for COMMANDS, this is Jay. It's up and running. It's there.","Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. I believe the slide said not yet enrolling, so I just was following up on that.","Jay T. Backstrom - Celgene Corp.","Yeah, no. The study's open. Sites are open, so it's in that start mode.","Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","Jay T. Backstrom - Celgene Corp.","So we're moving. Yes.","Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC","Good to hear.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Newman from Canaccord. Your line is open.","John Lawrence Newman - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. So it's been a recurring theme or question over time as to how you're going to address REVLIMID going generic, and you've put forth several products on this call that will address that gap when they contribute additional revenues. My question is, given that the BCMA programs, especially your CAR T, could essentially change the standard of care for the treatment of multiple myeloma even beyond what you've accomplished for REVLIMID, can you plan to run combination studies or perhaps sequence studies with some of your new IMiD agents in order to establish a new standard of care and at the same time pull revenue forward with new agents to offset the loss of REVLIMID? Thank you.","Nadim Ahmed - Celgene Corp.","Thanks, John, for your question. So absolutely. So we spoke earlier about our multi-pronged BCMA approach, but our overall approach to multiple myeloma actually has a couple of key core strands. One is the BCMA approach. The other approach is our new CELMoDs, of which we have at least two in the clinic currently, and that's without even contemplating the combination of the two classes of agent. So we feel very good about the overall multi-modality play, and we also feel very good about the timelines of delivery of those agents.","So two of the CELMoDs are both in the clinic already, and we have at least one antibody in the clinic targeting BCMA. Of course, you heard earlier from bb2121, where we are first and best-in-class at the moment. So we absolutely intend to make sure we continue to have great product offerings for patients with multiple myeloma. Thank you for your question.","John Lawrence Newman - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thank you.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Hey, Crystal, I think we have time for one last caller.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from Salim Syed from Mizuho. Your line is open. Please check that your line is currently not on mute.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Okay, let's go ahead and go to the next caller, please.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question will now come from Joseph Thome from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Joseph Thome - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, there. Thank you for taking my question. Maybe just one for Terrie. You did outline those different opportunities going forward for OTEZLA. Maybe specifically for scalp psoriasis and genital psoriasis, do these patients have more widespread disease so that they would already be under the umbrella of patients that are being treated currently on OTEZLA? Or would these be substantial new opportunities? And obviously the mild indication would be excellent. Is there currently any off-label treatment with OTEZLA in the mild patients or is it sticking mainly to moderate to severe? Thank you.","Terrie Curran - Celgene Corp.","So thanks for the question. I think if you look at scalp psoriasis, of moderate to severe patients, about 60% to 80% have scalp involvement. However, many of them are not treated. About 60% of patients that have scalp involvement are not treated and not even on a topical. Topicals are very burdensome for patients, so there really is a high unmet need for scalp psoriasis and also genital psoriasis. So we really see that a product like OTEZLA that's oral with a very significant risk benefit profile really plays to that patient population.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Okay, thank you, everyone, for your interest in Celgene. And as today's call demonstrates, organization continues to deliver outstanding operational performance. We're making meaningful progress advancing our five late-stage products and our early-stage pipeline has also advanced this year with the five INDs filed for molecules with novel mechanisms of actions.","I'd like to conclude the call by thanking the thousands of Celgene employees around the world dedicated to improving human health through the pursuit of novel science. We look forward to seeing all of you at ASH in a few weeks. Thank you, everyone.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program.

Please go ahead.","Patrick E. Flanigan III","Thanks, Stephanie, and welcome, everyone, to Celgene Corporation's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. The press release reporting our first quarter results, in addition to the presentation for today's webcast, can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the corporate website at www.celgene.com. ","Joining me in the room today are Bob Hugin, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jackie Fouse, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Alles, who is our Chief Commercial Officer. ","As a reminder, during today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements regarding our financial outlook in addition to regulatory and product development plans.

A description of these risks can be found in our most recent 10-K on file with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we undertake no duty to update or revise them. Finally, a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure is available as part of our earnings release.","I would now like to turn the call over to Bob.","Robert J. Hugin","Thanks, Patrick, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. I appreciate the opportunity to review the results of the first quarter and our outlook for the full year. 2012 is a year of multiple important milestones with a potential to transform Celgene. I'll share with you our significant progress towards achieving these milestones and advancing key programs. ","Before I review these major inflection points, let me provide my perspective on our financial results. The first quarter results demonstrated strong annual growth of 17% in product sales and 30% growth in non-GAAP earnings. These financial results were at the low end of our expectations. Our global businesses had a slower-than-anticipated January. Importantly, though, across geographies, positive momentum built during February and March, and this trajectory is continuing into April. This positive momentum was partially offset by some end-of-quarter customer inventory reductions primarily in the United States. Given our current trajectory and outlook for the full year, we are reaffirming our 2012 guidance of 15% revenue and 25% earnings per share growth. Our teams are focused and well positioned to achieve these targets, and Jackie and Mark will provide greater detail in a few minutes. ","Let me now turn to our key strategic initiatives designed to enhance our growth well into the future. Maximizing REVLIMID's full potential is an important growth driver for 2012 and beyond. During the quarter, we advanced a number of initiatives positioning REVLIMID for continued strong growth. In February, we submitted our REVLIMID marketing application for del 5q MDS in Europe, with the potential for a regulatory decision by year end. And in terms of our newly diagnosed multiple myeloma application in Europe, we submitted our responses to the 180-day questions and are on track for a CHMP recommendation by the end of this quarter. The benefits of growth from geographic expansion are quite clear, and progress has been achieved during the quarter in advancing our relapsed\/refractory myeloma applications in Mexico, Brazil and China, all with the potential for a regulatory or reimbursement action during the year. Myeloma is an important growth driver for REVLIMID, and we are equally committed to realizing its full potential to benefit patients across other hematological malignancies. ","The REVLIMID program in the lymphomas and leukemia are progressing rapidly. We've completed the accrual in our special protocol assessment mantle cell lymphoma trial and are planning for a regulatory submission within the next 9 to 12 months. Based on positive results in our DCL-001 REVLIMID relapsed\/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma study, we're advancing into the Phase III portion of the trial. We also continue to accrue patients in our other 2 Phase III lymphoma studies in DLBCL maintenance and follicular lymphoma. ","In chronic lymphocytic leukemia, we expect to complete enrollment in our Phase III first-line study in elderly patients by year end. With the addition of AVL-292 from the Avila acquisition, we're accelerating combination studies with this Btk inhibitor and REVLIMID CLL and lymphomas. ","One of our most important achievements of the past few months is the submission to the FDA of our New Drug Application for pomalidomide, our next-generation immunomodulatory therapy for heavily pre-treated multiple myeloma patients. This submission is a major step forward in broadening our product portfolio and strengthening our myeloma franchise. ","At the same time, we're accelerating our regulatory progress in Europe. We're on track to submit our marketing application during this quarter. As the potential impact of this product on both myeloma patients and Celgene is significant, we'll update you on our progress navigating the regulatory processes including acceptance of filings and the type and timing of reviews. I should note that our international Phase III multiple myeloma study, MM-003, is expected to complete accrual later this quarter. Additionally, during this quarter, we completed accrual of our Phase III myelofibrosis study, MF-002, and are initiating a Phase II pomalidomide study in systemic sclerosis. ","Our hematology\/oncology portfolio was also strengthened by clinical and regulatory progress achieved with ABRAXANE. Our supplemental New Drug Application for ABRAXANE in non-small cell lung cancer has been filed with the FDA and has an October PDUFA date. During the quarter, we completed enrollment in the Phase III ABRAXANE trial in metastatic pancreatic cancer. The trial enrolled over 800 patients and will answer the question whether the addition of ABRAXANE to gemcitabine meaningfully improves overall survival. If the data are consistent with Phase II filings, and we'll know that in the next 9 to 12 months, we believe that ABRAXANE would have a transformative impact on the treatment of the disease. I should also note that we'll see Phase III data in melanoma for ABRAXANE in the coming 3 to 4 months, excellent progress. ","Apremilast holds the promise of a new therapeutic franchise for Celgene. There's a major market opportunity for a safe and effective, orally available therapy for the over 3 million patients in the United States and Europe suffering from psoriatic arthritis and moderate-to-severe psoriasis, the initial indications in our registration program. As we've reported, our 5 Phase III studies have been fully accrued, and pivotal data are targeted on all the studies by year end. The initial data readout will begin with psoriatic arthritis this summer. Assuming positive data, we plan on initial regulatory submissions early next year. ","Speaking of Phase III trials, based on the data presented last fall at the American College of Rheumatology meeting, we've recently initiated the apremilast Phase III study in ankylosing spondylitis, AS001. I should also point out that within the next few weeks, we expect to provide top line data on our Phase IIb rheumatoid arthritis study. Assuming a positive outcome, we're preparing to initiate our Phase III program as soon as possible.  2012 is a year of significant data flow and great promise for apremilast. ","We also made progress advancing our deep and diverse mid-stage pipeline as well. We have 7 additional novel products in clinical development spanning hematology, oncology and immune-inflammatory diseases that provide new platforms for delivering therapies to patients with serious unmet medical needs. We look forward to communicating about these programs as they advance in development. ","We have a leadership position in epigenetics, a therapeutic class in which we market 2 of the 4 approved oncology products, VIDAZA and ISTODAX. This morning, we announced a strategic collaboration with Epizyme, a leader in the discovery and development of compounds inhibiting a new class of epigenetic enzymes, a mechanistic and therapeutic category that we increasingly believe will have broad potential in a wide range of malignancies. We have an active epigenetics development program and are advancing CC-486, oral azacitidine, into a Phase III registration study in lower-risk MDS by the end of this year. And based upon new data discussed at the American Association for Cancer Research meeting in early April, we will begin trials in multiple solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer later this year. ","All in all, we have made significant progress this quarter. We're committed to further strengthening our capabilities to innovate and deliver novel therapies to patients worldwide. We are leveraging our leadership position in hematology and expanding into oncology and immune-inflammatory diseases. We look forward to updating you with the outcomes of the many important inflection points that are expected throughout the year. ","Let me now turn the call over to Jackie to review our financial results.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. Celgene produced good year-over-year financial results for Q1 2012, though we were at the low end of our internal estimates for the quarter. Our year-over-year revenue growth of 15% and net product sales growth was higher at 17%. This growth was volume-driven and allowed us to produce faster EPS growth of 30%. Sequentially, product revenues were flat, and EPS grew 3%. And I will speak more about this in a moment. ","Our operating profit margin improved by 230 basis points year-over-year and 70 basis points sequentially. Our business model is performing as it should, and we will continue to see that over the course of the year. We also added some incremental value with financial drivers as we bought back 2.35 million shares for $170 million during the quarter, and we are now delivering a lower tax rate than last year. ","In keeping with our philosophy to continuously invest for the future while producing good short-term performance, we made a lot of progress with our late-stage pipeline projects, entered a new collaboration agreement with Epizyme and closed on the Avila transaction making the $350 million upfront payment. ","We are producing very solid growth on a larger and larger base. Our annual guidance foresaw top line percentage growth in 2012 that would be slower than prior years. Given the larger base, the trajectory for VIDAZA in the U.S. post loss of exclusivity, where we are today with growth following launches in major markets like Japan and moving into the second year comps after the Abraxis acquisition. ","However, beyond that overall expected trend, Q1 was also impacted by lower inventory levels, primarily in the U.S. across all products, and partly driven by the merger of 2 large pharmaceutical benefits management companies but also in Japan as a result of their March fiscal year end. Our estimates for this global impact range from about $30 million to $35 million, with a significant amount of that impacting REVLIMID and the U.S. Our year-over-year growth was good despite this inventory headwind, and the quality of our growth is very good. As a result, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our annual guidance. ","Speaking to the quality of the growth, 80% of the quarter's growth came from volume and the other 20% from price. This was driven by product sales growth of 17%, higher than the 15% overall revenue growth as we saw declines in our royalty income. The Celgene business model is performing as expected, and our P&L dynamic is strong. As a result, year-over-year EPS growth of 30% far outpaced revenue growth and was comparable to the same period 1 year ago. About 70% of the year-over-year increase in EPS came from growth in operating income. In addition, we continue to add incremental value with financial drivers that will provide sustainable benefits in the future. The good performance at the operating profit level resulted in an improvement in margin to 46.2%. This margin improved both on a year-over-year and on a sequential basis. ","With respect to individual product revenues and year-over-year performance, REVLIMID demonstrated good growth of 17%, with similar increases in both the U.S. and international. VIDAZA continues to solidify its position in international markets, with 23% growth there, and the product grew 14% globally. ABRAXANE started the year well, and we are seeing good uptake of the product in international markets. During Q1, the U.S. market experienced complete resolution of the generic paclitaxel shortages we saw in the second half of last year. ","As a reminder, Q1 sequential growth in the U.S. is negatively impacted each year by relatively larger portion of the Medicare Coverage Gap expense occurring in the quarter versus other quarters. This year, that sequential impact was about $9 million for REVLIMID and $13 million in total. In addition for all products, the sequential growth from Q4 2011 to Q1 2012 in the U.S. was impacted by inventory reductions, and we also saw lower inventories in Japan. I already mentioned that we estimate the global impact of that inventory effect at about $30 million to $35 million, and we think about $20 million of that relates to REVLIMID. Mark will cover the commercial dynamics for the product in just a moment. ","A quick look back at our history of quarterly revenues for both total revenues and REVLIMID revenues shows that Q1 of any given year is often the slowest sequential growth quarter, and we have also experienced phases of very rapid growth followed by short periods of slightly slower growth before we embark on another strong leg of growth. This was particularly evident in the second half of 2008 and entering 2009. We now see that we experienced a similar pattern in late 2011 and entering 2012. This being said, as you will hear from Mark, all of the commercial metrics for REVLIMID were very positive at the end of Q1, and we feel quite good about the prospects for Q2 as we have started this quarter strong and for the full year, and that is reflected in the affirmation of our guidance. ","Our P&L is performing extremely well. We are on track to achieve our full-year guidance across all line items, and we have already produced and improved operating profit margin in Q1. R&D and SG&A expenses are where we expected them to be. As a reminder, SG&A expense is impacted by much higher patient assistance expense in Q1 than in other quarters of the year, and we expect to see SG&A, as a percentage of revenues decline over the course of the year to end the full year at about 21%. ","With respect to the effective tax rate, we are seeing a more favorable mix of earnings across geographies, and we may end the year somewhat lower than our original guidance. We will give you an update on that later in the year. We do expect this lower rate to be sustainable on a go-forward basis.  Again, all of the trends in our P&L dynamic are tracking as we expected, with the usual impact I referred to in Q1 in SG&A expense. ","We had very good net cash from operations generation in the quarter at just over $300 million. The amount of cash in our balance sheet declined somewhat versus year-end 2011 as we redeployed capital to buy back about 170 million of our own shares, make the $350 million upfront payment for Avila and pay down some of our short-term debt, including commercial paper of $250 million. ","Here, we provide you with some information to better link our P&L and balance sheet performance, and you can see our return on invested capital history for the current trailing 12 months and the prior 5 years. With the green line in this chart, you can see a continuously improving ROIC that now stands at around 16%. We executed on the Abraxis acquisition in 2010 and held ROIC about flat during that time and then resumed our growth in returns in 2011 and are on track to produce higher returns in 2012. Full details of the ROIC calculation can be found in the Reconciliation Tables attached to our webcast slides. In those, we will see that we have used the more conservative GAAP operating income as the starting point for this analysis and growth as opposed to net debt in the invested capital base. ","To summarize, we reaffirm our original full-year guidance for total revenues, REVLIMID revenues and EPS with top line growth of 15%, global REVLIMID growth of 19% and EPS growth of 25% at the midpoints of the ranges. Our Q1 performance was solid, and we finished the quarter strong. The Celgene business model is delivering on all of the important operating and financial metrics and is allowing us to produce good short-term results while continuing to invest for our future growth. ","Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to Mark.","Mark J. Alles","Thanks very much, Jackie, and good morning, everyone. While we are pleased to report that our year-on-year first quarter total net product sales grew by 17%, it is clear that sequential quarterly sales growth was below our expectations. For the next several minutes, I'd like to add my perspective to these results, to our expectations for expanded market opportunities from new indications and pomalidomide and to highlight some of the emerging new clinical data expected to shape the value proposition of our products. ","First quarter 2012 global REVLIMID sales were $861 million, an increase of 17% compared with 2011. This year-on-year result demonstrates strong quality growth over a period of time when Celgene, our customers and our patients manage the uncertainty created by the regulatory and market focus on second primary malignancies. In Q1 2012, several well-understood product performance metrics and conditions contributed to flat quarter-on-quarter product sales growth. Jackie discussed the negative impact global inventory variances and the Medicare Part D Coverage Gap expense had on our sales results. My comments will focus on the key metrics that best describe product performance. ","Across our core markets, January REVLIMID sales were down compared with December but grew through the balance of the quarter. In the United States, Q1 new patient starts increased by 13% compared with the fourth quarter. This positive change represents the second highest sequential quarterly growth in new patient starts since the REVLIMID launch in 2006 and a record quarter for the most new patient starts. This jump in REVLIMID new patient demand translated into a first quarter market share trend that increased by approximately 4 points over the quarter to an overall myeloma market share of approximately 56%. Please remember that the reimbursed use of REVLIMID for myeloma in Europe is limited to previously treated patients. ","In Q1, our 4 major markets in Europe realized an approximately 2-point improvement in second line myeloma market share. This growth increased total REVLIMID share in this segment to approximately 54%. These promising Q1 trends have continued into the second quarter. We constantly measure duration of therapy, and this important indicator of REVLIMID growth improved in Q1. Importantly, the peer-reviewed publications that we expect will fully characterize the benefit of continuous treatment with REVLIMID in myeloma, either as induction and maintenance or as maintenance following autologous stem cell transplantation are expected to be published in the month of May. We anticipate that the availability of the full results of MM-015 and the CALGB and IFM studies will provide additional clarity on the optimal use of REVLIMID for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Our integrated clinical, regulatory and commercial plan designed to maximize the full potential of REVLIMID is just beginning to produce the promise of this product. ","Pivotal Phase II and III trials in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia are maturing, such that we expect new commercial opportunity this year, but more importantly, significant opportunities over the next 5 years. Approval of the pending newly diagnosed and maintenance marketing application in Europe will add incremental sales to 2012, with billion-dollar potential per year over time. Approval of the pending MDS del 5q market application will provide reimbursed access for patients in Europe to REVLIMID in this well-recognized standard of care status for low-risk MDS. Securing regulatory approvals for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma in new markets will add significant commercial opportunities to repeat the launch of REVLIMID in all planned indications. Our model is well established, it's leveraged and we are executing. ","We submitted the pomalidomide NDA in early April and are advancing our commercial plans to launch this important new therapy in the U.S. and Europe. The current pomalidomide clinical profile demonstrates broad utility for patients regardless of the number or type of prior anti-myeloma therapies. The Phase III program that will fully develop the potential pomalidomide and multiple myeloma includes the ongoing international study, MM-003, the MM-005 Phase I\/II study, combining pomalidomide and dexamethasone with Bortezomib, the special protocol assessment Phase III study, MM-007, and we plan to introduce expanded access programs in the U.S. and Europe following acceptance of our regulatory submissions. Regulatory and commercial plans are now in development to support what we expect will be positive results from the Phase III myelofibrosis study, MF-002. ","Turning to VIDAZA. First quarter 2012 VIDAZA sales were $186 million. Sequential quarterly sales were essentially flat, with year-on-year growth of 14%. Sequential sales in the United States decreased to $74 million but continue to reflect the consistent quarter-by-quarter strong market share and VIDAZA demand trends. International sales of VIDAZA, particularly in the recent launch markets of Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Spain, grew 23% year-on-year and 9% over the fourth quarter. The lack of a generic entrant in the U.S., our commercial launch momentum in new markets and our focus on improved duration of therapy should return VIDAZA to positive quarterly growth. Our early Q2 trends for VIDAZA are strong. Multiple strategies to leverage our global MDS franchise continue to be developed. VIDAZA and REVLIMID are being advanced in a series of clinical studies in higher-risk MDS and AML. The initiation of the Phase III study of CC-486, oral azacitidine, in lower-risk MDS is on track for the fourth quarter. Other trials in development will seek to define this novel agent's role in maintenance therapy for acute myeloid leukemia. ","First quarter sales of ABRAXANE were $104 million, representing strong year-on-year growth of 41%. We are encouraged by the improving contribution international launches are making to ABRAXANE total sales. Sequential quarterly international sales and year-on-year sales increased significantly. Year-on-year, U.S. sales grew 30% but before restocking of generic paclitaxel negatively impacted ABRAXANE inventory levels and use outside of metastatic breast cancer late in the fourth quarter and throughout the first quarter. With a current quarterly base of more than $100 million and multiple opportunities for growth this year, we look to the execution of the clinical and regulatory program goals established in breast cancer, lung cancer, melanoma and pancreatic cancer to create new therapeutic and commercial opportunities. Adding indications from our pivotal studies in non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer should ensure that ABRAXANE will become one of the billion-dollar brands in our cancer portfolio. ","Our scientific presence at this year's American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting will be meaningful for the quantity but more important, the quality of the data we expect to be presented. We are currently aware of approximately 50 abstracts that have been submitted. We are most interested in the Phase II study reporting data on the combination of REVLIMID and dexamethasone, combined with carfilzomib, the RCD regimen, in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma; pomalidomide Phase II data in the important segment of patients refractory to REVLIMID; the very first randomized study and data on the combination of REVLIMID plus rituximab in recurrent follicular lymphoma; more data from studies testing REVLIMID and VIDAZA in MDS and AML; the full presentation of the ABRAXANE plus Avastin data from the CALGB breast cancer trial, plus new ABRAXANE data in operable pancreatic cancer and updated results from our ABRAXANE pivotal Phase III trial in non-small cell lung cancer.  Our internal research team has now successfully advanced CC-223, our dual TOR kinase inhibitor in the Phase I, with the first oral presentation of its clinical profile expected during ASCO. ","In summary, we are very proud of our year-on-year total net product sales performance. In addition, the leading indicators of performance for our products such as new patient starts, market share and duration of therapy are on track, and we are confident we will achieve our full-year targets. We expect to realize the commercial benefit of significant new market opportunities throughout 2012, and we are completely focused on executing and delivering on our commercial plan. ","Thank you very much. And I'd like to turn the call back to Bob.","Robert J. Hugin","Thanks, Mark, and thanks, Jackie. We've covered a lot of ground this morning. Although we had some early challenges in the quarter, our current trajectory is positive and momentum strong. We're energized by our progress to date, advancing key programs across our hematology, oncology and immune-inflammatory franchises, and we're focused on our near-term objectives, which position us to achieve multiple clinical and regulatory milestones throughout the remainder of the year. 2012 will be a transformational year for Celgene. I do want to thank all my colleagues at Celgene for their dedication and commitment to delivering on our strategic goals and their focus on improving the lives of patients worldwide. ","Thank you. Operator, please open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Geoff Meacham from JPMorgan.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just got a couple of them. When you guys talk about global inventory for REVLIMID, if you help us out with how o U.S. inventories are different from the U.S. And the second question is, assuming European approval, how do you guys see the pace of reimbursement discussions thereafter, given that you'll be into a seasonally slow period?","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","Geoff, it's Jackie.  I'll take the first one and pass it to Mark for the second one. So with respect to the inventory impact, I highlighted the total of $30 million, $35 million globally for all products, of which we think REVLIMID was about $20 million or so globally, with around $15 million of that being in the U.S. and the balance mostly in Japan related to the March fiscal year end.","Mark J. Alles","Yes. I think, Geoff, the other component of that is that we do have obviously multiple markets around the world now where we're in various stages of maturing, some early, some a little bit later. And I think those other markets in combination make up the balance of what Jackie just presented. Geoff, can I just ask you to restate the second part of your question? I want to be sure I understood it well.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. So if you assume European approval, I would say third quarter, you're right in to sort of the vacation season and you -- this is for first line REVLIMID and myeloma, obviously. I mean, I'm assuming that it's going to take maybe 6 months, 9 months to get full reimbursement throughout the big 5, but do you -- would you now see, for example, the impact of that label skewed to say maybe mid-'13 as opposed to early '13?","Mark J. Alles","No, really, thank you for the detail. I wanted to be sure it was clear. First, the expected positive outcome of this CHMP review, we think, will be a big lift in the current market. So the incremental we see this year would be confidence in the brand moving to first line. That would be the market statement. Market by market, though, the difference between when we launched REVLIMID in the relapsed\/refractory setting across Europe is we had to really build our plans market by market from a 0 base. Today, we have, of course, a fully integrated global team focused on market access, so we built and have in the queue the value proposition dossiers that would be ready to engage much earlier post-approval. Having said that, it will be a month-by-month, quarter-by-quarter process, as you know, to get reimbursement. So our focus would be on the early opportunity markets in a priority order and yet still seek reimbursement in parallel across these markets. So is it going to be a Q1 to Q2 to Q3 effect in Europe? Certainly. But we're looking to front-load, to the best of our ability, broad reimbursement for newly diagnosed myeloma in the major European markets.","Operator","Our next question comes from Marshall Urist from Morgan Stanley.","Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So first question is just on U.S., on U.S. REVLIMID. I wanted to get a sense of just as we put the pieces together, given the price increase late last year, I realized it was a slow January. But can you help us think about how much unit growth you saw quarter-over-quarter, even if we take out the inventory in terms of end market unit growth? We'd love to get a better sense of kind of how that looked for the full quarter.","Mark J. Alles","So these variables, of course, happen in the quarter on a bit of a gated month-by-month. But we're looking at what we think now in absolute comparison unit growth in the mid single digits. But again, as we got into the second part of the quarter, we saw acceleration. So I think it's in absolute terms about mid single digits, but we're encouraged, as we said, about what we saw through March and into the early part of April.","Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And just 1 more follow-up on Europe. Just wanted to get an update on sort of the post the 180-day questions? Kind of how your -- is the confidence in the broad label still there and any sort of changes in how you're thinking about that or some of the age issues for elderly patients in the non-transplant setting?","Robert J. Hugin","Marshall, it's Bob. We're obviously in the late stages of the review, and we're now into the last couple of months. Hopefully, by the end of the quarter, have the CHMP recommendation. So again, we're engaged in a very active dialogue. And so I think until the results are clear, we'll see. But we're well positioned, and we're focused on the right issues. And we've got strong data, and we'll be discussing that over the coming weeks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from ISI Group.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Thanks for all transparency on the quarter. It's very helpful. Number one, will you be -- on the MMO-20 trial, will you be waiting for mature survival data before stopping that, even if PFS has a profound early separation? And number two, would you be willing to give us the actual durations of therapy in the quarter in the U.S. and in Europe? And then the third is, have you gotten a request yet for an oral argument in front of the CHMP? And if not, is that something that you would disclose or is that not something you'd disclose?","Mark J. Alles","Mark, it's Mark. So on MMO-20, this is, of course, a very, very important study for us and to really, really, I think, solidify ultimately the Rev\/Dex proposition in myeloma regardless of age or intent to transplant. The way we've approached this is that the planned statistical analysis, of course, will lead to various points in time where the event rate on things like survival, like progression-free survival would lead to independent review. And depending on the results, that review would either, by ethical reasons, say unblind or in the case of survival, if things are trending the right way, the recommendation could be to remain unblinded until survival. And we really don't have a choice in the matter, but our view would be, given the complexity of the comparison to melphalan, MPT, the optimal would be that the first look would include at least the strong trend of survival, if not, a complete analysis of OS. The second part of our duration, what I can say is that duration continues to improve. And when one looks at the dynamics first in Europe, the duration gain that we saw in the more recent quarter was quite positive. In the U.S., of course, we have a much more mature base of patients. And so while duration continues to improve, we're looking at the combination of the different cohorts. We call them short runners, 6 to 10 months on therapy, and then those very long runners where you get out to 2 years plus of therapy to understand if it's still accelerating as we expected. So I think generally speaking, we're satisfied where duration's at. But as I said in my comments earlier, the publication of the 3 papers that speak to duration in multiple settings from newly diagnosed multiple myeloma in the context of second primary malignancies, we believe, is very important confidence-building information to make sure duration stays on track now and in the future.","Robert J. Hugin","On the third question, I think I'm always cautious about discussing specific regulatory issues in between actual action at public action dates because we'd have a conversation one day and then something changes the next week, and you don't have the same forum providing some of that issue, plus I don't think anybody wants to negatively impact relationships with regulators. But specifically to your question about the oral explanation, we have not been asked to appear for oral explanation, though we are prepared if that were to happen in the next couple of weeks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Deutsche Bank.","Navdeep Singh - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's actually Navdeep substituting in for Robyn. I think you mentioned the increase in quarter-over-quarter new patients on REVLIMID was pretty robust, I think as robust as you've seen in many years. What drove this increase? Was it because Q4 new patients were soft? And a question on apremilast. If you're looking at umbrellaing pipe to continue to grow despite the competition, what kind of data do you think will be competitive as we approach the data readout?","Mark J. Alles","Yes, it's Mark Alles. So on the point that you're making, the comparable base of patients in Q4 or the second half of last year and how robust Q1 new patient starts were, I appreciate the question. We became aware of the relationship more acutely around getting new patient starts back on a strong growth trend towards, let's say, the latter part of Q3 into Q4. We were not declining, but the growth rate was a little bit less than we expected. So there is a little bit, a very small amount of that slightly lower base, I'd say, in Q4 coming into Q1, but it is so insignificant that we didn't call it out. However, we were aware, and our commercial organization around the world, but in particular, in the U.S., became very focused again on creating demand while still dealing with some of the questions clinically about overall treatment in the face of second primary malignancies. So that relationship is important, but we see it clearly. And no matter how we look at the quarter-over-quarter on new patients, this is an all-time record.","Robert J. Hugin","And on the apremilast issues, we're obviously very near-term to getting the important data starting, again, in the next few weeks for the controlled Phase II data of rheumatoid arthritis, which is very important for us to see if we're going to have a potential to go down a registration path there and obviously the summer beginning the psoriatic arthritis data then late in the year on the psoriasis. I think in terms of the data itself, it's obviously a very competitive market. It's an incredibly exciting market opportunity for us that an oral therapy that so far has the kind of side effect profile that ideally positions it in the marketplace. And I think on the efficacy side or the activity side, it's going to be very important for us to be able to distinguish it in its own right on that activity side and looking at it both from TNF na\u00efve patients and TNF pre-treated patients. And so we're optimistic it's going to be a very competitive on all aspects, and the reality of it is, the data is in 2012. So we're not going to wait long to have to make those judgments and see how we can maximize the opportunity here. But where we see it today, it's a tremendous opportunity.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Schmidt from Cowen and Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Jackie, on the inventory changes, would -- will we expect that to rebound in Q2? Or are these now with the TTM [ph] merger that you mentioned sort of reset as a new lower level, and we just don't -- won't see the same decline in Q2?","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","What I can tell you is that -- I think the most important thing is that we are not counting on a rebound with respect to how we're looking at delivering on the full-year guidance, and that gives us a lot of confidence in terms of affirming that guidance. I really can't tell you whether this is the new normal or not. What we can say is that we saw inventory levels in the U.S. that are the lowest that we've ever seen. Maybe the channel is becoming more efficient and some of that is permanent. Maybe some of it comes back. But we're not counting on it to come back in terms of delivering our guidance, so let's see how it plays out in Q2.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","If I could ask a second question, Mark, on MMO-020. Just on the timing, there's been some speculation about when we may see the results. Is there still a potential 2012 event? And if not, when would be the next interim?","Mark J. Alles","I think potential is the operative word. It's certainly, on an event basis, has the potential. I think the way we would think about it is, the longer we wait to see the results, the more likely we get an overall unblinding against all primary and secondary end points, such that the clear proposition of the product comes out first time with the unblinding. So the timing, unlikely this year, very likely in '13, but it's hard to know. It's one of these event-driven studies. And I'll just say it again, the longer we wait, the more positive we think about the data.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gene Mack from Mizuho.","Gene Mack - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","On pomalidomide, I'm just wondering, would it be possible, in your view, for the FDA to accept the application? I guess they would let you know in early May. And then perhaps -- or early June, rather, and then perhaps schedule you for ODAS [ph] panel on June 20 or 21? I see that the register reflects a panel for carfilzomib in relapsed\/refractory myeloma? I'm just wondering if there's still a potential that you see for the FDA to review both drugs together.","Robert J. Hugin","Yes, obviously, we can't speak for the FDA. But by having the application in now, we're in a good position that the data has been very rigorously analyzed and presented. So again, we haven't even passed the date for the submission to turn into a filing and for the FDA to notify us on the priority status of the review. But I do think based on the size of the trial and the completeness of the analysis that -- again, we can't speak for the FDA. We have no insight into this, but we will be prepared to move very expeditiously in any review. If there is an opportunity to review it more quickly, we'll be prepared and be very supportive of that.","Mark J. Alles","Just to clarify a point, I want to make sure people didn't hear what Bob said differently. We don't know the status of acceptance or not of the file. So we're not saying that there's a priority status given or not at this point. We've submitted, and I just -- I heard the word priority but didn't want people to connect the 2.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sapna Srivastava from Goldman Sachs.","Sapna Srivastava - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","The first question I just had was on the U.S. filing for front line. I just wanted to know as to when you expect -- I mean, what the gating factors still are. And do you expect that once you have to get the label in the U.S., I know the drug is used quite broadly off label, but is there room for acceleration once you get the label in the U.S.?","Robert J. Hugin","Yes, I think -- Sapna, it's Bob. Clearly, getting the European filing completed and getting that recommendation and move forward with that is the first priority, and that's what we're focused on. And that will occur before we submit in the U.S. and get -- making sure that the data is the right maturity for the U.S. regulators. So I think we're moving forward as appropriately as we can. And I think that any label expansion is always an opportunity to impact on the commercial opportunity for us. We obviously have a strong position, and Mark will add in a second his perspective. So positive label expansion is a good thing. It's not critical in the U.S., but it certainly will be, on the margin, a positive.","Mark J. Alles","Yes, no, I agree completely with Bob. One of the aspects we are interested in is to the extent that we go through the full regulatory procedure in Europe. We learn many, many things that would be helpful to helpful and inform how we would approach international filings, including FDA.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams from Wells Fargo.","Brian Abrahams - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Two quick questions. First, wondering, how much U.S. adoption of REVLIMID maybe has been impacted by lingering second primary malignancy concerns? And I guess I'm wondering if you saw any change in use patterns. Once the label is updated last month, perhaps with conditions, reassure that -- of the FDA's conclusion of our safety review. And then secondly, on VIDAZA, just wondering how far out your level of visibility is here in terms of potential generic entry. As from now into the year, wondering what your guidance now presumes in terms of how long you'll be able to maintain VIDAZA revenues in the U.S. before generic entry.","Robert J. Hugin","Yes, Brian, we obviously follow the VIDAZA situation very closely, but we don't have any access, any information that would be any different than anybody in the public domain as to the timing of that. We continue to support VIDAZA actively in the U.S. and [indiscernible] international presence. And as you've heard, there is some very encouraging epigenetic work being done presented at the American -- at the AACR meeting early this month about the potential for VIDAZA and ultimately for us oral azacitidine in number of areas of malignancy solid tumors. So that's an important development area for us. But as far as the generics specifically goes, we don't have any more clarity than what's available in the public domain.","Mark J. Alles","Brian, thanks for the question about SPMs. You're asking an umbrella question about its impact. Let me start with the past year. There's no question that in the hematology circles, academic meetings, patient advocacy, et cetera, that this was a finding, an outcome that people really focused on and wanted to understand. Interestingly, third-party evidence like the NCCN guidelines, et cetera, were not changed at all in the face of this concern. But as you point out, the label was just updated. There's no doubt that in certain markets, there was an acute measurable impact from the emergence of second primary malignancies, and we talked about France historically. Qualitatively, around the world, and I think to a certain extent in the U.S., we do think that some of what could be considered a little slower growth has to be related to the emergence and now what we believe is the full characterization of the benefit risk profile on this question. Once again, the full publication of the 3 papers that really led to the question should really help to put this issue more in the rearview mirror of everyone, academics, physicians, community physicians, but more importantly, inform patient advocacy and patients around the world that the benefit risk profile is well understood, and it's far better to get treated continuously than it is to not continue and then have progression of myeloma.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoff Porges from Sanford Bernstein.","Aleksandr Rabodzey","It's Aleks here for Geoff. I just got 2 quick questions. First is, could you give us some guidance of how we should think about the change in the amount of rebates that you will be paying between now and 2014 when the donut hole will be closing and probably the share will increase? And then the second quick question is, how should we think about the size of potential opportunity beyond multiple myeloma for REVLIMID, NHL, CLL, MDS? If you could kind of qualify that.","Robert J. Hugin","Yes, on the rebate or the closing of the donut hole, the -- our responsibility as a branded pharmaceutical company on the Part D Medicare Coverage Gap is will be unchanged going forward, unless the legislation has changed. And that's obviously an issue that if the Supreme Court ordered to overturn the legislation, the Affordable Care Act, that, that aspect of providing assistance to patients would have to be changed and figured out. But if the law is ruled constitutional and the Congress doesn't change it, we don't anticipate any change in our obligation in terms of any coverage and change to those rebates.","Mark J. Alles","Yes. And on the question of the market opportunity beyond myeloma, we are -- as Bob and I pointed out earlier, we are extremely encouraged by the maturity, the maturing of our CLL and NHL program. Just to put this in context, rituximab is the most commonly used product in leukemia and lymphoma, and global sales of this product are in the $6 billion range. So when we think about the combination of Rituxan with REVLIMID, which will be featured at ASCO in follicular lymphoma that we plan to file the mantle cell application with the FDA later this year from our study MCL-001, that we have ongoing maintenance trials in both follicular and especially diffuse large B-cell lymphoma for patients with high-risk disease. The opportunity for REVLIMID over the next 5 to 6 years in lymphoma is multibillion. In CLL, we have particular segmentation in the elderly population with single agent REVLIMID and then combination strategies and maintenance strategies in patients who have been previously treated. So this also represents another billion dollar or so opportunity just from CLL. So the next 3, 4, 5 years, we'll see new data, new indications and a ramp-up of this product across these diseases.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rachel McMinn from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I think you mentioned that some of the most important data for REVLIMID would be newly diagnosed data in combination with carfilzomib, and I wanted to better understand your perspective on that because we've already seen some Velcade\/Rev\/Dex combination data. So do you think this carfilzomib data is going to augment your market share? Do you think that bodes well for pomalidomide? I just want to better understand that. And then, Jackie, if could comment on France. You have mentioned, that's been sluggish since the SPM stuff came out. Has that rebounded?","Mark J. Alles","Rachel, it's Mark. On the carfilzomib piece, thanks for calling that out. One of the interesting things about the development of REVLIMID in myeloma that you understand very well is that it has become the backbone of all myeloma clinical trials that we're aware of regardless of the novel agent and development, in this case, carfilzomib. Our interest is because, as you know, the pivotal Phase III trial, RCD versus RD in relapsed\/refractory myeloma, the Aspire trial is fully accrued. What we don't have, at least I don't have, is awareness of does that regimen look like or perform like the other proteasome inhibitor combination that you pointed out in combination with Rev\/Dex? So we would look to that regimen to see if the response rates are similar. More importantly, I think, is the side effect profile equal to or better of what we see with Rev\/Dex and Bortezomib? So it really does look at the landscape. No matter how one looks at these combinations, improving the therapeutic profile of Rev\/Dex in a triplet like this, would be something that would improve the prospects of our products over time.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","And Rachel, just to your second question on France, as we've mentioned before, that market was sequentially down in Q2, then stable in Q3 and Q4, is how we would characterize it essentially and then starting to grow again in Q1. So the plan that we have internally for the French market has a growth in it. It's -- we're moving to this year, and we're essentially on track with that plan. That being said, that market is not yet back to the trajectory that it was on before in terms of duration and share and other things like that. But it is back on growth track, and over time, hopefully, we'll catch back up to where we were in terms of trajectory before.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joel Sendek from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Joel D. Sendek - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I have a question on apremilast. So if you get all of these studies between here and the end of the year, I'm wondering, you kind of suggest that you're going to wait for all the data prior to deciding the regulatory strategy? I'm wondering if 1 or 2 of the studies are particularly [Audio Gap] might be able to accelerate a filing on the basis of what you see. So is that possible at all?","Robert J. Hugin","Yes -- no, Joel, I apologize. I wasn't clear enough. We're going to get psoriatic arthritis data beginning in the summer. And the moderate-to-severe psoriasis pivotal is not towards the end of the year and -- hopefully, by January or so, but certainly, our goal at the end of the year. But we're not waiting for all that data to begin the filing. The fact that our target is to begin regulatory submissions at the beginning of '13 when we'll only have just -- either just getting the final psoriasis data or maybe not even having all the final psoriasis data and begin the psoriatic arthritis filing process -- submission process, again, assuming the data is positive and supportive of that. So we're going to be moving forward on multiple fronts in sequence or in parallel depending on what's available when. And we'll obviously begin in the U.S. and then begin international filings as appropriately as quickly thereafter as possible.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","Joel, one thing you might have heard us say before, so we will file for PsA first in the U.S., psoriasis second. There are 2 different indications that go to different departments in Europe. Because it's the same department and just given the timing on that, they will likely go together in Europe but after the first U.S. filing.","Robert J. Hugin","And you can imagine based on the data what's the best indication for us to go for, not just from a regulatory point of view but from a reimbursement and a market access and a marketing strategy, because this will be a very important market opportunity that needs to have a very specific marketing strategy in these kinds of market. So the opportunity is very significant. The plans have to be very appropriate for reimbursement pricing and regulatory issues market by market.","Joel D. Sendek - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then real quickly on REVLIMID. When will you have the Phase III NHL data?","Mark J. Alles","So the lymphoma program, the NHL program is, as I said, gated. The very first opportunity would be the mantle cell submission late this year. And then I think we would be looking a little bit further out for the results of some of the other studies. As everyone knows, these are patients who do quite well in response rates. So the effect on -- with REVLIMID will take a little bit longer. In our model, we have data flow coming '13 through '15 from the Phase III programs. So the order, much like we just talked about apremilast, really depends on the different histologies, segments of the population and then, of course, events, but a continuous flow of data beginning end of this year through '13 and really through the next maybe 5 to 6 years. That's before we add more to it based on opportunity.","Operator","Our next question comes from Yaron Werber from Citi.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So I have 2 questions. One is for Jackie and Mark, actually both of them. So just help us understand a little bit. It sounds like there was about a $9 million headwind from Medicare rebates and about $30 million to $35 million between inventory. So it looks like demand was closer to 905, if you just kind of -- 900 to 905. So the first question, is that sort of -- do you agree with that? Is that sort of how we should look at the transition into Q2? And then secondly, you're not changing the guidance. You're starting sort of $29 million or so below consensus. So I'm just trying to understand, what else are you seeing on a global basis that gives you a lot of confidence in the outlook ahead? And I'm just trying to get a sense kind of how to think about where we're going to end up at the end of the year.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","Let me start. So just to be very clear on the numbers, again, we estimate that the impact of the change in the number of days of inventory from 12\/31\/'11 to 3\/31\/'12 globally to be about $30 million to $35 million, okay? And we thought that we ended 2011 at a level that was in line with historical norms that we saw. So end of the first quarter of 2012 was lower. As I said before, we don't know if some of that is the new normal or not. Some of it is probably not, so that just be clear about that. When we look at the coverage gap expense, so the $9 million sequential impact that I talked about for REVLIMID equates to $13 million of expense in the first quarter of 2012, okay? And then the overall, as I said, was -- the sequential change was $13 million, the total expense was $16 million. So again, in Q1 2012, Coverage gap only expense for REVLIMID was $13 million, which is $9 million higher than Q4. The inventory impact for REVLIMID, out of the $30 million to $35 million, we estimate to be about $20 million or so. So those 2 REVLIMID sequential differences are $20 million and $9 million from Q4 to Q1.","Mark J. Alles","I think the -- Yaron, this is Mark. The other demand component is, in a quarter, patients are coming in, in bowl [ph] of pieces, whether it's at the beginning, the middle or the end. What we've seen in the second half of Q1, small amounts of time but encouraging new patient starts really back ended to the quarter with what's happening in early April. We're comfortable with that. Also remember that we have a lot of markets around the world that are in different stages of launch phases. So, for example, Jackie pointed out Japan and its impact in the quarter. We have renewed outlook for Japan coming out of Q1 despite the variance that Jackie spoke to where the underlying performance is stronger. Let me give you the example of that 1 variable. So everyone knows that every year in the April timeframe, the Japanese government looks across the pharmaceutical industry and will look to net out all discounts in the market, all rebates in the market and will reset pricing and reimbursement at that lower level. Lenalidomide, REVLIMID was fortunate that we don't discount, of course, our list price is our price, and we were not exposed to any reduction and reimbursement in April in Japan. This is 1 example such that in the model for the performance of Japan this year, that is a modest upside. And there are many items like that, that contributes over\/under to our reaffirmation of guidance.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just maybe -- that's very useful, but Jackie, just for you, just so I'm clear, we're clear. You mentioned that there was a $20 million quarter-to-quarter headwind related to inventory and not $30 million to $35 million? I'm just trying to understand that.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","Yes, Yaron, what we said was the global impact across all products of inventories. So for total Celgene revenues, we estimate that to be $30 million to $35 million, of which the global impact for REVLIMID only is about $20 million.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. So it looks like that's going to be -- so let's say 890 was the real demand then minus the -- including the inventory and the rebate. So is that how we should think about it? Is it 890 is really the level of demand as we enter Q2?","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","That's the math that I think we can all do.","Mark J. Alles","Well, I have to say it this way because we're on the call, we're not going to calculate all the different numbers. What we can say is there's certainly a range zone that you're speaking to. But on a demand basis, it's probably fairly accurate. The exact number, we could debate for a while, but I think we're in the range.","Robert J. Hugin","Right. But also just to reiterate what Jackie earlier said is that on that inventory front, we don't -- we're not using that to affirm our guidance, and we don't know when that -- if and when it will rebound or not. So it may be the new normal, it may not be. So I think it's -- you have to be careful of putting it in 1 quarter or not. It's -- we just -- and so I think that was the point that Jackie made.","Mark J. Alles","Absolutely.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Raymond from Robert W. Baird.","Christopher J. Raymond - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just wanted to ask maybe a detailed question here on ABRAXANE. Kind of struck by the x U.S. number. Can you maybe talk a little bit -- I know you guys have been in the process of relaunching it in x U.S., especially in Europe. But can you maybe tell us what specifically happened in the quarter for that kind of -- for the big number that you had there? And also maybe give us some color around the generic paclitaxel impact. Has it all worked its way through sort of rebasing ABRAXANE demand or do you expect maybe more impact? And if I can sneak one more question in. Do you guys ever plan on breaking Japan out for REVLIMID? That's it.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","Let me start real quickly and then pass it to Mark. I think we've talked over a couple of quarters about -- and I think we've used the word choppiness in the ABRAXANE international totals just because of the different stages of launch there. When we started rolling out in Europe, you get a little bit of top line fill and then we've got -- we use distributors in a few places. So you get irregular order patterns there. And I think what we said was that for a little while, for ABRAXANE total international, you would see that number move around because of those different issues and the fact that we're still on a very modest base. And we certainly saw that from Q3 to Q4. I think what we start to see now in Q1 is a little bit of smoothing out of some of those effects. And as the launches start to fully, in different countries, be in place and that continues to roll forward, I think it's pretty safe to say that the total international ABRAXANE base is something around that number that we saw in the first quarter. And we'll probably not going to see these $20 million to $12 million type of movements anymore, but there still will be a little bit of erratic pattern in that as we continue that. But again, I think that $20 million to $25 million per quarter base number that we saw for total international ABRAXANE is probably a pretty good way to think about it.","Mark J. Alles","Yes, no, just to follow that point, in Japan, our partner is Taiho. They recently filed the ABRAXANE product for gastric cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. So back to Jackie's point about choppiness, not only do you have the buying pattern but you also have the potential that this brand could grow in Japan off of these new indications. In Europe, I think it's very important to call out that a year ago this time, we made the business decision to establish a dedicated oncology presence in Europe similar to the U.S. The difference is that in the U.S., ABRAXANE launched and was commercialized for several years, where in Europe, despite an approval, it was never actually launched or commercialized in any meaningful way. What we've realized year-on-year in the quarter is our focus in Europe on core markets and our alignment with a lot of the breast cancer key opinion leaders across key markets has translated into market penetration and adoption that we're pleasantly surprised by. We look to expand that from here, in particular, because we're setting ourselves up for multiple launches with, for example, the pancreatic indication, which we think in Europe is going to be quite important like the rest of the world. But we recently looked at plans in Europe in the pancreatic market and are quite encouraged about what the potential is there. So I think we're in this window where we're getting beneficial effects year-on-year, and it will continue in the quarter from Europe. The other choppiness Jackie already spoke to with the real window is as we get new data and these markets expand for ABRAXANE, we see this brand becoming a meaningful top line contributor.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","Just on the generic paclitaxel, I think we feel like we've seen that fully washed out, now that supply has essentially returned to normalcy in the U.S. in Q1. And that was a last half of last year impact.","Mark J. Alles","Absolutely.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","Just on Japan, will we break it out or not? I can't tell you the answer to that today. We continue to look at it and try to tailor our disclosures to best mirror how we manage the business and what we think informs you best about the business. So we'll continue to have a look at that. Not only is Japan develops, the rest of the world market portfolio develops as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Birchenough from BMO Capital Markets.","Nicholas Abbott - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","This is Nick standing in for Jim. A couple of questions. The first one is, you mentioned the publications on the 3 front line REVLIMID trials. I'm wondering, do you know, is an editorial being written to go with those trials? And if so, who's writing it? And then a couple of pipeline questions. First one on ABRAXANE. Obviously, melanoma and pancreatic cancer are tough tumors, and I know that you've been beefing up designs around SPARC. Is there a plan to validate Spark as a biomarker in these trials if the overall data, the ITT data, does not support or is not as positive as you want? And then last one on the DLC-001 trial. We believe that trial was trying to show a benefit in the A, B, C phenotype of lymphoma, which obviously has a higher net medical need. Since you've now expanded that into Phase III, is it focused now on A, B, C or on all comers?","Mark J. Alles","On the publication front, our awareness is very, very superficial about the timing, but we're very sure of what we said in March. We have no information whatsoever about editorials or not. We know that it is customary for publications of this importance to be accompanied by editorials, but we don't have specific knowledge one way or the other. With respect to then the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma environment, I know that Bob mentioned that before. But I'll just make the observation that REVLIMID's activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma has been validated across the general population through our Phase II program. And this initial program is demonstrating, we think, good evidence that there is a difference by phenotype, and we want to exploit that difference.","Robert J. Hugin","And I think as we move into the Phase III trial, we're optimistic that at ASH, we'll be able to have some of this data available to look at the overall marketplace, as Mark mentioned, and the differentiated opportunities in the GCB, non-GCB.","Nicholas Abbott - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And then any comments on SPARC?","Robert J. Hugin","Both the melanoma and the pancreatic studies were both initiated, the Phase III studies, prior to our acquiring Abraxis. So those studies are well along and obviously completed enrollment. Going forward, we have, as you mentioned, significant work going on with major centers that focus on this research. The ability to validate a specific biomarker for a regulatory purpose or a marketing opportunity is still not clear, but it's something that we have a lot of interest in and we're advancing over these coming months.","Mark J. Alles","So the shorter version of how we would look at it is SPARC seems to be perhaps more important in pancreatic cancer, where that study will allow for a more complete exploration of this as a biomarker. But I think as Bob said, we're in different positions than the other disease categories. So I think pancreatic cancer is an area that we would really seek to determine that as a direct factor for benefit.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ravi Mehrotra from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ravi Mehrotra - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Probably a question for Jackie. On medium-term perspective, so 2013, 2014, the U.S. REVLIMID, specifically, how confident are you that you can deliver double-digit growth just on the MM indication?","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","We're very confident.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike King from Rodman & Renshaw.","Michael G. King - Rodman & Renshaw, LLC, Research Division","Nick had asked my question about lymphoma, but as long as you've let me jump in here, let me ask about sort of longer-term strategy with regard to lymphoma. I'm just looking at what you guys are doing from a business development standpoint with Avila back in March and now with Epizyme. I'm just wondering, are you guys thinking in a long-term basis that most of your indications, whether it be lymphoma and myeloma, et cetera, are going to be within oral -- all oral drug combination? Or do you still think that the best way forward is going to be with -- being on the back of antibodies like rituximab?","Mark J. Alles","It's Mark. I mean, it's a very important question you're asking, I think, even though it was not your original question. Lymphoma is an area of still high unmet medical need, particularly in the subsets. One of the things that we are, as I said, very anxious to see at ASCO is the validation of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, so called ADCC. Because I think our view long term is that the combination of REVLIMID and oral therapy with an anti-CD20 play, in this case, rituximab or a biosimilar over time, what we could see happen is that we would get rid of chop or the traditional chemotherapy that is usually the base for Rituxan-based therapy. So if I look longer term, it would be that an immunomodulatory drug with a monoclonal antibody targeting, in this case, CD20, would be the play that would get rid of finally these toxic, very old chemotherapies and improve not only response rates and other outcomes but really get rid of toxicity. So I think that's the play.","Michael G. King - Rodman & Renshaw, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then does Btk fit into that? And when might we see the first trials of the Avila Btk inhibitor?","Robert J. Hugin","Well, we're moving very quickly on that front, and we're working -- we've approved internally clinical development plan already. And we're initialing trials, and the combinations certainly are going to be underway in 2012.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","Operator, I think we've got time for 1 more question. And Ravi, I didn't mean to be cute. I think that all the dynamics that Mark highlighted today with respect to the potential for continued share gains in the U.S. and what we're seeing in terms of the dynamics there, what we think is going to happen with the publications and all the rest put us in a very good place in multiple myeloma in the U.S. for 2013 and 2014 and beyond. So just to make sure that we clarify that. And operator, if we could have 1 more question, please.","Operator","Our final question comes from Matt Roden from UBS.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","One of your near-term events here is ABRAXANE Phase III data in metastatic melanoma. This is a rapidly changing therapeutic category. So if successful, where do you think that ABRAXANE would fit into this treatment paradigm? What kind of data do you think it would take to become a highly attractive competitor in that category? Just trying to get a sense for how you view that opportunity.","Mark J. Alles","Matt, it's Mark, and of course, Bob, Jackie should jump in as well. You actually positioned it nicely. Finally, after decades, metastatic melanoma has a B-Raf inhibitor and the ipilimumab from BMS. So in back-to-back years, we have survival in this disease. What we think is important with ABRAXANE is that it could become the base chemotherapy for patients who are either in a combination approach or one could even imagine for certain subsets, maybe it's now a 3-drug combination versus 2. So I think the first important step is the readout of the data. We internally have gated it to say if we achieve PFS with a trend to OS, we have 1 strategy. If we achieve PFS and overall survival, we, of course, would accelerate our regulatory strategy around that. But no matter what, what you're describing is high academic interest in ABRAXANE beating dacarbazine, much like ipilimumab and the B-Raf inhibitor did. And on that basis, the combination studies would go forward.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","Thank you very much. For anybody who is still in the queue, sorry that we are running up on 1.5 hours here and need to stop the call. So thanks very much for being on the call today, and we will speak with you soon.","Robert J. Hugin","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's conference. You may all disconnect, and have a wonderful day."],"3787":["Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) Q2 2012 Earnings Call July 26, 2012  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Patrick Flanigan","Robert J.

[Operator Instructions] I would like to remind you that this call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Patrick Flanigan, Vice President of Investor Relations at Celgene.","Patrick Flanigan","Thanks, Ellie, and welcome, everyone, to Celgene Corporation's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. The press release reporting our second quarter results, in addition to the presentation for today's webcast, can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the corporate website at www.celgene.com.","Joining me in the room today with prepared remarks are Bob Hugin, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jackie Fouse, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Alles, who is our Chief Commercial Officer.","As a reminder, during today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements regarding our financial outlook in addition to regulatory and product development plans. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those forecasted. A description of these risks can be found in our most recent 10-Q on file with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we undertake no duty to update or revise them. Finally, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available as part of the earnings release.","I would now like to turn the call over to Bob.","Robert J. Hugin","Thank you, Patrick, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. I appreciate the opportunity to review the results of the second quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year.","The financial results for the quarter were outstanding, highlighted by annual total revenue growth of 16% and 37% growth in non-GAAP earnings per share. Our global commercial teams produced strong results across all geographies. Jackie and Mark will provide greater detail on our financial and commercial performance in a few minutes.","In addition to achieving these excellent commercial results, we advanced key strategic initiatives during the first half of the year. I\u2019ll shortly outline some of the important accomplishments strengthening our hematology and oncology businesses, developing our inflammation immunology franchise and advancing our deep and diverse clinical and research pipeline. We're making investments that position us for sustained long-term growth while we deliver strong near-term financial results.","Based on these results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we're increasing our earnings-per-share guidance $4.80 to $4.85 per share and are reaffirming our full year guidance for total revenue in REVLIMID sales.","Early in the year, we outlined numerous important clinical and regulatory milestones with transformative potential. Let me now review our progress on achieving these milestones. As depicted on this updated slide, we have accomplished a number of important milestones, had a delay in newly-diagnosed myeloma and advanced multiple programs to decision points during the first half of the year.","Pomalidomide is one of the most high-potential assets in our pipeline, and accelerating its development is of tremendous value. During the quarter, we submitted regulatory applications for relapsed refractory multiple myeloma in both the United States and Europe with both applications now under active review. And with the completion of enrollment in both our Phase III myelofibrosis study and MM-003, our international Phase III myeloma study, we expect data from these trials by the end of the year. Pomalidomide has the potential to become a major therapeutic advance for patients and to become our next global hematology blockbuster.","Other hematology programs, including REVLIMID in lymphoma and leukemia, are progressing well. We are on track to submit our sNDA for mantle cell lymphoma in the fourth quarter and expect to complete enrollment of our first Phase III CLL study by the end of the year. In addition, our pivotal registration studies for CC-486, oral azacitidine in AML and MDS are on track to initiate by the end of the year.","Substantial progress is being achieved in our ABRAXANE programs. We are now preparing for launch of ABRAXANE's new indication in non-small cell lung cancer in the United States with FDA approval anticipated in October. We\u2019re also expecting data from our Phase III melanoma study in the next several months and data from our pivotal study in pancreatic cancer in late 2012 or early '13.","Advancing earlier-stage research programs is essential to ensuring sustained long-term growth. Excellent progress has been achieved in multiple early clinical development programs in both oncology and inflammatory diseases. Collaborations have both been added and strengthened with 2 new INDs submitted by our team and our partners with additional new compounds targeted for clinical study by year-end.","Not everything has proceeded as planned. We're disappointed to withdraw our newly diagnosed multiple myeloma application for REVLIMID in Europe. We accept responsibility for this delay and are ensuring that we learn from it. We're confident in the strength and importance of the data from MM-015, IFM and CALGB studies and intend to resubmit our European application as soon as the maturity of the data allows.","We continue to execute our regulatory strategy for REVLIMID in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma in other markets. In May, we submitted our application in Switzerland, and in the coming months, we'll submit applications in Australia and other markets. The timing and scope of the U.S. filing is under review.","As we announced on July 12, our first pivotal study in psoriatic arthritis with apremilast produced positive results. Apremilast holds the promise of a new global therapeutic franchise for Celgene. I'll spend a few minutes to provide my perspective on the progress of this program. And let me assure you that we are very excited about the positive results from our initial psoriatic arthritis pivotal study, PALACE-1.","PALACE-1, which enrolled 504 patients with active psoriatic arthritis, compared placebo to 20-milligram BID and, for the first time in psoriatic arthritis patients, 30-milligram BID doses of apremilast also. Patients were entered on the study with or without oral DMARD background therapy. As we reported, statistical significance was achieved for the primary endpoint, ACR20, for both the 20-milligram and 30-milligram doses at week 16. Additionally, the clinical effectiveness of apremilast in treating patients with active psoriatic arthritis was demonstrated by the consistent, statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements seen across all measures of signs and symptoms and physical function. These included secondary endpoints such as ACR50, ACR70, DAS28 and measures of physical functions such HAQ-DI and SF-36 at week 16 and 24. We saw a dose response in efficacy between the apremilast arms, while the overall safety profile of both doses was comparable and favorable. Severe adverse event and dropout rates due to adverse events were similar between the apremilast arms and placebo. Additionally, no new safety signals were observed in the trial. The overall incidence of adverse events was lower than in the Phase II program.","We have made exceptional progress with our apremilast Phase III programs. PALACE-2 and PALACE-3 will report top line results in the next 2 to 3 months and, together with PALACE-1, will be the backbone of our initial registration package in the United States with a submission targeted in the first half of next year. As a reminder, the population of these 3 studies targeted patients with active psoriatic arthritis who had been previously treated with DMARD, including biologic DMARD and patients who have previously failed the TNF alpha blocker were also allowed in the studies. PALACE-3 includes a large subset of patients with significant skin involvement with psoriasis.","We're also pleased to announce that we have recently completed enrollment in PALACE-4, our apremilast monotherapy study in psoriatic arthritis patients not previously treated with any DMARDs. This study is an important component of our label expansion strategy, and when completed, the full PALACE program will cover all psoriatic arthritis patients in need of therapy.","Moving to psoriasis, we expect to have top line results in late 2012 or early 2013 for these ESTEEM program and, if positive, then submit our NDA for moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis in the second half of 2013. Our European submission, which will include all 4 PALACE studies, as well as the ESTEEM studies in psoriasis, is also targeted for the second half of 2013.","We're accelerating our other clinical development efforts with apremilast. Our ankylosing spondylitis Phase III study in over 450 patients was initiated in April, and we expect enrollment to be completed within the next year.","Our European apremilast biologic comparative trial in psoriasis patients will initiate in the next few months, as will our Japanese registration program in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.","We're also awaiting results from a pilot Phase II study of apremilast monotherapy in rheumatoid arthritis to finalize our plans for further development of RA later this year. Dissemination of the results of our clinical studies to the medical community is a high priority. We look forward to the presentation of the PALACE program data in an upcoming medical meeting later this year and additional PALACE and ESTEEM data at medical meetings throughout 2013.","Apremilast has the potential to satisfy a major unmet medical need in a number of inflammatory and immunological diseases. There's a significant market opportunity for a safe and effective oral therapy for the approximately 7 million patients globally suffering from psoriatic arthritis, moderate to severe psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis. Safe, effective and oral treatment options are extremely limited for these patients.","As we said in January, 2012 is a year of potentially transformational milestones for Celgene across our entire portfolio. We continue to make great progress and look forward to updating you on the outcome of the many important inflection points that are expected over the coming weeks and months as we continue to deliver on the promise of our pipeline for our company and the patients we serve.","Let me now turn the call over to Jackie.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Before I start, as a quick reminder, my comments today are focused on non-GAAP financial information, and the full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP figures can be found in the appendices to the slide deck posted for this webcast.","The Celgene team delivered great results across the board in the quarter. We produced strong total revenue and individual product sales growth while increasing both our operating and net profit margins. The quality of our growth is extremely high, as it is driven by volume increases and operating efficiencies. The combination of strong revenue growth and P&L leverage allowed us to grow year-over-year non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter by 37%, more than twice our 16% revenue growth. This strong earnings per share performance has driven us to increase our full year EPS guidance by $0.05, and we have narrowed the EPS range given that we are halfway through this year and also feel that we have relatively good visibility on the drivers of our performance for the second half of the year. We are maintaining our revenue guidance. I will discuss the details of our guidance in a moment.","Both total revenues and product sales grew 16% in Q2 on a year-over-year basis. Each of these grew a strong 7.3% on a sequential basis compared to Q1 of this year. As we will see in a moment when we look at product sales, REVLIMID growth was excellent at 17.4% year-over-year and 8.5% sequentially.","The quality of our revenue growth is very high with over 87%, or 14 percentage points of the 16 percentage points year-over-year growth, coming from volume increases for our products. Price had a net positive impact of 3 percentage points, and foreign currency, net of hedge results, had a small net negative impact of 1 percentage point. As a reminder, on currency, our largest exposures are to the euro and the Japanese yen, and we hedged the amount of our estimated operating profit exposure to those currencies. We execute the hedges against our revenues, thereby limiting the amount of volatility throughout our P&L from currency fluctuations. The net impact of currency on our operating profit is negligible.","As we grew revenues, we also leveraged expenses to produce higher operating and net profit margins. This powerful combination of top line growth and P&L leverage drove earnings per share growth of 37% for Q2 on a year-over-year basis to $1.22 for the quarter.","As with revenue growth, the quality of our earnings-per-share growth is very high. 70% of EPS growth came from operating income growth, 26 points of our 37-percentage-point growth. The remaining 30% came from the combination of a lower effective tax rate and reduced share count.","Turning to individual product sales. We're extremely pleased with REVLIMID's performance in Q2 as the product reached $934 million for the quarter and grew by over 17% on a year-over-year basis and 8.5% sequentially. Growth was excellent both in the U.S. and outside the U.S., and Mark will cover those details a bit more in his comments. The majority of REVLIMID's growth came from market share and duration gains around the world.","VIDAZA continues to solidify its strong position outside the U.S. with year-over-year international growth of 35%. The product is also performing well in the U.S., despite its loss of exclusivity over 1 year ago, and global VIDAZA growth came in at 24% year-over-year and a strong 8.1% sequentially. ABRAXANE is evolving on a positive trajectory and posted strong global 16% year-over-year growth and 5% sequential growth. As a reminder, both VIDAZA and ABRAXANE international growth rates can be impacted in any given period by distributor ordering patterns.","Regarding inventory, in Q1, we told you that inventory issues negatively impacted REVLIMID by about $15 million to $20 million in that quarter, out of a total global negative impact for all products of $25 million to $30 million. In Q2, we saw approximately $8 million of positive inventory impact on REVLIMID for the quarter out of a $10 million total impact for all products.","Moving on through some of the key line items in our P&L. Product gross margins improved to 94.8%, driven by favorable revenue mix. Compared to the second quarter of 2011, the significant increase in gross margin is partly due to a decrease in VIDAZA royalties after the product's loss of exclusivity in the U.S. in May of 2011. R&D as a percentage of revenue declined 50 basis points for the year-over-year comparison and increased 80 basis points sequentially, as we had Avila expenses in for the full quarter in Q2 versus only 3 weeks in Q1. We continue to see nice leverage in SG&A expense on both a year-over-year and sequential basis with declines of 160 and 180 basis points, respectively. This P&L leverage allowed us to grow operating profit by 26% on a year-over-year basis and improve operating margin to 47.8% for the quarter. Our effective tax rate remains at 16.5% for this quarter and represents a 250-basis-point improvement over the same period last year.","On a year-to-date basis, we see that we are tracking for 2012 to continue the favorable evolution of expenses downward as a percentage of revenues, a trend that we have seen over the past few years as the Celgene business model develops globally. Driven by that leverage and growth in revenues, we are delivering an ever-improving industry-leading operating profit margin that reached 47% for the year-to-date first 6 months of 2012 and 47.8% for Q2.","The Celgene business model generated almost $1 billion of net cash from operations during the first half of 2012. We deployed some of that cash flow to business development activities, including the Avila acquisition in Q1 and the Epizyme and Inhibrx transactions in Q2. We also continue to actively use our share repurchase program in Q2, and with the $2.5 billion additional authorization we received from our board in June, we had just over $3 billion of authorization open at the end of June. Since its inception, we have repurchased about $3.3 billion of our own shares under our buyback program, and we continue to actively use the program on an ongoing basis.","We saw a favorable development during the quarter regarding accounts receivable collections in certain jurisdictions in Europe, and I would particularly highlight the fact that we received over $150 million from Spain during Q2. Our day sales outstanding improved in several countries across Europe over the course of the quarter.","Driven by continuously increasing profit margins, combined with strong balance sheet and capital structure management, we are producing higher returns on invested capital, a trend we expect to sustain. This metric is based on the more conservative GAAP operating income numbers, and you can find its calculation in the reconciliation tables accompanying our webcast slides.","Regarding our outlook for the full year, we reaffirm our revenue guidance for both revenues -- total revenues and REVLIMID revenues at $5.4 billion to $5.6 billion and $3.75 billion to $3.85 billion, respectively or growth of 15% and 19%. In light of our strong P&L performance for the first half of this year and our view of the business drivers we see for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our EPS guidance to $4.80 to $4.85 and narrowing the range. At the midpoint of this range, our EPS growth would be about 27%.","We continue to expect R&D expense as a percentage of revenues to come in at about 25% for the full year, including the Avila acquisition, and SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues to be about 21%. We expect the effective tax rate to be 16.5% for the year, and our EPS guidance assumes a weighted average share count of about 445 million shares.","To summarize, we are very happy with our strong revenue growth in Q2 and our even stronger profit and EPS growth. Not only are our growth rates strong, but the quality of the growth is also very high as it is volume- and efficiency-driven. This growth is fueling improved returns on invested capital, even as we continue to invest for the long-term health of our business. Our performance to date reinforces our confidence in our ability to achieve and exceed our original EPS guidance for 2012, and we, therefore, raised our full year earnings outlook by $0.05.","We look forward to a strong second half of this year with respect to our financial performance, and we are very excited about the numerous milestones and catalysts still to come between now and year-end.","Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Mark.","Mark J. Alles","Thanks very much, Jackie. Good morning, everyone. As you heard from Bob and Jackie, Celgene made excellent progress during the quarter, advancing our products for unmet medical needs in cancer and immune inflammatory diseases, while delivering record operating results. My comments will focus on second quarter product sales, important drivers for continued top line growth and some insights into our expected near-term commercial launches.","First half 2012 total net product sales were $2,582,000,000, 17% growth compared with the first half of last year. We generated record second quarter net product sales of $1,334,000,000, representing sequential quarterly growth of 7% and 16% year-on-year. We remain confident that significant drivers of short and long-term sales growth are intact, including the resubmission of the REVLIMID newly diagnosed multiple myeloma regulatory dossier for CHMP, EMEA consideration. The timing for resubmission is dependent on longer-term follow-up and should become clearer by year-end. We are making important progress for the planned, early 2013 launch of pomalidomide for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, and we are making equally good progress preparing for the U.S. launch of ABRAXANE as the newest treatment for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Clearly, these pomalidomide and ABRAXANE marketing approvals represent 2 major near-term catalysts for significant business growth.","Second quarter 2012 total REVLIMID sales were $934 million, an increase of $73 million over the first quarter. This represents 8% quarter-on-quarter and 17% year-on-year growth. REVLIMID sales growth was balanced across our core markets. In the United States, sales were $537 million, up 10% quarter-on-quarter and 17% year-on-year. Total REVLIMID sales in our international markets were $397 million, up 7% quarter-on-quarter and 18% year-on-year. Quarter-on-quarter REVLIMID share of the U.S. and European myeloma markets was consistent, and we again realized improved duration of therapy. In Japan, REVLIMID market share expansion in second line myeloma and improved duration of therapy were particularly strong indicators of accelerating sales performance.","The recent publication of the REVLIMID MM-015, CALGB and IFM newly diagnosed and maintenance studies in the New England Journal of Medicine add significantly to the substantial amount of existing clinical evidence supporting patient treatment, new Phase III clinical trial concepts and the development of novel agents in combination with REVLIMID as the backbone of care. This level of peer-reviewed data should serve to strengthen the overall REVLIMID value proposition for patients, hematologists and payers.","Expanding our global commercial opportunity for REVLIMID in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma remains one of our most important objectives. Clinical follow-up on the results of MM-015, CALGB and IFM studies continues. And our Phase III MM-020 study remains blinded, pending the predefined number of progression events.","Beyond continued geographic expansions to markets such as Russia, Brazil, Mexico, China and South Korea, opportunities to better define the emerging role of REVLIMID for the treatment of lymphoma and leukemia should come into focus later this year. Important validation of REVLIMID and lymphoma should come from our mantle cell-001 Phase II study, we expect the MCL-001 studies to be available in time for this year's American Society of Hematology meeting and we plan to submit the sNDA for this indication by year-end. As you know, this is a Special Protocol Assessment Trial. Given new and updated data on the combination of REVLIMID and Rituxan in relapsed follicular lymphoma, we are evaluating a number of strategies potentially to realize regulatory approvals for this novel, biological regimen. In CLL, our REVLIMID pivotal Phase III study, CLL-008, comparing REVLIMID to chlorambucil as first-line therapy in elderly patients, is on track to complete accrual by late this year. We consider this study to be our key trial leading to global marketing approvals and standard of care status for REVLIMID in this important segment of the CLL market. Other studies include CLL-002, our REVLIMID maintenance trial and combinations in development with Rituxan and the new Btk inhibitors.","Since the late 1990s, clinical progress in multiple myeloma has been remarkable. Unfortunately, myeloma remains incurable and fatal for almost all patients, making the need for active and safe products for heavily pretreated patients very obvious. In the development of pomalidomide in relapsed refractory myeloma, we have accelerated dramatically. In the second quarter, the results of MM-002 allowed us to submit marketing applications to both U.S. and European regulatory agencies, and the pivotal international Phase III study, MM-003 study, reached its accrual target of just over 400 patients.","Given our progress and confidence in pomalidomide, Celgene is immediately allowing patient access through the PEXIUS program, or the Pomalidomide Expanded Access Program in the United States, and through the just approved and reimbursed access program in France known as the cohort ATU or Temporary Use Authorization. We continue to plan for clinical and commercial success with pomalidomide in myelofibrosis.","Second quarter VIDAZA sales were a record $201 million. Sequential quarterly sales grew 8% with strong year-on-year growth of 24%. In the U.S., sequential quarterly sales increased by 12% to $82 million and 12% year-on-year. Second quarter international VIDAZA sales grew to $119 million, up 6% quarter-on-quarter and 25% year-on-year. We expect new markets and increasing market share, plus duration of treatment in those existing markets, to drive improved international VIDAZA sales.","We continually work to optimize and leverage our global MDS franchise. Our Phase III registration study for VIDAZA in acute myeloid leukemia is advancing and should serve to expand its approved indication to include all categories of patients with AML. Investigator interest to conduct research with CC-486, or oral azacitidine, is very high with 2 specific strategies under active consideration. The first seeks to develop CC-486 for a subset of low-risk MDS, and the other will test CC-486 as maintenance therapy following transplantation or other induction therapy for AML. We expect a positive regulatory recommendation in Europe for REVLIMID in the treatment of low-risk, transfusion-dependent deletion 5q MDS by year-end.","Turning to ABRAXANE. Second quarter ABRAXANE sales were $110 million. This is our fourth consecutive quarter with sales greater than $100 million. These consistent results provide a solid base for increased growth from geographic expansion and new commercial opportunities we would realize following regulatory approvals for non-small cell lung cancer and positive Phase III data and marketing approvals in melanoma, pancreatic cancer and, perhaps, other solid tumors.","The PDUFA date for FDA to complete its review of ABRAXANE in the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer is October 12. We are in the very advanced phases of commercial launch planning, and I would like to take just a few minutes to provide some perspective on this market opportunity.","For context, please remember that in the United States, more people die every year from lung cancer than breast, prostate and colorectal cancer combined. Non-small cell lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the world with more than 1 million deaths per year. The 5-year survival rate for patients with Stage III-B and IV lung cancer is less than 10%. In the United States, there are approximately 100,000 people with lung cancer considered treatable with various chemotherapy regimens. Most often, treatment decisions are made on the basis of the histological categories of non-squamous or squamous. Our proposed indication for ABRAXANE is for all Stage III-B and IV patients, but there may be differentiated market adoption in elderly patients with non-squamous histology and, potentially, in the majority of patients with disease histologically classified as squamous.","We are pleased with our second quarter results. Sequential quarterly net product sales grew by 7% and 16% year-on-year. The leading indicators of product performance are on track with our sales forecasts. We are beginning to more fully realize the commercial benefit of geographic expansion with several major new markets expected to come online over the next 6 to 12 months.","I'd like to conclude by thanking our global commercial team for the second quarter and first half 2012 sales results. We are committed to executing and delivering on our full year operating plan.","Thank you very much, and I'd like to turn the call back to Bob.","Robert J. Hugin","Thank you, Mark. We're energized by our progress to-date and the promise and potential of our key programs. We're focused on our near-term objectives, which position us to achieve multiple clinical and regulatory milestones throughout the remainder of the year while delivering on our revenue and earnings guidance. We're committed to producing exceptional results and to discovering, developing, delivering breakthrough therapies for patients in need around the world. Our operating momentum is strong as we continue to execute on our business model.","Thank you very much. Operator, let's open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Yaron Werber of Citi.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So maybe it's a question for Mark, and relating to REVLIMID, certainly. Give us a little bit of a sense, kind of what are you seeing in terms of international growth? Where is the growth coming from? Is it growing in Europe? Or is it mostly coming from the rest of the world? And specifically, what drove sort of the reversal in the U.S. with REVLIMID? I mean, inventory is a part of it. I'm trying to get a sense, kind of organically, if you correct for the inventory last quarter and this quarter, what would've been the quarter-over-quarter growth?","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","Yaron, it's Jackie. Let me just jump in quickly on the inventory and then pass it to Mark. I mean, that's why I included that in my comments to make it very clear. So, back in Q1, we talked about the impact on REVLIMID at about $15 million to $20 million. Post that discussion, we talked about a particular transaction that we thought, in the M&A space, had an impact there, as well as the overall channel inventory levels, and we talked about how the channel maybe become somewhat more efficient over time. Then in Q2, I told you, everybody that we would let you know what the inventory impact was. We did see it be $8 million positive, again, versus the $15 million to $20 million negative in Q1. We think that inventory levels across all products now, including REVLIMID, are what we would consider to be at relatively \"normal levels\" for the channel in the U.S. And so, let's just be very clear about what the impact was in Q2 of $8 million. So we did not see the entire impact from Q1 come back in Q2. We did not expect that we would. The channel may become a little bit more efficient. Over time, we think the levels are probably relatively stable now. So with respect to the commercial dynamics, let me let Mark take that up.","Mark J. Alles","Yaron, so we saw balanced growth in REVLIMID across all our core markets. Europe, across-the-board, was stronger. France, a little bit better. We talked about the impact last year going back to some of the issues in the French market that were relatively unique and, perhaps, exaggerated. But Latin America, Japan, core markets in Europe and the U.S. were all up sequentially. Please remember in the U.S., we spoke to the Q1 dynamic of a very strong jump in new patient starts. We saw that share gain. We continued with that share gain through Q2, and we find ourselves in a position where demand on a TRx basis, so total prescriptions, and duration really combined across-the-board, perhaps a little bit better in the U.S. than other markets in the world, to deliver a solid quarter.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","But so if you back into it, it looks like it's a 4% to 5% quarter-over-quarter growth in the U.S. x inventory. Does that make sense?","Mark J. Alles","No, I wouldn't characterize it that way. I think that there are ongoing dynamics that will grow sequential growth in different manners. But I think when you put the business together, we had, in the U.S., a fairly consistent performance, and now, we've seen a very nice growth rate quarter-on-quarter. That's all.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","Well, I think, Yaron, if you look at the -- the sequential growth in the U.S. was around 10%.","Mark J. Alles","Well, it's up 10%. That's the point.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","So even if you adjust for the $8 million of inventory and assume that, that was all in the U.S., I think you get very strong sequential growth that's much higher than in the 4% or 5%...","Mark J. Alles","It's still in the 6% range or better if you did all of the changes, but it's very strong.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","No, what I'm thinking is that you took about $15 million to $20 million out of the channel in Q1, so if you add that in, because that was organic demand, and then you take out the $8 million this quarter, you get 4% to 5% quarter-over-quarter.","Mark J. Alles","Yes, I think, again, if mechanically, you want to do the math that way, it's fine. But I think as Jackie pointed out, channel management, quarter-by-quarter, on a brand now that is above $500 million in U.S. alone, will present either a buying pattern that's better or worse at the end of different quarters. So, the demand picture is solid, scripts are up, duration is up and we delivered in the U.S. and around the world a very strong REVLIMID performance.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum of the ISI Group.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Jackie, just on your guidance you took up -- you obviously took up EPS, but you didn't change revenue. I'm just wondering what, in the P&L, in your internal forecast, has changed. And the second was, what's your current view on potentially partnering apremilast? I know you're probably in the early stages thinking about that, but any comments would be helpful.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","So just with respect to EPS, you've got the revenue driver, and then you've got all, obviously, all of the expense drivers. So you might think about how we try to put our forecast together in that regard and whether we're conservative or not. But we left the revenue guidance fairly broad and are maintaining that because that's where we think that we\u2019ll come in. But we -- given the visibility that we have a little bit more on the expense side and how we\u2019ve performed to-date for the first half of the year, we feel like we're able to take that earnings guidance up at this time, until extremely confident in our ability to deliver that guidance. You may also remember that we did not change our original EPS guidance when we did the Avila acquisition. So we have absorbed those expenses. They\u2019re now fully in the P&L, and we'll have them from now on. And then in the second half of the year, we do have some launch costs foreseeing for the lung indication and a little bit of a prelaunch activity for pomalidomide as we expect to move towards an approval in February of next year. So we're just thinking about all of those things as we pull the overall guidance together.","Robert J. Hugin","And Mark, on apremilast, we're pursuing multiple analyses and strategies. We're engaging in partnering discussions. But until we see the full range of the data, both psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis, we're going to go along the paths of just making sure we understand what the options are so that as we make decisions early next year, we're in the best position to maximize the value of the apremilast franchise. So we're going down all the routes to just keep all our options open, make sure we understand the full data sets that we get. We're very encouraged by what the potential is, and we're going to make sure we maximize the value of the asset for ourselves and our shareholders.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham of JPMorgan.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You guys, last quarter, talked about REVLIMID new starts in the U.S. and how it's been fairly high over the past few months. I want to get a sense for what's really driving this and how sustainable it is. Is it more comfort with the SPM rate as it evolves over time, and do you think that the withdrawal of the European application could have an impact on this vis-\u00e0-vis physician sentiment?","Mark J. Alles","Geoff, it's Mark. I think there are a convergence of factors. We have, as I pointed out, tremendous visibility through the benefit of REVLIMID and myeloma across all the stages of the disease now, whether it's smoldering, induction, maintenance, pure second line, our core indication around the world. There's a lot of confidence, again, in the brand. And I think what we've seen in the last, let's say, 5 to 6 months is that confidence being built back in on a global basis. You asked the question about withdrawing the NDMM application, and I have to tell you that I do think that there is awareness of that, and to some extent, the confidence in the brand, from a physician usage point of view is actually paradoxically stronger because it's hard, sometimes, to reconcile between regulatory review and the clinical interpretation data. So bottom line, there are a lot of basic elements of commercialization, levels of evidence, experience, confidence, leading to improved demand. Duration is always one of those variables that is such a key driver, and to the extent that the SPM question was in the mind of the market over the last 18 months or so, we do believe there's a lot more comfort and confidence that, that issue is largely behind us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rachel McMinn of Bank of America.","Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to talk a little bit more about pomalidomide. Bob, I think you highlighted this as the product with significant or maybe the most potential in your pipeline. Can you talk a little bit more about this? Is this -- where does myelofibrosis fit into that? Do you think pomalidomide is going to be expanding the myeloma market or replacing REVLIMID at a higher price? Just any of the details you can give us on your thoughts.","Robert J. Hugin","I mean, we still have considerable work to do. We expect to see the Phase III data MM-003 by the end of the year, hopefully, at -- presented at ASH. So, we're very encouraged about the potential that pomalidomide has to expand the multiple myeloma market. We do not see it as cannibalizing REVLIMID. We think, in fact, mechanistic work that we've done really looks at the ability of that product to augment our portfolio and strengthen it and not -- and our ability to differentiate them will be, I think, very positive on its impact. And our forecasts are really focused on the myeloma market. We're encouraged by the fact that we're going to be able to -- we're hopeful, to launch in both Europe and the United States in 2013 and have the benefit of that nearly global or 90% of the market opportunity for us where we are today and, obviously, expand it beyond that as quickly as possible. So we see very strong opportunity in myeloma, expanding the marketplace, being a very preferential treatment for relapsed refractory myeloma patients. And in myelofibrosis, we view that very much as an additive opportunity. We have completed the accrual. As soon as the events hit the course, the specified amount, we'll have that data. And once we have that data -- and we're optimistic. We're talking about not just symptoms, but the real, underlying hematological impact of myelofibrosis on patients in dealing with those actual indications of the disease. So when we see that data, we'll be able to provide more guidance on what the opportunity is in myelofibrosis. But just in the myeloma space, our outlook is this will be our next blockbuster in hematology.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Schmidt of Cowen and Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Bob, in terms of apremilast profile and your plans to take this take commercially yourselves potentially, do you think that the drug needs to have efficacy as good as biologics? Or do you think you can win on lesser efficacy but, obviously, better convenience? And then, if I could just sneak in another one, could Mark please provide us the French ATU reimbursement price for pomalidomide?","Robert J. Hugin","On apremilast, just to be clear, we have not made up our strategic decision on how to best commercialize and how to best monetize or maximize the value of apremilast. We're very encouraged by our first pivotal data that we've received, and we\u2019ll receive the second and third trials here in the coming weeks and months and, hopefully by the end of the year, begin to see the psoriasis data. So it's a near-term and very important strategic decision that we have to make. And so we're going to look at all the options available to us to ensure that we do the right thing in terms of the access to patients and maximizing the value of that franchise for us and our shareholders, as I mentioned. In terms of the data, I think that we're encouraged by what we're seeing in terms of what impact it has from an efficacy point of view, what it's going to have from an efficacy point of view, and combined what we've seen on the tolerability and safety profile, that benefit risk, we think, is going to be our opportunity or whoever markets the product, if it's not us, opportunity to really differentiate it and take advantage of what we think is an increasing identification of a tremendous opportunity for oral therapies in newly diagnosed or not heavily pre-treated patients and, potentially, after biologics also. So we think that the data will and has to stand up on its own. And efficacy and safety, when you combine them both, we think the opportunity is great, and we're going to see that all the data in the next 6 months or so.","Mark J. Alles","Just on the ATU price for pomalidomide, we're finalizing that as we speak, so it will become available shortly.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges of Bernstein.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Jackie, you mentioned the payment from Spain, and we've heard this from a number of companies. And I think you said it was about $150 million. Could you tell us how that was incorporated into your revenue recognition? And if it was other than just cash, could you tell us which products you were paid for roughly distributed at across that $150 million?","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","Geoff, there's no impact on revenue recognition, so that was just related to accounts receivable balances that were in our balance sheet where we did have -- we do have small amounts of reserves against those. You can find those in our SEC filings, but they\u2019re very small. And we did not change anything in our reserve accruals, even though we got a payment. So there's no impact on revenues at all. It's only a cash item and a balance sheet item in terms of reducing the accounts receivable. Most of our sales in Spain are from REVLIMID, as you might appreciate. So a big part of that balance would go against that particular product. But in essence, that amount of money essentially paid for receivables that dated 12\/31\/2011 or prior. So it was essentially like a catch-up payment for some of those older receivable balances there. And just on that topic, we also saw improvements across-the-board in Europe in all countries on the days sales outstanding. So we feel quite good about that situation.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ying Huang of Barclays.","Ying Huang - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Number one, if you do resubmit the front line filing in the EU, would it still go through the 210-day standard timeline? And then secondly, in terms of the near-term loss opportunity in front line in Europe, have you thought about more business development opportunities?","Mark J. Alles","It's Mark. Just the front part of the question, with respect to the regulatory procedure on resubmission, this would be considered a new submission, and the process procedure would happen as if we had not filed previously. Bob, on...","Robert J. Hugin","I didn't really\u2026","Mark J. Alles","Sure, the question was, in the second part, because of, as I understood it, perhaps some revenue that is out of our model going forward, given the withdrawal, do we need some M&A activity or would we consider some business development activity to offset?","Robert J. Hugin","So let's be very clear. Our 2012 guidance and our 2015 guidance forecasts, no M&A activity to achieve those targets, and we don't believe that there's any reason for us to be considering any kind of major M&A at this time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Thomas Wei of Jefferies.","Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I had a question just on the European refiling front. We'd just love to get an update on the comment that you made, Mark, on having a much clearer situation by year-end. Can you just remind us again what exactly is all this data that you're going to be getting by year end? And presumably, that means that MM-020, the interim analysis, still on track to have data by then. And then also some sort of analysis of the ongoing front line trials as well, that's all culminating around that year-end mark?","Mark J. Alles","Thomas, it's Mark. So, as you know, MM-015, CALGB and IFM were extremely positive against the primary endpoint of progression-free survival. We think that is a relevant, very important end point, and these studies are extremely positive. The follow-up that is being considered as part of the strategy moving forward is for the maturity of the overall survival events and then the overall event-free and other analyses that would look at the clinical benefit. We believe that, with time, that maturity will give us a picture that allows us and EU regulators to consider the filing again. With respect to MM-020, as I said, it remains blinded, pending progression events, and it is an independent regulatory commercial strategy that we've had to make Rev\/Dex, REVLIMID plus lodus [ph] dexamethasone, a new standard compared with the alkylator regimen, MPT. So while there is some overlap, potentially, of these programs, and we would hope that, eventually, the REVLIMID label would include MPR-R from 015, REVLIMID maintenance therapy post-transplant, and Rev\/Dex as induction for other patients, these are strategies that will move in parallel.","Operator","Our next question comes from Marshall Urist of Morgan Stanley.","Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So just 2 quick things. First, just, Jackie, on the REVLIMID guidance for the year, are you guys still more comfortable at the kind of low to middle of the range, consistent with the previous comments? And then is it possible, was there any benefit of price quarter-on-quarter in terms of just realizing, I think, the late 2011 price increase as that kind of flowed through? Did we get any sequential benefit of that? And then just lastly, any kind of comments would be helpful on the extent of the dose response for the apremilast study that you saw at the higher dose. Can we get some, at least, qualitative comments, on how that looked relative to the 20-milligram dose?","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","On the REVLIMID, I think for right now, we would say we are still comfortable to say that we think that guidance range is more around the middle-ish part of the range that we would expect to come in at. We're very happy with where we are right now. We want to just manage expectations a little bit. On the price side, what you saw in the slides, I think, that I presented in the webcast and my comments, is that year-over-year, for the quarter, the contribution from price was 3 percentage points. So the total growth was 16, of which 14 points were volume, 3 points were price, and that is a global net price impact in total across the portfolio and a small 1 percentage point negative net impact from currency. So most of that contribution from price, or essentially all of it, would come from the U.S. Japan price, essentially flat. In Europe, we continued to see the downward pressure in Europe that we've seen for the past 2 years and have expected and built into our forecasts of kind of that 5% to 6% range in Europe, down overall. And you blend all that together, you get the 3% for the quarter year-over-year comparison.","Mark J. Alles","In the quarter-on-quarter comparison for REVLIMID, there is a very, very small impact on the price increase that flowed through, [indiscernible] to the price increase late last year that flowed through Q1 and into Q2.","Robert J. Hugin","And then on apremilast, obviously, we're looking forward to the presentation of all the data at the medical meeting, but we're encouraged by the dose response. The 20 milligrams certainly met the endpoints that we would seek to achieve in the trial, but what's really encouraging is that we saw the dose response of increased efficacy activity in the 30-milligram twice a day with no difference in the safety profile and basic tolerability, which really will beg the question over time, can we actually increase the dose and will -- is there an increasing dose response above the 30-mg BID? But I think clearly, what we're seeing so far from -- this is the first trial, it's just one, we need more than one trial, is that if we continue to sustain these results, that the 30 milligrams is going to be a very attractive dose to commercialize.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I actually had a question on ABRAXANE. Obviously, some big Phase III readouts coming out over the next 12 months. In pancreatic, specifically, I know you had previously increased the enrollment in that study, if I recall. What are you looking for? What kind of clinical benefit and powering assumptions? How should we think about that study?","Mark J. Alles","Yes, we did increase the sample size from around 550 patients to around 800 patients. So you're correct in that assumption. That was to increase the power to detect an overall survival advantage to 90%. So the clinical benefit in pancreatic cancer of a meaningful improvement at survival is what we look for. This study will -- it'd be very binary. Gemcitabine is the control arm. There's a well-understood profile for that product. The Phase II data that we built this strategy around, using the combination of ABRAXANE plus gemcitabine, is quite, quite strong. So we look for the trial to be positive and for this doublet, ABRAXANE-gemcitabine, to be a major, major benefit for patients with this terrible disease.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ian Somaiya of Piper Jaffray.","M. Ian Somaiya - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I just had questions on apremilast. First, maybe a follow-up to Marshall's question. Can you just confirm that the 2 doses showed a statistically significant benefit at the -- in terms of the ACR20, 50 and 70 measures, it'll be 24? And then the second question, maybe one specific -- maybe one for Mark Alles was, what are the commercial implications for the dampening effect of methotrexate that you pointed out in your press release? And I'm sure there are many patients who would love to get off methotrexate. Just wanted to get your sort of view on that point.","Robert J. Hugin","Just on the first question, it is absolutely accurate that at both 20-milligram and 30-milligram BID, the ACR20, 50 and 70s were statistically significant at 24 weeks.","Mark J. Alles","The methotrexate question, I suppose, the answer is going to be pretty obvious. As the data for apremilast mature, if the use of apremilast differentially from methotrexate or in those patients who have had methotrexate, informs the treatment strategy, I think a lot of the marketplace would like nothing better than to discontinue methotrexate as an old fairly toxic drug. So I think it bodes well for us in regards to how the market would respond.","Robert J. Hugin","And one of the attractions is if the safety profile continues on our subsequent pivotal studies, we really wouldn't anticipate any monitoring of patients, and obviously, methotrexate does require monitoring. So the kind of patient and physician abilities to use apremilast to, as Mark pointed out, it would be a very attractive opportunity to market that. So, we've got a lot more data to gum [ph]. It's an important step for us, and we're very encouraged and excited about the coming months for apremilast.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Roden of UBS.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. You guys highlighted upcoming data and potential registration in mantle cell, diffuse large B cell and CLL. Mark, can you comment on to what extent you see commercial utilization in these segments already? How do you see the incremental opportunity? And then Jackie, can you talk about how these segments factor into the year 2015 targets? And then, just secondly, can you speak to whether or not Brazil is in your REVLIMID guidance? And if you get approval this year, should we expect a Brazil bulk purchase?","Mark J. Alles","Yes, go ahead, Jackie. I'll follow up.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","Let me just start quickly with the targets out to 2015 to set the stage, and Mark will come along on the remainder of the questions. Our targets out to 2015 include a little bit of revenue for the MCL indication because we expect that we can have an approval for that by the end of next year. There's not very much in the model for diffuse large B cell, and there is essentially nothing for CLL because we don't expect those approvals until sometime in the 2014, '15, maybe even '16 timeframes as those roll out in their different variations. So one of the messages is that as REVLIMID continues to expand its indications and move into non-Hodgkin's lymphoma then into CLL, that the most significant part of that growth opportunity is beyond the 2015 timeframe. And we feel very, very good about our ability to deliver the growth targets that we've stated to you out to 2015 without those. So with that, let me let Mark take up the rest of it.","Mark J. Alles","Yes. It's critical that we advance the REVLIMID mantle cell program to have an approval in a subset of lymphoma, which we think will have an opportunity for the product to grow. CLL, same thing. I mean, it's interesting, as I listen to this, there are thousands of patients now who are being studied with REVLIMID and CLL. In fact, there are, I think now, more than 1,000 patients who have been accrued to different clinical trials, yet the marketplace, to your specific question, and its use of REVLIMID in different CLL and NHL populations is still quite low. So I think what Jackie outlined in terms of timing is important to keep in mind. I guess I'll summarize by saying the clinical program is robust, but the upside in CLL and NHL is enormous. It's tremendous. And I think we can really realize that benefit and that potential soon. Brazil, we continue to work very, very aggressively with the regulatory authorities, and we see most of the performance in Brazil into future years. We're working to get regulatory approval and then into reimbursement approval over the next 6 to 10 months, depending on the regulatory procedures. So Brazil is up slightly, the numbers as well.","Operator","And our final question comes from Chris Raymond of Robert Baird.","Christopher J. Raymond - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Jackie, I just wanted to see if I could better understand the share count assumptions going forward. In the slide pack, you say that we should assume a constant share count to year-end 2011, but you're sizably down in Q2 from that, and by our count, I think you've got, what, $3.2 billion left in the authorized repurchase. So can you maybe talk about really what's embedded there?","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","So if I'm not mistaken, and I think you'll see all the numbers either in the reconciliation tables or when we file the Q, but just as a reminder, the weighted average fully diluted share count for Q1 was 448.6 million. For Q2, it was 445.4 million. Again, that's the weighted average. So when you think about the evolution of that for the remainder of the year and run through some scenarios on what the weighted average calculation on a fully diluted basis would be for the full year, that comes back to my comment about the 445 million assumption that gets you to our EPS guidance range of $4.80 to $4.85. And then, you can make some assumptions around that about how you think we will use the program from now until the end of the year and what impact that would have. And I would just reiterate that we actively use the program but would like to leave you to run those different scenarios. But I think if you take the 445 million in context with the first 2 quarters experienced for the year and use that as the assumption, you'll understand at least how we've constructed our guidance. And then you can make your own inferences about the potential scenarios around that.","Thank you very much, everybody.

It\u2019s a long list of parties, and we'll follow up with you immediately after this call.

Product sales grew 19% year-over-year compared to our original guidance of 16% and adjusted EPS grew 24% year-over-year compared to our original guidance of 19%.","Now this strong performance was driven by a combination of significant growth across the product portfolio and substantial leverage in the P&L that resulted in the 220 basis point improvement in the adjusted operating margin.","Our focus on operational excellence extends beyond delivering near-term financial performance, it also includes making the appropriate investments to optimize the commercial opportunities of our inline product, investing wisely to advance our pipeline with leading technologies and enhancing our internal programs and capabilities through collaborations with the best biotech partners in the industry.","This last point is critical. Our top strategic priority is to both deliver on our current potential while at the same time, building a world-class, sustainable growth engine that will propel our performance beyond 2020. Now let's discuss the financial results for the quarter and the year.","Our fourth quarter total net less grew 19% compared to prior year and we're especially proud to have exceeded $2 billion in quarterly net sales for the first time in Q4.","For the full year, total net product sales also grew 19% and accelerated compared to prior year-over-year comparison. We had a diverse set of drivers that supported this exceptional performance including the global role out of POMALYST\/IMNOVID for myeloma and ABRAXANE for pancreatic cancer.","The U.S. launch of OTEZLA for psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis and overall strong sales for REVLIMID driven by extended duration of treatment in both the U.S. and Europe.","Our evolving product portfolio enjoyed broad-based success in Q4 and really throughout 2014. Beginning with our flagship product REVLIMID, full year net product sales grew over 16% and approached $5 billion.","Three of our products ABRAXANE, POMALYST\/IMNOVID and OTEZLA combined for a full year net product sales of approximately $1.6 billion reflecting a 67% year-over-year increase.","Growth was primarily volume driven as we continue to launch these products globally. Collectively these three products contributed almost half of the incremental increase in net product sales for the year.","In the fourth quarter, net product sales growth was indeed primarily driven by volume. The volatility in the foreign exchange markets toward the end of the year drove approximately a $25 million Q4 unfavorable impact to total net product sales resulting in a negative 1.4 percentage point impact to growth.","For the full year For-Ex really had a negligible impact on net product sales growth. Volume accounted for 15.7 percentage points of the 18.9 percentage point year-over-year growth, while price added a 3.4 percentage point benefit. So it's worth noting that for both Q4 and full year, pricing was a relatively minor driver of revenue growth across our products.","Adjusted earnings per share growth accelerated in both the fourth quarter and full year compared to 2013. We continue to drive our leverage P&L as earnings growth outpaced revenue growth.","Even with this strong P&L management as I mentioned earlier, we made significant investments throughout the year. These investments led to an approximately $400 million increase in combined R&D and SG&A expense in 2014, which is a 13% year-over-year growth.","Included in R&D, our investments in new clinical programs and medical affairs initiative in additions to the expansion of our early research and drug develop discovery capability.","Beyond our internal programs during the fourth quarter we paid $21 million in milestone and extension payments to partners for advancing our external programs. This compares to $52 million during the same period in 2013. We're pleased with the early success of our partner programs and the potential contribution they could have on our longer term outlook.","On the SG&A line, we are seeing considerable leverage on G&A expenses. They are offset by meaningful investments in our global commercial capabilities for example building out our global commercial INI franchise and supporting the global launches in our hematology and oncology franchise.","We expect these commercial investments to be leveraged going forward as ABRAXANE, POMALYST\/IMNOVID, and OTEZLA sales continue to ramp up globally.","Finally the effective tax rate improved by 80 basis points for the full year, mostly due to favorable geographic mix. In addition during the fourth quarter we realized the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. R&D tax credit.","In the fourth quarter, earnings growth was largely driven by operating income with the modest benefit from a lower tax rate and share count. Full year, our earnings growth was also high quality based largely on operating income, which accounted for $0.71 of the $0.73 per share increase year-over-year.","The gains from the improved tax rate and the favorable cumulative impact of our share purchase program were offset by increased financial expenses associated with our May 2014 $2.5 billion debt offering and our hedging program.","Our global business is dynamic and generated operating cash flow of $2.8 billion a 26% increase over prior year. The strength of our cash flow generation provides significant financial flexibility.","Throughout the course of last year we completed our strategic acquisition of GED-301 additionally we invested $454 million in upfront payments for new collaborations and expansion of existing collaborations. And finally we optimized our capital structure with a strong share repurchase of over $2.9 billion.","So to complete the picture of our financial performance we assess return on invested capital both including and excluding cash in the capital base. The overall trend is favorable with improving returns realized during the 2008 to 2014 timeframe.","Now earlier this month we provided 2015 guidance and we provided a new prospective on our long term financial target this time through 2020. This outlook continues the very strong topline and leverage bottom line outlook for Celgene.","It is based on the outstanding strength of our flagship commercial product, the emerging potential of their broaden indications and our high potential pipeline of the new products.","Focusing on 2015, we expect total net product sales between $9 billion to $9.5 billion a 22% year-over-year increase based on the midpoint of that range. Our guidance is based on For-Ex rates established over one week period last December that includes an expected a negative currency impact approaching $100 million for the year.","We have a diverse product portfolio with multiple drivers for the topline. In a table attached to this presentation summarizes the other key elements of our expected 2015 P&L. Finally I would like to convey a few thoughts on the quarterly progression of the annual guidance.","As you know during Q1 we typically have a higher gross adjustment with REVLIMID and POMALYST due to early Medicare donut hole and other ACA payments and we expect the same pattern in 2015. Accordingly, we expect Q1 earnings to be about 21% to 22% of the full year guidance.","Now the operational and financial achievements we had in 2014 in addition to the momentum we are seeing in the early part of 2015 has enabled to us to provide a longer term outlook to 2020.","Our presentation of these targets earlier this month was careful detailed drivers of our performance to 2017 and 2020 for each franchise and it noted the potential drivers that are not included in these targets. This presentation is available on our website under the IR section.","We currently forecast over $20 billion in net product sales reflecting in 18% compound annual growth rate. Importantly 15 percentage points of this growth were $17 billion of 2020 sales is from existing products and drivers that are already understood, such as the newly diagnosed multiple myeloma opportunity with REVLIMID, the continued global role out POMALYST\/IMNOVID, OTEZLA, and ABRAXANE.","The remaining three points of growth includes risk adjusted estimate of what we will achieve separately from eight labeled expansions and six new product introductions.","Now this target is not assumed that each of these programs needs to be successful in order for the $3 billion target to be achieved. Finally and importantly across our portfolio of pipeline and partner assets there is an additional level of optionality as there are at least 17 identified opportunities that are possible in this timeframe and we provide upside to our $20 billion target.","Our adjusted EPS target is to achieve over $12.50 per share which represents a 23% compound annual growth rate from 2014 to 2020. Please think of this earnings growth as primarily operationally driven.","For example as we compared this outlook we assumed as a planning convention, a constant share count, a constant effective tax rate and there are other income and expense line will evolve from a net expense currently to a net income benefit by 2020. Now of course the actual capital structure explaining another cooperate decisions that we make could well be different.","So to summarize, 2014 was a really a phenomenal year that set up our potential both in terms of financial and strategic opportunities. We are off to a strong start in 2015. We are well positioned to capitalize on the numerous immediate opportunities before us to drive toward 2020 financial target and to continue building our pipeline in additional growth drivers for the years beyond 2020.","Thank you and now I\u2019ll turn the call over to my colleague, Jackie.","Jackie Fouse","Thank you, Peter. Good morning everyone.","Our hematology-oncology teams around the world are delivering strong near-term commercial results while advancing the regulatory, clinical, and medical affairs programs and strategies that lay the foundation for our sustained long term growth. In 2014, franchise revenues grew 18% year-over-year and the 3% sequential growth we produced in Q4 gave us a strong finish to the year and great momentum moving into 2015.","As you heard from Peter, all of our major brands contributed to this growth as did all of our major geographies. The demographics for our target therapeutic categories are highly supportive of sustainable long term growth as we leverage our global infrastructure with new regulatory approvals for products and indications around the world.","The outstanding performance of our clinical, medical affairs and regulatory teams produced major submission and approvals for new indications across our in-line products, significant progress on our development pipeline and a constant stream of important new scientific data and publications and major medical journals.","The results of these efforts will drive not only our short term growth trajectory, but they also position us extremely well to sustain that growth. One reason we feel highly confident in our vision out to 2020. I\u2019ll speak more about some of our near term catalyst in a moment.","Our teams took important steps to advance key programs that will contribute to establishing new treatment paradigms for patients and drive our growth for the long term.","These include our efforts in lymphoma for a number of our trials are now in Phase III with several having completed enrollment and in the immuno-oncology arena for our unique position gives us near, medium and long-term opportunities.","REVLIMID position in the market has never been stronger. The product grew 16% year-over-year and now has an annual revenue base of just under $5 billion.","Our growth was once again broad-based across geographies with market share and duration games driving higher volumes. Quarterly revenues existed the year at a run rate of over $1.32 billion and we entered 2015 with excellent momentum as we look forward to approvals for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma in the U.S., Europe, and Japan as well as our ongoing geographic expansion in relaxed refractory multiple myeloma, MDS, and mantle cell lymphoma.","As a quick update on our geographic expansion I can now tell you that we have received reimbursement approval in Russia and we will participate in our first tender there later this year. We anticipate immanent pricing approval in Mexico and we will launch in last refractory myeloma there this year. And finally we are making good progress in Brazil and I look forward to telling you more about that market relatively soon.","We see ongoing support for sustained increased in duration of therapy and myeloma from the positive clinical read out for the triplet regimens and include REVLIMID as backbone therapy. We should see more of those triplet beta readout over the course of this year.","We are making good progress with our REVLIMID lymphoma program. We now have five phase three trials underway in both follicular and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. We anticipate seeing data from these trials over the coming 18 to 24 months.","To wrap on REVLIMID we expect a steady stream of new data this year across multiple indications and we will update you about that on an ongoing basis. Today I just wanted to mention a couple of things we believe will come at ASCO where we expect updated MMO2O survival data as well as the detailed results of the FLASH meta-analysis in follicular lymphoma.","It will be another exciting year for new data for REVLIMID. POMALYST\/IMNOVID is on its way to becoming a block buster product and we are extremely pleased with its performance in 2014. As we continued the product's geographic expansion with our launch starting across the EU this past year we grew globally at 123% year-over-year and posted 12% sequential growth in Q4.","A launch in Europe is ongoing and we now anticipate an approval in Japan during the first half of this year and launch in that market in the second half of the year. With those major geographies and launch mode and others like Australia and Canada coming along POMALYST\/IMNOVID has a very long growth trajectory still ahead of it.","A steady stream of new data is lending further support to the product's market position. These data which were recently presented at ASH include subset data for patients with renal impairment and data for POMALYST\/IMNOVID combination regimen.","The market dynamic for POMALYST\/IMNOVID in the third line and greater myeloma patient segments will be further enhanced as other therapies including REVLIMID continue to move up to earlier treatment lines.","For all of these reasons we are highly confident that POMALYST\/IMNOVID will become a multibillion dollar product and we are very happy with the strategic role the product is playing within our myeloma portfolio.","The ABRAXANE team produced outstanding results across the Board during 2014 and delivered not only excellent operating performance and 31% year-over-year growth, but also several key milestones that pave the way for the strong growth to come.","Our team has grown ABRAXANE from just over $300 million of annual revenues with one indication at the time of our acquisition of ABRAXANE in 2010 to almost $850 million of revenues in 2014 with now three global indications. The product is well positioned for many more years of global growth in success.","During 2014, we continued ABRAXANE\u2019s global launch in pancreatic cancer making significant progress in Europe and preparing for launches in Canada, Australia, and other markets.","In addition our partner Thiho recently obtained approval for this indication in Japan. The product has quickly become the new standard of care in metastatic pancreatic cancer and we're making excellent progress with our Phase III adjuvant and Phase II locally advanced pancreatic cancer trials.","We have received positive opinion from the CHMP in Europe for non-small cell lung cancer and look forward to adding that indication to our European label this year.","Our balance program of four trials across various segments of non-small cell lung cancer continues to make progress and trials are initiating to study of ABRAXANE in combination with novel agents in non-small cell lung cancer.","New data in breast cancer in the neoadjuvant setting was presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December by the German Breast Group. This new data from the GeparSepto trial further supports the value proposition for ABRAXANE in breast cancer.","Now with three indications labeled across the globe and with an ongoing stream of new data consistently reinforcing of ABRAXANE\u2019s clinical differentiation the product is the evolving as the chemotherapy for choice for possible combination regimens across multiple tumor comps.","We are working to make the most of this opportunity and our strategy includes studying ABRAXANE in combination with novel immuno-oncology agents for trials for TB1 and PDL1 check point inhibitors are already under way and we are working with several potential collaboration partners on other combination opportunities.","The future for ABRAXANE is bright indeed. To summarize our hematology-oncology global franchise team produce steady results in 2014 across all of our commercial clinical, regulatory and medical affairs activities. This was evident in our operating performance, in our clinical and regulatory achievements and in our new data generation and publications success.","At both AASCO and ASH in 2014 the Celgene presence was stronger and deeper than ever. The success of 2014 laid a foundation for our confidence in both our 2015 and longer term growth projections highlighted a number of catalyst that will drive our growth this year.","With these we expected to deliver REVLIMID sales of $5.6 billion to $5.7 billion including the impact of negative foreign exchange or growth of 13.5% year-over-year.","Growth is about 15% excluding foreign exchange is volume driven. We expect ABRAXANE\u2019s sales to exceed 1 $billion for the first time in the products history and anticipate coming in within a range of $1 billion to $1.25 billion, this year growth of 33% and arrange consistent with the long-term target we gave you several years ago.","We also see strong growth ahead for POMALYST\/IMNOVID and ongoing growth outside the U.S. for Vidaza. We look forward to further updating you on our pipeline progress as we advance our key programs, including our plans for moving ahead with our pivotal trials for AG221 in AML and sotatercept or luspatercept and beta thalassemia and MDS.","We are excited about these programs and the potential they held for evolving MDS AML franchise as we believe this business has the potential to go from around $1 billion of annual sales today to $3 plus billion over the next several years.","We are also excited about these as they represent concrete successes coming from our collaboration portfolio and our unique research and development model and I\u2019ll take this opportunity to thank our partners Agios and Acceleron for their outstanding execution and success.","Let me close by thanking all of my franchise colleagues in hematology and oncology around the world for a fantastic 2014 and for what I\u2019ll know will be a tremendous year in 2015.","Thank you, and let me now turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Smith","Thank you, Jackie and welcome everybody on the call.","Q4 was a quarter full of advancement and accomplishment within the I&I franchise. During this quarter we launched the psoriasis indication for OTEZLA in the U.S. and saw significant acceleration, prescriptions and revenue. We also advanced important life cycle programs for OTEZLA in a variety of different indication.","We received both a positive opinion and a strong broad label recommendation from the CHMP for PSA and psoriasis. Striking Phase II data for GED-301 was presented in the major medical meeting and we received important regulatory feedback for our proposed GED-301 clinical development plan.","Now let's turn to the OTEZLA launch. In the U.S., OTEZLA prescriptions accelerated significantly in Q4 following the psoriasis approval and with continued strong progress on the PSA launch. OTEZLA has obtained a highest initial weekly RX volume of any launch in the I&I space in recent years.","It is important to note that the vast majority of prescriptions in both PSA and psoriasis are for patients who coming off non-biologic therapies.","As of December, approximately 80% of patients who were initiating OTEZLA therapy were prebiologic and only 20% were coming to OTEZLA from a biologic therapy.","Now looking specifically at the U.S. psoriasis launch we are very encouraged by the initial data and see approval for psoriasis on September 23 we've seen a quadrupling in the number of dermatology prescribers of OTEZLA in just three months.","We saw broad utilization across all sectors of dermatology including those who prescribe biologics, those who prescribe oral systemic, those who prescribe mostly topicals and we're particularly pleased with OTEZLA uptake by the top decile psoriasis prescribers in the market.","Not only the prescriptions accelerated in Q4 we also saw significant acceleration in net product sales, which were $47 million in Q4 and $17 million for 2014 the first partial year of launch.","Overall we are very happy with the early launch success in OTEZLA in United States. As mentioned earlier we have received a positive CHMP opinion in Q4 and we have received a formal approval earlier this month for both PSA and psoriasis indications.","We will be launching OTEZLA in the U.K., Germany and Nordic Countries in February and expect a series of further launches in Europe through 2015. We also look forward to launching in Japan and major geographies in 2016 and beyond.","Turning our attention now to GED-301, we're currently initiating the early stages of the registration program.","This registration program will consists of three main components that will run in staggered parallel fashion, the first step in the registration enabling endoscopy study, which is initiating currency.","There will also be two large 52-week tweet through pivotal trials, which have clinical remission defined by CVAI as the primary endpoint in key secondary endpoints looking at endoscopic changes and patient reported outcomes, specifically PRO2.","We will also be working on initiating an Adolescent Crohn's Registration trial in 2015. Data from this program is expected to be available beginning in 2017.","As I stated earlier, 2014 was a year or significant advancement and accomplishment for Celgene I&I. 2015 should be another year full of major milestones and accomplishments for the I&I franchise.","We are focused on expanding the Otezla presence in the U.S. the launch of OTEZLA in multiple indications in key geographies outside of the United States, including the EU, Switzerland and Australia and completing enrollment of two phase trials of OTEZLA in atopic dermatitis and possibly ulcerative colitis.","We're also advancing the development of GED-301 including the publication of the [IGA] [ph] Phase II trial in Crohn's disease in a major medical journal, initiating all components of the GED-301 registration program in Crohn's disease and exploring the clinical development for GED-301 in ulcerative colitis.","Finally, we plan on moving forward other key clinical programs such as CC-220 in sotatercept forward through significant milestone in 2015.","We're very excited about the momentum that is being created over the last year. We're looking forward to further accelerating all key aspects of the I&I franchise as we move into 2015.","Thank you all for your attention and I would like to turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Alles","Thank you, Scott, thanks Jackie and Peter and good morning, everyone.","2014 was truly an outstanding year for Celgene. The momentum from our core businesses positions us for another year of strong growth and excellent results. Let me briefly add my perspective to close the call.","At Celgene, everything flows from our mission to help people with serious diseases and everything we do is aligned with our five strategic imperatives; deliver operating excellence, capitalize on our global leadership in hematology, expand our oncology franchise, build our immune inflammatory franchise and accelerate the pace of disruptive innovation.","Our mission derives us to set ambitious targets and our strategic imperatives help us to realize the enormous potential for scientific breakthroughs and sustained long-term growth.","Our business model is working well. We entered 2015 with excellent momentum and clarity on the significant opportunities before us. Our teams are energized and confident, supported by the compelling value proposition of our therapies, we expect market share gains, longer duration of therapy, launches of new indications, new treatment strategies and the continuous flow of new clinical data to combine to deliver robust, year-on-year sales growth and operating leverage.","This slide summarizes our major milestones for the year. More than that, it represents the opportunities we have to fully capitalize on the potential of our broad and deep hematology pipeline and to optimize the value of ABRAXANE in multiple solid tumor indications and novel immuno oncology treatment strategies.","This slide also reflects our determination and ambition to build Celgene's I&I franchise into a premier developer of innovative therapies for serious immune and inflammatory diseases and a significant contributor to our success. We are confident that the key growth drivers are in place to meet or exceed our 2015 and longer term financial targets.","Label expansions, new products and our ability to execute, provide great clarity on our opportunities from now and through the next several years. Under the leadership of Tom Daniel, our early drug development and research teams and partner companies are creating significant future opportunities by advancing high potential molecules through our dedicated protein home use faces, epigenetic and immuno oncology centers of excellence.","Our integrated and distributed R&D model is productive and working well and it is just one of the many reasons why we believe the promise and potential of Celgene is greater than ever.","Thank you very much. Operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt Roden of UBS. Your line is now open.","Matt Roden","Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the progress here. So lots of chatter from the PBMs and in the market as well about value for medicines and it seems to me that REVLIMID is in a good spot here, given the lack of therapies equivalents.","But as a Bellwether in the space, I wonder if you could make a general comment on what you're seeing across geographies on pricing and maybe specifically what impact if any you're seeing on your product lines?","It doesn\u2019t seem like you're seeing much from the waterfall plots that Peter you showed, but any commentary would be helpful in those lines. Thanks a lot.","Peter Kellogg","Yes, before maybe Jackie gives a little bit more color on REVLIMID specifically or others, I think Matt, our strategy for many years now has been that pharmacoeconomics help technology assessment the whole value proposition has to be core to everything we do, whether that's clinical development, early development, regulatory, commercial operations etcetera.","And that hasn\u2019t changed in any way, shape or form. We're committed to ensuring that our products have the value proposition that supports their access to patients, to physicians that prescribe them. So we feel very good about where we are and there isn\u2019t anything fundamentally changed.","I think our results indicate the success of really making sure that our products value proposition as solid in geographies all around the world.","Jackie Fouse","Yes, I'll just mainly add a little bit that here we start with differentiated science to produce differentiated outcomes and then you have the right teams working on reimbursement and market access issues with specific country expertise around the world and you build those relationships with the authorities.","You put yourself in a very good position to have an objective discussion about the value proposition. I think you've seen that with respect to how we have dealt with the pricing issues over the last two or three years and if you go back and look at the impact on the company, I think it become pretty clear that we've got a differentiated proposition.","We're not naive about it, but we've got teams that are very focused on that and we will continue to do so.","Matt Roden","Thanks very much.","Bob Hugin","Yes, good morning, Matt and I'll just add, the only point is as we build out our projections into the future, as Jackie said, we do use all the experience we have in these markets to have a very realistic view of pricing.","So it's all part of the equation we think about and as we develop drugs as we're developing target product profiles, we're very conscious of this and I think it's become a standard in the industry. You really have to think about how differentiated and how much value add you're bringing so that you can assure yourself even as you're designing your trials that you've got the data to support your position.","Matt Roden","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Robyn Karnauskas","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I was just curious from these prices in the market endpoint when do you think we can start seeing the first step to use your product ahead of biologics?","And then the second question on that point is there are several other volatiles that look safe that are being developed. So the landscape could change and when you're developing the drug knowing that you could have competition down the line, how are you thinking about how quickly you have to get like OTEZLA entrenching the market to compete with these products, thanks?","Bob Hugin","Thank you very much Robyn. I think we've already seen some plans taking the decision to put OTEZLA ahead of biologic therapy. It's not a large part of the market at this point in time, but we're seeing some plans starting to take those decisions particularly as we've guided into late '14 and early '15 and we hope to continue to work on that throughout '15 and beyond.","It's a very important principle and we've seen some and we hope to see some more.","In terms of other products, I think what we see when we take a look at our products with OTEZLA is we see continuing strong efficacy. Over time, we see in both indications we see long-term safety, which is creating a different benefit risk type profile that we see in the market today.","So we feel very confident about the profile that's emerging for OTEZLA and I believe around development is we've got a significant runway to really dominate and trench in the marketplace.","Robyn Karnauskas","Great. One follow-up just on that, when you think about 2017 and like the hockey stick that kind of happens to happen for OTEZLA in your guidance, can you give us a sense or even qualitatively or quantitatively, like what percentage of plans have to have those added since do you think for you to hit the guidance for OTEZLA?","Bob Hugin","Yes thanks Robyn. I think it\u2019s much more multifactorial than that. If you take a look, we just have one quarter of psoriasis launch. This will be the first full year of psoriasis and PSA launch in the U.S. We will be bringing Europe on Board and there will be reimbursement and launches happening.","Throughout the course of the year, you get into '16 and you really see the geographic spread and the impact from both indications in the U.S. and beyond. That to me is the main driver of those forecast.","Robyn Karnauskas","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Geoff Meacham","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. A quick one of ABRAXANE, when you guys look at the three indications in the U.S. only pancreatic has been a driver and been a successful launch, but looking forward through, what do you guys see as gating factor for broader adoption in pancreatic?","And when you look at breast alone, are those indications -- should we assume that those indications are fairly mature and this is obviously prior to having any additional data than you guys are obviously studying ABRAXANE in multiple combinations in those indications, I was just thinking in the near term say the next one to two year timeframe. Thank you.","Jackie Fouse","Thanks, so a couple of things. With respect to pancreas, what we've seen in the U.S. where we've been out the longest, ABRAXANE and GEMZAR are being combinations quickly becoming standard of care. As we launched in other markets around the world, we would expect to see that same type of ramp up.","So that should be a nice driver for that indication the geographic expansion on an ongoing basis. When we again look on to lung and breast, I think the lung indication is particularly exciting for a lot of reasons. We never included it any of our models previously an approval for lung in Europe. We now have that positive CHMP opinion in hand.","And we are seeing a significant amount of interest to study ABRAXANE in combination with novel agents, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer, but in other tumor types as well, but given where some of those novel agents are in their development, lung may be the nearer term opportunity with some of those combination studies.","So you're going to hear more about that over time and I think it's important to just keep in mind that the global approvals for ABRAXANE across these indications for the product in a great place with respect to these combination studies has a potential for interest to continue to pursue those as they\u2019ll be able to be global studies.","Lastly in breast, you saw the breast data presented back in December in San Antonio that's been very positive for new data for us. So we're out there making sure that that broad dissemination in the medical community.","We think that is going to be positive for breast and we've got some other things like that, that are coming along. This year we've got Italian cooperative group trial that could read out in 2015 that would further enhance the new breast data for ABRAXANE.","So all those things move in a great place and just a quick note on the long term targets, we've not included anything in those yet for the potential coming out of our immuno oncology efforts with these combination therapies for ABRAXANE or any of the other compounds that we have in our portfolio that we must steady in combination for various tumor types, but that's upside potential that we have an you'll hear more about that as those play out.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges of Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey Porges","Thanks very much for the question. One for Scott, one for Jackie if I may. Scott, could you just give us some more information about re-treatment for GED-301 with the 52-week data, is there any re-treatment in that or how you're going to approach that?","And then Jackie, just on REVLIMID, looking ahead at your guidance, it looks as though you've got a steady slow down in your growth, 16% and 15% adjusted for currency and that looks as though it's a 12%, 12.5% going forward to 17% and given that you have lymphoma, COL in front of you and you also have the frontline approval in the U.S. and Europe, to what extent is that conservative, given those opportunities, thanks?","Scott Smith","Just on GED-301 the overall structure of the treat-through the tow major treat-through 52-week trials we'll be initiating midyear. They will have induction component, 12-week induction component and then a longer term maintenance component, but they won't be separate studies.","It will be treating through the whole way. There is no design idea right now that there would be randomized treatment within that particular study. So those will be two 52-week through three Arm studies, approximately in those two 2,000 patients required for the safety database.","Jackie Fouse","And just on the REVLIMID growth, the guidance that we have given at the midpoint of the range has the growth including the negative currency impact of 13.5%. If you exclude that currency impact for 2015, the growth rate globally would be 15%.","A couple of things with respect to that, in terms of the European contribution from newly diagnosed because we have to go through the reimbursement discussions, country by country.","We have made some assumptions about what that will look like and you will see a significant acceleration from the European contribution to growth in 2016 and beyond with some contribution already in 2015 whether we've been a little bit conservative.","About how quickly we ramp in Europe or not, I don't know, but we probably have been a bit conservative in those assumptions. The other thing that we have been conservative regarding would be the evolution of treatments with the readouts of the triplet regimes.","And we probably have not fully baked in the potential impact on duration coming from that ongoing readout of data from the triplet regimen.","We've also taken into consideration some potential for a price erosion notable in Europe and that would be something that we will see how that plays out for the last one, two, three years.","We found that we've been a bit conservative with respect to what we've assumed might happen with price erosion outside the U.S. So we'll see how that goes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Cory Kasimov","All right. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I want to go back to OTEZLA, I am wondering if you can comment on what you're seeing with the conversion rate from the initial titration in starter packs to revenue generating scripts and also anything you can say on the persistency or drop out trends at this early stage and how this may or may not be different between psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, thanks?","Scott Smith","Thanks, the vast majority of patients, I don't have an exact number, its variable month by month, the vast majority of patients who are going on titration and bridging are ultimately aiming up in commercial packs.","It's more a matter of the length of time that that is taking. The average is approximately 28 days when a patient starts initiation to getting on. We're not losing a lot of patients in that time.","Relative to persistency, I am a little reluctant until you get years worth of data to really make anything solid around persistency, but I can say what we're seeing is that or above what our expectations were.","It looks like what we saw in the clinical trial program where it was very good persistency at one year and two years. So I don't want to be too definitive on it because you definitely need some period of time, but overall persistency is trending I think quite well and a little bit ahead where we were expecting it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Eric Schmidt","Maybe another question for Scott on the GED-301 program, doesn\u2019t look like the endoscopy studies on clinicaltrials.gov, so we don't really know much about the design there, but do you need to complete part of that study before you kick off the two next trials and it looks like on the slides that the induction studies have a four week primary endpoint, is that all that you will require for FDA approval?","And lastly what's the dosing regimen in the induction studies are frequent?","Scott Smith","So they're not just -- they're not induction studies, it's a tweet through overall protocol. So just to go through the various components there, what we're doing after regulatory advice, the startup time for studies is usually six to eight months. We're in that phase now for the two large treat through studies.","In the meantime, we're initiating and are initiating right now the endoscopic study. The purpose of that endoscopic study is to match up clinical symptom resolution with positive histologic changes and also further explored durability from the initial induction how long those effects are durable.","Because of the timing of it we have an interim analysis plan we should be hit that and that can form the two larger treat through studies, but we're now waiting for that data.","It should come in a way which we can do some adaptation of the longer term studies if we needed to. So we're going quickly, but thoughtfully I think with the feedback that we've received from regulatory authorities.","And in terms of dosing, we will be looking at one induction regimen in the treat through and then different maintenance regimes as we go through. We're finalizing that based on some final back and forth from regulatory authorities.","But it would be one dose for a period of time during the 12-week induction period, primary end point of four weeks and then we would have three separate different varied maintenance regimes that would look at durability through 52 weeks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenbaum of ISI. Your line is now open.","Mark Schoenbaum","Hey guys, thanks. I really appreciate it. First of all congrats guys on OTEZLA. I think the numbers are looking better than a lot of armchair observers thought they might, so well done on that.","And just to follow-up on Eric's question, the endoscopy data that you guys will have in house next year. Do you plan on releasing that to the street, yes or no? And if so when?","And then my second was just on REVLIMID and lymphoma, if the FDA agrees that durable complete response is indeed reliable so to get surrogate for survival, when would that enable you to file for approval of REVLIMID and NHL, thank you?","Scott Smith","The data from the endoscopy study will be an interim look, won't be full data. So there won't be a lot of external visibility around that. Also this data is probably likely to be an important part of the regulatory package and so we need to consider how that fits into the overall regulatory filing and when we can get that data out.","As soon as we can get that data out in the appropriate form, we will make sure we get it, but it's a 52-week study as well but we're just going to take an earlier cut and an interim look. So it will be sometime for that data is available, but we're looking forward to getting that out.","Jackie Fouse","And just on the REVLIMID follicular filing, so if we take few months ago, the RELEVANCE trial was fully enrolled. If we can use that 30-month endpoint kind of go out and you get to a readout call it early 2017 and filing sometime in middle to second half of 2017.","And that would be two to three years earlier than if you don't use that surrogate endpoint and we have not assumed that we would have that earlier path in our financial model for now.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber of Citi. Your line is now open.","Yaron Werber","Great. Thanks so much. I've a couple of questions if you don't mine. One on ABRAXANE and for Jackie, the GeparSepto data was pretty interesting and it sounds like you're eluding that there might be an additional Italian study, it wasn\u2019t clear whether that's new adjuvant 2.","I was wondering can you file in that. And then secondly the tenacity study that's the triple negative first line is kind of a Phase II 3 with leading into a Phase III might have data late this year or early next year. So I am trying to figure out if that's fillable?","And then III if you just don't mind, I noticed with Acceleron it sounds like there was no mention on starting Phase III in MDS this year, is that getting pushed out to early next year, thank you?","Jackie Fouse","Thanks Yaron, real quick just on the Acceleron, I actually in my comments did say that we will be making a decision on for sotatercept or lose sotatercept for advancing in both beta-thalessemia and MDS this year. So that is on track for this year. You'll hear more about that relatively soon. So that's completely on track.","So with respect to the GeparSepto and other data, so there is -- the team some years ago put together a nice strategy for firms running these working with cooperative groups on these different trials. The Etna Italian Group trial is also in neoadjuvant.","The trial is on slightly different than GeparSepto, but it's the same patient group and we are now looking at what the different approach is to registration would be with those -- the GeparSepto data and potentially with the Italian data as well.","So we're working through that right now with the German Breast Group and you'll hear more about what we think about -- what we think about that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Terence Flynn","Hi, thanks for taking the questions. The first one for me is I noticed in your release you talked about initiating the Phase III trial of REVLIMID maintenance in newly diagnosed patients post transplant that are minimal residual disease positive, just wondering if you can provide some thoughts there in terms of design, the rationale behind that study?","And then the second question I had was Jackie had asked you talked about a $3 billion figure for your AML, MDS franchise. Longer term, just wondering if you can give us any more insight in the drivers there, thank you?","Jackie Fouse","Yes, let me take the second part of the question first. When you look across the development portfolio now in AG-221, the sotatercept or luspatercept in MDS and how those things and the trials that we have ongoing with our internal compounds that phase our program layer across the different patient segments in MDS and AML.","You start to see a very nice picture emerging and the potential for those trials to give us data that would allow us to file for different patient subsets within those indications and cover a broader group of patients across MDS and AML than what we have today, that's in addition to the positive trial readout that we already had for REVLIMID in the non-deletion 5Q population which opens that one up significantly in terms of the numbers of patients that we can access.","So when we look out at that franchise and the unmet medical need there, we see significant potential for that franchise to grow over the next few years from a very good base today, but with many more products and across many more indications and covering a broader set of those patients.","So that's why we're so optimistic about that and then the unique profile of products like AG-221, which are somewhat more targeted therapy. Just on your other question, which is the MRD positive trial, we know that finding this sort of marker or way of looking at things is something that could apply not only to myeloma, but we think it's particularly important in myeloma and we and other s have been exploring this approach with the regulators and the medical community have support for looking at that.","And as we're ready to disclose a little bit more some of the details about that trial and its design, which we are working on now, we're fully supportive of the concept and the think that we would be leaders in this area.","You'll hear a bit more from us about that over the course of the year, but we had made the decisions to move forward with that trial.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Ravi Mehrotra","Thanks for taking my question. For Scott, on GED-301 your comments about the addition of UC indication, can you give us any color first on any additional formulation faction work you may need for UC?","And secondly any color on the development program, I'll be right in assuming you'll need some sort of Phase II study before going to Phase III, thank you?","Scott Smith","We're ongoing sonographic work right now with the current formulation to see exactly where it's released in the GI system to make sure we've got deliveries in the appropriate parts of the GI system, if not, there can be some tweaks made to the ph-dependent release system on the coding.","So that work should finish up very quickly and we continue to make a determination on whether the drugs being released approximately and where and then at that point depending on how when we see it, then we would move either into a Phase II proof of concept, going into Phase III, but that needs to be aside.","Right now we're focused on that sonographic work, but we think given what we've seen in Crohn's disease, there is a tremendous opportunity in ulcerative colitis for this product as well and it looks like we might have the current -- good chance of current formulation will be fine.","If not we believe it will only be a moderate tweak to the existing formulation.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Birchenough of BMO. Your line is now open.","Nick Glen","Good morning, it's Nick Glen for Jim this morning. Thanks for taking my question. Two part if I may, Yaron asked the question of how tenacity was not answered, so I can ask it as well I guess. So we know it's a Phase III for clinicaltrials.gov we have Phase II data at the end of the year.","Can you let us know little bit about the design of this study? How many patients were in Phase II versus Phase III? And then in terms of one of your new compounds that's gone into the clinic 9002 anti-CD 47, can you summarize past what the antibody are and some of the challenges that you face in terms of your protecting healthy cells, red blood cells as opposed to obviously targeting tumor cells for that pathway, thanks?","Jackie Fouse","So yes, I am going to remind about I was sitting here thinking out in answering to Yaron's question on tenacity, so it is a Phase II, III design. We should have the Phase II data later this year. We'll be making the decision on how we move into Phase III.","The Phase II patient numbers if I am not mistaken are around 240 or so and the Phase III would be randomized and the Phase III would be about 550.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya of Nomura Securities. Your line is now open.","Ian Somaiya","Thanks. I just wanted to follow up on maybe comments you made on REVLIMID pricing, and then on long-term guidance. On REVLIMID pricing, just how should we think about the label expansion that's upcoming and how that could play into pricing? Should we assume a price cut at that time point?","And in terms of long-term guidance, specifically 2020, can you just help us further tease out pipeline contribution, specifically partner drugs, which are included in the three percentage point contribution that you spoke to?","Jackie Fouse","Yes thanks. So with respect to the pricing discussions, it will be a country by country discussion as I think everybody is familiar with. There are some countries that will have early access. Germany, Austria, Netherlands, those typical countries it will be quite early.","Just because REVLIMID was approved before AMNOG we've had this question a few times. We don't have to go through or won't have an AMNOG review later for that because REVLIMID was approved before that process. So Germany is definitely an early access country.","And then again we've got people in the countries that are on top of this ready to go have those discussions as soon as we get the EMEA ratification of the CHMP approval or positive recommendation.","So we're ready to go, but it will be a staged process which is why we have regularly talked about the fact that we will get some contribution from this in Europe during 2015, but it will really start to ramp up and contribute more significantly in 2016 and beyond.","Peter Kellogg","Yes good, so thank you Jackie and this is Peter. On the question of the long-term guidance through 2020, as we've discussed and I think we've the deck that we originally presented at the conference earlier this month broke this out sort of nicely.","So I would encourage you to refer to that because we actually highlight some of the things that are in the base assumptions through 2017 and then relevant to your question what do we think about relative to what might contribute by 2020.","And what things did we not include and I think that's an important distinction because we had to go through and think about the timelines about partnered assets and so forth, but in each franchise, we thought about that and I wouldn't read too much into exactly how we place things because we were just kind of using out a scenario to build it out.","And as I highlighted the scenarios can be different. Clearly our base -- the 15 points of growth is coming from the existing products we have today and the indications that we really have good information about.","Beyond that we're looking at products such as the Acceleron assets or the IGOs assets that could come into play contribute that additional three points. Quite frankly in addition to that, things like REVLIMID in lymphoma really is a whole area that we have I think a lot of potential on, but that's also in that three points of growth and so really as Jackie has highlighted, that could be a very big opportunity and maybe we've underestimated that we will see.","Furthermore, as you get into oncology we're thinking about things like ABRAXANE in triple negative adjuvant pancreatic cancer, non-small cell lung cancer in Europe and so forth and so I think in INI as well, I don't know if exactly you're referring to, but clearly we had GED-301 in that space.","It's little hard to measure exactly what the timeline and contribution would be in its first year to base until we really see all the final data and then of course there is OTEZLA in additional indications that it might come along and then finally sotatercept could be a player.","So I think one of the things that's probably key is not to be too precise in saying exactly what did we assume in there and not in there because we have so may -- we have so much optionality that's positive.","We have quite a few asset that could be contributing in the 3% of growth and then quite frankly we've got a number of other assets that we haven\u2019t even concluded that could as we go through time come into the timeframe and be contributors that we may you know incorporate in the future.","So overall it\u2019s a very broad portfolio and we feel very good about the guidance.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets. Sir your line is now open.","Michael Yee","Hi thanks. Two quick ones. One is, can you remind us about OTEZLA pricing in Europe and how we should be thinking about that? But also the rate of adoption utilization of a new oral there versus, say, the U.S., what should we be thinking about?","The second question was to follow up on the last comment on long-term guidance, specifically for I&I where you have that $700 million label-expansion new products bucket. Is it safe to say the vast majority of that is GED and what type of assumptions did you make on that -- is that vast majority of that $700 million?","Scott Smith","Pricing in Europe we're going to take the same strategies we have in the United States, where we're going to be at a meaningful discount to average by logic price. It helps of course or helps encourage that pre-biologic utilization of the drug.","And we see that even majority of the utilization in the U.S. So we're going to go with this similar strategy. Biologic price point are variable by country in Europe, but there are generally lower than you see in the U.S. but we won't have the same kind of strategy, significant discount to average biologic price.","Rate of uptake in Europe it sort of gets blinded, it's difficult to make a blanket conclusion because you have some early adaption countries and you got some countries which are slower to adapt.","I think some of the early adoption countries will have a higher initial rate of utilization than you see in the U.S. and some of the ones that reversion will be slowest.","So it's a blended picture, but we think it's similar to what we see in the U.S. that there is a really tremendous opportunity for the oil product with differentiated benefit risk profile and the right kind of pricing strategy and the right kind of evidence around value, we think there is a tremendous opportunity in the Europe OTEZLA.","Peter Kellogg","Yeah and then for 2020 on the incremental $750 million, I would say there are multiple parts. Bob, I don't know if you want to comment on how we thought about it for GED-301, but in general it's comprised of both GED-301, but also CC-220.","So sotatercept and OTEZLA in additional indications to that and any comment that you would add?","Bob Hugin","Yeah those are all included in that 2020. At this point, heavily risk adjusted because they are programs which we don\u2019t have registration evidence on the risk adjusted appropriately for this stage in development, but you'll start to see major impact of those molecules as we get out to the 1920-21 timeframe.","Patrick Flanigan","Great, so operator if we can just -- given the time, we will take two more questions.","Operator","Perfect. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond of Robert Baird. Your line is open.","Chris Raymond","Yeah. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Just a question back on ABRAXANE. I think, Jackie, you alluded in the Q3 call to competitive pressure and it looks like you have been able to deal with that fairly effectively with the bounceback in Q4.","But I guess looking forward, especially in the context of the guidance having continued growth here, can you maybe talk about -- there is another drug very similar to ABRAXANE in development, the Sorrento drug.","How should we think about that, just given its similarity in mechanism, and also some of the data that they have shown recently? If you could put that into context for us, that would be great. Thanks.","Jackie Fouse","Thanks. Yeah so a couple of things just specifically with ABRAXANE and what we've seen is with the trials that we have talked about the co-operative groups and then the things that we're doing ourselves where you might imagine that we will make decisions to continue to invest in these different pricing segments trials that we see something that give us optimism or confidence in our ability to continue and to expand the label for ABRAXANE.","And you saw the GeparSepto read out and you will see other things, I think you are starting to see clear evidence of that. So we feel great about the product's differentiated position in the marketplace.","With respect to the potential competitor product, it is a different technology. So it can't make some of the same claims or around the NAM technology it is different.","I would also just say you have to watch for this as it plays out over time, we have strong belief that pharmacokinetics data and the plasma readout is not necessary telling you what\u2019s happening at the level of the tumor with respect to activity for the product. ","So we do think that we've got nice body of clinical data including trails where we've shown differentiated outcomes in the indications with the clinical trials, a full blown clinical trials for those and that we've got very strong case to make medically for ABRAXANE differentiation.","Scott Smith","And just because I think we're going to go with one more question Peter, I am struck by the conversations this morning in that when we think about where Celgene is today and there is notion of value preposition and how we're evolving along with how the macro environment around the world is evolving payers, governments etcetera, you could think of the Celgene portfolio today and as its evolving through our R&D effort where we're re-defining clinical end points with regulators.","So the notion minimum residual disease complete response, these are surrogates for patient outcomes where because blood cancer patients are living 10 plus years now, we have to redefine these end points for drug development and for differentiated outcomes.","Think of our original targeted population with REVLIMID of deletion 5Q MDS. So we've been in this space a long time. The triple negative discussion is interesting because it is the highest unmet medical need in the curative setting and the metastatic setting for breast cancer and we find ourselves right at the apex of what's happening to try to discover new ways to treat those patients.","I think the IO market that is emerging and one could say really is, now established in the form of multiple TB1 and PDL1 approaches, we find ourselves in a position with ABRAXANE where we synergize with those antibodies and it's steroid free.","So some simple things build our confidence again our bottom portfolio and our R&D approach and this all lines up with great differentiated patient outcome and we think sustainable value prepositions with payers.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Salveen Richter of SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Salveen Richter","Thanks for taking my question. Jackie, just wondering if you could help us with the outlook for -- just with the longer-term guidance that you provided, how we should think about assumptions for REVLIMID expansion into indications such as follicular lymphoma, whether the FLASH study could enable earlier data -- or the FLASH data could enable earlier registration here, and then for CLL as well. Thank you.","Jackie Fouse","Yes I think so we have in the long term guidance not assumed accelerated pathways standard pathway. I think in response to another question, we talked about how if the durable CR end point is accepted, it could be a two to three year earlier read out on that particular trial.","So the contribution from REVLIMID in the lymphomas is out in that period beyond 2017 and there would be ramping up beyond that. So we think there is a lot of potential there. We haven't included anything. We have not included anything in the model for CLL just to be clear about that as we don't have that data in hand and it's very competitive space.","So I think we've got nice optionality in the lymphoma program for the longer term.","Patrick Flanigan","Great. Jackie, thank you very much and thanks everybody on the call for staying with us a little bit longer today. A few folks probably didn't get their question asked. If there are other questions you want to ask, our IR team is available, I am available. So we will be glad to take calls in our IR office as we go through the rest of the day.","Again just to recap, we're very excited about the performance of 2014, obviously but more importantly what it says about our strategic opportunities going forward and I think as Mark commented, we're in a very exciting space. We've got a lot of great data coming our way.","We've got nice long lineup of assets. We've given long term guidance to give you a feel for how we see things could evolve very clearly and we're going to be working very hard on building and continuing to build the pipeline and the potential growth drivers that will even push us pass those goals.","So thank you very much. The exciting start to 2015 and we'll talk to you soon.","Operator","So ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone."],"4359":["Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ:CELG) Q4 2018 Earnings Conference Call January 31, 2019  9:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Nina Goworek - Executive Director of Investor Relations","Mark Alles - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","David Elkins - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Nadim Ahmed - President, Global Hematology & Oncology","Terrie Curran - President, Global Inflammation & Immunology","Jay Backstrom - Chief Medical Officer","Rupert Vessey - Global Head of Research and Early Development Group","Jonathan Biller - General Counsel","Conference Call Participants","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays.","Brian Abrahams - RBC Capital Markets","Michael Yee - Jefferies & Company","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Company","Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI","Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Aharon Gal - Sanford C.

I would like to remind you this call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Nina Goworek, Executive Director of Investor Relations at Celgene.","Nina Goworek","Thank you, Chelsea. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. The press release reporting our financial results, in addition to the presentation for today's webcast, can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the corporate website at celgene.com.","Joining me on today's call are Mark Alles, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; David Elkins, our Chief Financial Officer; Nadim Ahmed, Global Head of our Hematology and Oncology franchise; Terrie Curran, Global Head of our Inflammation and Immunology franchise; and Dr. Jay Backstrom, our Chief Medical Officer. Also available for the Q&A portion of the call are Dr. Rupert Vessey, Global Head of Research and Early Development Group; and Jonathan Biller, our General Counsel.","As a reminder, during today's call we will be making forward-looking statements regarding our financial outlook in addition to regulatory and product development plans. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those forecasted. A description of these risks can be found in our most recent 10-Q on file with the SEC. You will see on Slides 3 and 4 of today's presentation our legal disclosures. These statements speak only as of today's date and we undertake no duty to update or revise them. Reconciliation of the adjusted financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure are available as part of the earnings release.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Alles","Thank you, Nina, and thanks, everyone, for joining U.S. this morning. We appreciate the opportunity to review the results from our very good fourth quarter and full-year 2018, and the significant progress made advancing our early, mid, and late stage pipeline. Across our product portfolio and around the world, our operating performance was excellent, exceeding both top-line and bottom line guidance.","Compelling value propositions for patients plus outstanding commercial execution drove strong year-over-year growth for each of our flagship products, four of which exceeded $1 billion in sales last year. As we communicated earlier this month, this operating momentum supports our 2019 financial guidance of total revenue of $17-17.2 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $10.60-10.80.","We also reaffirming our 2020 outlook of $19 to $20 billion revenue and greater than $12.50 for adjusted diluted earnings per share. David, Terrie, and Nadim will discuss our financial results, commercial performance, and strategic progress later during the call.","Importantly, our multiyear investment to optimize the potential of our existing products and accelerate the development of several new medicines is delivering. In 2018 alone, we achieved 11 positive Phase III clinical trials spanning hematology, oncology, immunology, and new products.","At the end of 2018, our industry leading blood cancer portfolio was featured at the American Society of Hematology meeting, introducing and highlighting additional data and compounds across multiple disease areas and technology platforms.","Our five near-term launches remain on track, with U.S. approvals expected by the end of 2020. Dr. Jay Backstrom will provide a detailed update on ozanimod, fedratinib, luspatercept, liso-cel, and bb2121 shortly.","Our next wave of innovation is well under way as Dr. Rupert Vessey's Research and Early Development Team continue to advance new programs and novel mechanisms directed at cancer and inflammatory diseases. In 2018, seven new INDs were filed for innovative medicines discovered internally or in collaboration with one of our many partners.","For more than 15 years, our mission to become a preeminent company by discovering, developing, and delivering the most innovative therapy for patients has driven U.S. to constantly explore scientific frontiers and opportunities for sustainable long-term growth.","This is the lens by which we evaluate strategic alternatives, and how we became very excited by the proposed combination of Celgene and Bristol-Myers Squibb. Fundamentally, we are two innovation focused companies coming together to build an even stronger organization with virtually the same mission and purpose.","As has been discussed, the strategic rationale for this transaction is clear and compelling. The combination of our highly complementary portfolios creates a world leader in the important specialty areas of oncology and inflammation and immunology.","We believe the combined company will have even greater financial strength to further accelerate our research and development engine, continue to invest in external partnerships, and to attract the most talented people in our industry.","For Celgene shareholders, this cash and stock transaction recognizes and unlocks significant value by delivering immediate and substantial cash value and providing meaningful participation in the combined company's future growth. We are working together with our colleagues at Bristol-Myers Squibb to complete this transaction, which is expected in the third quarter of 2019.","We believe that Celgene's 2018 operational performance and significant clinical and regulatory progress sets U.S. up very well to deliver on our ambitious 2019 goals. With five near-term product launches and many promising pipeline assets advancing, we are very optimistic about the potential for long-term growth as part of the new Bristol-Myers Squibb.","Thanks again for joining U.S. today, and I'll now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, David Elkins.","David Elkins","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As Mark mentioned, we are pleased to have exceeded our full-year top-line and bottom line guidance. 2018's operating results highlights the strength of Celgene's business across the portfolio.","Revenues grew 16% and 18% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and full-year, which adjusted diluted earnings per share also grew double digits year-over-year at 20% and 19% for the fourth quarter and full-year respectively.","We also continued to make significant investments in research and development - in particular, in our late stage pipeline - to ensure we are advancing our regulatory submissions and driving toward approvals. We expect double digit growth on our top and bottom line to continue through 2019 and is reflected in our guidance.","Now, turning to Slide 10, total net product sales grew 16% year-over-year, achieving over $4 billion for the first time in Celgene's history, which is almost entirely driven by volume. Growth in our hematology and oncology franchise came primarily from volume drains across multiple brands and geographies.","OTEZLA had a very strong quarter, mainly driven by volume increases, as we continue to expand access and utilization, and also benefited from additional stocking in the quarter. Nadim and Terrie will elaborate further on these drivers.","Turning to our full-year 2018 top-line performance, net product sales grew about 18% to approximately $15.3 billion, exceeding our guidance of approximately $15.2 billion. Consistent with Q4, our full-year 2018 net product sales was driven primarily by volume, as price was only about 3% of our full-year growth.","On Slide 12, adjusted diluted EPS increased approximately 20% year-over-year, and 4% sequentially, to $2.39. The increase was primarily driven by the strong top-line growth partially offset by increased expenses relating to the Juno acquisition as well as our investments in our late stage pipeline. The net impact of these are reflected in the $0.30 of operating improvement seen on the slide.","Other income and expenses was negatively impacted by $0.12 due to increased interest expense from a higher level of debt primarily related to the financing of the Juno acquisition. Lower share count had a favorable impact of $0.25 to adjusted diluted EPS growth for the quarter, bringing adjusted diluted EPS to $2.39.","Full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 19% year-over-year to $8.87. This was driven by higher operating income of $0.97 and the benefit of $0.81 from lower share count partially offset by higher interest expense and a slightly higher effective tax rate. Note, these outstanding results were achieved despite approximately $0.50 dilution related to Juno post acquisition costs.","Now, turning to the key adjusted P&L line items on Slide 14, you will see product gross margin was in-line with our expectations at 96 % for the fourth quarter and 96.4% for the full-year. Product gross margin was slightly decreased versus prior year primarily due to raw material charges incurred in the year.","R&D as a percentage of revenue increased to 23% in the fourth quarter and for the full-year. The increase in R&D is primarily driven by the inclusion of Juno expenses. Excluding these expenses, R&D as a percentage of revenue decreased about 60 basis points versus prior year.","SG&A spend was $762 million for the fourth quarter, and $2.7 billion for the full-year. SG&A expenses were primarily driven by Juno and prelaunch marketing expenses for our late stage pipeline. The net result was about a 70-basis-point year-over-year decrease in our operating margin to 54.4% in the fourth quarter.","This resulted in a 55.5% operating margin for the full-year. Excluding the Juno-related expenses, operating margin improved 40 basis points for the full-year, and we closed out 2018 with a slightly higher effective tax rate at 16.5%, which is mainly driven by U.S. tax reform.","Now, on to capital allocation. In 2018, we continued our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Overall, we generated significant cash flow of about $5.2 billion. We also invested $9.7 billion in the strategic acquisition of Juno and Impact, and returned $6.1 billion to our shareholders through stock repurchases. We ended the year with a strong cash balance of approximately $6 billion in cash and marketable securities.","Now, turning to our 2019 guidance, 2019 reflects continued strong double-digit top-line and bottom line. To summarize, we expect total revenue to be $17-17.2 billion, growing at about 12% year-over-year using the midpoint of our guidance.","We expect adjusted operating margin improvement while maintaining a high-level investment in R&D. Our adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be about 17%. As a result, our adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be $10.60 and $10.80, reflecting strong 21% growth year-over-year when using the midpoint.","Lastly, we expect to maintain our share count where we landed at the fourth quarter of about 715 million shares. Finally, as we have discussed and experienced in the past, we want to remind you that we expect the typical seasonality of our business in Q1, as well as the impact of the donut hole payments, which is exacerbated by the manufacturing's responsibility increasing from 50% to 70%. We expect Q1 as a percentage of full-year revenue to be broadly in-line with Q1 2018. As a result, you should expect Q1 adjusted diluted EPS to be broadly in-line with Q4.","Thank you, and I would now like to turn the call over to Nadim.","Nadim Ahmed","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. The hematology and oncology franchise had another outstanding quarter, with net sales of approximately $3.6 billion and 15% year-over-year growth. For the full-year 2018, net sales revenue was approximately $13.7 billion with 17% year-over-year growth.","For REVLIMID, we met our full-year 2018 guidance with approximately $9.7 billion in revenue and 18% year-over-year growth. For POMALYST\/IMNOVID, we also met our full-year guidance of approximately $2 billion in revenue and 26% year-over-year growth. REVLIMID and POMALYST\/IMNOVID continue to drive our overall growth with volume gains across brand and geographies.","In 2019, we also anticipate additional label expansions that will continue to drive near-term growth for our key inline brands. For example, we have now submitted the SNVA and MAA for the chemotherapy free R2 regimen and in relapsed refractory indolent lymphoma, based on the positive AUGEMENT trial, and we expect FDA approval in the second half of 2019.","Finally, we continue to progress our portfolio of novel assets with ASH 2018 showcasing the significant advancement of our pipeline across a wide range of hematologic diseases. The data for luspatercept, a first in class erythroid maturation agent in MDS and beta-thalassemia, were a key highlight of ASH with luspatercept demonstrating a significant impact on disease related anemia across two distinct diseases.","There were also numerous oral presentations that demonstrated our progress with cellular therapy. We saw the first preliminary liso-cel data in CLL patients, demonstrating an approximately 45% complete response rate in patients with heavily pretreated relapsed refractory disease.","In terms of our broad BCMA campaign, we completed recruitment in our pivotal KarMMa study for bb2121 and also saw encouraging data for bb21217 and JCARH125 in relapsed refractory myeloma. We have also now submitted the NDA for fedratinib in myelofibrosis in the U.S. and expect approval by the end of 2019. From a commercial perspective, our teams are now in full launch preparation mode for our key near-term launches.","REVLIMID continues to deliver strong quarterly results with 16% year-over-year growth. In the U.S., REVLIMID grew 17% year-over-year for the quarter as market share and treatment duration continue to increase. We continue to see strong underlying demand growth with solid performance in the non-stem cell transplant and post stem cell transplant maintenance studies.","Outside of the U.S. REVLIMID net sales grew 15% year-over-year, with 24% volume growth. This growth is a result of robust underlying demand in ex U.S. markets, driven by REVLIMID shared in both frontline non-stem cell transplant and post stem transplant patients.","Duration also continues to increase with the impact of REVLIMID based triplet regimens. We also expect continued growth for REVLIMID in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, with the addition of new triple combination regimens, including REVLIMID, daratumumab, dexamethasone in the U.S., and also RVd outside of the U.S., based on expected European regulatory approval later this year.","The expected FDA approval later this year for R2 in lymphoma will also provide a new growth driver for the brand. Finally, we are awaiting the results of the REVLIMID robust trial in first line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. This is an event driven trial and we continue to monitor the phases of patients.","POMALYST\/IMNOVID net sales for the quarter increased 28% year-over-year. In the US, POMALYST fourth quarter net sales grew 39% year-over-year, driven by the continued adoption of the triplet regiment of POMALYST, daratumumab, and dexamethasone for relapsed refractory myeloma.","Outside of the US, POMALYST\/IMNOVID revenue grew 9% year-over-year with volume increasing by 17% despite competition from new entrants, which includes REVLIMID based triplet regimens. Similar to REVLIMID, we expect to see additional POMALYST share and duration gains through the use of newer triplet regimens.","We are anticipating approval of the PVd triple combination in relapsed refractory myeloma later this year in Europe and Japan. PVd will provide another important triplet option for patients with relapsed refractory myeloma.","ABRAXANE net sales for the fourth quarter increased by 7% year-over-year, and the brand surpassed the $1 billion mark for the first time. In the US, we saw a 15% increase in net sales year-over-year.","Outside of the US, ABRAXANE decreased slightly due to changes in distributor buying patterns. We look forward to the upcoming ABRAXANE data readout for the Phase III apact adjuvant pancreatic cancer trial. This is an event driven trial, and we continue to monitor the status of patients.","The upcoming ABRAXANE IO combination approvals represent another near-term growth driver for the brand. The first ABRAXANE IO combination regimen was approved in October 2018 in frontline metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer, and the producer dates for the ABRAXANE IO combinations in metastatic triple negative breast cancer and frontline metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer are set for March and September respectively.","In summary, the hematology and oncology franchise had another robust quarter to finish 2018. Underlying demand is strong for our key inline brands. We have multiple label expansions in 2019 to drive near-term growth, and our commercial teams are in full preparation mode for the launches of our key near-term novel assets.","Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Terrie Curran.","Terrie Curran","Thank you, Nadim, and good morning, everyone. The inflammation and immunology franchise had delivered a very strong fourth quarter, and demonstrated outstanding growth in 2018. We exceeded our original revenue target and continued to drive strong demand across geographies. A key growth catalyst has been the successful execution of our strategy to expand market access for appropriate post topical prebiologic patients.","We have secured biologic step free access for more than 85% of commercial patients in the U.S. and in key international markets such as France, Germany, and Japan. This expanded access footprint has increased the number of patients eligible for OTEZLA coverage and continues to be an important driver of worldwide growth.","There is a robust life cycle development plan in place for OTEZLA, and in 2018 we advanced multiple programs that have the potential to add substantial value in the years ahead. In the second half of the year, we submitted the regulatory filings for the treatment of oral ulcers associated with Behcet's disease in both the U.S. and Japan, and announced positive Phase III data in scalp psoriasis. We also initiative several Phase III and Phase IV trials in new and complimentary patient populations and look forward to continuing to advance those efforts in 2019.","Moving on to our pipeline compounds, in 2018 we made significant progress on the U.S. and EU regulatory filings for ozanimod in relapsing MS, and remain on track to submit in March 2019. We believe that ozanimod has the potential to be a best in class S1P receptor modulator, and we are currently building out the infrastructure necessary to ensure a world class launch.","We continue to build the platform for ozanimod in IBD through our Phase III trial in ulcerative colitis, which will complete enrollment in the first half of 2019, and the initiation of a Phase III trial in Crohn's disease. My colleague, Dr. Jay Backstrom, will provide a more detailed update on ozanimod regulatory and clinical development activities later in the call.","In 2018, we also presented a positive 52-week Phase II data for RP4046 in eosinophilic esophagitis, a disease with high unmet need. We continued to advance our other near and late stage pipeline assets and expect to complete the enrollment of the Phase II trial of CC-220 in SLE in 2019.","Now, diving deeper into 2019 OTEZLA performance. Q4 revenue was $448 million, which represents 21% year-over-year growth. For the full-year 2018, year-over-year growth was 26% and we raised our revenue guidance of $1.6 billion.","These strong results have been driven by our outstanding team that has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to excellence and passion for improving outcomes for the patients we serve. In the almost five years since the launch of OTEZLA, we have experience strong, sustained, volume-based growth in our core indications, which is a tremendous accomplishment and a testament to the unmet need for the existence of a treatment option like OTEZLA.","Despite increased competitive activity, OTEZLA continues to maintain new-to-brand leadership and healthy market share in the US. The newer entrants that have come into this space have primarily taken share away from existing biologic therapies, which we believe further supports our view that OTEZLA has a unique value proposition and is well positioned to deliver future growth.","Outside the US, we have also achieved dynamic market leadership in France and continue to have record breaking success post launch in Japan. As we look forward to what's to come in 2019, we will continue to maximize the OTEZLA opportunities through focus, strategic execution, and the advancement of life cycle development activities.","While we are very pleased with our momentum heading into the year, in Q1 we expect to experience the typical demand softening in the psoriasis markets, which of course has been factored into our 2019 guidance of approximately $1.9 billion in sales.","In terms of upcoming regulatory submission and approvals for OTEZLA, we expect to submit the filing in Behcet's disease to EMA in the first half of 2019 and anticipate approval in the U.S. and Japan in the second half of the year. Excellent progress is also being made on the sNDA for our scalp psoriasis label enhancement, which we plan to submit to the FDA in the second quarter of 2019.","Another important area of focus this year will be to enroll patients in our recently announced Phase III trials for pediatric and mild to moderate plaque psoriasis, and Phase IIIb trial for moderate to severe genital psoriasis. Our combined development activities for OTEZLA represent a potential revenue opportunity of more than $500 million at peak for the brand.","We are excited by the prospect of having a positive impact on the lives of these patients. Throughout these efforts, we remain focused on further expanding the post topical prebiologic market opportunity for appropriate patients.","I'm extremely proud of what our team has accomplished in 2018 and look forward to another year of growth in 2019. Thank you, and I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Jay Backstrom.","Jay Backstrom","Thank you, Terrie, and good morning. The clinical and regulatory teams had a strong finish to 2018 and we are well positioned at the start of 2019 to advance our five near-term new therapies - fedratinib, ozanimod, luspatercept, liso-cel, and bb2121 - toward regulatory approval.","I would like to now provide you with an update on these five key programs, starting with ozanimod on Slide 25. As Terrie indicated, we continue the advance ozanimod NDA that will be based on two randomized controlled Phase III studies, SUNBEAM and RADIANCE. As a reminder, both studies met their primary end point, demonstrating a significant reduction in annualized relapse rate compared to beta interferon.","With respect to safety, ozanimod was generally well tolerated, as reflected in the low incidents of serious adverse events. In addition, less than 5% of patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events.","No patient experienced second degree or higher AV block. And the rate of infection was comparable between treatment groups. Together, the efficacy and safety results support a favorable benefit\/risk profile.","With respect to our submission date - July 26 - we have successfully completed the additional non-clinical and clinical pharmacology studies and plan to submit the relapsing multiple sclerosis applications in the U.S. and Europe in March, with an expected U.S. approval in the first half of 2020.","The ozanimod inflammatory bowel disease program, including the Phase III clinical studies in ulcerative colitis, TRUE NORTH, and in Crohn's disease, YELLOWSTONE, also continues to advance. Enrollment for TRUE NORTH, which includes both an induction and maintenance phase, is nearing completion for enrollment, and we expect the last patient to be randomized by the end of the first half of this year with top-line results, including the maintenance phase, reporting out in mid-2020. The Phase III randomized trials in Crohn's disease are ongoing and actively recruiting.","Turning to fedratinib, our selective JAK2 inhibitor, on Slide 17. We announced earlier this year, fedratinib NDA for the myelofibrosis indication, which includes both JAKARTA, the Phase III randomized placebo-controlled study, and ruxolitinib-na\u00efve patients in JAKARTA-2, the single arm trial on patients who have failed or are intolerant to ruxolitinib, was submitted as planned and we now look forward to advancing the fedratinib NDA through the regulatory review process with an expected U.S. approval by the end of 2019. We expect to submit the marketing authorization application to the EMA in the first half of this year.","The fedratinib clinical teams continue to execute on the development plan in myelofibrosis, including additional studies in patients that have failed or are intolerant to ruxolitinib, FREEDOM and FREEDOM-2, and a Phase I\/II combination study with luspatercept planned for later this year.","Luspatercept, On Slide 28, remains on target for U.S. and EU submissions in the first half of 2019, for both the NDS and beta-thalassemia indications, with an expected U.S. approval in the first half of 2020. The BEYOND trial, a randomized Phase II study in non-transfusion dependent beta-thalassemia is expected to complete recruitment later this year.","The COMMAND study in ESA-na\u00efve lower risk MDS is open and ongoing, and we expect to have data available later this year from the Phase II myelofibrosis study that will help inform subsequent trials in myelofibrosis.","Now, turning to our CAR-T programs, both liso-cel and bb2121 remain on target for expected 2020 approvals. For liso-cel, on Slide 29, we remain on track for submitting the BLA in the second half of 2019, with an expected U.S. approval in mid-2020.","As we previously mentioned, the BLA will include a robust data package containing substantial follow-up on the relapsed refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cohort, allowing further characterization of the duration of response, and will include a safety database that will approaching 300 treated patients by the time of our submission - a safety database that will be two to three times that included in the initial submissions for the two approved CD19-directed CAR-Ts.","In addition, we are advancing liso-cel to earlier lines of treatment, with the second line studies, TRANSFORM and PILOT, in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients who are transplant eligible or nontransplant eligible respectively. As Nadim mentioned, the data presented at ASH from the Phase I TRANSEND CLL study, patients with relapsed refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia, who failed or were ineligible to receive a BTK inhibitor, are very promising. And we are initiating a pivotal Phase II trial in this high unmet need population.","Finally, for bb2121, on Slide 30, the enrollment for the pivotal KarMMa study in relapsed refractory myeloma was completed in November, and we are well positioned, pending follow-up, to submit the BLA for this first in class BCMA-direct CAR-T, leading to an expected U.S. approval in the second half of 2020.","The clinical teams continue to implement the development plan designed to evaluate bb2121 and earlier lines of therapy, including KarMMA 3, a randomized Phase III study in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma in patients who received at least two prior lines of therapy, and KarMMA 2, a Phase II study, which includes a high-risk cohort who have failed one prior line of treatment. A Phase II study in newly diagnosed myeloma is under development.","In closing, our teams have made excellent progress in advancing our five near-term programs. With the NDA submitted for fedratinib, the ozanimod NDA planned for March, the BLA for luspatercept to follow, and the pivotal studies for both CAR-T programs fully accrued, we are well positioned to remain on track for expected U.S. approvals for all five of these innovative products by the end of 2020.","I now will turn the call back over to Mark.","Mark Alles","Thank you, Jay, and thanks, David. Thanks, Terrie and Nadim. I also want to thank our colleagues around the world and across every function for another outstanding year. Really well done. Thanks so much.","2018 was an important year for Celgene, highlighted by strong operating performance and continued investment in the pipeline and people critical for our future. We are excited to accelerate and expand these opportunities by combining with Bristol-Myers Squibb later this year.","Before we open the call for questions, please note that while we look forward to answering any questions you may have about Celgene, we will refer certain questions pertaining to the acquisition of Celgene by Bristol-Myers Squibb to BMS.","Thank you. Chelsea, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Your line is open.","Geoff Meacham","Hey, guys. Good morning, and thanks for the question. I just had a few. On luspatercept, you guys had initial top-line data in June of last year. So, are there studies or analyses that you have yet to do? It just seems like it's a long time from data to filing when it was a pretty clean result. And the second one is on oral azacytidine. There hasn't been much discussion of this asset in the Bristol deal. What, if any, valuation consideration was given is my question? You guys gave out top-line data, I think, on two studies. I wasn't sure if little mention of this meant lower probability of success, or how to interpret that. Thanks a lot.","Jay Backstrom","Hi, Geoff. This is Jay. Let me start with luspatercept. This is the BLA that's going to include both MDS and beta-thalassemia. So, we have been working on that, as you know, since we had the top-line results. There are no additional analyses or anything else pending. We are really pushing on that. We are on track for what we declared earlier this year, which is We will have this in by tap.","And for oral azacytidine, two Phase III studies. Those trials are still ongoing. The second trial, which is maintenance for patients that successfully got through CR and AML, that's an event driven study and we are waiting for those results. Event rates sometimes slow down. That's happening here, so we are waiting to see what happens with that. And the low-risk MDS trial - that's a time dependent one. And they should read at or near the same time, probably later this year.","Geoff Meacham","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Brian Abrahams","Hi there. Thanks very much for taking my question. I was wondering if you could make any comments on ozanimod in terms of what your learnings have been from the additional non-clinical and clinical work that you have done there. How your interactions with the agency have been, whether you expect any delays in either the filing or the review based on the recent shutdown. Thanks.","Jay Backstrom","So, hi, Brian. This is Jay. So, from the learnings, it's real interesting, right? We were further characterized in one of the active metabolites. But our prediction going into that is given the selectivity, specificity, etc., that it would look similar. And, in fact, that's exactly what we have seen. So, that's really progressed well.","We are on track, as I mentioned, to submit in March. We have had no delays to date with the issue that we had previously with the government shutdown. It's premature to say what will happen. One hopes that it won't shut down, but right now it's full steam ahead. So, we are really - good engagement with the FDA. We are looking forward to getting that to them for their review.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Michael Yee","Hi. Thanks for the question. Question for Mark. The market seems to be a little bit nervous about the transaction - I guess I'm speaking from high level. Maybe you could just give some context to the market about how this all came about with Bristol and, more specifically, what gives you - or what can you say to shareholders to give them comfort that this will complete and that nothing else would happen. Thanks so much.","Mark Alles","Michael, thank you for the question. We are extremely excited about this transaction. As we have said from the beginning, and as my colleague Giovanni Caforio has said, we think this is the right transaction at exactly the right time.","Both companies, the EMS reported late last week - we reported today - have incredibly strong operating momentum. In fact, we come off of the best quarters separately and then collectively using pro forma in the history of both companies. For Celgene shareholders, it's quite clear how this unlocks and recognizes a lot of the value that the market has not assigned to use more recently.","The notion that we would create a new company that would have very dramatic leadership in the high specialty areas of oncology, inflammation, and immunology is again quite clear. I think of the separate companies' immunology and inflammation franchises coming together, where together they become a top five franchise with lots of opportunity including, as BMS has talked about more recently, the prospects for TIP II, which in Phase II looks fantastic and, of course, is moving into later stage development.","I think other aspects of the deal that are probably underappreciated is the scientific prowess of both companies and how, when they come together, we enhance our opportunity to accelerate research and development unlike we think either company alone could do. Obviously, that's the mother's milk for all of us. We have got to have innovation, new medicines, coming through. And I think that combined scientific prowess is underestimated.","I think, on the cultural side, there is also an underestimation about how these companies come together in such a complimentary way, where the mission, the purpose, is quite unique, but at the same time, it overlaps beautifully. So, I think this is a deal that investors weren't expecting. I think investors will get very comfortable with it over time.","But we are really excited about it. We are moving along the continuum to close this transaction sooner rather than later. But of course, we all know that we have got to go through the regulatory steps, shareholder approval, etc. But I'm quite excited about it, Mike, and I appreciate the chance to talk about it today.","Michael Yee","Perfect. Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Phil Nadeau","Morning. Thanks for taking my question. First, just on the Dr. Reddy's lawsuit. Could you give U.S. an update on the timelines, both for the IPR and the lawsuit? There seems, in particular, to be some controversy about exactly when discovery's going to be done in the lawsuit.","Jonathan Biller","Sure, Phil. This is Jonathan Biller. The timeline hasn't changed from really the way that we have been discussing it. In fact, discovery has not closed yet. The expert phase will close sometime this quarter. Most recently, in that case, as well as the other cases, you saw publicly that there was - the judge moved this to mediation. So, all of the cases are now moving to a mediation phase. We are in the process of scheduling that. There is been nothing scheduled on that front.","And with respect to the IPRs, sometime later in February, and then in March, there are three IPRs from Dr. Reddy's. Those are initiation decisions. So, what will be decided there is, the PTAB will decide whether or not to initiate those cases. If they chose to do so, it would be about a year before we'd have a decision.","And then, on the Lotus Alvogen, there is some additional IPR initiation decisions that will be made in March. And again, those are just on our method of treatment patents - MDS, in the case of Dr. Reddy's and multiple myeloma in the case of Lotus.","And so, they are not - they do not address all of our patents, in particular our polymorph patent. So, even as those things play out, they are not dispositive to the case.","Phil Nadeau","That's helpful. And then, my follow-up is actually on liso-cel. Can you give U.S. an update on the status of the manufacturing, in particular, is the commercial process ready and do you need to do any manufacturing work prior to submission? Thank you.","Nadim Ahmed","Yes, I think everything is on track from a manufacturing process - actually, across all of our CAR-T programs, both from the clinical trial perspective and the commercial perspective. So, as I said earlier, both our commercial teams and our manufacturing teams are just getting ready for approval and launch now. So, we feel very good about where we are.","Phil Nadeau","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Umer Raffat","Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. Nadim, perhaps the first one for you - or perhaps Terrie. Can you remind U.S. what percentage of REVLIMID sales are in first-line myeloma, and then also in transplant maintenance? And I'm looking to understand that as a percentage of total REVLIMID protected by the 2022 and the 2024 exclusivities that are in place.","And then, Mark, question for you. Should the Street expect additional REVLIMID settlements prior to the close of transaction? I know it's a hard question to answer, but would be curious about your thoughts and priority.","Nadim Ahmed","Umer, thanks for the question. Nadim first. So, we don't necessarily get specifically granular. But what I will say is that the majority of our share and use for REVLIMID, especially in the US, is the in the frontline setting - both nontransplant and transplant settings. And that's where we are seeing continued growth in Europe also. So, most of our use is coming from the frontline setting.","Mark Alles","Umer, thanks for the question about IP. And we already have settled, so I think our view about settlements is under the right conditions we have already demonstrated we are willing to settle. That's the Natco settlement that's in place. But it remains to be seen what those circumstances would be with additional filers. We are very confident in our patent state. We have been at this for a very long time and will continue to defend it in a very confident straightforward way. As we have said many times, and even presented more recently at ASH, as you will recall, we think it is an unlikely scenario that there would be an at-launch risk prior to the timeline that we have outlined that is out to 2022. But we are engaged, we are working through the process, we stay confident in our position and, without doubt, under the right circumstances, we would be willing to engage in settlements.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Salim Syed with Mizuho. Your line is open.","Salim Syed","Yes, hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just one on CAR-T, just long-term thinking here. So, there is some discussion in the marketplace that an allo-CAR-T can be actually more efficacious because an auto because you are taking the cells from a healthy donor. So, the debate here is not just about convenience, but about efficacy. I was wondering what Celgene has done to prepare for that - if you agree with that statement - and what the company has done to prepare for that so that, when you do hand the company over to Bristol, what do they exactly get on the allo front? Thank you.","Rupert Vessey","Hi, Salim. It's Rupert Vessey here. So, allo-CAR-T is still a theoretical prospect, and there are a number of hurdles that need to be overcome in order to achieve that objective, that will include extensive gemedicine strategies so that both the CAR-T itself is not detrimental to the patients, and the patients' immune system does not attack the CAR-T. So, those are problems that need to be solved from a scientific point of view. There are also a number of manufacturing issues that need to be solved as well.","On the auto-CAR-T side, obviously we know that works very well. And we know that there are a many manufacturing improvements that can be put in place over time that we will see, that I think will close the gap between these different approaches. That doesn't mean, though, that we are not really well aware of the allo approach. And we have an allo strategy that we are putting in place, including some agreements that we already have that are in the public domain. So, we are on top of that as well as it emerges.","Salim Syed","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Ying Huang","Hi, and good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple quick ones for me. First of all, can you talk about the ex U.S. version of the U.S. pricing contribution to the growth in the year of 2018, and what's your outlook for pricing overall for net product sales in 2019? And then, secondly, on the KarMMa 3 trial, the protocol calls for a security agent in the triplets. Can you tell U.S. whether it's a request on regulators or it's probably coming from your commercial consideration? Thank you.","Jay Backstrom","Yes, hi, this is Jay. I'll take the question on KarMMa 3. No, that design was a combination of what we thought would be a very good comparator to show the benefit of CAR-T moving forward with the triplet. We certainly have discussed it with agencies, so there is agreement and consistency with that. But that was a design as we thought about moving forward.","David Elkins","On the question around price, as we talked about for the full-year prices around 3%, and the net impact of price increases in the U.S. being offset by price declines in rest of world.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Aharon Gal","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Two of them, if you don't mind. First, on luspatercept, if you can give U.S. a bit of your feeling about what are the right benchmarks to think about when we think about luspatercept pricing, given the safety. Is this more EPOGEN or given to ability and efficacy more like the first line drugs we are seeing in MDS today, or another benchmark?","And the second question is about the timing of the CVR. You are progressing quite well on those programs, but if I look at the timeline that Jay has given U.S. today, it looks like you are going to have a six months window between the first potential approval and the time the CVR expires. And you have got to think about a typical review cycle by FDA, if there is a need for further answers, to be at least six months.","But with innovative oncology drugs it might be faster. Can you just give U.S. a little bit of your thinking about the safety margin you have built into those - into the CVR to ensure that, if there is extra questions by the FDA we are not going to lose the value of that? Thanks.","Nadim Ahmed","Thanks for your question. So, obviously we are early in the game when it come to pricing for luspatercept. And I think, what you can expect is we are going to make sure that the price matches the value proposition for the brand. So, we are not going to talk about analogues today, but We will continue to look at the data and make sure we price the value of luspatercept at launch.","Mark Alles","Ronny, on the CVR - this is Mark - thanks for the observations. And of course, many of the variables that you described you can imagine were part of our thinking and discussions through the negotiation. I can just tell you, we are very confident and comfortable with the timing and the probability that we achieve the CVR. So, thanks for that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alethia Young with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Alethia Young","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two quick ones. One, Mark, I just wanted you to - or team - opine on just - do you think that there will be more industry consolidation in the future? Obviously, you have a unique perspective in this question. Then, for Terrie, just - can you talk a little bit about, with OTEZLA, the growth year-over-year has been very good. And again, just break down for U.S. maybe where you are seeing this coming from. Is it indication or is certain geographies? And where will the future growth come from? Thanks.","Mark Alles","Alethia, it's Mark. I'll start with the broader macro question about consolidation. I really don't know. I think it's an interesting thing to think about in the context of Bristol and Celgene coming together. I think we have gone through these episodic windows where it makes sense or it doesn't make sense at the macro level. I think a lot of other companies have been in the media through their earnings, talking about their strategic outlook.","I think there is a very common theme, though, and that is that we have to search for innovation wherever it comes from, whether that's small cap, mid-cap, or in some cases - which is how BMS and Celgene think about this, we see ourselves as innovators of the first order and are happy to come together.","So, this certainly makes sense for us. I think every other company has to decide for themselves what makes sense for them long-term. But it's - as I answered the question Michael asked me - this is clearly the right transaction at the right time for Bristol-Myers Squibb and Celgene.","Terrie Curran","Yes, thanks for the question. It's Terrie here regarding OTEZLA. We are very pleased with the momentum heading into 2019. And the growth is really coming from a number of places. Firstly, the U.S. is continuing to really perform exceptionally well.","Our strategy has been, from the beginning of the launch, to really secure that positioning for first line post topical pre-biologic. And that was why we implemented the contracts to secure that position, so that 85% of our business is coming from patients that have just been on topical treatment.","Importantly, the ex U.S. business now is really growing very quickly. It took U.S. a little longer to secure investment outside of the US, and so core markets like Japan and France are preforming exceptionally well.","I think, heading into 2019, I think the growth will continue to come from that pre-biologic segment in the psoriasis market. Importantly, about 60% of patients in that segment remain untreated. So, there remains a really - a fairly large opportunity for U.S. to continue to grow in that segment. And then, we have got the life cycle opportunities, as I mentioned, that will also deliver growth into the future.","So, mild to moderate psoriasis, scalp psoriasis, Behcet's disease, and genital psoriasis. Those additional, either label enhancing or additional indications, will generate an additional $500 million at peak. So, it's really a great position heading into 2019 for OTEZLA.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with UBS. Your line is open.","Carter Gould","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Two from me. I guess, first, just to real quick - can you remind U.S. again, beyond what - the non-clinical bridging data and the PD data for ozanimod - any other incrementally new information that will go into this filing versus the last one? And then, just real quick on fedratinib. Any indication from FDA if there will be an ad comm and\/or do you expect one?","Jay Backstrom","This is Jay. So, let's start with ozanimod. I think one other piece that's going in, which is substantial, is we have had another year of data to follow-up for safety. So, I think we are really putting in a very, very strong safety data package. Data looks really very, very consistent with what we have seen early. So, I think that really strengthens it.","So, I think for ozanimod - and for fedratinib, I think it's a class of drug that's known to the agency. We will learn during the review whether or not they will invite U.S. to an advisory. At this point, I would have to say what I'm predicting. But I think the application's fairly straightforward. So, if we learn that later, We will certainly let folks know.","Carter Gould","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Newman with Canaccord. Your line is open.","John Newman","Hey, good morning. Thanks very much taking my question. Maybe a question for maybe Jay, Mark, and Nadim all together. I wondered if you could give U.S. an update on the current status of debate at the FDA with respect to MRD negativity for multiple myeloma. And the reason I'm curious is because you have obviously got a very aggressive and efficient clinical program moving forward for bb2121. And I'm wondering if there is a chance that perhaps some of these later studies, like the newly diagnosed study, could shift toward that MRD negativity endpoint over time. Thanks.","Jay Backstrom","Yes, this is Jay. I mean, the FDA certainly is interested in the MRD negativity to be applied in clinical trials. And they are actually encouraging sponsors to come forward and find ways to include that. To me, if I look at it from the regulatory framework, the ultimate place that they'd want to take this is to be using that as a recognized end point that they could use to action. That requires a little bit of additional work.","There is an ongoing effort, I think, across the industry to get data in front of the FDA for that to occur. But I think you are spot on. I think, as we look forward into these particularly frontline trials, given the improvement that's been made with current available therapies, FDA is very interested in finding ways to get surrogate endpoints built into that, such as an MRD negative.","So, today yes, we are including in our trials. FDA's encouraging such action by sponsors to engage and discuss with them. So, it's definitely something to watch.","John Newman","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Schmidt with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.","Michael Schmidt","Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. I had one around your CAR-T program. So, the question is what work have you done at this point around pricing and access for bb2121? And last is to what degree, for example, are you considering outcome space pricing strategies, as opposed to using a traditional one-time payment option for those types of products? And then, the second question would be on the market dynamics in multiple sclerosis. I was just wondering how you see the market and opportunity for oral drugs like ozanimod to be potentially impacted by the increased use of infused drugs like others?","Nadim Ahmed","Michael, I'll take the CAR-T question first and then hand over to Terrie. So, in terms of the access reimbursement environment, we continue to work with both our government affairs team and our market access team to work with payers, both commercial and CMS, to look at a range of ways to make sure patients get access to these treatments. So, in answer to your question, you are looking at the full range of spectrum of options, including innovative approaches as well. So, that's very much on our radar. Thanks for your questions.","Terrie Curran","Yes, just in terms of the MS market dynamics, I think what we see is a large market. It's a chronic market where there is a need for physicians to have a range of treatment options. I think, if you look at the segmentation of the market and the movement toward oral, there is an opportunity for ozanimod in the market. Clearly, as Jay talked to, the clinical data is very well differentiated and we see an oral for ozanimod in the first line - first switch - segment of the market.","Mark Alles","Chelsea, I think we have time for two last callers.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Dane Leone with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Dane Leone","Hi. Thank you for taking the questions and congratulations on the strong quarter. Just two for me on this whole therapy space. One, for bb2121, with the newly diagnosed plans in the second half, could you elaborate whether this would be as a lead into transplant, or for those patients who would not qualify for transplant, and whether there will be some sort of combination therapy with bb2121? And the second one is just any general update on plans to develop JCARH125 this year? Thank you.","Nadim Ahmed","Thanks for the question. So, let me start with bb2121. And just, again, to emphasize, this is our first in class, best in class, asset. And so, we are accelerating it as rapidly as possible and building out a strong development program around it, which is what leads U.S. to the frontline setting.","So, if you think about how Jay outlined the relapsed setting, we are looking at high-risk patient populations. And that's the approach We will take in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, across both nontransplant and transplant eligible patient populations.","So, definitely interested in that space, and these Phase II studies will allow U.S. to determine early activity in high-risk patient populations, which will then allow U.S. to build a rapid development program around the frontline setting. So, you can see them as proof of concept studies.","As for JCARH125, you saw the early data at ASH. So, we continue to enroll patients, so we continue to have follow-up for both JCARH125 and bb21217. And as the data emerge, We will assess the clinical profiles and make those data available. Thanks for your questions.","Dane Leone","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question will come from the line of Asthika Goonewardene with Bloomberg Intelligence. Your line is open.","Asthika Goonewardene","Hi, good morning, all. And thanks for squeezing me in. Two quick ones and a slightly bigger picture one for me. Can you give U.S. an update on the expected completion of enrollment for YELLOWSTONE? And then, to build on Umer's question, will the timeline specifically with Dr. Reddy's litigation permit a settlement before the deal closed? And for the big picture, we noted a flurry of deal activity, even after the Bristol-Myers deal - prior to the Bristol-Myers bid. Could you maybe tell U.S. a little bit more about what your overall strategy is with these included deals you plan on accomplishing before the Bristol deal closed? And if Bristol's getting involved in these - in the decision-making process or not. Thank you.","Jay Backstrom","Yep. Yes, so this is Jay. YELLOWSTONE is a program. We have got two inductions in the maintenance in Crohn's, so those all up and running, actively accruing. So, we are continuing with that. So, at this point, we won't be able to tell you the projected timeline. But, we are actively moving and progressing.","Jonathan Biller","So, I'll just jump in on the timeline with Dr. Reddy's. As you can appreciate, I'm sure, every piece of litigation has its own cadence. So, there is nothing between now and closing that would prevent two parties reaching a settlement, but there is also nothing that would impact it the other way either. So, it's just as Mark said earlier. In this process, subsequent to the Natco settlement, we have - everything's been as we expected. There is been no surprises to us. These cases are moving along the way that we would've imagined and we remain very confident in our position.","Mark Alles","Just before I had it off to David, the three deals that were referred to were deals with Kyn, Obsidian, and Triphase that we signed through the month of January. These are expansions of our efforts to look at protein degradation, to look at controllable CAR-T function, and mitigating certain side effects. In the case of Triphase, this is classic Celgene, where we look for novel mechanisms, new therapeutics, and in the case of Triphase, they have a molecular target that we think is important across a number of cancer cell lines. But it's very early. The upfront was $40 million. And of course we would love for this to pay out over time on success. David?","David Elkins","Yes, thanks, Mark. And we remain open for business. We are going to continue to follow the science, continue working with our collaborators, and We will do that in consultation with BMS as well. So, for everyone out there, very much we remain open.","With that, as we close out this call, we want to thank you again for everyone's interest in Celgene. We also want to thank all the Celgene employees around the world for another excellent year of operating results and commercial execution while making significant progress on advancing our pipeline.","As we progress into 2019, we look forward to continuing our strong momentum, executing against all of our regulatory milestones, and coming together with Bristol-Myers Squibb to create a leading and focused biopharmaceutical company.","Operator, you may now end the call.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day."],"4527":["Celgene Corp.

I would like to remind you that this call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Flanigan, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations at Celgene.","Patrick E. Flanigan - Celgene Corp.","Thanks, Nicole, and welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter earnings and year-end conference call. The press release reporting our financial results in addition to the presentation for today's webcast can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the corporate website, at www.celgene.com.","Joining me in the room today with prepared remarks are Mark Alles, our Chief Executive Officer; Peter Kellogg, our Chief Financial Officer; Jackie Fouse, our Chief Operating Officer; Michael Pehl, President of our Hematology & Oncology franchise; and Scott Smith, President and Global Head of our Inflammation & Immunology franchise.","As a reminder, during today's call we will be making forward-looking statements regarding our financial outlook in addition to regulatory and product development plans. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those forecasted. A description of these risks can be found in our most recent 10-Q on file with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we undertake no duty to update or revise them. Reconciliation of the adjusted financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available as part of the earnings release.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mark.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Thanks, Patrick. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As we shared with you a few weeks ago, 2016 was an outstanding year of strategic and operational progress for Celgene. We continued to strengthen the value propositions of our medicines, we accelerated and advanced our early, mid and late-stage pipeline, and we added new technology platforms, capabilities and compounds to our Research and Development engine.","For more than two decades, Celgene has been committed to discovering, developing and commercializing differentiated therapies that meaningfully improve and extend the lives of patients. In 2016, this commitment led to more than 500,000 patients being treated with one or more of our approved commercial products. Our clinical research teams and collaborators submitted approximately 400 scientific abstracts to global academic meetings and they are currently conducting more than 180 clinical trials.","This research footprint ties directly to our strategic intent to capitalize on our global leadership in hematology, build our oncology franchise beyond ABRAXANE and to rapidly expand our immunology and inflammation franchise to include new therapies for the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and other serious inflammatory conditions.","Our ability to invest in these opportunities is driven by the consistently strong operational performance of our teams around the world. And I'd like to thank my colleagues for their outstanding work last year.","Immediately following my remarks, Peter will review our excellent fourth quarter and full-year 2016 financial results. And Michael and Scott will discuss how the achievements of our therapeutic franchises have us well positioned for high growth in 2017 and beyond.","Our multi-year efforts to develop the full therapeutic value of our marketed products and to build a robust pipeline have placed Celgene at a new inflection point, with the potential for accelerating growth. Over the next two years, we expect data from 19 Phase III trials to become available. During the same time period, we currently expect to advance at least nine novel agents to pivotal trials and gain increasing clarity into the profiles of 14 new products, each with the potential for regulatory approval over the next five years.","Jackie will close our call today by providing her perspective on this exciting and important two-year window of incredible opportunity for us and for the patients we seek to serve. Our distributed research model continues to expand the depth and breadth of our early drug development programs. Together with our collaboration partners, we filed eight INDs in 2016 for molecules that we believe have first-in-class or best-in-class potential.","I'd like to thank Rupert Vessey, George Golumbeski and our business development team for another year of exceptional work adding to our high-potential pipeline. Some notable examples include: initiating our second collaboration with Agios aimed at the growing convergence of cancer cell metabolism and immuno-oncology; our acquisition of EngMab and EM901, a bispecific T cell-engaging antibody targeting BCMA in myeloma; our collaboration with Evotec to identify disease-modifying therapeutics for a broad range of neurodegenerative diseases; and our recently announced collaboration with Anokion, where we hope to move beyond broad immunosuppression and toward antigen-specific tolerance by utilizing the tolerogenic processes of the immune system.","And today we announced another important I&I transaction with our acquisition of Delinia and its lead program, DEL106. DEL106 is a novel IL-2 mutein Fc fusion protein designed to preferentially upregulate regulatory T cells, which, as you know, are critical to maintaining natural self-tolerance and immune system homeostasis. We are confident that both the Anokion and Delinia transactions will add to our understanding of T cell biology and to our efforts to develop improved treatments for immune and inflammatory diseases.","Thanks to the work of our colleagues around the world and across all functions, the state of Celgene is very strong. We are energized and optimistic about our future and look forward to updating you on our progress throughout 2017.","Thanks again. And please join me in welcoming Peter to our call.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. 2016 was an outstanding year for Celgene, with strong growth across our franchises and exceptional operating performance. In 2016, both OTEZLA and POMALYST hit blockbuster status, with both drugs posting sales over $1 billion. Michael and Scott will share details on the performance of the Hematology, Oncology and I&I franchises, respectively.","We continued to strengthen our portfolio in 2016 by adding new disruptive technologies to our distributed research model, further enhancing our innovative pipeline. Our momentum leading into 2017 and key catalysts that Mark mentioned expected in the 2017 and 2018 timeframe sets us up to continue to deliver high growth into the next decade.","Turning to our sales results. In the fourth quarter of 2016, total net product sales were $2.98 billion, a 17% increase year over year. Consistent with past periods, our top-line growth was predominantly volume-driven, with 14% of the growth coming from product volume. For the full year 2016, total net product sales were over $11 billion, a 22% increase year over year. 18% of the growth came from product volume.","Fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share was $1.61, a 36% year-over-year increase. Operating income drove the increase. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share were $5.94, a 26% year-over-year increase, again driven by operating income. Now, the benefit of a lower diluted share count was more than offset by a full year of interest expense related to the debt issued to acquire Receptos in August of the prior year.","Our operating model continues to deliver strong P&L leverage while we also maintain industry-leading investment in R&D. For the full year of 2016, our operating margin increased 300 basis points. We ended the year with approximately $8 billion in cash and marketable securities. Throughout the year, we used our balance sheet and cash flow to continue to invest in disruptive technologies while also repurchasing approximately $2 billion of Celgene shares.","Now, at the JPMorgan Conference earlier this month, we updated our full-year 2017 financial guidance. As a reminder, we expect total revenue to be between $13 billion to $13.4 billion, an increase of 18% year over year. We also expect our four main products to have sales at or above $1 billion in 2017. We expect a 150 basis point improvement in our operating margin, which will be primarily driven by leverage in SG&A.","2017 adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $7.10 to $7.25, a 21% increase over 2016. As we transition to 2017, I would like to remind you that in Q1 we will again see the customary P&L impact of our ACA doughnut hole payments, primarily for Rev and Pom, and the softer seasonality impacts of ABRAXANE, as we've seen in prior years and that you're all familiar with.","Additionally, Scott will update you shortly on some very positive news related to increased market access in the U.S. via successful managed care contracting for OTEZLA. These agreements should increase the speed and efficiency of patients' access, but will also increase our gross to net terms, so please consider these factors in your Q1 modeling.","We now expect our weighted average diluted share count to be approximately 815 million shares. Recall that this includes the impact of a new accounting standard in 2017 that revises the share count methodology. This change drives the majority of this guided increase in 2017 shares. We do fully expect to continue our share repurchase program in 2017.","I'd also like to add that our 2017 operating income is well hedged against major currencies. This provides very strong coverage of our 2017 operating income at our planned exchange rates. Building on an exceptional 2016, we really look forward to another strong year with continued operational and financial momentum.","Thank you. And I'll now turn the call over to my colleague, Michael.","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. The fourth quarter of 2016 was another great quarter for the Hematology and Oncology franchise. Our team produced an excellent sales performance, and we also continue to make significant progress with our development programs.","Our sales performance and growth was driven by strong underlying demand across brands and geographies. REVLIMID demand increased globally, with further share and duration gains in newly diagnosed myeloma. POMALYST\/IMNOVID continued to grow at an impressive rate in both U.S. and ex-U.S., and the brand achieved blockbuster status, surpassing $1 billion in net sales in 2016. Finally, ABRAXANE had steady growth outside the U.S., and the U.S. market continued to be relatively stable in spite of significant competitive market dynamics in lung cancer and breast cancer.","Our 2017 key drivers are on track. We are awaiting the U.S. and EU approvals of REVLIMID in transplant-eligible maintenance and U.S. POMALYST approval in combination with daratumumab. Triplet combinations in myeloma will continue to drive share and duration around the globe. The new drug application for enasidenib was submitted to the FDA at the end of December and we expect a U.S. regulatory decision by the second half of 2017. And we'll have multiple Phase III data readouts by the end of 2017, with the RELEVANCE and AUGMENT trials for REVLIMID in indolent lymphoma and the ABRAXANE APACT trial in adjuvant pancreatic cancer.","Our mid to late-stage pipeline is advancing and we are accelerating many programs. We have 11 pivotal programs with existing and new assets enrolling and we hope to initiate more than 10 additional pivotal programs with our later-stage pipeline assets by the end of 2017. I will share more of those details later in my remarks.","REVLIMID net sales grew 16% year-over-year and slightly declined by 4% quarter-over-quarter. As you will recall, we had significant Russian tenders in both the fourth quarter 2015 and the third quarter 2016 which impacted REVLIMID's annual and sequential growth rate. Without the impact of the Russian tenders, REVLIMID Q4 net sales grew approximately 10% year-over-year outside of the U.S. and the REVLIMID Q4 year-over-year volume growth outside of U.S. was 14%. We are very pleased with the performance in underlying growth drivers for REVLIMID globally.","U.S. REVLIMID TRxs increased versus prior year and versus prior quarter. Outside the U.S., we are equally optimistic, as REVLIMID continues to have global share and duration gain, with very successful launches in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. We have 20 countries reimbursed for NDMM and we expect to have additional reimbursement in France in Q1. We're still early in the international launch and expect significant market share growth in Europe and Japan during 2017.","Finally, we are beginning to see the cumulative impact of NDMM and triplets on treatment duration in many markets and duration is increasing rapidly. In addition to the ongoing launch in lung transplant eligible patients, we have many additional drivers coming soon. We are expecting approval from maintenance and transplant eligible NDMM patients in the U.S. in the first quarter and in the EU in the first half of the year. We believe this will be a significant driver for REVLIMID globally, as it will give us the opportunity to highlight the unique value proposition of REVLIMID in this patient population and to further educate on treating patients to disease progression.","We are also in discussion with health authorities regarding the submission of an NDA for RVD in first-line transplant and lung transplant patients. This would create additional opportunities to expand the use of REVLIMID-based triplets.","2017 will also be an important year for our lymphoma program. The R-squared based RELEVANCE and AUGMENT trials in indolent lymphoma will both read out by the end of 2017. We have strong clinical evidence from multiple Phase II studies with R-squared in this indication and we are very optimistic about the benefit of R-squared versus current standard of care.","In 2017 we also expect to complete enrollment of the ROBUST trial, our R-CHOP induction Phase III study in first-line diffuse large B-cell patients with the ABC subtype. All of these lymphoma trials will generate significant growth and opportunity for REVLIMID in the coming years and are complementary to our efforts to bring next generation CELMoDs to NHL patients.","POMALYST\/IMNOVID delivered impressive growth in Q4, with 29% year-over-year and 11% sequential revenue growth. The brand is maintaining its leadership position in the third and fourth-line plus patient segment in major markets, in spite of the increasing number of available new therapies and later lines of treatment. In fact, POMALYST\/IMNOVID has experienced accelerated growth in many markets, as duration continues to increase at a fast pace driven by the increased worldwide views of POMALYST\/IMNOVID in triplet combinations. In addition, we are awaiting the FDA approval POMALYST in combination with daratumumab for relapsed refractory myeloma by June of this year.","Finally, we are successfully enrolling key development programs for POMALYST\/IMNOVID to further support the use of multiple combinations. Our Phase III OPTIMISM trial in combination with bortezomib in second or later treatment lines is expected to complete enrollment in the first half of 2017.","ABRAXANE continues to have quite stable demand. ABRAXANE net sales grew 14% quarter-over-quarter and declined by 1% year-over-year. U.S. business had a significant increase in Q4 due to the impact of customer buying patterns. U.S. ABRAXANE maintains its leadership position in pancreatic cancer and demand is relatively stable in breast and lung cancer.","Outside of the U.S., ABRAXANE grew 5% year-over-year and 6% quarter-over-quarter, driven by pancreatic cancer. We still see multiple growth drivers ahead for ABRAXANE. We expect the results of the APACT adjuvant pancreatic cancer trial to be available by the end of 2017 and the pivotal ABRAXANE\/Tecentriq combination trials in non-small cell lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer will read out in 2018.","In addition to our excellent financial performance, I'd like to provide you with an update on some of the exciting progress we are making with our rich mid and late-stage pipeline in multiple myeloma, lymphoma, myeloid diseases and solid tumors.","Starting with multiple myeloma, our BCMA collaboration with bluebird continues to progress nicely. Interim data from the ongoing Phase I study of BB2121 were presented in December at the Triple symposium in Munich. These data showed impressive efficacy and safety in the quadruple refractory myeloma population. We are moving forward with plans to initiate a pivotal program for BB2121 in patients with relapsed refractory myeloma later this year.","We are now enrolling eight trials for the durvalumab FUSION program. These studies are enrolling in newly diagnosed myeloma, relapsed\/refractory myeloma, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, CLL, MDS and AML. These trials are in combination with key inline brands and novel agents. We expect pivotal study-enabling data in myeloma, MDS and AML to be available throughout 2017.","Moving to lymphoma. In addition to the REVLIMID Phase III readouts at the end of the year, the CC-122 program continues to enroll multiple proof-of-concept studies in lymphoma, CLL, myeloma and hepatocellular carcinoma, both as monotherapy and in combination with new agents. We expect data from most of these indications this year and we are planning to initiate the first pivotal program in relapsed refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma by year end, with further pivotal opportunities as additional data reads out.","Our collaboration with Juno to develop JCAR017 continues to advance. Based on very encouraging NHL data shared at ASH in December, the EMA granted JCAR017 access to the Priority Medicine, or PRIME, scheme for relapsed refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We hope to initiate a pivotal study in this indication later this year.","We are very excited about the number of opportunities we have to truly transform the myeloid space. We are pleased to announce that we submitted a new drug application to the FDA for enasidenib, or AG-221, in relapsed refractory AML at the end of last year. The NDA was based on data from the Phase I, II study of AG-221 in patients with relapsed refractory AML. We expect a regulatory decision on enasidenib in the U.S. in this indication in the second half of 2017, while we're pursuing first-line AML opportunities in combination with azacitidine and standard chemotherapy.","We've also made great progress with the collaboration with the luspatercept collaboration with Acceleron. Our two Phase III trials in lower-risk MDS patients and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia will be fully recruited in 2017, and we are actively engaged in planning to further maximize the opportunity of the asset in additional patient segments and indications. We plan to initiate a Phase II trial in myelofibrosis later this year and are evaluating additional pivotal opportunities in low-risk MDS and beta-thalassemia.","Our two CC-486 Phase III studies, known as the QUAZAR studies, in higher-risk MDS and first-line AML maintenance, continue to enroll well. Data presented at ASH in December highlighted the impressive results of CC-486 in patients who were relapsed or refractory to injectable hypomethylating agents, so-called HMA failures. These data helped to further understand the differentiated profile of CC-486 and allow us to work on potential additional pivotal opportunities in MDS and AML.","We continue to build our solid tumor franchise beyond ABRAXANE based on encouraging data in relapsed refractory neuroblastoma as monotherapy and in combination with AVASTIN we exercised an option to acquire the rights to marizomib during the fourth quarter. We are advancing marizomib in first-line neuroblastoma in combination with Temodar radiotherapy, and we hope to initiate a respective pivotal program later this year.","Finally, through our collaboration with OncoMed, we are awaiting data from our ongoing demcizumab program. An ongoing Phase II randomized trial is evaluating demcizumab plus ABRAXANE and gemcitabine in patients with first-line metastatic pancreatic cancer, and we expect to see data from this study in the first half of 2017, allowing us to decide on a potential pivotal path in this indication.","In summary, we had another excellent quarter and year for the Hematology and Oncology franchise. Our financial performance was driven by strong underlying demand for both REVLIMID and POMALYST\/IMNOVID. We have many key growth drivers for 2017 in place, including upcoming regulatory decisions on REVLIMID, POMALYST and enasidenib. There are multiple Phase III data readouts expected by year end for REVLIMID and ABRAXANE. We have multiple pivotal programs underway, and we will be making many decisions to initiate additional pivotal programs for our later-stage pipeline assets in 2017.","Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to Scott.","Scott A. Smith - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Michael, and good morning. 2016 was a great year for Celgene I&I. Importantly, OTEZLA became a blockbuster product for the treatment of psoriatic disease. Additionally, we laid the groundwork to expand our global footprint and prepare for launches in several major European countries as well as Japan. We moved the pipeline forward by advancing all major molecules through a series of important milestones.","Looking specifically at OTEZLA, Q4 sales were $305 million dollars, with full-year sales exceeding $1 billion, which represents a 116% year-on-year increase. This blockbuster milestone was achieved in only the second full year of commercialization.","As you can see, the majority of this growth continues to be driven by the U.S. Specifically looking at the U.S., we see continued growth in market share driven by DTC, gains in our prescriber base and increases in persistence and compliance. 90% of patients are coming to OTEZLA from something other than a biologic.","Importantly, we are entering 2017 with an expanded U.S. access footprint, as we have increased our contracting activity and expect to see additional 70 million to 100 million commercial lives with biologic step-free access to OTEZLA. Although in the past year most patients prescribed OTEZLA were ultimately able to gain access, these new agreements will make it substantially easier for a large number of patients to initiate OTEZLA therapy.","All these factors taken together will allow us to effectively compete for share leadership in the large psoriasis market. We are also focused on a number of new launches in 2017, driven by recent positive reimbursement decisions for psoriasis and PSA in France and the UK, and PSA in Italy. We expect a pricing decision for both indications in Japan by the end of Q1. In Japan, OTEZLA will be the first oral psoriasis product launched in over 25 years. There is a tremendous opportunity for an oral product with a differentiated benefit risk profile in this sizeable market.","Beyond geographic expansion, we have a robust lifecycle plan including submission of a once-daily formation and initiation of a Phase III program in scalp psoriasis. We have strong proof-of-concept in scalp psoriasis. And this trial, if successful, will enable for us to communicate the value of OTEZLA for use in this difficult-to-treat and significant subset of psoriasis patients.","Turning now to ozanimod. We are very excited to be getting pivotal data from both the 12-month SUNBEAM and 24-month RADIANT studies in the first half of 2017. These large Phase III active comparator trials have annualized relapse rate, or ARR, as the primary endpoint and will form the core of an expected NDA submission by year end. Clinical results to-date in Phase II show strong efficacy and a differentiated safety profile. The ARR at two years in the Phase II program was 0.18.","When we look at the data relative to other therapies studied in RMS, oral ozanimod falls at the upper end of the efficacy range. This efficacy, together with an expected differentiated safety profile resulting from the S1P1 specificity and other characteristics of this model, should lead to an improved benefit risk profile for patients. We believe ozanimod will become a cornerstone product for Celgene in the area of neuroscience.","As we move into 2017, we look to expand the OTEZLA opportunity for the treatment of psoriatic disease throughout the world. We have built a very strong foundation for OTEZLA and we see many more growth opportunities to come, in both the near and longer term. This year we expect to fully enroll critical studies in our IBD program, including the large treat through pivotal trial for GED-301 in the treatment of Crohn's disease. We are very excited about the transformational potential of this novel oral treatment approach in an area of very high unmet medical need.","2016 was a pivotal year for Celgene I&I and we've already begun 2017 with strong momentum and enthusiasm.","Thank you for your attention. And I'd like to turn the call over to Jackie.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","Thanks, Scott, and good morning, all. We entered 2017 at Celgene looking forward to as exciting a year as we have ever had. The commercial momentum our teams have built in both of our franchises is outstanding, and you see that reflected in our annual guidance. Our key brands are extremely well-positioned to succeed in the markets in which we compete, serving unmet medical needs through clear value propositions.","On top of that, we expect very important Phase III trial readouts this year. These include trials for new compounds, such as ozanimod, and trials for label expansions for existing products. We will also move a number of key programs into pivotal trials, and we will have proof-of-concept data from our early pipeline efforts. Many of these potential products are not yet reflected in our financial models, and we look forward to updating those models when we have the data to allow us to do so. We feel highly confident about achieving our 2020 targets and that we will have upside to those, given the tremendous optionality we have in our portfolio.","Another exciting aspect about the period we are entering is that it represents the start of what will be several years of catalyst events that will shape the Celgene portfolio of the future and our long-term growth trajectory. As we produce data across our research and development pipeline from early to late-stage programs, I am confident you will start to better appreciate the potential we have to grow at industry-leading rates well beyond 2020 and throughout the decade 2021 to 2030.","For 2017, you can focus on several major milestones as listed on the webcast slide. These will bring approvals that will contribute to our ongoing product and indication diversification. These are but a selection out of a much longer list of objectives we have set for ourselves for the coming year, and you can find that longer list in the appendix to our quarterly materials.","We have a history of delivering across short-, medium- and long-term time horizons, and we will continue to deliver. 2017 and 2018 are shaping up to be transformative years supporting our ongoing success, and we look forward to sharing our milestone results with you throughout the course of the year.","Thank you. And I will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Hey, team. Thank you so much for taking my question and also thanks to the whole Celgene organization for all the help you gave my team while I was out. I really appreciate it. My question is a fairly simple one. I'm not sure who to direct it to, perhaps Jackie. But I think during the JPMorgan presentation, you mentioned that you thought you could grow. And I think it was earnings from the time period of 2020 to 2030. And I know that's a long way away. But I'd be curious to know if you can provide any other color on that? Do you think, for example, Jackie, that you can grow earnings every year in that time period despite what will be the probable expiration of REVLIMID exclusivity? Thank you.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","Thank you for the question. You said simple. I'm not so sure. But I think when you look at the totality of our portfolio, both with respect to where we are right now and the tremendous momentum that we have, not only in the existing business, but the momentum that the teams have generated across the pipeline and how our business development activities continue to feed into that, we've got a ton of optionality in this portfolio. And no matter how you go through it and do risk adjustments and things like that, I think we have a very, very strong chance of growing annually each and every year throughout the decade beyond 2020.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Got you. (30:36)","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","There are a number of compounds that are very specifically not in our financial models. I think we highlighted some of those during the conference. They include the JCAR017, luspatercept NDS, durvalumab, ABRAXANE IO, BB2121, marizomib, demcizumab, CC-122. I can go through like eight or 10 different products that are not included in the models yet at all. And I think everybody will remember that we put a placeholder in the 2020 targets after the Receptos acquisition. But the potential value to Celgene of the ozanimod indications is not by any stretch of the imagination yet modeled in our numbers. And we're going to start to have data from those trials to do that soon. So it's very exciting. And I think we're going to grow for a long, long, long, long time.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","So, Mark, it's Mark. Just to maybe wrap up the question because it's very, very important. I appreciate you starting off with it. The other thing we talked about in JPMorgan in this context of optionality is that we have 30 unique molecules in development with 50 programs supporting those molecules. We gave some color, I think, and clarity around 14 of those molecules, 10 of which we think have blockbuster potential. And a few that we already think have peak potential in the multibillion-dollar type range. So that kind of clarity going into the window that Jackie just spoke to, you're asking about, gives us that increased confidence about growing beyond the loss of exclusivity, particularly of lenalidomide, REVLIMID.","But I'll also make the point that the strength of the company now puts us in a position to continue to build off of that very strong base. Our (32:26), our research groups, are doing outstanding work advancing next-generation designer CELMoDs across a number of diseases. We are just on the front end of understanding and unlocking how to design through protein homeostasis new small molecules. On the BD front, as you heard, 2016 was another great year for the company. And I highlighted a few of those transactions during the prepared remarks. We want to follow the science. We want to keep building the company. So along with Jackie's comment, we did provide, I think, some clarity about why we feel confident.","So thanks for the question. And, Patrick, we'll go to the next one.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of from Eric Schmidt of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking my question. I think it's much, much simpler than Mark's. For Michael on the Q4 REVLIMID revenues. I think even if you correct for the Russian tender offer, as you did in your discussion I believe, if my math is correct, that ex-U.S. REVLIMID and worldwide REVLIMID sales were down on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Is there anything else going on? And do you still think this franchise is accelerating? Thank you.","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","Thanks, Eric, for the question. And I think to start with this question, it makes sense to really look at the overall growth that we have throughout the year. When we're looking at U.S., we had a 3% sequential growth and 24% annual growth. So all the growth drivers are intact.","What you see in Europe is really an impact of a large Russian tender that we had in Q3. We also had a large Russian tender by the end of 2015, so that has impacted the annual growth rates and the sequential growth rates. If you take the Russian tender out, I think what can you can see is very good growth in Europe both from a volume perspective and from a sales perspective. So all of the growth drivers are intact. Shares are increasing. Duration is increasing, all of that worldwide. What you see in Europe was really impacted by a large Russian tender.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I have a question I guess for Peter or Mark on the capital allocation front. Just wondering what your latest thoughts are with regard to potentially start paying a dividend. Thanks.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Thanks, Cory. I'll start and maybe Mark can jump in. Look, we are always thinking about capital allocation in a way that, number one, takes care of our strategic needs, but, number two, really supports our shareholders and provides great returns to them. So we're always evaluating this.","Clearly, as we've described and Mark and Jackie just highlighted, we are right now in a period where we have a lot of Phase III outcomes, cards turning over over the next two years. And as those come through, it'll really clarify just how solidly we see the next decade of growth drivers and so forth. If that turns out very well, then I think really we do open up the discussion about capital allocation and think very freely about new approaches and so forth. So I think that's around the corner. That said, we do want to see that data come through a bit and really build that momentum. And then I think, clearly, we're open to discussion.","I think I would say that we've asked the question a lot to our broad base of investors. And, in fact, what I just described is something that has been the major feedback we've gotten. After our Analyst Day back in September, October, we actually did a survey. And that was one of the major dynamics coming back from all of our investor base was really build that next-generation pipeline, continue to drive the potential of your current assets. And then at a lower priority, as you start to solidify your pipeline results and data, come back with a capital allocation process to think through what the optimum approach is there.","And so we're listening to our investors, really trying to be as dynamic as we can. But it's certainly on our radar and our planning. And we'll keep an open mind to it for sure.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges of Leerink Partners. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much. And I just wanted to ask a couple questions about the myeloma outlook. Michael, you mentioned the approval for maintenance post-transplant. I'm just wondering, first of all, how routine is that already in clinical practice, meaning how much incremental penetration do you think that the approval would get you?","And then a longer-term question on myeloma. The data just seems to be getting better and better for REVLIMID. And wondering how feasible you think it is that next-generation CELMoDs, such as 122 or 220, could be advanced to the front-line setting by early 2020s. Or is that just looking like it's too big a hill to climb? Thanks.","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","Yeah, thanks, Geoffrey, for the question. Starting with your first one about usage and maintenance post transplant patients ready. The picture is actually different in U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., around about 50% of the eligible transplant patients are getting REVLIMID in maintenance onto the progression. The other 50% don't. They either don't get maintenance at all or they don't get REVLIMID or they get REVLIMID and maintenance but not onto the progression. So we think there's a really nice opportunity in the U.S.","In Europe, we don't have any maintenance at the moment of time. The reason it is very simple. In order to get reimbursed, you have to have approval. And we are very optimistic that we're going to be able to obtain that. So combined the opportunity in the post-maintenance setting is probably as big as the opportunity that we have in the non-transplant setting. So it's a very substantial opportunity for the company.","Talking about the myeloma market as such and the opportunity, there's a couple of points to make, starting with, yes, the data with REVLIMID is really good. But there is segments of patients that are absolutely not doing well. Even with the best combination at this moment of time, which we think is probably the combination of an IMiD, in that case, REVLIMID, with daratumumab. A third of the patients is relapsing after six to 12 months. All of these patients are going to die after three to four years. That's number one.","There are high-risk patients out there with adverse cytogenetics, del(17p), for example, which are going to die after three to four years. There is elderly, frail patients out there where you cannot use triplets at this moment of time. And then, unfortunately, you still have patients who are relapsing after all available treatment options.","So I think there's multiple options for us to develop, not just CELMoDs, but our whole portfolio that we're having with CAR-T, with bispecific antibodies, with new CELMoDs, and we're going to be very, very thoughtful and going into the right patient populations right from the get-go.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Salim Syed of Mizuho. Your line is now open.","Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Hey there. Thanks for the question, guys, and shout-out to my former boss, Mark Schoenebaum. Mark, good to hear your voice and I miss you, man. One of the best bosses ever, everybody. So anyway, thanks for the question, guys. I just had a general one for Mark \u2013 the other Mark. Mark, can you just comment on the Trump administration? Any comments? Any discussions you've had with the Trump administration? Can you characterize the level of interaction you've had with them and maybe what you've learned from those discussions? Thank you.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Yeah, thanks for the question. Appreciate it. Just for the record, we've not as a company or me as a person have not had direct interaction with the administration. I think the indirect has been quite intense and quite measurable through our different trade associations, pharma, bio, et cetera. So I think the media interaction and the awareness is quite high of what the industry is trying to advance, which is the value of what we do economically, how we create jobs. I think the latest count is some four million jobs are generated by the industry. Of course, the economic value of what our medicines do for people who can work and be productive in their lives is part of that equation.","So this information is being talked about. And personally, I'm extremely excited because I think there's a lot of education going on through a lot of the back-and-forth, a lot of the different stakeholder groups talking about value versus cost and price. The notion of comprehensive transparency is getting a lot of attention.","So we're very, very optimistic that the Trump administration is wanting to and will focus on preserving and enhancing the competitive marketplace as a way to balance value and the economics of health care in general.","There's a lot of attention of course about repeal and replace. We have to see how that plays out. But there are a number of things we're excited about. We think it's going to be a pro-innovation, a pro-industry policy environment. But we're waiting, and of course, we'll engage appropriately whenever we would be invited to discuss these topics.","So thanks for the question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks very much. I appreciate the question. I had a question on ozanimod. Scott, could you just talk a little bit about what your expectations are for the data from those two studies and how you think it might compare in the marketplace? And then just remind us what your plans are for that agent. Are you still considering launching that on your own, or should we think about you partnering that asset? Thanks.","Scott A. Smith - Celgene Corp.","Thank you for the question. I think to answer the second part first, we would wait to understand and see the fullness of the Phase III data, which we will in the first half of this year, to make any final decisions around partnering. Certainly there's been a lot of interest in the asset.","We will in parallel tracks be prepared to launch and commercialize on our own. But also when we have the fullness of the data, have discussions with appropriate companies to see if there's something which could be additive in terms of value to the asset and to patients. So we would be prepared to do either, but wait until we had good Phase III data.","What our expectations are. When you take a look at the pre-clinical models and where you start to see differentiation is because of the S1P1 and S1P5 specificity as opposed to S1P3, plus volume of distribution, titration, more rapid recovery of lymphocyte levels, other things. All those things together, I think, will lead to a differentiated safety profile which will have a different benefit risk.","And you saw that pre-clinically, you see that in the Phase II data. And we'll have to wait until we see the Phase III data. But certainly our hypothesis is that you would have top-end efficacy with a better safety profile leading to differentiated benefit risk in the long term.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas of Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, guys. Thank you. I just want to follow up, Jackie, on the comments you made at JPMorgan as well. So I think you had mentioned in 2020 guidance, you guys raised it for $1 billion to include the Receptos acquisition.","And with data this year for ozanimod and maybe a launch in 2018 and maybe more data next year in EC, just trying to understand where the confidence comes that that could be either conservative or at least achievable just because (44:35) itself was about $1 billion, a little bit over $1 billion after two years. And the MS market has had some stress lately. So just maybe give us color on your thoughts on the MS market and how you're thinking about how it's evolved the acquisition and the guidance? Thanks.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","Hi, Robyn. Thanks for the question. So let me start and then I'll also maybe pass it over to Scott. So if you look at the totality of the potential for ozanimod, we, I think, are thinking about the ulcerative colitis market as being very important as well.","So the placeholder that we have in the model covers the total product without a lot of fine tuning of certain assumptions around the different indications. And with the profile that we're hoping that it will have, as Scott said, we think we are going to have a highly differentiated molecule. So you're going to have the data from the two Phase III MS trials this year. And then the team will submit that by the end of the year. Then we're going to have the data from the ulcerative colitis trial next year and would be submitting. So you're potentially in the market with two indications and some time to start to see some ramp-up there by 2020.","And as importantly, personally, I think beyond that period of time when you think about 2021 and beyond and even past 2026, given the intellectual property on some of these new compounds, these are tremendous opportunities for us to have significant revenue products. And we highlighted that in some of our JPMorgan materials in terms of the peak sales potential and a more diversified product portfolio.","The other thing about 2020 is the existing business is doing better than we had expected at the time we gave the 2020 targets originally, so that base and the assumptions underlying, whether it's REVLIMID or POMALYST durations and some other things, is outperforming.","Remember, at one time we thought REVLIMID would be a $7 billion drug in 2017. It was a $7 billion drug in 2016. So there's very low risk associated with our ability to hit those targets. And the mix may even be a little bit different than we thought, which gives you upside potential both in 2020 and beyond.","Scott A. Smith - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Jackie. So our current assumptions around ozanimod, as I said just a minute ago, are a differentiated asset from what you see in Gilenya. And by the time we get to 2020, we will be in the second full year of launch in MS and the first full year of launch in UC, so there will be contribution from both those programs. And we think both the UC and MS programs are very, very viable and relatively equal size in terms of their opportunity. So that's what gives us the confidence that we will be able to deliver on the numbers in 2020 and beyond.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just for Mark or Peter, just wondering if you can maybe provide some perspective on U.S. corporate tax reform? I know there are a couple different options out there, or proposals. But as you think about your tax rate and the driver long term, anything you can help frame for us there? Thank you.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Sure. Thank you. Obviously, we're tracking that very closely, and our team is very involved with a number of the other large biotech and pharma companies in Washington. So we're very close to it. But, as you indicated, it's not yet exactly clear how it's going to play out, so it would be hard for me to be totally definitive.","But I would say that, overall, we are guardedly optimistic, and I think growing optimism that what will come out will be very pro-innovation of corporate tax reform. You know, the timing, of course, is pretty hard. And we think that could be very exciting and provide significant long-term benefit to the U.S. economy as well as to our industry. And obviously overall what we're excited about is the fact that this would really level the playing field vis-\u00e0-vis foreign multinationals and, quite frankly, remove any tax incentive to locate activities and investments offshore, which is what it's all about. This is really pro-U.S. multinational and building the business in the U.S. So we are very supportive of all that.","You know, if we were to triangulate based on what we know now and, again, with the caveat that we don't know how it'll play out, we are not sure that it would necessarily imply a significant change to our tax rate, which you know right is now is kind of in the high teens. And if we were to build up a scenario of what might come through, we would see some things helping us, some things maybe being slightly negative. But net-net, we think all of that would be easily navigated.","What would be much more positive for us overall is the fact that we would have access to our worldwide cash flows going forward, as well as the cash we have right now. And we think that would just allow us to accelerate all the strategic initiatives we have and all the shareholder-friendly actions that we have.","So we think overall it's a great thing. We're very supportive. We're very engaged. And we're excited to see something really positive come out for the industry, because we think we are, as Mark said earlier, an industry that provides great jobs, is growing very rapidly and really provides tremendous value in the health care world. And we just would love to keep that going with a better level playing field.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. I wanted to ask a question on ABRAXANE in two areas. One was the adjuvant Phase III study in pancreatic will read out this year. I wanted to ask about your confidence there and how risky that was, realizing it's an option.","And then secondly in lung, as we know in chemo combos, Merck has filed, although not using ABRAXANE. Just wanted to understand your views on whether that would help. And then whether the other chemo combos in lung are using ABRAXANE and how to think about that as well. Thanks.","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","Yeah, hi, Michael. Thanks for the question. So starting with the APACT study. So it's going to read out by the end of the year. The time point at which it is exactly going to read out is going to be event-driven. We've been showing recently at the ASCO GI Meeting data in an earlier patient population, so patients with local advanced pancreatic cancer. And the results look really excellent. Many of these patients that were not operable before became operable. Which tells us this that the combination of ABRAXANE and gemcitabine is really an excellent choice in patients with earlier cancer, pancreatic cancer. So we are very confident in that regard. And there was really not a lot of progress for those patients in the past year, so if the study's positive, and we assume it's going to be, there's going to be a very fast uptake of the combination.","In terms of the chemo combos, we also followed the recent development with Merck. What basically it tells you I think is a couple of things. A, monotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors is not the right thing to do with everybody. B, in patients with low expression of PD-L1, the jury is still out who's going to qualify for I-O, I-O versus chemo I-O. And, C, we really think that ABRAXANE has an advantage versus other chemotherapies in that patient population. Roche has been publishing in abstract form the response rates that have been achieved in the non-small cell lung cancer population with the combination of ABRAXANE and Tecentriq and it really looks excellent. We think those data are definitely better than anything that has been published.","So we think we're going to have advantage in the chemo field. We think there is going to be a role for chemo I-O combinations in patients who are low or low-expressive. And we also think that we're going to have an economic advantage compared to I-O, I-O ABRAXANE I-O is just going to be very favorable for payers. So I hope that answers your question.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Yatin Suneja of SunTrust Bank. Your line is now open.","Yatin Suneja - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I have a question for Scott on OTEZLA. So the rest of the world should be a major driver going forward. Could you maybe comment on the market dynamics there? What sort of contribution should we anticipate from, let's say, Europe and Japan? Obviously we understand there is a pricing difference. But how do you see that market relative to U.S.? Thank you.","Scott A. Smith - Celgene Corp.","Thank you for the question. We're very excited in 2017 to really start to get going in Europe and commercialization and in Japan. In Europe, in particular, reimbursement decisions, these are highly managed areas. They can take a little while. But we ended up I think in a very, very good place with our reimbursement in France, where we don't have to have a first hospital prescription like biologics do.","We've got a very favorable label and hopefully good pricing and reimbursement finalization in Japan in the next little while. So I think there are some markets and the majority of markets in Europe and, again, Japan I would point out as well where I think we have a tremendous opportunity to really drive growth.","There are generally lower prices. But with full reimbursement and indications to be used early in these countries, I think the rest of the world will start to catch up to the contribution that we see for the U.S. And longer term at peak sales sometime deep into the 2020 I would expect relatively equal contributions between the U.S. market and everything outside of the U.S.","Patrick E. Flanigan - Celgene Corp.","And, Nicole, I think we have time for two more callers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alethia Young of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess one for Scott. I wanted to get some color on with all these psoriasis drugs coming to the market, how do you see if there's potential for further expansion for OTEZLA in the United States? Thanks.","Scott A. Smith - Celgene Corp.","Thank you. So it's a better time to be a psoriasis patient than it has been in many years, when the only modalities from a targeted perspective were TNF inhibitors. And now you've got drugs like OTEZLA to be used earlier in therapy and you've got IL-1223s, IL-23s, IL-17s, which are coming post-TNF. And the utilization is generally there. So the market is starting to segment out.","But if you take a look at utilization rates in the U.S., still only about 20% of patients with moderate to severe disease are being treated. So I think there's still tremendous potential to be moving this market forward.","As we talked about, Peter talked about and I talked about earlier on the call, some contracting leading to agreements to have a number of commercial lives bio-step free going into 2017 I think will increase our access and ease of getting patients onto drug, onto OTEZLA, and I think will be a significant driver for continued market share development and growth in the United States.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I have another ozanimod one. Scott, can you talk about the level of commercial investments in MS that you have already made ahead of the Phase III data?","And then, Mark, when I look at the large number of deals you guys have done, they obviously have a HemOnc and I&I bias. Would neurology become a major focus area? Does that depend on data? And is there capacity for another category at Celgene? Thanks.","Scott A. Smith - Celgene Corp.","So thank you for the question. Relative to ozanimod commercial spend, it depends on how you define what commercial spend looks like. Certainly, there are commercial preparatory activities that you would do before getting your Phase III data. But most of the activity would be in the medical affairs, scientific understanding, moving forward the clinical development program and working from a medical perspective to help to create the \u2013 to have good understanding of the data and to start to do some shaping around the molecule and where it might fit into the marketplace.","You start to see increasing commercial investments in things as you turn over the data and know you have positive Phase III data and then start building sales forces and other things. But at this point, the majority of our activity has been in the clinical development, clinical operations and medical affairs side at this point.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","And if I can just jump in, Scott and his team have a very successful track record with respect to building the commercial infrastructure to support what our specialty physician-targeted markets and categories and do that in a highly efficient way and then deliver on the revenue growth. So back when they did this, when we did this as a company to support the launch of OTEZLA, we didn't miss a beat in terms of the ongoing operating margin expansion while we made those investments.","Scott A. Smith - Celgene Corp.","And just one more little bit of color here is that what you would do is you would really invest in leadership and people that understand this marketplace, that were involved in the development of many other molecules in this space. And we have got clinical leads, commercial leads, safety leads from other MS programs in the past who have come here and are forming the core of the leadership of MS.","And I think we have people that have a tremendous understanding in this marketplace. And the bigger investments and build out happens as we get later into the year, but we really do feel good about the type of people who are working on the MS program and the leadership they bring.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","So, Geoff, it's Mark. Just to close out the point. And it's such an important question, you're getting the whole team to answer pieces of it. But what you hear are some principles at play that I really would harken back to when Celgene became a hematology company. It's this idea of very, very high unmet medical need, disruptive opportunity, specialty markets, as Jackie points out, and then this opportunity to basically take a molecule and then use that as an anchor opportunity to build the capabilities and the presence in one or another market, as long as it is truly disruptive, as long as it fits into our principles about how we think about the company's mission.","So we're trying to be bold. We want to change the outcomes for patients, but not incrementally. And in that context, we're in a position now if the question specific to neurosciences, where the short-term window of some availability of ozanimod data and what that means for Celgene and for the marketplace at large is an opportunity, a window, for us to apply our principles and think about how we'll build the company into the future.","So thanks a lot, Geoff. We'll talk to you soon.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","So thank you for joining us on the call today. This is Peter just to wrap up. Obviously you can hear from this call and discussions we've had already, we are very proud of the tremendous accomplishments of the Celgene organization across a number of fronts in 2016. But even more so we are, quite frankly, very excited to be in 2017 and driving forward with a lot of data flow and the chance to really continue the momentum and, in fact, enhance it going forward.","So I think 2017 is going to be a very exciting year. We feel great about our guidance, as Jackie and Mark have highlighted, both for 2017 and 2020. There's a lot of momentum here, a lot of excitement in the organization.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session at the end of the conference. I\u2019d like to remind you that this call is being recorded.","I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Patrick Flanigan, Vice President of Investor Relations at Celgene.","Patrick Flanigan","Thanks, [Hyde]. And welcome everyone to our Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. The press release reporting our financial results in addition to the presentation for today\u2019s webcast can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the corporate website at www.celgene.com.","Joining me in the room today with prepared remarks are Bob Hugin, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jackie Fouse, our Chief Financial Officer; Mark Alles, who is Global Head of our Hematology and Oncology Business and the Global Head of our Inflammation and Immunology Business, Scott Smith.","As a reminder, during today\u2019s call we will be making forward-looking statements regarding our financial outlook, in addition to regulatory and product development plans. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those forecasted. A description of these risks can be found in our most recent 10-Q on file with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today\u2019s date and we undertake no duty to update or revise them. Finally, reconciliation of the adjusted financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure are available as part of the earnings release.","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Bob.","Robert J. Hugin","Thank you, Patrick, and thank you, everyone for joining us this morning. I appreciate the opportunity to review the exceptional results and the progress achieved during the second quarter. Strong global operating momentum drove outstanding commercial and financial results across all of our products and geographies.","At the same time, we significantly advanced our pipeline from early research programs to key regulatory actions around the world. These results position us extremely well to accomplish our key goals for 2013 and to deliver on the promise of 2017 and beyond.","Our commercial performance in the second quarter was excellent. REVLIMID produced impressive results in markets around the world. ABRAXANE continued its accelerated sales trajectory that began with the launch of the lung indication in the United States late last year. And we\u2019re very encouraged by the POMALYST results in the United States.","The first full quarter of sales exceeded our expectations, generating strong momentum for the rest of the year. Several important clinical and regulatory events in the second quarter also position our hematology\/oncology franchise for the next phase of growth. Our REVLIMID franchise was strengthened by the approval in Europe for MDS deletion-5q and the approval in the United States for mantle cell lymphoma.","These label expansions reflect both perseverance of our teams and the focus on solutions for patients. And just two weeks ago, we also announced that MM-020, our Phase III study of REVLIMID and dexamethasone in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, met its primary endpoint of progression free survival. We look forward to the presentation of this data at upcoming medical meetings and to advancing our regulatory strategies for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.","And with pomalidomide we\u2019re finalizing our launch plans in Europe having received a positive CHMP opinion in May. Our teams are also developing global launch plans for ABRAXANE in pancreatic cancer with the PDUFA date of September 21st in the United States and ongoing review of our application in Europe.","Over 400 data presentations at major medical meetings in the first half of this year highlighted the growing body of important clinical data from our portfolio. In a few moments, Mark will provide a more complete perspective on the progress and opportunities in our hematology\/oncology franchise.","Our lead product in our inflammation and immunology franchise, apremilast continue to make excellent progress. Our regulatory applications for psoriatic arthritis in both the United States and Canada are under active review. Our psoriasis submissions in the United States and Canada, as well as our combined psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis submission in Europe, are on track for later this year.","In May we announced positive results from our six pivotal Phase III study of apremilast. The PALACE 4 study in DMARD-na\u00efve psoriatic arthritis patients. apremilast was highlighted at EULAR, the European Congress of Rheumatology in Madrid last month, building the knowledge of this product in the medical community.","In a few minutes Scott Smith, the leader of our I&I franchise revise his insights on our commercial, clinical and regulatory strategies as we move toward launches in the United States and Canada hopefully next year. We continue to invest in the future as we seek to expand our high potential internal pipeline and portfolio of external collaborations. I\u2019m very excited about the progress being achieved on multiple programs both at Celgene and with our partners.","Our pipeline is the lifeblood of our future and we\u2019re energized by its promise. This outstanding operating momentum and the strength of our business model positioned us very well to accomplish our near and longer term objectives. Our outlook supports raising our full-year financial guidance for REVLIMID sales, total product sales and earnings per share. Jackie will provide her perspective on this revised guidance next.","The achievement of the second quarter demonstrates the power of our strategic imperatives, maximizing the whole potential of our hematology franchise, expanding our oncology business, building a global I&I franchise and advancing our innovative early pipeline. We are focused on delivering on the extraordinary potential of our portfolio. Thank you.","Let me now turn the call over to Jackie.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","Thank you, Bob and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us on our Q2 earnings call. The Celgene team built on the strong momentum we created in Q1 of this year and produced yet another great quarter in Q2.","We accelerated year-over-year product sales growth in Q2 as POMALYST had its first full quarter revenues in the U.S. As ABRAXANE momentum continues to build with new indications contributing to that franchise has grown. Net product sales grew 17% year-over-year and REVLIMID sales grew 13% year-over-year with volume growth continuing to be the main driver for all products.","Sequential growth was 9% for the total net product sales and 5% for revenue. Our P&L metrics are strong across the board and our operating margin grew 180 basis points year-over-year and 20 basis points sequentially.","As previously announced, we completed our prior share repurchase authorization back in June, having repurchased 16.3 million shares for $1.8 billion in the first half of this year and our Board approved a new $3 billion authorization at its last meeting. We also invested in new R&D collaborations, including Concert, FORMA and Tengion and start a new collaboration agreement with MorphoSys. With the 17% year-over-year growth, total net product sales reached $1.564 billion, a new record sales for Celgene.","Total revenues also grew 17% year-over-year to $1.6 billion. All of our major products posted solid growth in the quarter across the globe. Our 17% product sales growth came from 16% volume growth and a net 1% positive contribution from the net of price in foreign exchange. The impact of foreign exchange was about $30 million negative for the Q2 year-over-year comparison inline with our internal plan.","As a reminder, that impact in Q1 was about $27 million negative. That brings the total negative foreign currency impact for the first six months of this year to about $57 million and we continue to expect about $100 million for the full-year with most of it impacting REVLIMID and with most of it coming for Europe.","Adjusted earnings per share was $1.52 for Q2, up 25% over Q2, 2012 driven by growth in operating income and our business model continues to deliver P&L leverage. Adjusted earnings per share grew by $0.30 versus one year-ago with $0.26 coming from operating income growth and a net $0.04 from the combination of tax rates and share count.","Reviewing the details of our net product sales, REVLIMID increased nicely, at about 13% year-over-year, up 16% in the U.S. and 8% in international, including a negative impact from foreign exchange on international sales. Excluding this impact, international year-over-year growth would have been 13% and total global REVLIMID growth ","15%.","Sequential growth in the U.S. was a strong 10% and international sequential volume growth was very solid across all major markets that was offset by negative price and currency effects in the quarter. VIDAZA continues to grow well outside the U.S. and posted solid mid single-digit gains year-over-year and sequentially.","ABRAXANE is showing strong momentum following last year\u2019s non-small cell lung cancer approval in the U.S., as well as good growth in the breast syndication outside the U.S. The product grew 41% year-over-year with the U.S. up 38% and international 55%. Global sequential growth was 26%.","We\u2019re extremely pleased with the performance of POMALYST in its first full quarter of sales in the U.S. POMALYST growth was demand driven. Demand for the product is exceeding our expectations and the product is on track for an outstanding 2013 build into a strong full-year expectation for 2014 and we expect to have commercial sales in both the U.S. and Europe.","Looking at the components of REVLIMID\u2019s growth for the Q2 year-over-year comparisons, total growth was about 13% with 11.4% coming from volume, 3.7% from price, and negative 2.5% from foreign exchange. The U.S. market 16% year-over-year growth for the quarter came about 60% from volume and 40% from price.","With respect to international, total year-over-year growth was 8%. The volume growth reached 15% as the net impact of price for the quarter was negative and the negative foreign currency impact was about 6% with the greatest impact being in Europe.","Our P&L dynamic continues inline with our expectations. We improved product growth margins to 95.1% driven by favorable sales mix. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue declined, reflecting timing of spend on milestones in clinical trials.","SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was higher in the quarter due to ongoing launch expenses for POMALYST, pre-launch expenses for ABRAXANE in pancreatic cancer, incremental expenses for Inflammation and Immunology and expenses related to a large number of medical meetings in Q2 of this year.","We expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to trend lower over the remainder of the year. Our operating profit margin improved versus one year-ago and versus the prior quarter and reached 49.6% for the quarter. Our effective tax rate rose slightly in Q2 driven by higher sales for both POMALYST and ABRAXANE in the U.S. and their impact on geographic mix of income.","We are delivering sustainable operating leverage and on this chart we track our current year progress in that regard on a year-to-date basis every quarter and the trend in our metrics for the past few years. You can see, we continue in Q2 of 2013 to build on a strong start to the year from Q1. This performance is a result of excellent execution across all Celgene functions. And now that we have two quarters of 2013 and our trailing 12 months return on invested capital calculation, we also now see our return increasing for 2013.","Our cash and marketable securities balance at the end of Q2 still in just over $4 billion and our balance sheet remains very strong. In Q2 we generated over $700 million of cash flow from operations and we spend just over $800 million on share repurchases.","On the strength of our Q2 performance and given our outlook for the remainder of this year, we are updating our full-year financial guidance as follows. We are raising total net product sales to approximately $6.2 billion growth of 15% versus a 11% previously. We are raising REVLIMID sales to a range of $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion, growth at the midpoint of 13% versus 10% previously.","We are raising EPS guidance by $0.25 to a range of $5.80 to $5.90, growth of 19% versus 14% previously. We continue to assume a fully diluted weighted average share count of 430 million shares. We assume a possible generic VIDAZA entrant in the U.S. at the beginning of Q4. We also expect to ramp up our investment in Inflammation and Immunology commercial infrastructure in the U.S. as we move towards year-end and into 2014 in advance of an expected launch of the psoriatic arthritis indication for apremilast in the U.S. next year.","We forecast our operating profit margins to be at least 49% as we have P&L flexibility in both R&D and SG&A expense lines. We may see a slightly higher effective tax rate for the full-year versus our previous guidance of 16.5% depending on the mix of income between U.S. and international markets. As of now, we see that rate coming in between 16.5% and 17%. In the future it will then trend back to down to our 16.5% longer term guidance.","With this positive update, I\u2019ll now close and turn the call over to Mark. Thank you very much.","Mark J. Alles","Thank you, Jackie. Good morning, everyone. As you heard from Bob and Jackie, our clinical regulatory and commercial teams delivered outstanding second quarter results. I\u2019m pleased to have my perspective on second quarter product sales, current jars of growth and some of the significant franchise expansion opportunities for our Hematology and Oncology business.","In the second quarter excellent demand growth for REVLIMID and ABRAXANE, solid VIDAZA sales and the early commercial success of POMALYST, combined to generate total product sales of $1,564 billion, strong year-on-year growth of 17% and quarter-on-quarter growth of 9%.","REVLIMID second quarter sales grew 13% year-on-year and 5% sequentially to $1,052 billion. 1increased demand was the overwhelming driver of percentage. ABRAXANE second quarter sales were $155 million, representing 41% year-on-year and 26% quarter-on-quarter growth. Continued stable use in metastatic breast cancer and adoption in non-small cell lung cancer combined to produce this record quarterly results.","Our teams in the United States and in Europe and our partners in Japan, Australia and Latin America are all preparing for regulatory approval and the commercial launch of ABRAXANE plus Gemcitabine for pancreatic cancer, a major unmet medial need around the world. The POMALYST launch is confirming the unmet medical needs of patients with heavily pretreated multiple myeloma.","Commercially the U.S. launch is exceeding our expectations. Quarter-on-quarter sales grew by 132% to $66 million. I will provide more insight into launch of POMALYST later. The second quarter performance by our leading cancer brands is a key indicator of the momentum we\u2019re generating. Important growth progress, duration of therapy, market share, geographic expansion and new launches combined to generate strong sales growth. Other significant franchise expansion opportunities are just now coming into focus, many more are in development.","Across markets, REVLIMID gain share in myeloma. Duration of therapy was up in the quarter. In Europe, our team is successfully growing share in duration in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma. We are pleased with the early launch success of REVLIMID in China and our teams in Japan, Canada and Australia produced excellent second quarter results.","The U.S. launch of REVLIMID for relapsed refractory mantle cell lymphoma acts as an immediate growth driver. Our European team is working to secure reimbursement across markets for the recently approved deletion-5q MDS indication. Optimizing the full potential of REVLIMID requires global regulatory approval for its Houston patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.","A central element of our regulatory strategy is based on the results of the MM-020 study. Among the completed randomized Phase III studies designed potentially to get approval, the MM-020 study features important clinical outcomes, regulatory agencies, physicians and patients are seeking. As you know the primary endpoint was progression free survival. The primary analysis measure the difference in progression free survival between arm A and arm C.","Key secondary endpoints included overall survival response rates and safety. Earlier this month, we announced that the MM-020 study met its primary endpoint. Working with the study investigators and a consideration of our regulatory strategy we plan to submit an abstract of the American Society of Hematology for the December ASH meeting.","Given the strength of the data package we now have, we\u2019re moving forward with our plan to submit regulatory applications for REVLIMID for the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma in the U.S. and in Europe by the end of this year. Other global submissions will follow.","Presented at ASCO and again at EHA, the demand on Phase III study of REVLIMID maintenance for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma after treatment with either nPR or Autologous stem cell transplantation is the third randomized trial in the younger transplant eligible population to demonstrate superior progression free survival and the second study in this population to demonstrate an overall survival advantage when REVLIMID is used as maintenance therapy until disease progression.","Recent international medical meetings have also featured key data on REVLIMID in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We are particularly impressed with the activity and safety of the combination of REVLIMID plus rituximab. As you know we\u2019re conducting a series of late stage trials seeking to define the optimal patient population as part of our registration strategy for this chemo free regimen.","The results for the CALGB 5803 Phase II study of REVLIMID plus rituximab in patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma were presented during the International Congress on Malignant Lymphoma. This multi-center study reported a response rate of 93% by PET scan, 72% achieved the complete response. The medium follow-up was just over 1 and 1.5 years. This is the second Phase II trial of the R2 regimen in untreated follicular lymphoma to demonstrate a greater than 90% overall response rate with a very high percentage of complete responses.","We believe that these data provides compelling support for the ongoing conduct of the relevant study, our randomized Phase III registration trial comparing the combination of REVLIMID plus rituximab to rituximab plus standard chemotherapy in first line follicular lymphoma. Enrollment is on target, with full approval expected to be completed by the second half of 2014.","Approximately 50% of patients with Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma, who complete treatment with rituximab plus CHOP chemotherapy achieved long-term remissions and can be considered cured. The other 50% do not do well and are usually treated with a series of therapy spending months or even years before eventually dying from their disease.","We are committed to developing novel therapies for these patients. This is the population where we anticipate REVLIMID maintenance therapy could provide substantial clinical benefit. The REMARK study is a randomized Phase III trial testing REVLIMID maintenance versus placebo following through standard R-CHOP in patients with Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma. We expect enrollment in REMARC to be completed by the end of this year.","Last week we announced the discontinuation of the CLL-008 study due to an imbalance in the number of deaths in patients treated with REVLIMID versus chlorambucil. We are disappointed with this outcome, but we have learned more about the efficacy and safety of REVLIMID in previously untreated patients with CLL who also have extensive comorbidities. Importantly all other REVLIMID sponsor studies and investigator initiated studies in CLL are continuing further existing protocols. REVLIMID remains one of the most active drugs in development for CLL, and we\u2019re investing in a robust program focused on a variety of clinical studies.","For example, our Phase III study CLL-002 testing REVLIMID maintenance following documented response after one or two lines of therapy is enrolling well with greater than 60% of patients now approved. Success in CLL-002 potentially defines a very unique segment of the market and may represent the optimal treatment strategy for single agent REVLIMID in this disease. Our early drug development team has made important progress to finding the dosing schedule of CC-292 our potent Btk inhibitor. Phase I studies in hematology have been initiated for the combination of REVLIMID plus CC-292, REVLIMID plus ibrutinib and the combination of CC-292 plus rituximab.","Driven by the outstanding execution of our commercial team and significant patient need, second quarter sales of POMALYST were excellent. Year-to-date grand performance across all of our internal metrics is exceeding expectations, while it is much too early to appreciate the length of the treatment duration where key prescriptions are being dispensed to a high percentage of patient\u2019s. The successful launch of POMALYST in the U.S. market is helping us prepare for a launch in Europe immediately following the final approval decision by the European Commission, a regulatory approval we expect to receive very soon.","We were pleased with the diversity of clinical data presented during ASCO and EHA supporting the clinical profile of POMALYST and expect presentations of updated and new data to continue through the ASH meeting in December and beyond. ABRAXANE has entered a new phase of sales growth and potentially transformative clinical development. Our near term priorities for this major cancer brand have not changed. We need to maximize it's fully potential in metastatic breast cancer, optimize the opportunity in non-small cell lung cancer and secure global regulatory approval and market access for the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer. We continue to expect final overall survival results from our Phase III study in metastatic myeloma in the fourth quarter and supporting studies in bladder cancer and other solid tumors. ABRAXANE is on track to become our first oncology blockbuster brand.","Years of strategic thinking, innovative clinical research and consistently strong operational execution are coming together to create significant new opportunity for our global cancer franchise. Our inline portfolio offer substantial value to patients, physicians and payers supporting our efforts to effectively commercialize our market leading cancer therapies. For the next five years and beyond we have numerous high value catalysts that support our robust outlook for growth, and we intend to capitalize on every one of them. Speaking of our outlook for growth, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Scott Smith, the Global Head of our Inflammation and Immunology franchise. Thank you very much.","Scott Smith","Thanks Mark. It's a pleasure to be here with you today speaking about the INI franchise and the progress that we\u2019ve made over the past months. Today for apremilast we have enrolled over 4000 patients in the global commercial registration programs and in the past 12 months we\u2019ve seen positive results in six Phase III trials in arthritis \u2013 in psoriatic arthritis and a positive Phase II trial in Behcet\u2019s disease. We\u2019ve also made significant progress with our regulatory filings. We submitted to U.S. PsA NDA in March and have since received acceptance of the filings PDUFA date of March 21, 2014. In Q2 we submitted the NDS for PsA for the Canadian authorities and we\u2019re also on track for a combined PsA psoriasis submission in the EU as well as a submission for psoriasis in U.S. and Canada later this year.","In addition the apremilast Phase III POSTURE trial in ankylosing spondylitis is rapidly accruing and we anticipate complete enrollment this quarter. We also initiated enrollment in a Japanese psoriasis PsA registration trial earlier this year. Last month of the EULAR European Congress at Rheumatology we presented a PALACE 3 top line data as well as the PALACE 152 week results and you can see from the graph on the left the results of PALACE 3 are remarkably consistent with PALACE 1 results with the apremilast 30 mg BID arm achieving an ACR 20 score a 43% at week 16. Additionally the 30 mg BID arm achieved statistical significance on a number of key secondary end points including ACR 50, ACR 70 as well as other key measures of physical function, quality of life at week 24.","What created a lot of excitement was the graph on the right that demonstrated there was continued treatment the ACR 20 scores of apremilast continue to improve to the 50 to 60 plus percent level by week 52. It should be noted that apremilast was well tolerated and the prolonged exposure did not result in any unexpected increase in adverse events or laboratory abnormalities. Posted the randomized Phase II trial BCT-001 investigating apremilast 30 mg BID versus placebo in Beh\u00e7et's disease also generated a lot of excitement at EULAR. Behcet\u2019s disease is a very significant immune-mediated disease with limited treatment options in this 111 patient trial there was a 71% complete response rate and 89% of overall response rate for apremilast is shown in the graph on the left. As well there was a very rapid response demonstrated by the change oral azacitidine that you can see from the graph on the right. We are continuing our meetings with various health authorities discussing the possibility of using the data from this trial for a potential Behcet\u2019s approval.","The second half of 2013 promises to be even more substantial in terms of the quantity and quality of additional data that we will bring to the medical community. This data should include presentations of PALACE 2 and PALACE 3 52 week data, data in difficult treat symptoms of PsA such as enthesitis, dactylitis and additional deeper views of ESTEEM 1 and Behcet\u2019s trials. We have also made significant progress in filling out our key global commercial and medical affairs leadership roles. These positions have been filled with high caliber candidates that have significant and deep experience at successfully launching and commercializing blockbuster drugs in the immunology space.","In the mean timer our new heads of U.S. commercial and global marketing had already begun to have a major impact. We are accelerating all key launcher activities to ensure full preparedness for early 2014 U.S. and Canada launches. We are very, very excited as we prepare to bring a potentially significant new treatment option to the millions of patient\u2019s world wide with PsA and psoriases. We are very confident about the opportunity ahead of us; the opportunity to create a new global standard for the treatment of psoriatic disease.","Thank you very much and I\u2019d like to turn it back to Bob.","Robert J. Hugin","Thank you Scott and thank you Jackie and Mark. The second quarter was truly outstanding. I want to thank all of my colleagues at Celgene for their commitment to producing outstanding results and for striving to improve the lives of patients worldwide. We\u2019re energized by the progress achieved in the first half of the year and are focused on producing outstanding results for the full-year. Much has been achieved in the past few months. Even more importantly because of our investments in innovation and our focus on patients, the future of Celgene has never been brighter. We look forward to updating you multiple times later this year, including on or quarterly conference call on October 24, at the American College of Rheumatology meeting in late October in Santiago, and at the American Society of Hematology meeting early December in New Orleans.","Thank you very much for your support, and operator we can now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Geoff Porges from Sanford Bernstein.","Geoffrey Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on a very strong quarter and the helpful guidance and information. I have a question on ABRAXANE that was a surprise that the result was so strong and plus you gave us some color on that particularly how much of the growth came from pancreatic cancer based on new some of the companion listing. And secondly, could you talk a little bit about the exact status outside the U.S. of the approval for ABRAXANE, and are you going to have a full scale launch in Europe and in other geographies or is it going to continue to come out on a more restricted basis? Thanks.","Mark J. Alles","Geoff, thank you. It's Mark, thanks for the question. So, yeah we're very pleased with the quarter and ABRAXANE sales trajectory. The majority of the incremental gain comes from the lung cancer launch. We are seeing adoption starting in the pancreatic cancer segment as you know the NCCN guidelines upgraded the category to one. The data have been presented multiple times starting back in January, again at ASCO at the world GI Symposium that just happened, so awareness of the survival advantage and then the access in the U.S. is starting to create that momentum. OUS, Europe is very important for us in terms of regulatory work and we look to a full scale launch of the pancreatic cancer indication in Europe we\u2019ll build the clinical program with Europe and U.S. collaboration for an adjuvant pancreatic study so that will support the ongoing profile of the product for years to come. You recall in Australia we have a partner and in Japan in fact in the quarter our partner was successful getting not only a lung cancer approval, but also gastric cancer. So, a lot of things happening in ex-U.S. and of course we\u2019re very pleased with the progress in Q2 in the U.S.","Geoffrey Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Thanks very much. That\u2019s very helpful information.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Deutsche Bank.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank","Numerous question\u2019s, and just given the recent positive data with 020; I was wondering if you could comment on what are the next steps for figuring out what Europe wants to see as far as 020 for filing and 015, and how do you think about using these two trials to get approval of REVLIMID in Europe? Thanks.","Mark J. Alles","Thanks Robyn, it's Mark again. Bob, if you will comment please. But Robyn we\u2019re very pleased that MM-20 met its primary endpoint. We continue to follow up on the results of MM-015 and the two maintenance trials as well. So our intent is to continue to move forward with filing strategies by the end of the year in the U.S. and in Europe followed by other markets around the world, the comprehensive data will be considered all the way through the process.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank","The follow-up though, do you know yet whether you will file on both together or one on them separately.","Mark J. Alles","Yeah, we\u2019re beginning discussions with regulators now and so we want to leave the diversity of options for us and them wide open.","Robert J. Hugin","Yeah, I think we want to make sure that patients all around the world have the most rapid access to REVLIMID in newly diagnosed myeloma, and so as we finalize that strategy we\u2019re going to do the one that get access the most quickest, but we\u2019re very optimistic that we\u2019re going to begin by the end of the year the filings.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Schmidt from Cowen & Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Company","Thanks for taking my question, and congrats again on a great quarter. Maybe another one for Mark; it does look like apremilast and ABRAXANE as Geoff mentioned are doing very, very well. Could you provide us some sort of a benchmark for where you are in terms of market share in the relapsed refractory myeloma population for POMALYST and off label ABRAXANE and pancreatic cancer?","Mark J. Alles","Eric, thanks it's Mark. With respect to pomalidomide we are very excited about the launch, it's going extremely well. We have a lot of metrics to look at because the product is in the market just for months we're beginning to see shared gains that are meaningful, but I think it's a bit early to declare what market share is or isn\u2019t, certainly in line 3 plus the share is meaningful and very competitive given the market place as you know it. With respect to the ongoing launch we see a lot of interest in combining POMALYST with other noble agents so I think that\u2019s going to drive the brand and the data that recently came out including subsets of patients renal insufficiency et cetera these are very important confidence builders in the launch of the product. With respect to ABRAXANE and share in pancreatic cancer there is a meaningful share starting to show up, but again it's early in terms of from the time the data is in the market, market access becomes stronger and what we\u2019re doing in terms of preparing for launch we\u2019re going to be in a good place to run to the PDUFA date remind you that the PDUFA date is in September \u2013 September 21 and we still expect given the progress we\u2019re making in Europe that we could have an end of year launch approval launch in Europe, so I think all systems go for ABRAXANE and pancreatic cancer.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rachel McMinn from Bank of America Merrill Lynch\u200e.","Rachel McMinn - Bank of America Merrill Lynch\u200e","Yeah, thanks. Maybe another way of asking the question; can you talk a little bit about the REVLIMID versus pomalidomide dynamics, so I mean to what percentage of POMALYST is coming from REVLIMID, patients that would have otherwise been on REVLIMID. And then just totally a separate question, on 020 can you think that overall survival trends are going to be important in getting European regulators comfortable with the data set or is PFS alone when we see those curves is that sufficient to you know really kind of answer outstanding questions on the product. Thank you.","Mark J. Alles","Hi, Rachel its Mark; thanks for the question. First there is absolutely no cannibalization going on between pomalidomide and REVLIMID, if anything REVLIMID is expanding in share and in duration as a consequence of the confidence in the market being able to transition for patients who really exhausted first and second line therapy to be able to then have that confidence to go to a third or even a fourth line therapy, pomalidomide\u2019s, profile with an overall survival advantage in that setting is comforting to the market. With respect to MM-020 the PFS advantage of course is the center point of the comprehensive data package we have. There is no doubt that the overall benefit risk in front of all regulators includes the assessment of trends for overall survival and then of course in the context of the safety profile that there\u2019s nothing going on in the survival trend positively or negatively that is being driven by particular side effects. So, I think in the end PFS stands alone, other endpoints including the overall safety and other trends in clinical outcomes are part of that consideration. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gene Mack from Brean Capital.","Gene Mack - Brean Capital","Actually, I was wondering if Mark maybe and Jackie if you guys could comment on some of the strategies driving the MorphoSys deal and how you see maybe the development of that compound impacting the various settings in myeloma well maybe where, I know it's early days but maybe where we should see trials beginning to unfold; and then maybe Jackie I don\u2019t know if it's too early to tell, but is there something that could wind up impacting 2017 guidance? Thanks.","Mark J. Alles","Yeah, hi its Mark let me jump in. Jackie and I will probably go back and forth a little bit on the answer. The coverage of MorphoSys is very important because it represents a new therapeutic way of thinking about the treatment of multiple blood cancers, myeloma for sure but we think CD38 is a target beyond multiple myeloma and we fully intend to investigate that. So we this is an important maybe best in class therapeutic antibody against CD38, and are looking to fully develop it. With respect to R&D, I think that there are different segments one could think of we are very early in that assessment, but have pretty good ideas about how we would with MorphoSys think to develop the asset in multiple blood cancers. With respect to guidance long-term, I think Jackie can answer that question, but my view is this is complementary to our R&D program.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","I completely agree, I would say that today we don\u2019t see an impact on 2017 guidance, we have a number of projects that are not included in our assumptions for guidance in 2017 that could represent upside to that guidance and we\u2019ve talked about those some in the past and I would put this in that category as well as the timing is faster than what we\u2019re thinking about today.","Gene Mack - Brean Capital","And is it too early to tell when this drug might become commercially available?","Mark J. Alles","I think it's a little bit early, I don\u2019t know about too early. We certainly look forward and think that it could be in a sort of classic Phase II to Phase III development cycle. On the early side maybe four years on the longest side maybe a five to six year window. But again a lot of that depends on once the full integration of the collaboration happens we can get started.","Gene Mack - Brean Capital","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham from JP Morgan.","Geoffrey Meacham - JP Morgan","Nice results on the quarter, and thanks for taking the question. I got one on 020 and one on REV and CLL, so there\u2019s been a big benefit for you guys waiting for 015 to mature with respect to SPM, PFS to OS. I am just curious if you thought 020 at this point was mature enough to make a compelling case review, looks like there is a benefit to waiting a bit longer these are things to mature. And then on REV and CLL when you look at historically tumor lysis syndrome had been a concern previously was this an issue in the origin study or was it just the type of patient enrolled on that study? Thanks.","Mark J. Alles","Geoff thanks for the question. We are comfortable that we are ready to begin very, very direct dialogue with regulatory agencies with our intent to file in the U.S. and Europe submit by the end of the year filing of course is a regulatory decision. And then go outside of those markets very rapidly. So our plan is intact, we\u2019ll submit before the end of the year, hopefully in both parts of the world and we will use 2014 to go to the rest of the world. With respect to TLS and CLL I think it is an important question. There is a heterogeneity across the patient desk the imbalance in the CLL-008 study, there are no patterns, there\u2019s no direct cause in effect that we see, the deaths were early so we think that what's really happening in this setting was that extensive comorbidities and the age of the population led to some early deaths probably linked to disease resolution that\u2019s hard to really know. That said, I think we\u2019re very, very comfortable with the idea that REVLIMID in combination to CLL all of the different studies that are ongoing, the profile even in the setting of some morbidities is quite good. In the setting of maintenance after patients are (indiscernible) we\u2019re very excited because we think once the tumor load is less and we think the immuno surveillance effect of REVLIMID that mechanism is going to be quite effective. So, optimistic we learned a lot and we\u2019re moving into a more confident way of segmenting CLL going forward.","Geoffrey Meacham - JP Morgan","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Schoenbaum from ISI Group.","Mark Schoenbaum - ISI Group","Jackie has been not asked a lot of questions, so I thought I\u2019d bring her into the dialogue if I might. I would love to get updated thoughts on use of cash. There\u2019s obviously been rumors and press reports of lots of M&A activity in the space, I\u2019d love to know kind of where your head is Jackie, and perhaps Bob on the use of cash and specifically I\u2019ll go out on a limb and ask, are you \u2013 would you be willing to comment on whether or not you\u2019ve entered the process that\u2019s going on over at Onyx and then the follow-up is maybe just, I know in the past you said you\u2019re keeping your partnering options open for apremilast and now that we\u2019re getting dangerously close to the producer and the launch I\u2019d love to know your updated thoughts on that if any. Thanks.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","Thank you, Mark I was feeling a little bit neglected here with no questions up to now, so I appreciate it, and I am sure Bob will want to jump in.","Robert J. Hugin","I\u2019m here for you.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","I think as we\u2019ve often said, I mean we don\u2019t comment on specific transactions in the M&A space that maybe out there in the environment. What I would reiterate and you\u2019ve seen it from our activity thus far this year is that we continue to place a higher priority on the kinds of agreements that you\u2019ve seen us strike with more process and others so that we are complementing our internal research capabilities in our internal technology platforms with other technologies and compounds that we think could lead to breakthroughs or represent best in class products in the future and we think layering that on top of an extremely strong organic growth profile that we have for many, many years to come is a top priority for us right now. So, with that, I think I\u2019ll move on to the apremilast partnering question or maybe let Bob chime in as well, and then we\u2019ll let Scott talk about apremilast partnering.","Robert J. Hugin","Yeah, I think before Scott talks about apremilast I just want to reiterate our strategic perspective of how we\u2019ve looked at new franchise and opportunities, and there are key factors that drive our decision making and our thinking on it. And the two that are most significant when we look at new franchises are is the data strong enough to really allow an entrance to make a new marketer or a new impact on existing markets in a meaningful way and the data strong enough to justify that kind of issue. So in the first case there I think is becoming more and more clear with six positive pivotal Phase III studies and the continuing positive maturing of the data very, very important for us as we look at those as those decisions. And secondly the other really important factor to us is can we attract and have the right people that can lead the efforts to ensure that we have the expertise and the capability to really deliver and maximize the value of the franchise and the asset that we think of ourselves. Clearly from a strategic perspective maintaining ownership of your products and reaping the full benefit from them for your shareholders and your franchise for yourself has great long-term value like the proposition that we\u2019ve achieved globally both financially and operationally with REVLIMID in our hematology, oncology franchise which have accrued great benefit to us. So I think that strategically over the past six months we have resoundingly answered the questions about the quality, the importance of the data that benefit to have a significant impact on patients. And I think Scott and the team have done a spectacular job of really attracting and building a leadership team that gives us the capability to take on whatever challenges and opportunities we seek to pursue. That being said, we should always be open minded about opportunities and indications and geographies to ensure that we maximize the full net present value of the franchise, but I hope you can tell from my comment, but I think this is a very exciting opportunity to strengthen the breadth of our Company strategically and the key decisions that we are faced with are ones out of clear strength from the data and the quality of the people leading the effort.","Scott Smith","And not much to really add to what Bob said, we\u2019re building a tremendous leadership team, we\u2019re in full commercialization mode in acceleration getting ready for launches both in the U.S. and Canada which are likely to come in the early part of 2014. So we are fully committed to that build and moving forward and accelerating all our activities and as Bob said we\u2019re also engaged in some geographic and therapeutic discussions to see if we can accelerate our overall top line by engaging in that, but we\u2019re hiring a leadership team with the feel but we\u2019ve got a tremendous asset, great data and we\u2019re hiring the best people we can hire in the world, and for us to maintain core commercialization of the asset.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","And just mainly to close the loop I mean we talked specifically about kind of our view on the M&A. Bob and Scott just covered how we\u2019re thinking about Apremilast and maximizing that opportunity just on the broader implied question of use of cash, I mean you\u2019ve seen us execute on a business strategy for the past few years and a financial strategy that supports the business strategy and that is focused on creating shareholder value and you\u2019ve seen what we\u2019ve delivered on that and you\u2019ve seen that we\u2019ve renewed our share repurchase authorization which is just one tool amongst an armamentarium of tools that we had to manage the business investment and the capital structure and you\u2019re going to see us continue to consistently apply those strategies on a go forward basis.","Mark Schoenbaum - ISI Group","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Howard Liang from Leerink Swann.","Howard Liang - Leerink Swann","Thanks very much. I just have a question on R2 is there a plan to see companion listing based on the CALGB data presented with Dr. Martin and MD Anderson data and can you update us on the plans to have an interim look for the RELEVANCE trial.","Mark J. Alles","Thanks Howard. So, currently REVLIMID with (indiscernible) approval and other data including R2 has very good access in the U.S. market, of course it's different around the rest of the world. The RELEVANCE trial would be un-blinded for the results on an event driven basis, again this is like we\u2019ve been talking about with MM-20 for so long, there\u2019s no plan to do anything before it would happen exactly on time with respect to the protocol. In terms of CLL so across the Board this regimen R2 has become a chemo free doublet where not only can we look at it in the context of acute therapy but also along the course of therapy because of the lack of certain toxicities. I think the other thing that\u2019s important is we\u2019re building an R2 strategy in first line Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma we have very, very important ongoing analysis that are informing us about using an R2-CHOP versus an R-CHOP Phase III approach and we think that this biomarker GCB, ABC is still a very important way for us to look at differentiated performance of an R2 doublet with or without CHOP included. So much more to come in the CLL and any CHOP programs off of the R2 backbone, and I look forward to talking more about this with you at ASH and even into next year because the data will continue to mature.","Howard Liang - Leerink Swann","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Yaron Werber from Citi.","Yaron Werber - Citi","Thanks for taking my question. I got a question 020 and a question on POM. A 020 crossover should not be a huge issue right the way that the study was designed, I mean patients want to discontinue right on the subsequent therapies. I am trying to get a sense, do you think you can show survival benefit in fact take survival benefit over time or how should we think about that. And then secondly just on POM how much of the initial kind of $55 million in the U.S. is bonus or pent up demand versus being sustainable demand and growing from there?","Mark J. Alles","Hi, Yaron, it's Mark; thanks for the question. You started with a question on crossover, and these are things we\u2019ll find out over time as the results get analyzed and sensitivity analysis gets done. What we know is that progression-free survival 2 is part of the ongoing analysis so of course that now, and you know that the European guidance for regulatory review now does include a view to PFS 2. This will then provide that calculation of any impact good or bad with respect to progression-free survival. So we will have those data, they\u2019ll probably be part of an ASH presentation and so I think we just have to wait to see what we learn about that specifically. With respect to overall survival and time, I\u2019ll just state you the facts, you\u2019d call that the final PFS is where we un-blinded the study, that\u2019s the end point, interim survival and then other survival analysis will continue with respect to the benefit risk. This all still ties directly to a yearend submission strategy in U.S. Europe followed by the rest of the world. You asked about pomalidomide in the market and the vast majority, I don\u2019t have an exact percentage but it's overwhelming majority is demand based with new patient starts, total prescriptions and then as I mentioned we are seeing early signs that a high percentage of those new prescriptions are being repeated, so cycle 2 a little bit of cycle 3 already. I think that\u2019s something we\u2019ll be able to update you more about again when we get a little bit further into the launch.","Robert J. Hugin","But I just want to add a little something to that obviously early in the launch it's -- you have to be a little bit cautious and clearly the expectations \u2013 our expectations have been exceeded by the start of it. But I also do want to point out that we did not have as with other compounds on occasions, a very heavy number of \u2013 large number of patients that were in a compassionate use program that rolled over into an early access, compassionate access program, so we did not have that phenomenon here. That being said it's still early and we\u2019re encouraged and it exceed our expectations and we\u2019re going to keep pushing.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks, congrats on the quarter and on MM-020. I had a follow on question on survival, I know you\u2019ve sort of addressed this in a couple of ways, but when people get to ASH and there\u2019ll be an expectation and people are really focused on looking at the survival curves. Should one expect even trends this early or is it just simply too early to even see trends. How should we think about that as we go to ASH? And then secondly for Mark, in CLL that\u2019s a very fast moving field, a lot of things were presented both in ASCO and ASH and for orals in CLL; do you guys have the assets in-house to de-bulk the tumor, how do you think about your position in CLL?","Mark J. Alles","Yeah, so at ASH the data set will of course focus on the primary efficacy endpoint; that is PFS. All of the secondary end points would have data. Sitting here today it\u2019s not exactly clear what those data sets would be. But we would expect, that they would include the hazard ratio and an estimate of overall survival, that\u2019s an expectation whether that\u2019s ready or not is to be determined. With respect to CLL, I think your question is important in terms of about acute treatment of CLL and I\u2019ll just remind you again this is where follicular and then aggressive Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma we really like how REVLIMID plus rituximab is creating a different way of thinking about the acute treatment of the disease. And so yes the answer is, REVLIMID used in certain way is very effective at treating CLL in an acute stage. As a single agent we think it maybe more effective maintaining the benefit over time. That said, as I mentioned CC-292 is moving very nicely into a more mature Phase I study in hematology so we think CC-292 has made good progress and we look forward to seeing how that asset plays out more data coming at ASH, more development outlines coming then as well.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams from Wells Fargo Securities.","Brian Abrahams - Wells Fargo Securities","Thanks for taking my question and my congrats on a good quarter as well. Another question for Jackie, your R&D data initially you gave guidance for 2015 REVLIMID sales that I think may have been a little bit below peoples expectations. Now say you\u2019ve increased your 2013 REVLIMID sales guidance, I was wondering actually maybe just talk through the dynamics that might be shaping this. Did you see a reacceleration in uptakes since May, is $4.7 billion to $4.8 billion still the number we should be thinking about for 2015 or do you have expectations maybe for growth slowing down in the near term and the medium term was a bit more perhaps than that we\u2019ve been expecting? Thanks.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","Yeah, thanks for the question, Brian. I mean, with respect to updates of the longer term guidance we do that from time-to-time where we\u2019ve got clear trends that we see. As opposed to where we were back in May with the R&D data, I think where we sit today we have got the evidence of the momentum that we saw across the world in demand for REVLIMID and we feel very good about what that looks like. We\u2019re also sitting here today with the benefit of the positive outcome on the primary endpoint for the MM-020 trial. So I think that where we sit today we feel quite good about where we are with REVLIMID and the future for REVLIMID and even greater clarity on the regulatory pathways and the way it forwards for the submission on newly diagnosed. So, I think we can continue to reiterate our confidence in our longer term targets and you\u2019ve seen how we feel about the shorter term with 2013, and the visibility that we have there to increase the guidance on REVLIMID revenues for this year. So, continue to watch for more to come on that with respect to the future updates on the longer term guidance and we feel very good about where we are.","Brian Abrahams - Wells Fargo Securities","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ying Huang from Barclays.","Ying Huang \u2013 Barclays Capital","Thanks for taking my question. So I have a question on apremilast NDA, I know we saw the 52 week data from PALACE 1 and EULAR last month. Did you include that data in the NDA, and would that be included in the label when FDA approves the drug. And then secondly you guys already saw some extension data from PALACE 2 and 3. Do you also see the similar trend to what we saw in PALACE 1 that is overtime you actually increase the efficacy?","Mark J. Alles","So in terms of the NDA the 52 week data is not in the NDA. We would hope to submit that data at some point after the initial approval and get that in the label, there\u2019s often longer term observed data in competitors labels of this type. Your second question was relative to; do we see more things with PALACE 2 and 3? We see very similar trends in the long-term data when you take a look at the observed data in these trials for all the trials very, very -- one thing that\u2019s striking and we\u2019ll get all the data out in the second half of the year longer term data for PALACE 2 and 3, very consistent and it gets even more consistent when you take a look at the longer term endpoint. So yes, they\u2019re very consistent with the program.","Ying Huang \u2013 Barclays Capital","And what about the publication strategies, Scott in terms of all the data; how are we doing with that?","Scott Smith","Yeah, so we\u2019re moving forward, the first we would look to get the first PALACE 1 published. That is close to being submitted, there\u2019s a lot of data there, and we would publish the full 52 week and then we will work to publish PALACE 2, PALACE 3. And then there\u2019s a lot of sub-publications which would come from each of those, each of those pending that there is lots of subsets of that data that you can take and look and emphasize and tacticalize, but its by far the PALACE 1 through 4 program by far the largest PsA program ever initiated globally by any molecule and there is a lot of data, and there is going to be a lot of \u2013 there is a lot of good data that exist there, there\u2019s going to be a lot more over the next couple of years. Thanks for asking that question.","Ying Huang \u2013 Barclays Capital","If I can slip another one, can you guys provide an update on the patent challenge by Actavis?","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","This is Jackie. Hi. So, there is not a lot news has happened, I mean, we speak about this fairly off and where we\u2019re still in the discovery phase on the new patents, so we had to go through the process again. As we know the timeline has got extended once, our estimate at the current time, I guess, if we have a view on timing would be that there is no (indiscernible) hearing scheduled for the moment. It could come sometime next year, but we still go through discovery and we\u2019d expect that to continue over the course of the year right now. It\u2019s not really anything new since the last time we talked about it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Somaiya from Piper Jaffray.","Ian Somaiya - Piper Jaffray","Hi. Just a question on the following for REVLIMID for newly diagnosed maintenance. Can you just may be speak to the strategy to get an overall survival claim whether its in Europe or in the U.S., which trial do you think it will be based on and maybe give us a sense of the timing. Since \u2013 as I look at the slide deck, you\u2019re pointing to a Q4 \u201913 filing based on 015 and 012. If you\u2019re confident on 015, would you wait for the overall survival benefit to be confirmed before submitting that data?","Mark J. Alles","Ian thanks. It\u2019s Mark. I appreciate the question. Just a clarification, the use of the word maintenance gets mixed up a little bit and how we talk about newly diagnosed myeloma, I understand why. I want to make you clear that in 012 patients are treated from diagnosis of myeloma continuously or for fixed course and that was a clinical strategy built into the trial. So there is no -- technically there is a maintenance effect other than continuous treatment. That said, I think it\u2019s very important that we focus on that we have four studies with progression free survival advantages that are quite robust. This is the clinical benefit endpoint that regulators are recognized in cancer for very long time. All other data will be part of the regulatory review including benefit risk assessments with respect to updated incidence rates for SPMs, how that does or doesn\u2019t play out, survival trends etcetera. So there is not an either or this will are we based on the overwhelming efficacy of the drug with respect to progression free survival and then we will based on the comprehensive data package we have submit in the U.S., submit in Europe and follow those submissions around the world as rapidly as possible.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joel Sendek from Stifel.","Joel Sendek - Stifel Nicolaus","Hi. Thanks a lot. I have a question on apremilast too, and maybe might be individual but too closely here, but if you look at slide 36, the box on the submission was raised in the third quarter, is that \u2013 should I read into that at all and I\u2019m also wondering if you can give us 53 week data on PALACE, where you have at some point 52 week data on ESTEEM and if so that will be part of the \u2013 while you submit that at some point maybe in a hope to getting possibly maintenance use of the apremilast in psoriasis? Thanks.","Robert J. Hugin","So let me \u2013 sorry about that, let me answer the second question first and we do look at longer term data for ESTEEM and see increasing response, we will take a look at the observed data etcetera in the ESTEEM program. Where 52 week data we don\u2019t necessarily have in ESTEEM because the studies as on it\u2019s a little bit confounded. Regulatory authorities wanted to see in the context of the psoriasis study randomized withdrawal after week 32 for some of the subset of patients who have had response, how long did it take for disease come back and some of those things. So, we don\u2019t have straight line patients on drug for 52 weeks, non-uninterrupted like we did with the PALACE program. But we will in the second half of the year hopefully have some presentations of the longer term ESTEEM data it\u2019s a little more confounded I think than you will see with PsA, same trends that you see in PsA just to say design create some differences. The first question was relative to submission in the third quarter of which particular submission?","Joel Sendek - Stifel Nicolaus","The psoriasis U.S. companies.","Robert J. Hugin","The Psoriasis U.S. NDA will be in the second half of the year. It\u2019s not a Q3 or Q4 we purposely put that second half there.","Mark J. Alles","So, as soon as possible.","Robert J. Hugin","As soon as possible.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","Yeah, I mean, its -- we\u2019ve shown it on the slides just as -- it could fall right at the end of Q3 or beginning of Q4 and maybe just a little bit ahead of the other. So, it\u2019s optically it looks like that.","Joel Sendek - Stifel Nicolaus","Got it.","Robert J. Hugin","No change to our plan.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","No change to the plan at all.","Robert J. Hugin","It will be the next submission might be.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","I think we got five people in the queue, we may not get to all of you, so it depends on how long the questions are, we\u2019re going to take at least two more \u2013 next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Thomas Wei from Jefferies.","Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Company","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask just a housekeeping thing on the contribution, also inventory stocking for the POMALYST sales during the quarter? And then also a question on REVLIMID market share, which has been pretty stable now in the mid 50s for a while and I\u2019m curious where you see that going over time and if you think that MM-020 can kind of restart share gains in the U.S. or is it something else that you think could be the driver of share gains higher than mid 50?","Mark J. Alles","Thanks Thomas. This is Mark. On inventory we\u2019ve seen as expected weeks on hand for pomalidomide come down as demand has grown. So inventory is moving exactly as we expected. With respect to MM-020 and what\u2019s happening in the myeloma share circumstance, very interesting because data subset of course do move share, but the other thing that is part of our program that we think over the next year to three that with the important are the combined studies looking for example at Bristol-Myers Squibb ipilimumab in combination with REV\/Dex, looking at the Kyprolis development in combination with REV\/Dex. So we\u2019ve multiple, multiple market shaping event that will move share from where it is today. What we control directly is submitting to the U.S. regulatory authority I took your question to mean U.S. alone, so FDA are newly diagnosed application and then finally being able to assuming that we get a positive outcome being able to directly promote REVLIMID dexamethasone for a combination that will be in the label for newly diagnosed myeloma that we definitely believe will reaccelerate adoption of REVLIMID and share in newly diagnosed patients.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","We are going to try and take two more questions. So \u2026","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Schimmer from Lazard Capital Markets.","Josh Schimmer - Lazard Capital Markets","Yes, thanks for squeezing me in. Have you started to see any meaningful inflexion in the use of the R2 regimen in the U.S. with the approval of the 20 milligram dose or one might may \u2013 we see that and do you have any plans of study in your apremilast that on the biologics and that sort one might expect? Thanks.","Robert J. Hugin","Thanks for the question. On the R2 regimen and the introduction of the 20 milligram dose for the \u2013 for more specifically its early, we don\u2019t see a lot of adoption in the market for the combination, but we do see tremendous investigator interest. So I think we\u2019re on the leading edge of being able to establish that regimen.","The focus of our future clinical development is not likely on add on to biologics, certainly it will be some exploration of that for safety reasons and some utilization. We see the primary positioning for apremilast being used before biologics and it can be in some cases after biologics and failures but the primary position being for that in the pre-biologic space, early in the biologics and we see a very different risk benefit profile emerging from the Phase III data which would support that use early.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","I think operator, we have time for one last question please.","Operator","Thank you. Your final question for today comes from Matthew Roden from UBS Securities.","Matthew Roden - UBS Securities","Great. Thanks for taking my question. So, assuming MM-015 and 020 are supportive of label expansion REVLIMID in Europe. Should we modeling uptake in the transplant setting as well as the non-transplant setting, the later being where those trials were conducted, realizing you\u2019ve other data sets like ECOG that could be supportive here, but I just want to clarify this issue because, I know that you tends to be very specific in this labeling and I just don\u2019t know to what extent that applies to here. So, it would be helpful if you could walk us through what settings and combinations you think your filings will be supportive of outside the U.S.?","Robert J. Hugin","Matt, thanks for the question. So in the end we would want to have as many segments in newly diagnosed myeloma represented in our label in Europe and around the world as possible. This is my point about combination therapies. So nPR RV \u2013 these are regimes as you all know that could be approved for elderly or younger patients. So right now our models include all patient populations. I think the only category where we discount rapid adoption or major adoption is in the higher risk group, because that\u2019s still an open ended question about slightly genetics and some of the things that are in development, that might be specific to higher risks. That said, these combinations with REVLIMID are as effective as all other existing regimens for high risk patients.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","And just to make sure that you\u2019re alarmed with our model assumptions, we have pushed the transplant setting revenues out to close to two years later than the non-transplant faring just from the standpoint of when we actually start to see material revenues, we may start to ramp up. So it is we lay outside the U.S., so it is layered into the model that way.","With that, thank you very much for being on the call with us today. We appreciate it and we look forward to seeing you and speaking with you soon.","Robert J. Hugin","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This concludes our program for today. You may all disconnect and have a wonderful day."],"3913":["Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ:CELG) Q2 2015 Earnings Conference Call July 23, 2015  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Patrick Flanigan - VP, IR","Bob Hugin - Chairman & CEO","Peter Kellogg - EVP and CFO","Jackie Fouse - President, Global Hematology and Oncology","Scott Smith - President, Global Inflammation and Immunology","Mark Alles - President & COO","Analysts","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Geoff Meacham - Barclays","Odysseas Kostas - Evercore ISI","Matt Roden - UBS","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs","Geoffrey Porges - Bernstein","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets","Ian Somaiya - Nomura Securities","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Company","Cory Kasimov - JPMorgan","Matthew Harrison - Morgan Stanley","John Newman - Canaccord","Mara Goldstein - Cantor Fitzgerald","Operator","Welcome to Celgene's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. I would like to remind you that this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Patrick Flanigan, Vice President of Investor Relations at Celgene.","Patrick Flanigan","Thanks, Amanda and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter earnings conference call. The press release reporting our financial results, in addition to the presentation for today's webcast, can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the corporate website at www.celgene.com.","Joining me in the room today with prepared remarks are Bob Hugin, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Peter Kellogg, our Chief Financial Officer; Mark Alles, our Chief Operating Officer; Jackie Fouse, who is Global Head of our Hematology and Oncology franchise; and Scott Smith, Global Head of our Inflammation and Immunology franchise.","As a reminder, during today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements regarding our financial outlook in addition to regulatory and product development plans. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those forecasted. A description of these risks can be found in our most recent 10-Q on file with the SEC.","These statements speak only as of today's date and we undertake no duty to update or revise them. Reconciliation of the adjusted financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available as part of the earnings release.","Finally, just a reminder that the acquisition of Receptos will be accomplished through a tender offer that has not yet commenced. Any descriptions relating to Receptos contained in this presentation are for informational purposes. Receptos' stockholders are urged to read the tender offer document that will be filed with the SEC.","I would now like to turn the call over to Bob.","Bob Hugin","Thank you, Patrick. Good morning and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Having shared our preliminary results with you last week, we appreciate the opportunity to more fully discuss our second quarter accomplishments this morning.","Across the board, the results were outstanding. Our teams around the world delivered exceptional near-term performance and advanced strategic initiatives, significantly enhancing our medium and long-term growth potential. Peter, Jackie, Scott and Mark will review the numerous accomplishments of the first half of the year and how they position us to meet or exceed our objectives for the remainder of 2015.","Strong revenue and earnings growth reflect the positive operating momentum in our businesses across franchises and geographies. Accordingly, we have raised our 2015 adjusted earnings-per-share guidance to a range of $4.75 to $4.85, up from our earlier target of $4.60 to $4.75. This updated guidance includes the dilutive impact of all of our business development activities this year.","We've also made excellent progress advancing the potential of our portfolio. In the first half of the year, we achieved six approvals in major markets for our key products. We're only beginning to see the returns from these regulatory actions.","We do not often have the opportunity to highlight the progress of our early stage pipeline, but thanks to the work of our research teams and collaboration partners, we've already filed four new INDs and progressed five new candidates into the clinic this year. Over the next 12 to 15 months, together with our partners, we expect to file at least five additional INDs, continuing to add to our deep and diverse pipeline.","During the quarter, we identified several opportunities that can materially enhance and diversify our long-term growth drivers well beyond 2020. Our transactions with AstraZeneca and Juno broadened our immuno-oncology pipeline by leveraging the strength of our hematology and oncology franchise.","The Receptos acquisition, targeted to close in the third quarter following Hart-Scott-Rodino review, is aligned with our strategic imperative of building a leading immunology and inflammation franchise. Ozanimod is a key addition to our portfolio of innovative and disruptive oral therapies targeting sizable and evolving immuno inflammatory markets. We look forward to welcoming the Receptos employees who have done an outstanding job advancing their programs to the Celgene team, once the transaction closes.","It's a very exciting time at Celgene and we remain committed to achieving our full potential. Let me now turn the call over to Peter.","Peter Kellogg","Thank you, Bob. And good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report exceptional results across our portfolio in both the second quarter and the first half of 2015. Our business grew strongly, the pipeline has progressed well and with eight new approvals over the last 12 months, our outlook continues to improve.","While delivering exceptional operational results, as Bob discussed, our team has been determined to build an increasingly strong future by investing in innovative and disruptive technologies that contribute to growth in 2020 and the next decade. To that end, we increased our topline and bottom-line 2020 targets to greater than $21 billion and $13 per share, respectively.","These strategic investments have additionally been paired with an ongoing focus on shareholder returns. Our execution of the Celgene capital allocation strategy continues to return near-term value to our shareholders in addition to the important strategic investments. Through midyear, we have repurchased over $2 billion of Celgene shares.","Now, turning to our second quarter results, total net product sales grew 22% to approximately $2.25 billion. The growth was driven by strong performances by REVLIMID and POMALYST\/IMNOVID. ABRAXANE continues to grow nicely in pancreatic cancer and OTEZLA's launch remains on track, achieving the desired pre-biologic positioning, strong adoption and is well-positioned for future success.","Once again, volume drove our revenue growth. The 21.7 percentage points for the volume growth accounted for the vast majority of our 22.2% topline performance. Modest price gains were largely offset by a negative 2% Forex impact of approximately $38 million. REVLIMID and POMALYST\/IMNOVID posted strong year-over-year increases.","These products are performing quite well in the marketplace. And Jackie will talk more later about the market dynamics. ABRAXANE continues to grow, especially outside the U.S., where we're now seeing the impact of the September 2013 pancreatic cancer approval in Europe. OTEZLA had nearly 50% quarter-over-quarter growth. The drug is still in the early phase of its European global launch. Scott will provide additional color on the underlying product dynamics.","Second quarter adjusted earnings-per-share was $1.23, a 37% increase over prior-year. And this result includes a $0.06 equity gain due to the acquisition of Flexus Biosciences by Bristol-Myers Squibb.","Looking at the P&L line items for Q2, year-over-year, the adjusted operating margin improved 100 basis points to 51.3%. While there was some natural leverage from our outstanding topline performance, you can see the effects of our quarter-over-quarter launch investments in SG&A. And we stepped up our OTEZLA DTC launch campaign and continued building our commercial I&I EU organization for future launches.","Earlier this year, we indicated that we expected the pace of R&D spend to increase as our pipeline and clinical trial activity grew. We continue to invest strongly in R&D. And through the first half of 2015, we have invested almost $1 billion. Operating income was our major driver of bottom-line results, accounting for $0.23 per share of the year-over-year increase in adjusted EPS.","And we ended the quarter with nearly $7.5 billion in cash and marketable securities, roughly in line with our balance at the beginning of the year. As I mentioned, during the first half of 2015, we have purchased over $2 billion in shares. We have reauthorized an additional $4 billion for share repurchases, leaving us with an ongoing authorization level of $5.1 billion.","So, while the Celgene team has made significant investment in innovative and disruptive technologies in the first half of 2015, we have also continued our philosophy of returning excess capital to shareholders through our strong share repurchase program. In completing our financial picture, we assess return on invested capital both with and without cash in the capital base. Through Q2, our ROIC performance continues to be outstanding.","So in summary, our financial and operating results in Q2 and the first half of 2015 certainly established strong momentum for the second half of the year. We're well on track to achieve our net product sales guidance of $9 billion to $9.5 billion. And absorbing the dilutive impact of our strategic deals, we have actually raised our adjusted EPS guidance to $4.75 to $4.85.","It was indeed a very active first half. Celgene announced important investments across our portfolio with AstraZeneca, Quanticel, Agios and more recently with Lycera, Juno and Receptos. Accordingly, we feel it has been a very strong first-half strategically as well and we're excited to be driving the company toward its very bright future.","Thank you. Now I'd like to turn the call over to my colleague, Jackie.","Jackie Fouse","Thank you, Peter. Good morning, everyone. The hematology\/oncology team delivered outstanding results in Q2 and continues to build on the strong momentum created in Q1. Our growth is accelerating and our first-half results put us in a great position to deliver on our targets for the full-year.","Our commercial and market access teams around the world are executing extremely well and our launches are meeting or exceeding our expectations. Our clinical medical project leadership and regulatory teams are also hitting their milestones and setting us up to be able to continue to generate strong growth for a long time to come.","In addition, as Bob and Peter mentioned, we invested further for the future during Q2, in particular with our AstraZeneca MedImmune durvalumab and our collaboration with Juno. The clinical development plan for durvalumab has been approved by the collaboration's joint Development Committee and we will initiate the first trials under the program by year-end.","REVLIMID's growth accelerated significantly in Q2 and quarterly revenues surpassed $1.44 billion. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, REVLIMID's year-over-year growth in Q2 was 21% and was mainly volume-driven, as the favorable impact of U.S. price increases is largely being offset by price declines in Europe.","Our newly diagnosed multiple myeloma launch dynamics are very strong in both the U.S. and Europe, as our country teams execute on a well-formulated global launch plan developed by our global marketing team. In the U.S., we hit all-time highs with both total RX's and new RX's in Q2. In Germany, our launch metrics are strong and in Europe, we expect to have all top five country reimbursement approvals by around Q1 of next year.","Market shares are strong across all geographies, as are duration trends. We continue to further REVLIMID's geographic expansion. We have finalized federal reimbursement in Russia and made important progress towards regulatory approval and reimbursement in both Brazil and Mexico. During Q2, data was presented at ASCO that added further support for REVLIMID's position as the backbone in the emerging myeloma triplet regimens.","The details of the FLASH analysis presented at ASCO, EHA and ICML support durable complete response as a surrogate endpoint for PFS in follicular lymphoma, where our RELEVANCE trial is fully enrolled and should read out on 30-month durable CR in the first half of 2017. Other data presented at these congresses further enhances Celgene's strong positions across hematology. And we're now looking forward to a successful international myeloma workshop meeting in September.","POMALYST\/IMNOVID's growth is excellent in the markets where we have launched and the product grew 18% sequentially and 46% year-over-year. Advancing the product's geographic expansion, we achieved reimbursement approval in Japan during Q2 and began launching there in June. Both share and duration metrics were positive across our major geographies. And we still have important EU and other country reimbursement approvals ahead of us, approvals that will fuel the products' growth for a long time to come.","On the regulatory front, POMALYST U.S. label was updated for overall survival during the quarter and our U.S. approval made final. We're in the early days of the label update but initial market reaction to that update is positive.","On the clinical front, trials studying pomalidomide in several combination regimens are enrolling. We saw early interesting data presented at ASCO for Pom\/Dex in combination with cyclophosphamide and we expect to continue to see pomalidomide Triplett data emerge and evolve.","ABRAXANE posted strong 9% sequential growth and 13% year-over-year growth, driven primarily by the ongoing launch of pancreatic cancer across Europe. We have also launched Abraxane in non-small cell lung cancer in the early access markets in Europe. We expect solid future growth in Europe for Abraxane as we continue to achieve reimbursement for the pancreatic indication and as the launch of non-small cell lung cancer ramps up.","Abraxane is also now approved for pancreatic cancer in Japan and our partner Taiho is launching that indication there. Multiple trials are ongoing, studying Abraxane across a variety of indications in immunotherapy combination regimens and some of these programs were highlighted at ASCO. We continue to be excited about ABRAXANE's future prospects in this space. In addition, we expect data from our internal trials to start to read out beginning next year, with breast and lung data coming first and adjuvant pancreatic later.","In summary, my hematology\/oncology franchise colleagues around the world produced outstanding results yet again in Q2 across all of our teams. Our near-term execution is excellent and our long-term strategy is robust and designed to produce strong growth for many years to come as we invest for the future. In addition to our very positive operating momentum, we will also see a steady stream of new clinical data across our products and indications starting in 2016. And we look forward to sharing that data with you.","Thank you. And I will now hand over to Scott.","Scott Smith","Thank you, Jackie. Q2 was a great quarter for Celgene I&I. During the quarter, we saw significant acceleration of prescriptions and revenues for OTEZLA in the U.S. and strong initial uptake in the early launch countries internationally. We also made progress on indication expansion for OTEZLA advancing a global Phase III program in Behcet's Disease and Phase II studies in atopic dermatitis and ulcerative colitis.","Additionally, we made significant investments in our next-generation growth drivers by initiating the early stages of the pivotal program for GED-301 in Crohn's disease. And last week we announced the potentially transformational agreement with Receptos.","Now turning to OTEZLA, we're seeing a substantive uptick in revenues and demand in the U.S.. Total prescriptions far outpace the recent launch analogs in the I&I space and currently measure over 4,500 TRx's per week based on the latest data.","Revenues for the quarter grew to $90 million worldwide and we're tracking well in line with internal plans. We're very encouraged at the progress we're seeing outside of the U.S., both in Canada and in early launch countries in the EU. After only five months, we're outpacing all recent launches in Germany. Still very early in the launch, but this initial success helps reinforce the global value proposition of OTEZLA and the need for novel approaches to the treatment of I&I disease.","The trends in the U.S. are supported by positive launch metrics. While the PSA launch continues to make strong and steady progress, the launch of psoriasis indication has fueled much of the recent acceleration.","Access to new therapies is a critical component of success in this market. And it's important to note that over 70% of OTEZLA prescriptions in pre-biologic patients are being approved on first pass. Total U.S. patient share for OTEZLA in psoriasis surpassed ALLERA some months ago and passed ENBREL's overall patient share in June. The source of business in psoriasis continues to be heavily weighted towards the pre-biologic sector with 75% of patients coming to OTEZLA from topical therapy or no therapy at all over the past 12 months.","We're very pleased with this early OTEZLA launch success and we're focused on continuing execution in the U.S. and around the world. At the same time, we're working to build a strong and diversified portfolio. Anchored by early OTEZLA success, we expect to see a series of blockbuster launches beginning in 2018, with ozanimod in multiple sclerosis quickly followed by GED-301 in Crohn's disease and ozanimod in EC. These launches have the potential to transform the treatment of these serious and difficult to treat diseases, as well as setting the foundation for significant revenue growth in 2020 and beyond.","We're strongly focused in executing on all aspects of the GED-301 development plan. The endoscopy study, CD-001, is actively enrolling and should fully enroll this summer. The large pivotal [indiscernible] program will initiate in Q3 and we're working towards initiating a Phase II study with GED-301 in UC by the end of the year.","Earlier this week, we received orphan drug designation for the FDA for the treatment of pediatric Crohn's and look to initiate that study later this year or in early 2016. This is a large and diverse late-stage development program and we're very, very excited about the potential of GED-301 across a variety of patient types.","As stated earlier, Q2 was a quarter full of advancements in Celgene I&I. The balance of the year should also be full of major milestones and accomplishments. We're focused on continuing to accelerate the strong U.S. OTEZLA launch, including expanding our DCC program and on the successful launch of OTEZLA in key geographies outside of the U.S..","Advancing the pipeline is also critical in 2015 and led by the development of GED-301 in IBD. Additionally, we plan on moving other key clinical programs, such as CC-220 and sotatercept, forward through important milestones. We're also very excited about the announced transaction with Receptos. On completion of the merger, we look forward to working with the talented people of Receptos to accelerate the development of ozanimod.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Alles","Thank you, Scott. Good morning, everyone. I appreciate the opportunity to provide additional perspective on our performance before opening the call for your questions.","We started this year with excellent operating momentum and clarity on the significant opportunities for our products and our company. We established ambitious goals and set high expectations. Clearly, our second quarter results demonstrate that our teams are executing well and that we're achieving the milestones and adding important new drivers to accelerate growth now and well into the future.","In hematology, our multiple myeloma portfolio continues to define the standards of care for all segments of this incurable blood cancer. While still early into the global launch of REVLIMID for newly diagnosed myeloma, we're encouraged by key indicators of success in the United States and in Europe. The recent addition of overall survival data to the POMALYST approved product labeling in the United States adds an immediate and important commercial advantage.","Pivotal clinical trials testing REVLIMID in diffuse large B-cell and follicular lymphoma continue to advance. Our strategy to establish durable complete response as a key clinical and perhaps regulatory endpoint in follicular lymphoma was significantly strengthened by the FLASH and meta-analysis presented during ASCO. Optimizing the potential of REVLIMID in the lymphoma is one of our most important corporate objectives.","In collaboration with our partners Agios and Acceleron, we continue to advance the development of high potential and unique agents, with pivotal trials planned for the treatment of subsets of patients with acute myeloid leukemia, beta thalassemia or myelodysplastic syndromes. With the International Myeloma Working Group meeting set for September and our plans for ASH in December, we expect our hematology franchise to continue to gain momentum.","Since the formation of our Immuno-oncology Research Center of Excellence just 12 months ago, we have rapidly and strategically evolved and are shaping the future direction of the field through new partnerships focused on T-cell checkpoint inhibitors and engineered T cells and other unique platforms seeking to direct or activate the immune system to fight cancer.","Our significant progress in this relatively short amount of time makes us optimistic about our potential to develop and deliver blockbuster products in this increasingly important approach to the treatment of cancer. Our I&I franchise made outstanding progress during the second quarter. OTEZLA is gaining strong momentum in the U.S.","The marketing approval for OTEZLA in Europe, coupled with positive results of the SORE11 study to support registration in Japan, firmly established geographic expansion as a new growth driver. And key studies supporting new indications are in development or are ongoing. Once completed, the acquisition of Receptos adds ozanimod to our cornerstone products OTEZLA and GED-301 and vaults us into a leadership position developing and commercializing therapies for dermatologic, rheumatologic and inflammatory bowel diseases, with an important opportunity in multiple sclerosis.","We're encouraged and energized by our year-to-date progress and accomplishments. Our teams are committed to achieving key second-half goals and understand the significant promise of our products, pipeline, partnerships and now and well beyond 2020. Above all, we're focused on improving our operating performance and on developing and commercializing therapies with the greatest potential to help patients and their families.","Thank you, operator. Please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ying Huang of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Ying Huang","Jackie, if you don't mind, can you provide a little bit more clarity on the initial trajectory for REVLIMID launch in first-line myeloma, especially in Germany? For example, do you expect ultimately you will achieve the same market share like in the United States?","And then secondly, on the high-level, can you guys comment on -- obviously, you have been very busy on the deal front, including Astra, Juno and then acquisition of Receptos. Does that change your thought on potential settlements on IP for REVLIMID with Allergan? Thank you.","Jackie Fouse","So, yes, we're seeing -- it's a little bit early, because we just got the approval in February, but we're off to a really great start. In Germany, we've seen rapid gains in share. The uptake is quite good. So we're very happy with where we're. We think it bodes well for other markets.","In terms of where the share should be able to go, there is no reason why it shouldn't go in the same direction that it's gone in the U.S.. But every country is a little bit different, so the rate at which that happens and just the different product positions in the different markets gives you a little bit of variability there. But we were extremely excited about it. All of the feedback that we got from EHA is very consistent and positive. And we're quite happy with how things are going.","Scott Smith","And on the intellectual property front, we really view the prosecution of the defense of our IP estate completely independent from any other actions. So, our strategy is very clear in what we're doing there and unrelated to any of the business development activities that we've undertaken.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is open.","Geoff Meacham","I wanted to ask you a little bit on Abraxane. I know you have Phase III in long and triple negative for -- with PD-L1 ongoing. But the growth drivers from here in the U.S., maybe just help us with what we'll see. Are you gaining additional share in pancreatic? Are you expanding the market in your older indications, if you want to call it that, in the case of breast and lung? Thanks a lot.","Jackie Fouse","In pancreatic, we have been gaining share. The share in the impact patient population is right at 50% now. And it's -- once you jump up, it's a slower trajectory in terms of the share gains. But we continue to see a nice position there. Lung and breast are quite competitive, so I would say we're holding our own in that regard.","We will see, globally, I think, a nice acceleration as we continue to ramp the launches in Europe for pancreatic and lung. It's still early days with those. We still don't have approval in all major markets for pancreatic, for example. So we've got France still to go there and only recent approvals in countries like Spain.","So the trajectory is still well ahead of us for pancreatic in Europe. In the countries where we're launched, we're doing quite well. So, in terms of the other programs that we have, we're quite excited about what's going on in the immuno-oncology space. But in addition to all of those trials, some of which are being run by other companies, our own programs are going to start to read data out beginning in 2016 across the ABOUND program in lung which is four trials, as you know. Adjuvant pancreas will be a little bit later in the second half of 2017 in triple negative breast data from the Phase II TENACITY trial. So, we're very excited about the data flow to come.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Odysseas Kostas","It's actually Odysseas Kostas sitting in for Mark. The questions I have, one of them has to do with the guidance for full-year EPS that was given. I guess that was last week -- the increase to $4.75, $4.85 just by the expected dilution from the acquisition of Receptos. I'm just sort of wondering if you can sort of talk us through sort of how you end up getting there.","And then the other question has to do with the -- again, the acquisition of Receptos and the $4 billion to $6 billion that you said about expected sales. Just wondering in terms of what kind of label that $4 billion to $6 billion assumes? Does that assume that ozanimod does not get a class label? And then also on that $4 billion to $6 million, maybe help us, are those probability-adjusted sales numbers? Thank you.","Peter Kellogg","This is Peter. Let me take the first question regarding the guidance and then I'll pass it over to Scott for the questions regarding the Receptos transaction. So, on the guidance for this year, clearly, as you can see to the first half of the year, we've got great business momentum. And I think we've covered that. Now you can see the full P&L.","So quite frankly, what's been very nice is that as we anticipate the closing of this transaction and having the Receptos operation as part of our company, we do include the R&D burn for the stub of the year and the second half of the year for the company -- important clinical trials that are going on. And as well, we will be taking out debt, as we talked about. And so we've incorporated the interest expense.","So those are the two items that will be added to our P&L from an expense standpoint. What we have highlighted is that we actually have very good business momentum. We're able to absorb those items and still deliver the EPS that we had originally anticipated. And, in fact, that the momentum is so strong that we're both absorbing that additional R&D and interest expense and actually increasing the EPS.","So, it's actually just a reflection of very, very strong operating performance, in many ways thanks to the global hem\/onc team, Jackie, really great performance. And it's a real luxury to be able to do a transaction and raise guidance in the same situation.","Let me turn -- for the second question, let me turn it over to Scott regarding the revenue outlook for peak sales.","Scott Smith","Our base assumptions around label is that there will be some class labeling that we had, but there will be an opportunity to have data in the label. We can't be definitive on what the exact label is going to look like. It's a matter of getting the data and having discussions and review with the FDA. But we believe that the data, particularly around cardiovascular and hepatic toxicity, looks quite different than you see for Gilenya and it's quite differentiated.","Relative to the second part of that question, the $4 billion to $6 million are nonprobability-adjusted, but they only include the two lead indications of multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis. Did not include any revenues for other potential indications, including Crohn's disease, psoriasis or lupus, specifically SLE.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Roden of UBS. Your line is open.","Matt Roden","Nice product volume growth here in the quarter. And, in particular, I wanted to ask about REVLIMID in the U.S., given the better-than-expected performance and Jackie mentioned specifically growth in the new prescriptions as well as the total.","I believe that you guys used to say that with the approval of REVLIMID in the U.S. for newly diagnosed, that you could capture an incremental 10 or 15 share points in the U.S.. Now that you have a quarter-plus under your belts here, is that 10 to 15 point gain still looking realistic? And do you think that could even be conservative, considering that some other cancer drugs can get up as high as 70%, 80% penetration?","I guess what would be helpful is if you could give us an update on share trends in the U.S. and to the extent you can, an update on duration of therapy, since that is also a driver of the volumes. Thanks very much.","Jackie Fouse","We're extremely pleased with REVLIMID's performance, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. The early indications in Germany, as we said, are very strong. So, we're gaining share in newly diagnosed, particularly in that non-stem cell transplant population. We, I would say, are holding steady in second-line. That's where we see carfilzomib coming up a little bit, but we've been very pleased with the RX trends.","And now that we're several weeks into the launch and seeing those record numbers, we think those reflect share gains as well as duration trends when we look between the new RXs and the total RXs. So duration continues to be a positive in terms of the trajectory. And now in the U.S. for first exposure is about 16.5 months or so. So we continue to see steady gains there.","Matt Roden","And can you put any parameters around where you think you are in terms of share in the various segments of front-line?","Jackie Fouse","Yes, I mean remember that in, for example, post-stem cell transplant maintenance, our share has always been quite strong. It's been over 80% for a long time. And we continue to hold there. And we continue to gain in the front-line, particularly, as I said, the non-transplant-eligible. And I think we've still got a ways to go in terms of the share gains there.","We like the position that we're in with respect to backbone therapy in the emerging triplet regimens. And we think that's going to help as well. So, gaining share with more gains still to come. And it's going to be a steady process, I would say, in the U.S. and Europe, I think we'll see the uptake be pretty steep as we get into the launches in the different countries across Europe.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Robyn Karnauskas","So, the question is for Scott. So, a couple things. You mentioned that a lot of patients or many patients for OTEZLA are allowed to take the drug without having to take a biologic. But what percentage of patients really have no problem, like if they write a script, the doctor is going to fill out a form to argue that the patient doesn't -- can't take a biologic?","What percent of patients have it very easy and what percentage of patients do you think -- there is still some hurdle where there's paperwork ahead of getting a script? And then regarding European launch, can you give any color on anything you are seeing there as far as trends, differences versus the U.S. and the launch of OTEZLA? Thanks.","Scott Smith","It's a little bit difficult to get at the exact data from your first question, but what our feel is, about 50% of scripts go through without any additional paperwork and other things. And then another -- of the other 50% that require some paperwork, a letter of medical necessity or rather minor paperwork from the office goes in with the script and it gets billed on first pass.","So, about 70% of them are getting filled first pass whether it's immediately or with a letter to help accentuate and quicken that process. And that's one of our key goals throughout the course of this year, is to continue to move positively the access situation for the drug. But so far, we're pleased and it's in line, but we have some ways to go to continue to make sure that the product is made available generally as much as possible and has the best access position as possible.","Relative to the second part, in the EU launch, it's early. I think, as Jackie was saying, relative to newly diagnosed, the approval was late in January and the launch was in February. But we're very, very pleased with the launch dynamics. When you take a look at market share and where the source of business is coming from and some of the early launch metrics, it looks very, very similar to what you see in the U.S..","I think on a per-patient basis, Germany actually may be ahead of those strong trends that we saw in the United States. So we're very pleased there. Other countries coming online. Some still aren't online with reimbursement and others have just received reimbursement decisions over the past couple of months. So it's too early for me to really project on those. But Germany, that's had four or five months now of relatively unrestricted access. So it's very, very positive.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Terence Flynn","Maybe just two for me. Was wondering, Peter, if we look at the SG&A, I think it came in a little bit ahead of what we were expecting. Just wondering, is that the kind of new level we should expect as we head into 2016? And then the second question was just maybe for Mark on REVLIMID for lymphoma. I know you guys are highly focused here. Any update on the timing of the two key studies there? Thank you.","Peter Kellogg","So for the SG&A, yes. In many ways, what we've done is we've really, in the first half of the year, really done a lot in terms of the buildout of the I&I franchise, getting ready for the European launches. We continue to launch out some of the POM and Abraxane markets.","So, in some ways, our running rate through the second quarter is what you should think of going forward. SG&A will go up a bit in Q3 and Q4 as well. But really, the growth, the increase is going to slow down. We're going to start getting leverage now that we've built this infrastructure and so forth, as we continue moving forward in 2016.","So I think SG&A will not grow as fast as revenue in future years and we'll see some really nice P&L leverage from that which will be really helpful to our P&L. I would just also highlight that we kicked off some DTC in the U.S. for OTEZLA in the second quarter and that will continue. And so that also stepped up a little bit the SG&A. So we feel very good about those investments. But clearly, as we've indicated before, we'll start seeing some leverage off of that. And we'll keep powering ahead on the R&D line.","Jackie Fouse","I'm going to take the REVLIMID lymphoma question. So, as we all know, there's five Phase III trials up and running. Two of those are fully enrolled, being REMARK in diffuse large B-cell and RELEVANCE in follicular lymphoma. And then we have three other ones that are enrolling.","The first data readout we would expect should be for the REMARK trial late in 2016, sometime in the second half. And then we would expect the RELEVANCE trial to read out on that 30-month durable CR endpoint in the first half of 2017. And then we've got the other trials reading out in the second half of 2017 and out into 2018 depending on the trial.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges of Bernstein. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Porges","Peter, I wanted to follow-up on your comments about SG&A in regard to R&D. Could you give us a sense of how much of your R&D pro forma spend this quarter was for external milestones? And then secondly, related to that, you've taken on a lot of major obligations for 2016 and 2017 between Receptos, Juno, the PD-L1, et cetera. So, are you confident at this stage that your R&D spend will not grow faster than revenue? Or are you prepared to allow to grow faster than revenue for a couple of years? And could you lastly give us some sense of where you think net debt should be after you get through all this activity? Thanks.","Scott Smith","I think that in the second quarter, we actually had a lower level of milestones. This quarter, I think we had a couple of small ones. But relative to some quarters in the past, this is probably lower. So, not a big item.","Your point about taking on some of the additional pipeline opportunities with both Receptos and also the AstraZeneca MedImmune deal and so forth, you're right. That is an important part of building our future. And so we do -- I don't have a number to guide exactly on R&D as we go into 2016, but you should see, as I mentioned earlier, from the Receptos transaction, we're going to be pushing forward with the trials they've got underway and continuing developing those drugs. So that will increase R&D.","Likewise, interest expense will go up. We indicated that in the financing of this deal, we would have incremental roughly $5 billion in debt and the rest would be done with using our own company cash.","And on an ongoing basis, obviously, we continue to maintain efficient capital structure which does imply having a certain amount of leverage and strong share repurchase program. All of that was taken into account and we indicated on the announcement that we thought that for 2016, we would have a dilutive impact of about $0.40 per share in 2016, but we would start working that down to $0.25 in 2017 and be breakeven in 2018. So we took a very ambitious approach.","One thing I would highlight, though, is, although we're investing in R&D and that is so important to our future and it is so important to have these collaborations and these development deals, our operating margin net-net, when you look through all this, is continuing to increase. We're actually anticipating about 52% in 2015. And if you kind of go forward kind of on a longer-term view, we'd see that operating margin continue to grow really nicely.","If you take our 2020 guidance, really the math would imply that we're going to have our operating margin in the high 50s. So while we're making the important and necessary investments to create the growth drivers for the next decade, we're also, at the same time, really pushing hard to have great productivity in the organization, great operating efficiency and to have, over time -- it may move around a little bit, but over time, we're setting very ambitious goals for having improved margins and really great strong operating performance throughout the company.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Michael Yee","I wanted to ask on an update or a little more details on GED-0301. Specifically the endoscopy study almost finished enrollment and then the start of the Phase III efficacy studies, just wanted to understand the gating factors to starting the efficacy studies. What is going on there? What are we waiting for in terms of the endoscopy interim and what you can say there -- should we just be looking for start of the efficacy studies? And maybe give a little more color on what's going on with 0301. Thanks.","Scott Smith","The endoscopy study UC or CD-001 is ongoing. It's enrolling right now and should be finishing enrolling by the end of the summer. It's a 48-week study, so we should be getting results at 48 weeks after last enrollment. It's enrolling online.","The larger treat group program will initiate in Q3, this current quarter. And we're very excited about it. We're involved in study startup right now, getting everything done. It's a big global complex development plan, multicenter, multi-country. So there's a little time to get it set up, but it's not gated on anything. It's just we're going as soon as that is up and ready and we're very excited to get that going. And that will be happening this quarter. So we're very, very excited about where the program is and looking forward to moving it forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Somaiya with Nomura Securities. Your line is open.","Ian Somaiya","Just one question, just related to the ozanimod development strategy in RMS and in IBD. And if you could just sort of compare that to Novartis's strategy with Siponimod in secondary progressive MS. And a couple of questions related to that.","One, do you plan to pursue secondary progressive MS? And second, is there anything to sort of read through from Novartis's decision not to evaluate the drug in relapsed and remaining MS? And does it imply anything in terms of what the generic Gilenya might -- impact might have?","Scott Smith","So, relative to the second part of the question, I can't speculate on why a program was moved forward or not by Novartis and what the particular strategy is relative to MS. We're focused on RMF at this point in time. Secondary progressive is not an indication that we're going for right now. We'll take a look at it; understand the fullness of the data. I think the strategy would be to fully execute that Phase III program, large Phase III program in MS, take a look at that data and then figure out if we wanted to get into the secondary progressive at that point in time.","Ian Somaiya","And if I could just ask a related question. There is obviously potentially having a neurology sales force. Does that open up the company to more corporate development activity in that area now? Or would you wait for the Phase III data before making that decision?","Bob Hugin","Yes, I think we're very happy with the portfolio where it's headed and what we have. I think we've got a lot of work to do to make sure that we're clear what our strategy is with MS, as Scott outlined. So I don't think you'll see something from us in the near-term. We're going to evaluate our options, chart our course and then execute over the next couple of years.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Schmidt of Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Eric Schmidt","Maybe for Jackie and Scott, as you work through your EU reimbursement discussions on REVLIMID ABRAXANE and OTEZLA, respectively, is there sort of an average price or an average discount to the U.S. price that we should start to focus on for Europe?","Jackie Fouse","I don't think you can really say that. I mean, every country is very different in Europe, at least in the Hem\/Onc space. What I would say in terms of our experience so far with the newly diagnosed reimbursement approvals, they are going in line essentially with our expectations, although maybe slightly better.","So we had all along expected that we related to the newly diagnosed approval in Europe would have a little bit higher average price decline in 2015, particularly than we've seen on average in the past.","And we're seeing that; it's already built into our forecast. And I would say we're coming in where we thought we would. I would also say if you look back at the situation with ABRAXANE for pancreatic cancer, as an example, we've got the regulatory approval in September of 2013. Even for a high unmet medical need disease, we see we still have a major market where we don't have reimbursement approval yet, that being France. And we only recently got it in Spain.","So, it's not an easy process. I mean, I think that I would just reiterate that. We've got great people that have built up a lot of experience over time. So we're coming out in line with or maybe slightly better than our own expectations for how we would do. But it's quite a difficult environment.","Scott Smith","Yes, always a different environment, Jackie. I would say our strategy in the I&I space, specifically for OTEZLA, is virtually identical to the strategy we have in the United States. That is a modest discount average biologic pricing to accentuate utilization in the pre-biologic space. From what I showed earlier, you can see the majority of our use is for patients that are coming off topicals or nothing and not coming off biologics.","So we believe that strategy is working in the U.S. and that's exactly our strategy in Europe as well. The difference is there are slightly different price points between the markets that you see in Europe and in the U.S. But strategically, we will come into Europe with exactly the same framework which is a modest discount to Biologics.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Cory Kasimov","I wanted to ask you about your recently announced collaboration with Juno. After working on CAR-Ts in a preclinical setting for the last couple of years, what was it that you saw in Juno's approach or capabilities that was differentiated and led you to sign this pretty sizable deal? Thanks.","Bob Hugin","I think a couple of people may have a perspective on it. I mean, we've obviously followed the whole T-cell space for a long time and have been an immunology company for a long time. And we've had good experiences with lots of different people. Here we really did feel that the long-term strategic vision about where this whole T-cell biology could take us, not just with the CAR-T as it exists today.","We thought there was great strategic research alignment as to what the potential was with the people that we're working with at Juno. We just think the team itself that they have in Seattle, the collaborators they have, the whole infrastructure they are building, is really consistent with our view of what the longer-term potential is here.","So and I think strategic corporate governance vision about what is needed to have a mutual success for both companies was something that was also very aligned here and what they see of their corporate future and how we see working together, the two of us together are really going to build a team that is going to do great things.","And so the combination of more of the strategic vision, our own view of where the science is heading and that alignment and that's what led us to looking to have a very strategic collaboration with them.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Matthew Harrison","I have two that I just wanted to ask. So the one just related to Receptos, if you could just talk a little bit about what your thoughts are on indications outside of MS? And the reason I ask is, obviously, we've seen a handful of PML cases with Gilenya and I'm just wondering how you manage that risk in indications outside MS and how you think about that with the Receptos molecule?","And then, second, maybe just back to ABRAXANE for a second. Can you just talk a little about obviously we've seen the growth slow in the U.S.. Your point to some studies next year and then obviously combinations with PD-1, PD-L1. Can you just talk about the confidence you have in the longer-term guidance that you've given for Abraxane? Thanks.","Scott Smith","And specific to ozanimod, in indications focusing on MS first and then IBD going forward, et cetera, from a PML risk and perspective what we're seeing from Gilenya when we take a look at it, a small handful of cases, all those cases to my understanding involve pretreatment with TYSABI and oftentimes with other agents which has shown to generate PMLs. And so there's been no link made between the S1P mechanism and PML at all. So we don't think there's any problem with indication expansion beyond that.","Jackie Fouse","So yes, we feel very confident in our guidance for Abraxane. Just as a reminder for the 2017 range is $1.5 billion to $2 billion of revenue. What I would tell you at the moment is it's a very competitive space, particularly in breast and lung. We're quite happy with our positions in the U.S. and we continue to grow. It is a daily fight, though, with the -- in the commercial environment, including working through pathways in the U.S. with payers and things like that. So -- and we're extremely pleased with what we've achieved in pancreatic cancer becoming standard of care in a relatively short period of time.","We see a lot of potential in Europe over the next -- from now, out for the next few years, as we launch there and ramp up. So that's going to give us very solid growth. And then as I mentioned, between our internal trials and then the immunotherapy trials reading out, we're extremely confident in where Abraxane is going to shake out with all of this.","And I think on a regular basis, you are seeing companies talk about their programs and coming data readouts from those of various trials. And we're hearing a lot of anecdotal positives -- feedback in terms of how people see ABRAXANE's potential for the long-term in that space. So, quite confident in where we're going to get to.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Newman of Canaccord. Your line is open.","John Newman","The question is on OTEZLA. And then I have a question on the Juno collaboration. On OTEZLA, would you expect the DTC spending to continue to increase in the United States at the same rate going forward? Or would you expect it perhaps to accelerate? I'm also wondering if, within your strategy, you have considered negotiating with the plans in order to ensure that patients have to step through OTEZLA before Biologics? Or if you believe that's necessary?","And in terms of the Juno collaboration, I'm wondering if there are any specific plans to look at the CAR-T technology in multiple myeloma? There's been small amounts of data there that suggests there might be something interesting, but I'm just curious if you've thought about that possibility? Thank you.","Scott Smith","We have a DTC program for OTEZLA for the course of this year 2015. That DTC initiated on June 9. So we're still in the early days. We'll take a look at how that rolls out and the effect of the return and the ability of that DTC program to continue to drive patients to lots of different sites.","And so we'll evaluate more as we get towards the end of the year whether that stays the same or accelerates or what that looks like, based on the effectiveness of that particular program. Yes, certainly we do consider negotiating with plans. We do have -- with a relatively small number of plans but growing -- have negotiated a place where patients would step through OTEZLA before going to Biologics. The clinical profile certainly supports that in a good portion of patients.","And so, that's something that we don't see a lot of that in the U.S., but we're starting to see some plans come that way. And I think that's a good long-term goal for us as we move OTEZLA forward, is to bring more and more plans with a step-on OTEZLA before heading to other biologic therapy.","Bob Hugin","And on the other question about myeloma CAR-T, we're very encouraged and committed to our program with Bluebird for the BCMA target myeloma in that space. So we're very encouraged, looking forward to accelerating the clinical development there. And specifically to myeloma, it's such an important disease to us that we're committed to all the patient subtypes of myeloma, high-risk disease, all other areas of disease.","And whatever modality could provide an advantage and opportunity for patients there, we will invest in investigating the opportunity to really treat myeloma even more effectively than it is today.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Mara Goldstein of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Mara Goldstein","On Abraxane, I'm wondering if we could just go back for a moment and speak to the dynamic in the U.S.? I know earlier in the year, there was some discussion -- or maybe rounding out last year -- about competitive issues in the breast cancer space. But sales have been in that single-digit area.","Should we think about that as a continuation in growth primarily ex-U.S. from some of the countries you've discussed? Or is there something particular in the U.S. that might be that focal point to change what's going on there?","Jackie Fouse","And just to be clear in terms of the near-term relative contribution to growth, Europe will be the bigger component. We do continue to grow, we think, in a solid fashion in the U.S.. Breast is probably, well, lung as well to some extent -- but breast is quite competitive indication.","And what I would say on the positive side is, we will have the Phase II TENACITY triple negative results readout, as I already mentioned, in the first half of next year. We've got the GeparSepto data in the neoadjuvant setting and we're expecting that there will be an update on at San Antonio Breast. So, there is some data coming that will be supportive of our position in breast and help us continue to compete effectively and maybe get a little bit of momentum behind that indication as we go into next year.","Peter Kellogg","And that's the last question. This is Peter. I'd just like to finish up by thanking everybody for their support and interest. This has been an incredible first half of the year and a really tremendous second quarter, both operationally, as you can see in our financial numbers; strategically, in terms of the deals we've done and really we've reflected that in the increase in our 2015 guidance.","We've increased our targets for 2020 in reflection of the increased potential of this pipeline. We have a big Q3 ahead of us. We intend to wrap things up in terms of some of the transactions we've announced. We look forward after that to really welcoming the organization of Receptos into the Celgene family. They are a great team and we're looking forward to having them carry forward with the trials they've got.","So overall, we're very proud of what we've done, but we remain ambitious for the rest of this year. We've got a lot on the agenda and very excited to drive this forward. So thank you very much for your interest.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

Importantly, we achieved these results while both investing in our high-potential research portfolio and assertively managing our capital structure.","Our first quarter performance and key market dynamics for our products strengthen our confidence that we will achieve at least the midpoint of our 2016 EPS and product sales guidance ranges that we provided in January. To that end, today we are raising the lower end of our 2016 sales and EPS ranges. Our excellent business momentum also presents us with the opportunity to provide further clarity on our 2017 targets, where we now expect top line growth of approximately 18% and EPS growth of approximately 22% based on the midpoints of our adjusted 2016 and 2017 ranges.","Peter will provide additional details on our updated 2016 guidance and 2017 targets. And in addition to reviewing our excellent commercial performance, Jackie and Scott will discuss the progress our global teams are making towards maximizing the potential of our marketed products and broadening the footprint of our therapeutic franchises.","With the positive results of the Phase IIIb PSA-006 trial evaluating OTEZLA in biologic-naive patients with psoriatic arthritis, we have entered a two-year period when we expect to have the results from 18 Phase III clinical trials involving our commercial portfolio and several key late-stage compounds. These significant later-stage programs and several molecules in early and mid-stage development are expected to provide the platforms for our continued growth through the next decade. Under the leadership of Rupert Vessey and Rob Hershberg, our Thematic Centers of Excellence and our integrated collaborative research model continues to advance our portfolio of unique and potentially transformative early-stage molecules towards critical decision points.","Since the start of this year, we have already achieved important milestones relating to the development of three novel therapies. We filed investigational new drug submissions for: CC-90009, a cell-mod for acute myeloid leukemia; CC-90010, a BET inhibitor in development for solid tumors; and in collaboration with our partner Bluebird Bio, we have dosed the first patient with BB-2121, our BCMA CAR-T therapy for patients with multiple myeloma.","Additionally, based on the tremendous progress our partner Juno has made with its CD19 CAR-T therapy, we exercised our option on the program, providing yet another opportunity for us to build on and leverage our existing expertise and infrastructure to accelerate the development of a unique therapeutic approach in the promising field of immuno-oncology.","Combining our expertise in immunology and inflammation, protein homeostasis, epigenetics, and immuno-oncology with insights gained from our world-class partners is rapidly increasing our understanding of the biology and drivers of cancer and immune-inflammatory diseases. This research engine is enhancing our discovery capabilities and driving the identification of therapies that have the potential to disrupt and improve the treatment paradigms for significantly underserved patient populations.","Our first quarter performance and important research, clinical, and regulatory achievements have us well positioned to deliver high growth in the near, medium, and long term.","Thank you, and I'm pleased to welcome Peter to our call.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Mark, and good morning everyone.","As Mark mentioned, this has been an exceptional start to the year, with strong, volume-driven product sales growth of 21% driving bottom line growth of 23%. We are delivering this industry-leading performance while significantly increasing our R&D investments, as we lay the foundation for long-term growth. Our business momentum has us on track to achieve the upper half of our previously issued 2016 adjusted earnings guidance. Accordingly, we are now raising the bottom end of that range, updating guidance to $5.60 to $5.70 per share. Later on the call, I will discuss how we see this momentum continuing into 2017 and right through to 2020.","First, I would like to provide our thoughts on the outstanding Q1 results. Q1 net product sales grew 21% to approximately $2.5 billion, really strong growth. And key contributions were made by REVLIMID, POMALYST, and OTEZLA. Both Jackie and Scott will address the underlying demand dynamics and outlook for these products later on the call.","Separately, as I mentioned on the last earnings call, the sequential performance from Q4 to Q1 is always impacted by several items. REVLIMID and POMALYST were impacted in Q1 by higher gross-to-net adjustments related to early Medicare donut hole and other ACA payments. In addition, international REVLIMID sales were favorably impacted by the Russian tender in Q4. And ABRAXANE sales were impacted by customer contract optimization that resulted in a buy-in during Q4, followed by a sell-through in Q1. Not surprisingly, these dynamics resulted in a 2% sequential decline to net product sales from Q4.","Looking at our top line drivers of growth, volume accounted for 19 of the 21 total percentage points of growth, outstanding operational performance. A modest contribution from price was partially offset by foreign exchange. The strengthening U.S. dollar drove a negative ForEx impact of approximately $31 million, or a 1.5% negative impact to net product sales.","At the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share grew 23% to $1.32 per share, which includes a $0.065 impact from milestone payments made to collaboration partners for the advancement of our joint programs. Now you may recall that we did not have any milestone payments in Q1 last year. This performance exceeded our guidance range of $1.27 to $1.30 per share due to this strong operational performance. U.S. REVLIMID sales are ahead of expectations, and OTEZLA and POMALYST posted very solid year-on-year growth.","Turning to the P&L line items, as you can see, Celgene's outstanding P&L performance continued. The adjusted operating margin improved 160 basis points to 54%. We saw meaningful leverage from G&A and also from the fact that we are now lapping strong sales and marketing investments that were in place a year ago. And these investments last year supported the launches of REVLIMID in newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma, the U.S. OTEZLA launch, and global rollouts for ABRAXANE and POMALYST\/IMNOVID. This year, the increase in SG&A was primarily to support the rollout of OTEZLA in the European Community.","As we highlighted over the last few quarters, we are making significant investments in advancing our next generation of growth drivers through the mid to late-stage clinical trials. Year over year, R&D grew 37% due to: increased clinical trial activity; the Receptos operations, which were not part of our Q1 financials last year; and the $65 million of collaboration-related milestone payments that I just mentioned earlier.","Finally, the tax rate increased from the prior period, largely due to product and geographic mix.","The exceptional operational performance in Q1 drove adjusted earnings per share. Operating income growth drove $0.27 per share of the $0.25 per share bottom line growth. In total, financial levers had a negative $0.02 impact, primarily due to higher interest expense from the $8 billion bond offering last summer.","We ended the quarter with approximately $5.7 billion in cash and marketable securities. As we mentioned on the last call, given current market conditions and our long-term view on the value of the company, we accelerated our full-year plans and were forceful during Q1 with the repurchase program, acquiring $1.4 billion of shares. We achieved this level of activity while preserving financial flexibility to continue making strategic investments that further build long-term shareholder value.","Based on the strong start to the year, we are updating our 2016 guidance. We now expect REVLIMID to achieve sales of $6.7 billion, the high end of the previous range. ABRAXANE sales are expected to be in the $950 million to $1 billion range due to a highly competitive U.S. market for lung and breast cancer therapy. OTEZLA and POMALYST are on track with solid trajectories for the year. All of this gives us confidence to raise the lower end of the previous total net product sales range to $10.75 billion.","We expect R&D to increase throughout the year based on clinical trial activity and new programs coming into the portfolio such as the recent opt-in on Juno's CD19 CAR-T program. Based on these adjustments, we are also raising the lower end of the adjusted earnings guidance to the new range of $5.60 to $5.70 per share, as I mentioned earlier.","A great first quarter and an improved outlook for 2016; and very importantly, we anticipate that this strong operational momentum will carry forward.","Our guidance for 2016 equates to 19% top line growth and 20% bottom line growth. We have spent some time assessing how this great 2016 momentum will carry forward beyond our current guidance year into our target timeframe. We are very pleased to say that despite the previously discussed ForEx impact of the strengthen in the U.S. dollar and our ongoing substantial late-stage R&D investment, we expect to sustain our top and bottom line performance into 2017 and through to our 2020 target goals. This has been achieved as we significantly increased our R&D late-stage pipeline investment, funding 18 Phase III trials and is based on current ForEx exchange rates. Our outlook for 2017 now establishes a target of 18% growth top line, completely in line with our 2020 target CAGR previously announced. It is again worth noting that viewed on a constant currency basis, this 2017 top line outlook represents performance at the high end of our previous target range.","Additionally, we anticipate that the 2016 bottom line growth rate will be improved in 2017 to 22%, which is approaching our 2020 CAGR previously announced in our prior targets, and it represents an improvement over the increased 2016 bottom line guidance range. Of course, all these growth rates are based on the midpoints of our target ranges. With these outstanding growth prospects the operational performance of Celgene is expected to remain outstanding relative to the industry for the duration of our target timeframe.","Now let's focus on the two target years specifically. Turning to 2017, the primary driver in our expected commercial performance is REVLIMID, which we now expect to achieve sales of approximately $8 billion, a $1 billion increase from our prior target. Both POMALYST and OTEZLA are on track and expected to achieve our previous targets. These three drivers are partially offset by ABRAXANE due to the previously mentioned competitive dynamic.","Importantly, our R&D agenda remains very full in 2017. Programs such as GED-0301, ozanimod, durvalumab, and Juno's CD19 program are exciting high-potential assets that represent next-generation growth drivers for the company, and they will all receive important R&D late-stage investment in 2017.","At the bottom line, we now target 2017 adjusted earnings per share of between $6.75 and $7.00 a share and expect a 22% increase from 2016 based on the guidance midpoints in each year.","Finally, for modeling purposes, we advise you to use a diluted share count of 825 million shares. Now, this figure is in line with our prior target but higher than our 2016 guidance. Beginning next year, a change to the FASB accounting standards for share-based payments eliminates the favorable adjustment that is currently provided in the treasury stock method for calculating the diluted share count. This will increase our share count based solely on the new calculation methodology. Additionally, increases in the Celgene share price will also create an increase in the calculated share count.","To round out our longer-term targets, we are on track to achieve our 2020 targets of over $21 billion in product sales and over $13.00 in adjusted earnings per share. As I mentioned, these figures now reflect the current ForEx environment. We are on track despite the weakened U.S. dollar due to our operational strength. We expect that our mix of products will be different, as we now anticipate that the momentum and upside expected with REVLIMID, POMALYST, and OTEZLA will be offset by our reduced ABRAXANE outlook.","As you can see, Q1 financial performance was outstanding. It supports a strong full-year outlook and aligns with our targets for 2017 and 2020, a very strong position for Celgene.","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to my colleague, Jackie.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Peter. Good morning, everyone.","Our teams around the world produced excellent results during Q1. Our hematology franchise performance is particularly robust, especially in multiple myeloma. We have leading positions in many geographies across all lines of myeloma therapy, and we have significant growth opportunities ahead of us.","Our global launch of REVLIMID in newly-diagnosed myeloma continues and is a key driver of our growth trajectory. POMALYST\/IMNOVID remains a critical component of our portfolio and has a strong global position in relapsed refractory myeloma. ABRAXANE's growth outside the U.S. remains solid, as the product rises to a standard-of-care position in multiple markets in pancreatic cancer. In the U.S. we continue to face significant competitive challenges as we compete with novel agents in terms of both breast and lung.","Our clinical, medical, and regulatory teams delivered another strong quarter of execution on our development programs. We've made progress across all therapeutic categories on our portfolio of trials, including opting into Juno's CD19 program. We look forward to the ongoing advancement of our programs, including the first readout from our Phase III REVLIMID lymphoma program, with top line results from REMARC for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma coming soon.","Significant growth opportunities are ahead of us in multiple myeloma. REVLIMID and POMALYST\/IMNOVID are now backbone therapies within combination regimens across all lines of myeloma treatment. Triplet combinations and continuous treatment are driving and will continue to drive increases in duration. We are gaining shares in newly-diagnosed myeloma across many geographies and will continue to build on our competitive position with label expansions for REVLIMID in the post-stem cell transplant segment and for POMALYST\/IMNOVID in renal impaired patients and over time for both products in combination regimens.","Generally for multiple myeloma, the pool of patients is growing around the world with the aging population and with new therapies expanding survival and thus prevalence. And large areas of unmet medical need in myeloma remain. We believe we have a strong portfolio of novel agents in development that position us very well to deliver new therapies to patients who are not yet cured of their disease, and we will report on our progress with those programs as they advance.","Even as those development plans evolve for new novel agents starting already now with recently approved and soon to come triplet regimens, we see nice growth opportunities for IMiDs and combination regimens including IMiDs to continue to gain market share in the U.S., EU-5, and other geographies as well.","REVLIMID had a great quarter in Q1, and we are extremely pleased with our 19% year-over-year growth excluding negative foreign exchange.","In the U.S. in multiple myeloma, we continue to see strong growth in new Rx's and total Rx's, positive momentum in duration, and the ongoing adoption of the continuous treatment approach with REVLIMID. Our growth is mainly volume-driven, and we expect this to continue for a long time to come.","This strong momentum stems from a series of positive events that put REVLIMID in an outstanding position as a backbone therapy in the treatment of multiple myeloma. We now see solid trends in the U.S. with 12 to 18 months of experience, demonstrating the impact of these events in the marketplace. These same trends are taking hold outside the U.S. as well, as we achieve reimbursement for newly-diagnosed myeloma across Europe and now in Japan. With approximately one year of data post the launch of newly-diagnosed myeloma in Europe, now in several countries across Europe we feel highly confident in REVLIMID's future growth trajectory as we continue its broad global expansion.","POMALYST\/IMNOVID's global growth remained stellar at 38% for the quarter on a year-over-year basis and is robust across most major geographies. One exception was France, where net revenues for the quarter were negatively impacted in the amount of about $15 million due to a one-time adjustment to rebates. Globally, growth is volume-driven from share gains and increasing duration of treatment. POMALYST\/IMNOVID now holds a leading position in third-line and greater myeloma in all major markets where it is approved and reimbursed.","Growth will continue to be strong in 2016 and beyond, as we will have our first full year of product sales in Japan, as duration trends continue to increase around the world, and as we work to update our label for renal impairment data, which will allow us to better address that patient segment. In addition, POMALYST\/IMNOVID combination regimens are being studied with a variety of novel agents, and additional future growth will come as those data and subsequent approvals become available.","ABRAXANE continues to hold a solid position in the treatment of breast, lung, and pancreatic cancers within a highly competitive marketplace. In the U.S., overall demand for the product has been relatively stable. In pancreatic cancer, ABRAXANE in combination with gemcitabine remains the standard of care, with around 50% share of first-line patients. In both breast and squamous lung, U.S. shares have been generally flat, while shares are somewhat down in non-squamous lung. We are also seeing some downward impact on the number of breast cancer patients being treated with chemotherapy post the launch of palbociclib early last year.","Outside the U.S., ABRAXANE growth is good as the product is moving to a standard-of-care position for pancreatic cancer in the markets where it is reimbursed. Future catalysts for ABRAXANE include data from the now fully enrolled apact adjuvant pancreas trial, expected in 2017, and data from immuno-oncology combination trials in lung, expected in 2017, and triple-negative breast expected in 2018.","Our hematology\/oncology franchise is off to a great start to the year, with particularly strong trends in hematology. As Peter highlighted, this momentum is causing us to now see REVLIMID coming in at the upper end of our revenue guidance range for 2016 at around $6.7 billion. With the strength we see across our hematology portfolio this year, when we look ahead to next year we now expect a target range for 2017 total hematology revenues of $10.2 billion to $10.5 billion and range of $11.2 billion to $11.5 billion for the combined hematology\/oncology franchise, including the net negative impact of foreign exchange.","Our clinical programs are advancing, with lymphoma in the lead, and we look forward to sharing top line data with you soon from the REMARC diffuse large B-cell trial. As we move into 2017, we will have even more data coming from our lymphoma program, as we will see the readout of the RELEVANCE in follicular lymphoma in the first half of the year and the AUGMENT trial in the second half.","Moving to the longer term, we have expanded the number of new compounds and indications in our mid to late-stage hematology pipeline. This progress gives us significant confidence in our ability to deliver on our 2020 target of over $17 billion of hematology\/oncology sales despite negative currency impacts. We look forward to providing you with more updates on our clinical programs during upcoming medical meetings, as ASCO [American Society of Clinical Oncology] and EHA [European Hematology Association] are upon us, and we have excellent sets of abstract submissions for both congresses.","Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Andrew Smith - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Jackie, and good morning.","Q1 was a strong quarter for Celgene I&I and for OTEZLA. In Q1 we saw revenues continue to grow throughout the quarter in the U.S. and the EU. Leading indicators of demand remain strong in all geographies in which we have launched, and in March we filed the JNDA in Japan. We also significantly advanced the development pipeline for Celgene I&I by taking important steps forward in the GED-0301 and ozanimod programs as well as with many other early to mid-stage clinical programs.","Global OTEZLA net sales for Q1 2016 were $196 million. This represents a 224% year-on-year increase. Sales in Q1 continued to increase despite normal TRx market declines in the first quarter. The majority of revenues remain from the U.S., but we are also seeing encouraging metrics in the early launch countries in Europe. In 2016, our focus in Europe is not only on execution in the early launch countries but also on gaining optimal reimbursement decisions in the next wave of countries and more broadly expanding our footprint in the EU. This should be a significant source of growth in 2017 and beyond.","Overall, we are very pleased with the global execution of the OTEZLA launch as we head into the second full year of commercialization. This strong start in 2016 will help enable us achieve our goal of $1 billion in sales in 2016.","Now looking specifically at the U.S., physician and consumer campaigns are driving increases in brand awareness, patient requests, and trial. It's important to note that OTEZLA continues to lead all other therapies in new-to-brand share, with approximately 40% of both psoriasis and PSA markets. Additionally, OTEZLA total market share in the large psoriasis market has surpassed Enbrel and now stands at 20% of the total branded market. In the slower evolving PSA market, OTEZLA has already achieved 15% market share of the branded market.","Also importantly, earlier this month at the AMCP [Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy] meeting, data was presented that concluded OTEZLA patients showed a similar persistence compared with a biologic cohort amongst adults with psoriasis in the United States.","We are continuing to execute and advance on a robust lifecycle plan for OTEZLA. As previously mentioned, we filed for both psoriasis and PSA in Japan. We also received data from PSA-006, a Phase III study in biologic-naive patients. This was our fifth positive Phase III study for OTEZLA in PSA. We expect a number of milestones in 2016 in 2017, including data from our once-daily registration program as well as Phase II studies in atopic dermatitis and ulcerative colitis. Phase III data from the global Beh\u00e7et's trial should be available in 2017.","We are aggressively advancing all pipeline programs, including GED-0301 and ozanimod. Specifically looking at GED, in Q1 we completed enrollment in the endoscopic study CD-001 in Crohn's disease as well as continuing to enroll the large pivotal Phase III Crohn's disease trial CD-002 and a Phase II proof-of-concept study in ulcerative colitis.","During Q1 we saw significant data readouts for ozanimod, including presentations of both the 72-week MS data at ACTRIMS [Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis] and the TOUCHSTONE UC Phase II data at ECCO [European Crohn's and Colitis Organization]. We also expect the TOUCHSTONE data to be published in a major medical journal in the very near future.","Q1 was a quarter of tremendous progress for Celgene I&I. The execution of the OTEZLA launch has put us in a position to have a blockbuster contributor to the Celgene portfolio this year and beyond. We also moved all major development programs ahead. These programs will be major contributors in driving strong growth through 2020 and beyond. We are very excited and optimistic about the future of OTEZLA and the rest of the I&I portfolio as we move deeper into 2016.","Thank you for your attention. I'd like to now turn the call back to Mark.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Scott, and thanks, Peter and Jackie.","As you've heard from the team, we had an outstanding first quarter, and our global teams made great progress towards meeting or exceeding many of the aspirational goals and objectives we set at the beginning of this year. We look forward to providing further updates regarding these milestones at key conferences and major medical meetings throughout the year. Our business momentum is accelerating, driven by the robust value propositions of our major products and the beginning of a catalyst-rich two-year period, with data expected from 18 late-stage clinical trials.","We are energized and focused on executing on our strategic imperatives, maximizing our incredible potential, and discovering, developing, and delivering transformational therapies to patients in need. Our outlook has never been stronger, more dynamic, or held as much promise as it does today.","Operator, please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, thanks. Congratulations, Mark; it's your first big earnings call as CEO. On the 2017 guidance, I appreciate slide 39, which really implies that it's all due to FX. Can you just help me connect the data points between REVLIMID going up by $1 billion but total net product sales going down by about $1 billion? So that would imply changes not only to ABRAXANE but OTEZLA and possibly POM [POMALYST], which wasn't necessarily commented on. Can you walk us through what the thinking is around those other products and if the guidance you're thinking has changed on 2017? Thanks.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Hi, Michael, it's Peter. Let me start on that, and then I'm going to pass it to Jackie and Scott as well just to comment on their outlooks for each of their related products.","So you referenced a slide that actually, for the benefit of all the listeners, is actually in the backup. It's the first slide, I believe, in the backup of the slides that we went through. And it just simply highlights that over time we've had targets for 2017 revenue, which actually from when they were originally issued to more recently they were $13 billion to $14 billion, which was an increase from the original target. And if you eliminate the ForEx impact, what it shows is that in fact our current operational performance is in the high end of that guidance range. The entire discussion for 2017 total product sales is entirely a question of the strong operational performance offset by foreign exchange impacts by a strengthened dollar. So thanks for pointing that out.","I think the key is also, though, and very importantly, is with the targets that we've laid out for 2017 and for 2020, we can see now our path forward, at current foreign exchange rates, to having very strong sales momentum that we're achieving this year, that we anticipate maintaining that momentum in 2017, and quite frankly that sets us up very well to maintain that momentum all the way through 2020.","Now in terms of the individual products, maybe I'll let Jackie and Scott each just comment on what they see happening.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","Thanks, Michael. So just on the Heme\/Onc franchise, we've talked about the mix for the franchise for probably about a year or so as being different than what we had expected back in 2013 when we gave these targets, largely driven by the dynamics for ABRAXANE in the marketplace post the era of the checkpoint inhibitors and a couple of other novel agents as well. So if you take the REVLIMID update of $8 billion compared to $7 billion before, that's the plus $1 billion that you talked about. When you think about the operational performance though, the lion's share of the foreign exchange would also hit REVLIMID. That $8 billion excluding foreign exchange would be even higher, significantly higher.","The other product that would come next in the ranking of those impacted by foreign exchange would be POMALYST\/IMNOVID, now that we're into the year where we have more international sales for that product. You will remember that the ABRAXANE target for 2017 that was given in 2013 was $1.5 billion to $2 billion. So now honing in on that ABRAXANE number of around $1 billion, you can see I think pretty clearly where that mix shift is.","Scott Andrew Smith - Celgene Corp.","This is Scott. On the OTEZLA side, we're reaffirming the 2017 target for OTEZLA, regardless of FX, at $1.5 billion to $2 billion.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Citi.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and the slides are great, by the way, for all of us here. I just had a big picture question and a maintenance question. The big picture question is I get a lot of questions from investors trying to understand what kind of changes to the REVLIMID dynamics are going to happen as we approach the cliff. You've got a lot of new combos and data that are coming out this year. I'm wondering if you thought about how you might articulate to investors how to think about, either qualitatively or quantitatively, what percentage of REVLIMID you might be able to offset with these new combos because modeling that in the out years really makes a difference, and there's not a lot of color out there right now.","Then the second question is a maintenance question for Scott, any changes in prior auth [authorization] requirements for OTEZLA that you've seen in the last three months? Thanks.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","Thanks, Robyn. It's Jackie. I'm going to jump in on the REVLIMID question, and if any of my colleagues who want to add to it, please feel free. The main thing that we see as we continue to make progress on the top line is we feel like we've got pretty clear visibility to how we will be able to bring more targeted novel agents to market to further address certain patient segments within multiple myeloma, be they high-risk patients, patients that are refractory to certain compounds. And we I think have a plan and a strategy that's as clear as it's ever been with the agents that we have in our hands today, and you saw that on one of the slides where we have quite a nice portfolio.","And what we've learned about the mechanism of action of the IMiDs over time is also allowing us to potentially accelerate the next generation of compounds coming out of that platform and the cereblon-modifying agents to allow us to achieve that segmentation and then bringing in more targeted therapies to the different patient segments. So when we think about REVLIMID as we approach that 2025 \u2013 2026 timeframe, we see it probably not being replaced by one new novel agent, but by a basket of novel agents and combination therapies that are going to allow us to grow through that patent cliff, and I think that's probably as much is I need to say at this point in time. I would also maybe add that at some point when we do another research day or an analyst\/investor day, I think we'll be looking to give you a bit more visibility to how we're thinking about those things.","Let me also maybe just summarize before I turn it over to Scott. Sorry for the long-winded answer, but with the negotiation on the patent litigation, I think from your perspective in modeling, now that you've got that 2026 goalpost in there, you can see how we get there over the next 10 years in terms of bringing these novel agents forward, and I think you'll see that our development programs are taking us in that direction. Sorry I'm keeping \u2013 going long with this, but there are some compounds that are also not in any of our forecasts yet, including durvalumab, for example, which is one that you've got a decent amount of visibility to already in terms of the clinical development program, and you'll see data over time. So with that, I'm going to stop.","Scott Andrew Smith - Celgene Corp.","Thank you for asking the question, Robyn. I think to understand \u2013 to answer your question, I think you have to look at the market dynamics and what you see for the market as a whole in Q1 relative to Q4, Q3, Q2, is this idea of patients re-insuring and re-having to go through the prior auth process. And so you definitely see for all compounds, all products in the space that there is an increase in that prior auth process early in the year, and then the patients work through it. A number will have to redo it every year, some will go continuously. But what you see overall is a little bit of a chilling or a drop in Q1 in the overall psoriatic marketplace, and you've seen it for number of years in a row. And then you see the increases happening in Q2, Q3, and Q4, and we see that in the market this year. So you do see an increase in the number of prior auth requirements for OTEZLA, but you see it for the whole market. It's a normal market phenomenon that we see in Q1.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","What about step edit? Do you have to use Enbrel ahead of OTEZLA? Is that changing yet?","Scott Andrew Smith - Celgene Corp.","It's a dynamic environment in terms of the payer environment. Over time, we are increasing the number of patients who aren't exposed to step edits. One thing I will say is that the step edits that exist in plans are not necessarily mandatory step edits. There are processes, letters of medical necessity, and other things that can happen to allow access for patients even on plans where there are step edits. Our guess right now is that 80% of patients who are being prescribed OTEZLA are getting OTEZLA, regardless of the edits on the plan, within a reasonable period of time. So we're continuing to evolve the landscape. We want to make it better and better, but the access position is relatively good for a launch product at this point in time.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great, thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from Leerink Partners.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much for taking the question and congratulations on clarifying 2017. Peter, I just wanted to, if you can, give us a little bit more color on the sequential gross-to-net from Q4 to Q1 in the U.S. for OTEZLA, REV [REVLIMID], and POMALYST. You mentioned that.","And then secondly, you talked in your presentation about the strong financial flexibility; that you have a certain amount of leverage already on your balance sheet. Could you give us a sense of where you might be willing to go in terms of debt to EBITDA or debt to total capital using your balance sheet from here? That would be helpful. Thanks.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Sure. Good morning, Geoff, thanks for the question. So the first thing on the sequential, what you see each quarter, at the beginning of each year in the first quarter, I think this is actually not so much specific to Celgene even necessarily. It's an industrywide phenomenon, which is with the ACA program you do make payments. Each of us has a certain tax we pay, as well as we have to make higher gross-to-net payments early in the year to fill the donut hole. So I think that's a dynamic where you see a lot of that coming through, and basically it's a first quarter effect that hits the gross-to-net. That's the main item.","I don't think there's anything else beyond that. And I do think probably if you found products that came into the same reimbursement world with the government programs under ACA, you'd see that for most companies. I went through that. Just to highlight, as you go from Q4 to Q1, it's just an odd thing. If you happen to be looking at sequential quarters, which personally I always like to look at year-over-year growth obviously. But if you look at sequential quarters, these are the things to keep in the back of your mind; that the gross-to-net does pick up some extra volume in the first quarter.","Also, just to remind you, in Q4 we actually did have a very favorable tender that helped our performance in the first quarter. It's not so much of a gross-to-net, but it's a good volume item, and I mentioned that as well. And then Jackie in her comments, we did have one adjustment into our gross-to-net in France that actually impacted the gross-to-net for POMALYST. So POMALYST really I think is key to understand that there is a slight adjustment in the first quarter. It's a one-timer, it's a catch-up. So POMALYST I think you need to read through that a little bit to make sure you get an accurate view of the momentum of POMALYST, which is just great and doing very well around the world.","On the second question relative to our flexibility, I would just highlight a couple things. First of all, as we went to the transaction with Receptos last year, we did increase our debt load. And obviously we highlighted that that took us up to a much higher debt-to-EBITDA ratio for the short term. And with the very strong cash flow performance of the company, that will be worked back down again, pretty quickly actually. We've obviously covered that with the credit agencies very carefully and full understanding and agreement on that, which is great.","The other thing I'd say is that as we do our business development activity, we are able to use some of our foreign cash in a lot of these transactions because very often we have rest-of-world rights. So we're actually buying IP that, for example, when we did the AstraZeneca deal, that IP was already offshore, or as you get other transactions like GED-0301, likewise an offshore asset, so we are able to use that. And so as a result, our U.S. cash position relative to the Moody's rating is not as stressed. We were also able to do that with Receptos, so we have a relatively good U.S. cash position. We highlight that in the 10-Q. You'll see that in the 10-Q each quarter. We did it for the 10-K as well. And in fact, our U.S. cash position is actually relatively good having gone through that transaction. So from that standpoint, we feel very good about our debt to EBITDA. We actually just recently met with all the agencies. Everything is good.","Now your question was more prospectively. If a transaction came along, how would we look at it? Those are situation specific. I think it was a large transaction \u2013 obviously we're not trying to forecast that would be the case, but obviously you might end up using some equity, or you might push yourself up again a little bit. But we obviously have got a very, very full arsenal right now between our internal pipeline as well as our collaboration portfolio. And so we really did use 2015 as a major year to step into immuno-oncology.","Are we still hungry for BD deals? Absolutely, you see us continuing to do transactions with different companies, often fitting in the profile of our collaboration portfolio. So from time to time, if the right opportunity came along, we would be happy to step up. And I think the point about strong financial flexibility is that we have been very fortunate to have a very strong cash flow in this company. We work very closely with the credit agencies on a regular basis, and we feel very comfortable about where we are and where we're going.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Great, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Hey, everybody. Thanks for taking my question, I really appreciate it. Congratulations to Mark. It seems everyone is breaking the rules, so I'll ask two questions too. You can decline to answer one if you like.","But I think Bob is in the room. I know Bob has been very involved I think in pharma and bio. And a big top-down issue for the sector is drug pricing. I'd love to hear, Bob, you just talk about where you think that's going and how that's going to evolve either with your Celgene hat on or with your pharma\/bio hat on, if you're willing to.","And then a more operational question \u2013 not really operational, a pipeline question. Can you just talk more about the REMARC trial? The primary endpoint I believe is PFS [Progression-Free Survival], and I'm assuming it's not powered for OS [Overall Survival]. So is PFS enough, A), to gain regulatory approval in both the U.S. and the rest of world and without OS? And, B), if it is approved, do you think physicians will adopt this therapy without seeing and OS benefit? Thank you very much.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","Hi, Mark. It's Jackie, so I guess I get to choose which question we don't answer?","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Yes, that's fine. You can answer both, though.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","I'll take the REMARC one first and then turn it over to Bob. I think I can answer the REMARC question pretty quickly. I think we've talked about this before. Everybody knows the trial that's on is REVLIMID maintenance for patients that have responded to R-CHOP. It's for two years. It matches up very nicely with the unmet medical need in that space.","The trial is powered for both PFS and OS. What we would expect to see \u2013 I think we've even told you and you can see out there in ClinicalTrials.gov that the expected PFS difference would be about 15 months versus the control. And we would expect or hope to see a positive statistically significant result on PFS and a trend on OS. We do not necessarily expect at this time to see a statistically significant trend. So we think that with the trend in OS and a positive PFS trial that we've got a nice regulatory submission.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Thanks, Jackie.","Robert J. Hugin - Celgene Corp.","And then, Mark, on the pricing and the environment that we face, I think there are important issues that we need to make sure we're all aware of. We have the overarching economics of the demographics of the developed societies that are going to keep pressure on healthcare economics for several decades. And so I think the most significant issue that we all face is how do we afford the healthcare that we want to have and make the investments in the future that we want. And I think that we're very concerned by the level of noise in the environment. It's very concerning and it's real.","And also to put it in perspective, every eight years we have a presidential election. When that's definitely going to turn over, you see this happening whether you look at 1992 or 2008 and what happens. And so it is an important time for us to address these issues. So first, we're going to be faced with these issues of cost and value for a long time regardless of the politics of it. The politics are important to us. I think we need to make sure we understand that the kind of changes that anybody would propose to really affect our outcomes are going to be very significant are unlikely to occur.","So we think the issues are going to have to be dealt with through the normal operations of our businesses and the systems in our ecosystem, whether it's payers and providers. And we've got to work to do a better job to define what value is, and I think you're seeing people on one side of the system trying to decide this is the way we'll define value and others are going to other methods. I think there are many collaborative efforts going on today between companies on our side and also versus payers, working together to find solutions to these issues to ensure that we do constrain cost but not at the reduction of these kind of investments that we need to deal with the incredible issues that we as a society face from Alzheimer's, cancer, metabolic disease, et cetera.","So we're very concerned about it. Before the end of this presidential debate, we've got to change the tenor to it to ensure that there's a balance to the discussion. We've got important initiatives coming on from the industry about that in the coming weeks and months. But I think we all have to recognize, this is a long-term issue that we're going to be dealing with based on the longer-term healthcare economics of the entire system, and we're going to have to (48:40) be prepared for that discussion.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","I think, Bob, just to wrap the point up and we'll go on to the next question, Mark, you know Celgene has been engaged in this discussion for a long time. It's not new for us, as Bob said. This is a very long-term issue, and we're totally engaged worldwide. We've built core capabilities across the globe in our franchises and in our global functions. So it's a thoughtful, engaged approach. And so for us, this idea of patient access, sustaining innovation, I think the narrative that's in the media is different than what's actually happening between governments, innovator companies like Celgene, and the patient groups that we deal with all the time. So I think we'll see the tide change a little bit after the election. But we're totally engaged. It's constructive. And I think for the long term, we understand what our value proposition is as a company and what we have to do in research to continue to bend the curve in the future. So maybe we'll go to the next question, Patrick.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on REVLIMID and the implications of the 2017 guidance. I'm really curious about the actual drivers behind the sizable bump to your updated rev outlook for 2017 and how much recent positive data sets like the SWOG S0777 study are driving this. Because if they are, I'm curious if there's any particular reason why 2020 stays the same for now, in terms of that outlook. Thanks.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","Maybe the short answer to your question on 2020 is conservativism. The trends are \u2013 that's one reason why we put the slide in there where we show some of those events that have occurred over the last 12 to 18 months that support REVLIMID's position as a backbone therapy and the dynamics around its performance in the marketplace. And now we just had the SWOG data presentation at ASH [American Society of Hematology] last year.","But with that, what we're seeing, and this is true across the world. I think we also included the slides for the early launch countries for newly-diagnosed in Europe, where we now have about a year's worth of data. We see very strong share uptake in the markets where the product is reimbursed, and we're seeing positive duration trends in all geographies. We're also seeing physicians who previously did not necessarily fully embrace the continuous treatment paradigm now embracing that paradigm. We're also seeing fundamental support for not only REVLIMID, but also POMALYST in combination, that is going to be a reality for a long time to come. We're seeing very nice increases in duration for POMALYST as well. So I think that we're in a great position.","When you run some of the numbers out and do some scenarios, we could have some nice upside to 2020. I think today, what we are prepared to say about that is we would expect the mix to be different between heme and onc, as we have said, for 2016 and 2017. But the fundamentals for REVLIMID and POMALYST both are really exceptionally strong.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","I would just add, Jackie, if I could. Recall that obviously we have never changed our view of 2020. In fact, despite the fact that the dollar has strengthened, the operational strength, the power of REVLIMID and POMALYST and OTEZLA and our outlook for that have driven right through that foreign exchange impact, so that's a little bit of the dynamic. So we feel very good about the operational performance of these drugs. More data coming through that's been great, so in no way, Cory, do we want you to think that we're not very bullish on these leading brands.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","I think some of those updates will come as we get more visibility into the market. But I think the other thing that we've already talked about today is we have a robust pipeline of myeloma drugs behind all of this that we still need to see when and how they segment and change the market. So a lot of dynacism, a lot of opportunity, and I think Jackie said it well. There's probably conservatism in the outlook simply because there are so many dynamic levers. So thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya from BMO Capital Markets.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks for taking my question. I was excited to see CC-122 and CC-220 mentioned as part of your line extension strategy for myeloma. I was hoping you could speak to maybe the aspect of the REVLIMID profile these two drugs could potentially improve upon. And I know there are, at this point at least, no clinical trials in myeloma. Maybe if you could speak to the regulatory timelines and clinical timelines and what the strategy will be. Is there potential for in the future running head-to-head trials versus REVLIMID?","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","Yes. So, Ian, as I spoke about with respect to the patients and the segmentation strategy and how we see this playing out over the next few years, we do think there is the potential to run head-to-head trials in certain patient segments. We think that what we have learned about effects, immune effects with these different compounds and the mix of immune effects versus antitumor effects is something that is informing how we view these molecules. You saw us add them to the pipeline for myeloma relatively recently, so I think that should tell you something about the insights that we have. It's not only myeloma. We're also learning things that would inform how we think about the future for NHL [Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma] novel agents and CLL [Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia] novel agents, and still unmet medical need patient segments in those categories too.","So I think one of the key aspects of this \u2013 there are probably two maybe. And again, those are the kinds of things that we would be able to address in a research type of day, are the molecules behave very differently. We know a lot about them now and are able to design them to fine-tune certain aspects of them to target certain patient segments. We're optimistic about that. And the second thing would be based on what we know about this class of drugs is our ability, once we see some proof-of-concept data, to jump faster to pivotal trials and accelerate the approval timelines for the drugs.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","What would those timelines be?","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","We think that we have a good way to move forward with the portfolio of development programs for multiple novel agents and differentiated combinations that will allow us to bring those therapies to market for the 2026 timeframe for the REVLIMID patent.","Patrick E. Flanigan III - Celgene Corp.","I want to be sensitive to all the other earnings calls that are going to happen today. So maybe, Karen, if we have time for just two more callers.","Operator","Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First one is maybe for Scott. I guess you just reaffirmed the 2017 guidance for OTEZLA of $1.5 billion to $2 billion. We're probably running at $1 billion or so in 2016 levels. So what gives you the confidence that you will be able to meet that goal? And also do you see any impact at all from the newly launched, for example, COSENTYX from Novartis?","And then second question I want to ask to maybe Jackie, are you seeing pressure in terms of competitive pressure from the newly launched drugs, for example, DARZALEX, in the third-line setting in myeloma? And if so, what's your vision going into the next couple years for POMALYST in that setting? Thanks.","Scott Andrew Smith - Celgene Corp.","Thank you. Relative to OTEZLA and the confidence we have on the targets or our goals for 2016 and 2017 are the idea that the TRx's continue to grow. We're at the highest levels ever as of last week. We're seeing patient initiations at the highest levels possible. We're continuing to gain market share. There's a lot of momentum on demand, and we're seeing very good persistency of patients on the drug.","There was a paper just published last week showing very similar persistency, OTEZLA versus a biologic cohort, which is very encouraging. And then we've got a number of countries that are going to be launching as we go through 2016 into early 2017. We are still at this point in reimbursement discussions and not launched yet in the UK and France and Spain and Italy, so those are upside and growth drivers for late 2016 \u2013 2017 and beyond.","And Japan we believe is going to be a strong growth driver as well. We filed in Japan. We had a very strong pivotal trial in PSOR-11. We filed in Japan. We expect an approval towards the end of this year and be launching with reimbursement early in 2017. We think there's a tremendous opportunity for the compound in Japan. They're very oral-oriented and very safety-oriented, and we think the product fits very, very well in there. So we have a nice growth opportunity in Japan.","The second part of the question was COSENTYX. What we've seen since the launch of COSENTYX, and if you look at the slides you can see the market share graphs, both from a new-to-brand patient initiation perspective and from a market share perspective and a TRx perspective, we've seen OTEZLA continue to grow at a similar rate before versus after the launch of COSENTYX. We believe that they are products which are competing in quite different parts of the market, COSENTYX mainly from the TNF failure portion. And if you remember some of the data that we presented on OTEZLA, 80% of patients who are coming to OTEZLA are coming from something other than a biologic therapy, whether that's lide [lidocaine] or topicals or oral DMARDs. So I think they're products that are in very different parts of the market and looking at different patient segments.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","Hi, Ying. So just on the dara [daratumumab] question, what we're seeing in the U.S. is that it's mostly staying in the fourth-line and greater setting in terms of usage. We are seeing some combination usage. This is actually a positive thing for POMALYST. We're seeing increasing usage of POM in second and third lines. It's moving up, I would say. The dynamic is actually quite good in terms of the overall relapsed refractory market. And we think as the combination data continues to emerge, this is going to be quite positive for POMALYST on a go-forward basis.","The other thing, as I mentioned in my comments, is we're seeing nice increases in duration of treatment for POMALYST, and we're seeing them quarter after quarter. We're still seeing double-digit growth in both new Rx's and almost double the new Rx level of growth in total Rx's for POM in the U.S., so it's quite positive. When you think about the environment outside the U.S., the one thing I would say is keep your eyes on reimbursement discussions as novel agents come to market, and keep in mind that POMALYST has an overall survival benefit in its label, and that's quite important when you think about reimbursement positioning.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question for today comes from the line of Eric Schmidt from Cowen & Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks, just two real quick ones for Scott. Can you tell us what percent of a price increase you might actually capture on OTEZLA? I see there were a couple increases earlier in the year.","And then for Peter, the other income line is running well below the guidance you gave us last fall. Should we rethink that guidance?","Scott Andrew Smith - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Eric, for the question. We have had a couple of price increases. If you take a look at the value proposition that we created for OTEZLA at launch, and that was to be at a significant discount to average biologic price, when we launched we were at about a 30% discount to average biologic price. Now, even though we've had a couple price increases, we've lost a little bit of ground to the market and we're at a 35% decrease or beneath our market competitors and where they're at.","So the market has been aggressive on price. We've been a little bit less aggressive than the market over the past couple of years. We want to maintain that position at a discount to biologic price because we think not only in the U.S., but around the world, it gives us the best opportunity to penetrate and to be used early and the encouragement for patients to be used in the pre-biologic space, so we're going to continue with that pricing strategy.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Eric, this is Peter. Just on the OIE line, really quickly, if you look at just interest expense and interest income, we're right on track with the guidance we gave. But then always there's this other category where there's a lot of other things that come in. It tends to be a little bit noisy. You have some impairments, some gains on some of our equity holdings and so forth, and that nets out to be this quarter a little bit positive. But quite frankly, some of the gains were discrete items that pushed our tax rate up a little bit. So overall in the financial section, I'd say really not much benefit there.","And then overall, the net positive, probably we had a couple of positive items on our hedging relative to the recognition of positive impacts from the forward points as we roll forward. You may recall last fall we had a couple of quarters where we had some negative impact. This is just a volatile item that bounces back and forth. So net-net, though, I think I would retain my comment that the interest expense\/interest income net-net should be in that high $400 million range on a full-year basis. In any given quarter, the other category can be positive or negative, and I wouldn't go one way or the other with that. And I would remind you that sometimes when there's a positive, it is offset by a higher discrete item on the tax line.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","So just to wrap things up, if I can just finish things up for the company, we're really thrilled with the first quarter. We feel like we have come into the year with great momentum, and it's allowed us to increase our guidance top line and bottom line. We have allowed that momentum to help us think through exactly where we're going with our financial targets out in the outer years for 2017 and 2020. We feel really good about that.","I think as Jackie and Scott and Mark all talked about, we have got a lot of exciting activity going on in the pipeline and a lot of late-stage report-out coming in the near term. So I think if you go through the balance of 2016 and into 2017, we have a lot of very positive stimulus items reporting out, and we'll see how that goes. But boy, we're excited to be running the business right now. Thank you very much for joining us on the call.","Operator","Thank you.

Flanigan III - Celgene Corp.","Thanks, Vince, and welcome, everyone, to our third quarter earnings conference call. The press release reporting our financial results, in addition to the presentation for today's webcast, can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the corporate website at www.celgene.com.","Joining me in the room today with prepared remarks are Mark Alles, our Chief Executive Officer; Peter Kellogg, our Chief Financial Officer; Terrie Curran, Global Head of our Inflammation and Immunology franchise; our Global Head of our Hematology\/Oncology franchise, Nadim Ahmed; and Scott Smith, President and Chief Operating Officer.

Reconciliation of the adjusted financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available as part of the earnings release.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mark.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Patrick. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Let me start by just admitting that we're very disappointed with the results of the quarter and are committed to rebounding very quickly with respect to OTEZLA and our overall performance. Before my team provides an in-depth review of our operating results, let me take a few minutes to update you about our 2017 guidance, changes to our 2020 outlook, and highlight some of the progress we are making in research and development to deliver our next wave of innovative medicines.","Two major developments shaped the results of the third quarter and have impacted our short- and longer-term outlook. First, while OTEZLA continues to maintain a strong U.S. market position, our 2017 forecast assumptions did not adequately anticipate the deep and persistent slowing growth of the psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis markets, especially during the entire third quarter. When combined with the discounts tied to the execution of our ongoing managed care contracting strategy, we missed our third quarter OTEZLA sales target.","The immediate effect of this result is that we are reducing our full-year 2017 guidance for OTEZLA from the lower end of the range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion to a target of approximately $1.25 billion, 23% year-on-year growth. The variables affecting OTEZLA's Q3 performance are expected to continue to put pressure on its near-term growth profile, and we've adjusted our 2020 targets accordingly. Although our outlook has changed, our confidence in OTEZLA's value proposition and its opportunity to become a multibillion-dollar product remain strong. We are committed to optimizing its potential.","Last week, we announced the discontinuation of the GED-0301 clinical development program in Crohn's disease. This pipeline failure is a major disappointment, but all of us want to thank the clinical investigators and most importantly the patients who participated in this pivotal study. While sales of GED-0301 were relatively modest in our 2020 model, we did forecast multibillion-dollar peak sales potential. We are encouraged by the recently presented ozanimod Phase 2 data in Crohn's disease and expect to initiate a Phase 3 study of this novel agent in Crohn's within the next few months.","We are committed to building a leading inflammatory bowel disease franchise, now led by ozanimod, for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's and perhaps OTEZLA in one or both of these serious unmet medical conditions. And this immediate shift from GED-0301 to ozanimod in Crohn's disease is a great example of the pipeline optionality and opportunity we have built and continue to build into our research model for hematology, oncology, and inflammation and immunology.","As part of our just completed long-range strategic planning process, we pressure-tested all major assumptions and probabilities built into our 2020 financial targets. Adjusting for GED-0301, the market dynamics impacting OTEZLA, and the opportunities and risks associated with our portfolio of Phase 3 studies that are expected to read out by the end of 2018, we are updating our 2020 revenue target to a range of $19 billion to $20 billion, a 14.5% compounded annual growth rate, and our 2020 adjusted earnings per share target to greater than $12.50 per share, approximately 20% compounded growth.","Our long-range plan also evaluated a range of financial strategies to ensure that we're investing in those commercial, research, business development, and capital structure opportunities with the greatest potential for shareholder value creation. Following my remarks, Peter will provide greater insights about our third quarter results, our 2017 guidance, and our 2020 outlook. He will also outline our plan for a more aggressive approach to our existing share repurchase program.","In addition to discussing our franchise results, Terrie, Nadim, and Scott will highlight the meaningful progress being made advancing our high-potential pipeline. Most notably, Terrie will discuss our plans for the full release of the ozanimod Phase 3 SUNBEAM and RADIANCE studies in relapsing multiple sclerosis, set for tomorrow and Saturday at ECTRIMS in Paris. We remain very confident in the potential for ozanimod to become an important product for patients chronically suffering with MS and a blockbuster in this disease category.","I'd like to welcome Nadim Ahmed, our new President of Hematology & Oncology, to the team presenting today. Nadim joined us from GSK in 2010 as the head of our global multiple myeloma marketing team. He was responsible for the launches of REVLIMID for newly diagnosed myeloma, POMALYST\/IMNOVID for relapsed myeloma, and for the launch of ABRAXANE for the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer. Most recently, Nadim was Vice President, Worldwide Commercial Markets for Hematology and Oncology. He's an outstanding leader with more than a decade of experience in the cancer field. Welcome, Nadim.","Our research and early development team continues to discover new molecules at a rapid pace, with five INDs filed year to date and another three on deck. This tremendous productivity is a result of our multiyear strategy to invest in internal and external transformative technology, drug discovery platforms, and paradigm-shifting science. We intend to continue to augment our collaborative research model through aggressive business development activity.","With more than 50 molecules in all stages of development across more than 100 indications, we expect our innovative pipeline to deliver important new medicines for patients and significant catalysts for our growth to 2020 and beyond. The promise and potential of Celgene continues to be very strong.","Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Peter.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone.","Our Q3 results are solid and, very importantly, are driven by volume across our portfolio. Celgene's P&L management continues to be focused, delivering on-track bottom line results for the quarter. Our full-year guidance for revenue has been set at approximately $13 billion, with an adjustment to the OTEZLA outlook due to the marketwide challenges in the U.S. dermatology market. Our P&L performance has allowed us to narrow our 2017 non-GAAP EPS range to the high end of prior guidance, $7.30 to $7.35 per share.","As Mark mentioned, we have taken the time to review Celgene's longer-term outlook and updated our top and bottom line targets, incorporating a refreshed view of revenue and non-GAAP EPS for 2020. I will review this in greater detail in a minute, but this outlook does reconfirm that we are expected to drive industry-leading growth rates over the next three to four years, with revenue in the mid-teens CAGR level and earnings approaching 20% growth compounded.","Finally, given this robust outlook and the current status of market valuation for Celgene, we are immediately initiating a strong share repurchase program. As a reminder, our number one priority for capital deployment will continue to be strategic investment in our business. Now, given our strong balance sheet and expected earnings growth, we can also be aggressively opportunistic with respect to share repurchases when we see market dislocations without materially impacting our ability to execute on strategic investments. In this regard, we are targeting a very strong repurchase agenda over the next few months, beginning immediately. We expect this will allow Celgene to enhance its already strong overall return on invested capital and serve to reward shareholders with enhanced long-term investment rewards.","Now, I will structure my comments today around these four topics, beginning with our Q3 results. During Q3, our net product sales grew 11% year over year to $3.3 billion. There was solid growth across the portfolio, particularly from POMALYST. Volume continues to be the main driver of net product sales growth. There was a modest negative effect from foreign exchange headwinds and hedging that we mentioned would occur when we were on the Q2 call.","Earnings performance continues to be strong, as Q3 adjusted earnings per share grew 21% year over year. As with previous quarters, growth was driven by operating income. Financial factors, including the tax rate, had a negative $0.06 per share impact, which was offset by a slightly more favorable OIE line, where we lapped some charges for impairments in the prior year.","Turning to the Q3 P&L, we again have invested strongly in our pipeline, as R&D grew 9% versus last year and approached $700 million. We now have a robust portfolio of clinical programs in active development. We continue to see leverage from SG&A, and our tax rate remains at 16.5% for the quarter. The adjusted operating margin for Q3 was 59.5%, very much in line with our original high-50s percent longer-term expectations. This adjusted operating margin is unchanged from Q2.","We do expect R&D expenses to increase in the fourth quarter, as we continue to initiate pivotal trials for early-stage assets. Based on these Q3 and year-to-date trends and the revised dynamics seen in the dermatology area, which Terrie will discuss next, we are adjusting our 2017 net product sales outlook for OTEZLA and also our total revenue for the year.","As Mark mentioned in his opening comments, we recently completed our long-range strategic plan, and as part of that company-wide effort, have refreshed our 2020 targets. As we were incorporating updated information for GED-0301, we also conducted a full review across the portfolio to reflect all the trends we have seen since the 2020 targets were initiated in early 2015. The resulting Celgene growth outlook is shown here.","Our targets for 2020 now call for 14.5% compounded net product sales growth from 2017 to 2020, and we have assumed continued strong R&D investments and still deliver continued P&L leverage in other areas, providing bottom line non-GAAP EPS growth that approaches 20%. That certainly represents industry-leading growth.","To clarify this updated view, this slide details our refreshed targets in a similar level of detail as was provided when our original 2020 targets were issued. Not surprisingly, our hematologic commercial products in existing indications have outperformed our original expectations. We have updated our 2020 guidance include both the strength of this momentum in hem while also revising the outlook for ABRAXANE, OTEZLA, the likely timing of our ozanimod UC launch GED-0301.","Note that we have used the upper and lower ends of our revenue targets to incorporate a range of outcomes for several of our pipeline programs. This range is created by the natural risk of succession timing that exists in all pipeline programs. We remain committed to our ongoing BD and pipeline development investment. While our financial capacity to add to the company's R&D and\/or commercial portfolio is significant, these targets do not include anything for possible additions to the company from BD.","Finally, we ended the quarter with $11.8 billion in cash and marketable securities. This balance sheet, combined with our strong cash flow, creates a strong financial capacity to expand. And as I indicated earlier, we will continue to make strategic investments in our business via business development while also taking advantage of current conditions to pursue a strong share repurchase agenda over the next few months.","I would also like to note that in the appendix of this presentation, a return on invested capital valuation of Celgene is provided, which highlights that after some fluctuation in 2015 for the Receptos acquisition, our ROIC performance has fully recovered and is currently well above 17%. This ROIC has been strong throughout our history, and current performance is at an all-time high.","Thank you. And now I'd like to turn the call over to my colleague, Terrie.","Terrie Curran - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Peter, and good morning.","Q3 2017 was both a challenging quarter for Celgene I&I, as well as one of progress on several fronts. OTEZLA continued to produce double-digit year-on-year growth despite challenging psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis category headwinds. Key OTEZLA performance indicators were stable in an increasingly competitive market, and we remained focused on executing against several life-cycle initiatives that will expand the potential population for OTEZLA worldwide.","We made good progress on the I&I pipeline, and I'm very excited about the upcoming data presentation for ozanimod in MS at the ECTRIMS-ACTRIMS joint meeting in Paris later this week. The program remains on track for regulatory submission beginning with the U.S. by year-end and EMEA in the first half of 2018. We are focused on advancing enrollment for the Phase 3 UC study TOUCHSTONE and initiating the pivotal program in Crohn's disease. Lastly, we will be reviewing the results from the OTEZLA ulcerative colitis proof-of-concept trial by year-end.","Global OTEZLA net sales for Q3 2017 were $308 million, which represents a 12% year-on-year increase. This revenue growth is being driven by positive U.S. TRx growth despite challenging market dynamics. Additionally, significant international growth is being driven by our success in securing a differentiated access position in key markets. In the past two years, the U.S. market for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis grew strongly, posting TRx growth rates in the high teens versus previous years. This was fueled by new launches, including OTEZLA, which expanded the total pool of patients on treatment. We assumed that category growth rates would maintain these historical levels in setting out 2017 targets.","However, year to date through September, both markets have experienced a significant slowdown in growth as a result of increasingly restrictive PBM formulary control. While OTEZLA demand continues to outpace the overall market, we are seeing lower-than-expected revenue due to market deceleration, increases in gross-to-net discounts to drive biologic step free access and inventory fluctuations.","Since launch, OTEZLA rapidly established clear leadership in user brand share, and this continues despite numerous competitive approvals. Consistent with our strategy, we continue to maintain leadership in patients in the treatment-naive setting, while share has been somewhat impacted in patients previously exposed to biologics. We remain committed to executing against our core strategies to further open up biologic step free access, focus on the moderate post-topical patient segment, execute impactful DTC efforts, and further strengthen physician advocacy based on real-world utilization.","Now I'd like to comment on the progress OTEZLA is making in some key markets outside the United States. International revenue grew from $31 million in the third quarter of 2016 to $58 million in the third quarter of 2017, an increase of 87%. We expect ex-U.S. revenue contribution to continue to increase.","Our launch success in both France and Japan illustrate the importance of differentiated access as a key uptake driver. In France, uptake at one year since launch exceeds competitive benchmark. Unlike biologics, OTEZLA does not require an initial prescription in the hospital setting and can be used in psoriasis after only one systemic failure versus two biologics. In Japan, OTEZLA has captured almost half of new-to-brand share of the total systemic market. Unlike biologics, OTEZLA can be prescribed in the community setting versus hospital only and has the broadest label among systemic treatments, including post-topical.","We continue to make solid progress in advancing several life-cycle initiatives to drive further OTEZLA growth. Importantly, we are pleased that the Phase 3 release trial evaluating OTEZLA for the treatment of active Beh\u00e7et's disease met its primary and key secondary endpoints across multiple measures of disease activity. We're planning global submissions beginning in 2018. We believe these data are very compelling, and our goal is to become the first and only product approved globally for the treatment of active Beh\u00e7et's disease. We project this represents a total market opportunity of at least $100 million in peak revenue. Several other key plans are also advancing and represent further growth drivers for OTEZLA.","Turning now to ozanimod. We are highly encouraged by the results we have seen to date in both MS and IBD indications. Focusing on ozanimod in MS, we are very excited that results from both pivotal Phase 3 studies will be featured as oral presentations at ACTRIMS later this week. We also have several additional clinical and nonclinical poster presentations, which further characterize the profile of ozanimod. Collectively, we believe these data support a highly differentiated profile that will address important unmet medical needs in the MS market and allow us to successfully compete in the marketplace. We continue to make excellent progress in building organizational readiness to support our entry into the category. We're attracting talented people from both scientific and commercial backgrounds who are highly experienced in the MS area.","We also continue to advance the development of ozanimod in both ulcerative colitis and in Crohn's disease. Data presentations were featured at the recent World Congress on Gastroenterology meeting and again at the upcoming UEGW meeting. In that TOUCHSTONE open-label extension phase of the study, we're encouraged that ozanimod continued to maintain clinically meaningful results in moderate to severe active ulcerative colitis across multiple measures of disease activity through week 92. In the STEPSTONE open-label study, ozanimod demonstrated meaningful clinical and endoscopic improvements in patients with moderate to severe active Crohn's disease at week 12. The safety and tolerability profile of ozanimod in both studies was generally consistent with previously reported studies of ozanimod.","Enrolling patients into IBD trials has become increasingly competitive and challenging, with over 30 active programs recruiting patients. Relative to our Phase 3 TRUE NORTH study of ozanimod in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, we now plan to complete enrollment by second half 2018.","Q3 was a quarter of important progress for the franchise. We advanced multiple initiatives to expand the foundation for OTEZLA growth across both markets and indications. Additionally, we took strategic actions to continue improving market access to position the brand for future growth. We aggressively advanced the development and organizational readiness to optimize the ozanimod opportunity in MS. Important data were presented for ozanimod in both IBD indications. And, despite the setback of discontinued GED-0301 clinical development in Crohn's disease, we remain committed to being a leader in the IBD area.","Thank you for your attention. I'd now like to turn the call over to Nadim.","Nadim Ahmed - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Terrie, and good morning, everyone. The Hematology & Oncology franchise had a solid third quarter, with 10% year-over-year revenue growth. The year-on-year growth number was affected by some volatility in ex-U.S. REVLIMID sales in the third quarter of last year, which I will explain later in the presentation.","Our core in-line brands grew across geographies. REVLIMID continued to increase in share and duration in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. POMALYST\/IMNOVID delivered robust sales growth with positive performance across all geographies. Our multiple myeloma business continues to demonstrate strong momentum, with significant opportunities ahead of us through our ongoing launches, both in terms of market share, duration, and also through the rapidly increasing use of triplet regimens.","We also have a potential transformational asset with bb2121 in the relapsed\/refractory space, a patient segment where prevalence continues to increase with the introduction of newer agents. ABRAXANE demand continues to remain stable globally. And IDHIFA was approved in August by the FDA in IDH2-mutant relapsed\/refractory AML, and the launch is going well in the U.S. Near-term Phase 3 data readouts for our in-line brands include REVLIMID in lymphoma, POMALYST in second-line-plus multiple myeloma, as well as ABRAXANE in adjuvant pancreatic cancer.","In addition to our in-line brands, we've made significant progress with our pipeline. In August, we closed our collaboration deal with BeiGene for BGB-A317, and we are actively working on our clinical development plans to maximize this asset. And we look forward to sharing our A-317 plans with you at ASH. We are advancing the bb2121 BCMA CAR-T program in collaboration with our partner, bluebird bio, and we plan to initiate a pivotal trial in relapsed\/refractory multiple myeloma by year-end. The JCAR017 CAR-T program in collaboration with Juno Therapeutics continues to progress, with studies ongoing and planned in relapsed\/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.","We continue to advance our luspatercept programs through our partnership with Acceleron as we await results from the fully enrolled Phase 3 programs in low-risk MDS and beta-thalassemia in mid-2018. We also expect to begin enrollment in an additional luspatercept Phase 3 study in front-line low-risk MDS in 2018. Our plans for marizomib continue to advance, with the initiation of a pivotal Phase 3 study in front-line glioblastoma planned for next year. The Phase 3 CC-486 trial in AML maintenance has fully enrolled, and we expect the results in 2018. With CC-122, we now have plans to initiate pivotal registration studies in lymphoma. In September, the IND was submitted for our next-generation CELMoD, CC-92480, in patients with relapsed\/refractory multiple myeloma.","REVLIMID third quarter sales increased 10% year over year. In the U.S., we had 18% year-over-year growth, fueled by continued gains in both duration and market share. We are seeing a positive impact from the post stem cell transplant maintenance launch, and we expect to see continued increases in share and duration in the future from the NDMM and maintenance launches, as well as the use of triplet combinations with REVLIMID.","Outside of the U.S., REVLIMID decreased 2% year over year. As we mentioned on our second quarter call, we have seen some volatility in the international sales patterns for REVLIMID. The Q3 year-over-year growth rate was impacted by this volatility. Recall the revenue for 3Q 2016 was driven higher by the combination of a larger Russian tender and clinical trial purchase, which then affected the year-on-year growth for 3Q 2017. Excluding these factors, year-on-year revenue growth for REVLIMID was 4% for ex-U.S. sales.","Of note, year-over-year international volume growth was in the high teens, driven by increases in newly diagnosed myeloma market share and treatment duration in key markets. Today, REVLIMID is reimbursed in many countries for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, including recent reimbursement success in France. REVLIMID reimbursement is also now occurring in the post autologous stem cell transplant maintenance setting with positive uptake.","We expect to see continued gains in both share and duration from both NDMM and post transplant maintenance settings. We expect many additional drivers for REVLIMID in the near future. And as I mentioned earlier, we will soon have the results of our R-squared indolent lymphoma trials, including RELEVANCE and AUGMENT. Also, our plans are on track for the submission of an sNDA for RVd for first-line multiple myeloma patients in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2018. All of these potential future launches will continue to drive REVLIMID growth.","POMALYST\/IMNOVID net sales continued to grow across geographies, with 22% year-over-year growth. In the U.S., POMALYST net sales grew 32% year over year. This growth was driven by share and duration gains in third-line-plus patients. We are seeing a strong increase in demand since the recent approval of the triplet regimen, POMALYST in combination with daratumumab and dexamethasone, for relapsed\/refractory multiple myeloma. Just as with REVLIMID, we expect to see additional POMALYST share and duration gains through the use of triplet regimens.","Outside of the U.S., POMALYST\/IMNOVID grew by 8% year over year. International volume was relatively stable despite the entry of multiple new competitors in relapsed\/refractory myeloma. Finally, we expect the POMALYST and bortezomib-dexamethasone combination from our OPTIMISMM study to provide another important treatment option for patients and potentially lead to increased use of POMALYST\/IMNOVID-based triplet regimens with expected increases in both market share and duration.","ABRAXANE continues to maintain stable demand overall. ABRAXANE net sales grew 8% year over year, and ABRAXANE U.S. sales increased 3% year over year. In the U.S., ABRAXANE clearly maintains its leadership position in pancreatic cancer, and we continue to see stable market share in both metastatic breast cancer and non-small-cell lung cancer. Outside of the U.S., ABRAXANE grew 15% year over year, with market share gains in metastatic pancreatic cancer.","In addition to the APACT adjuvant pancreatic cancer trial, we expect the pivotal I\/O ABRAXANE-elotuzumab combination trials in non-small-cell lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer to read out in 2018.","We expect to have a significant presence at the ASH Congress this year, with over 120 abstracts for Celgene brand and pipeline assets. CAR-T will be front and center, with additional follow-up data after the initial presentations at ASCO. We are excited to see updated results of the Phase 1 bb2121 trial, which initially demonstrated very high response rates in very heavily pretreated patients with relapsed\/refractory myeloma. There will also be five oral presentations covering the safety and efficacy data for JCAR017 in relapsed\/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. And we will also present very interesting combination data for CC-486 and CC-122 in front-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and relapsed\/refractory lymphoma respectively. And we look forward to sharing more of these exciting data with you at the ASH Congress.","In summary, we had a strong quarter for the Hematology & Oncology franchise. We continue to deliver solid sales growth with many near-term growth drivers. And the momentum of our multiple myeloma business with our in-line brands continues to go very well, with many opportunities still ahead of us. We will have multiple Phase 3 data readouts in our key disease areas of lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and pancreatic cancer for our in-line brands over the coming months. We also expect multiple Phase 3 data readouts for our pipeline assets next year in myeloid diseases. Finally, we continue to advance our other key pipeline assets, including the promise of CAR-T and next-generation lymphoma opportunities. We also continue to advance our solid tumor strategy.","Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Scott.","Scott A. Smith - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Nadim, and good morning.","As discussed earlier, net product sales continued to advance across the portfolio, and the commercial execution of our global teams has been excellent. We are also accelerating many high-value pipeline opportunities, which represent significant investments and opportunities that will enable us to reach our long-term goals.","While we're disappointed with the discontinuation of the RESOLVE and SUSTAIN Crohn's disease trials in GED-0301, we remain steadfastly committed to the development of novel therapies for patients suffering from IBD. We are awaiting full data from GED-0301 in UC and have a robust portfolio of potentially transformative IBD assets in late-stage development, including OTEZLA UC and ozanimod in UC as well as Crohn's disease.","We are excited about the near-term inflection points to occur before the end of this year or early in 2018. These include ozanimod data which will build on the promising top line results communicated earlier this year with our two positive pivotal trials in relapsing MS, SUNBEAM and RADIANCE. As mentioned, these data are being presented later this week at ECTRIMS and will form the backbone of our global regulatory applications.","Additionally, we are expecting data from our REVLIMID lymphoma trials by the end of this year for RELEVANCE, a study in front-line follicular lymphoma, and by early Q1 2018 for the AUGMENT trial in relapsed disease. This is an opportunity that could bring a chemotherapy-free standard of care to patients in a disease which has the highest incidence among hematologic malignancies.","Lastly, we are very excited at the progress of our other novel innovative products in our pipeline that have the potential to be transformative for patients and for our organization. Key milestones achieved this year in the early clinical pipeline include but are not limited to: IND filings for our new CELMoD CC-92480 in multiple myeloma; initiation of a Phase 1 program for CC-90001 in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; as well as the initiation of a Phase 2b trial with CC-220 in patients with systemic lupus.","In addition to the numerous pivotal data readouts expected in 2018, we will be initiating at least five new pivotal programs in the next few months, including: bb2121 in multiple myeloma; JCAR017 in patients with DLBCL; marizomib in glioblastoma; ozanimod in Crohn's disease; and luspatercept in front-line MDS. These programs demonstrate the depth and diversity of our portfolio and have the potential to transform the company and be major blockbuster revenue drivers beyond 2020.","Despite the challenges in the current environment, we are incredibly well-positioned for growth in 2017 and into the future. We are committed to leveraging our global business model to not only continue to drive solid top line growth but also to drive expanded operating efficiencies across the organization. We remain deeply committed to our mission of delivering life-changing medications to patients worldwide.","I'd like to now turn the call over for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Umer Raffat of Evercore. Your line is open.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. I wanted to focus on the bridge you show for year-over-year growth, so specifically looking at the 10.6% year-over-year growth on top line. And I noticed it mentions price contributions of 0.6% out of the 10.6%. So I was just curious how to think about that. I know the third-party data suggests IMiD franchise up 10% over 3Q last year. So I was curious how to think about the price contribution.","And then if I may sneak in a quick one on CELMoD in myeloma as well, I noticed CC-122 went from being slightly darker shaded to being slightly lighter shaded on your pipeline slide. I just wanted to understand the status there. Thank you.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Hi, Umer, this is Peter Kellogg. Let me take the first part, and I'll pass the pipeline part over probably to Mark or Scott. I assume you're talking about net product sales, where you have the volume, price, and ForEx hedge impact that in aggregate add up to the 10.6% revenue growth, and volume is 11% of that 10.6%. So obviously, for the REV and POM business, that's one product, and that's U.S. pricing only. This is obviously including all of our products. And so it does include the gross-to-net impact from OTEZLA. It includes the impacts for ABRAXANE as well, and obviously it has impacts for the U.S. and rest of world. So the mix effect does play into this. So that's really I think the net of it all.","I think the key thing is our products are continuing to be used more and more around the world. Duration is growing for REV and POM significantly. Obviously, as Terrie showed, the OTEZLA volume is up very much. But obviously we're going through that first year of managed care contracting, where we've implemented a contract that created gross-to-net discounts on a net pricing basis, which this would be based on. You can see that has a negative impact on price. So when you add it all up across our portfolio, this chart summarizes how that comes together.","Now, related to the pipeline, maybe I'll turn it over.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Umer, hi, it's Mark. Thanks for the question. Just very briefly \u2013 so CC-122, we still have flexibility between the blood cancer franchise. It's a very clearly potent product. We could go a number of directions. But right now, it's Phase 3 ready for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. So that might be why the color is a little different, but our optimism for it as a Phase 3 ready asset is very high.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Abrahams of RBC Capital Markets. Your is open.","Brian Abrahams - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks very much for taking my question. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more clarity around 2020 guidance, specifically the change in I&I relative contributions there from the maybe different OTEZLA trajectory, the GED-0301 failure, and the ozanimod UC pushout and timelines.","And maybe as a corollary to that, when might we expect ozanimod Crohn's disease, OTEZLA in ulcerative colitis, or CC-220 in lupus to contribute? And maybe any updates on the NDA filing timelines for ozanimod in UC? Thanks.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Great. So, hi, Brian. This is Peter. Let me again take that one. So obviously, we have incorporated a total I&I view, which does have both OTEZLA as well as ozanimod in there. In my comments, I noted that we revised the outlook for a number of different products, including OTEZLA, but also the likely timing for the ozanimod UC launch. Now obviously we have the ozanimod MS data, which we're very excited about, we're going to be showing that over the weekend at ECTRIMS in Paris. But for UC, Terrie did update you on the timeline for fully accruing the Phase 3 trial, which would be in the second half of 2018. And so that leads to having very little UC revenue in the 2020 timeframe.","Now obviously, late 2020 and into 2021 and onward it becomes \u2013 when you see the data, I think you'll be very excited about what that can contribute, but it's more of a post-2020 contribution.","On OTEZLA, I think I'll let Terrie comment on it as well, but what we've done is we've rolled it an outlook for OTEZLA which continues to grow and do well, perhaps some expanded managed care contracting, a lot of international growth. And so I think right now, we've kind of tried to digest what's going on in the U.S. market and incorporate that into our thinking over a longer timeframe. Since there are all I&I franchise points, maybe I'll turn it over to Terrie and to Scott for further color commentary.","Scott A. Smith - Celgene Corp.","So I would just like to reiterate specific to the IBD portfolio, that although we've a pipeline event in the recent past, we remain very, very excited about the opportunities that we have ahead. Ozanimod Crohn's disease data was just released few days ago and will be presented again soon. The OTEZLA ulcerative colitis data, by the end of the year, we should be in a position, end of the year or early next year, to talk about that data. And I'm very hopeful about what that looks like. The ozanimod UC program is actively enrolling. The timeline is a little bit outside of that window for 2020, but we remain very, very enthusiastic about the potential of that program.","And even though not embedded in your question, relative to MS, a lot of the portfolio, the profile of ozanimod and the safety data and other things will be coming evident in the next few days, which really, I think, plays into our optimism around that how that particular molecule can play in IBD. So we're very, very hopeful about IBD portfolio in general.","Terrie Curran - Celgene Corp.","And I'll make a few comments regarding OTEZLA. I think in the earlier comments, we touched on the fact that the market is becoming increasingly dynamic and competitive, which is in the U.S. one of the key reasons why it's very important for us to secure a pre-biologic position, which is why we entered into the contract. And while that has an impact on the GTN, it's very important that we secure that position for the medium to the long term to continue to drive growth. In addition to that, we're very encouraged with the underlying dynamics in the U.S. business, continuing to lead new-to-brand and maintain our market share despite the entrance of a number of competitors. That, combined with our increasing international business and additional life cycle indications, will really put us in a good position for future growth.","Brian Abrahams - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Eric Schmidt of Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Co. LLC","Hi. Maybe another question on the OTEZLA dynamics. I think the slide suggests that you're seeing 4% quarter-on-quarter unit volume growth, yet obviously I think sales in the U.S. were down something around 14% or so quarter on quarter. So what else is going on there? I though the discounting and managed care contracting happened much earlier in the year, and on a quarter-on-quarter basis we wouldn't see much price decline. Was there an inventory shift? Just any color you could provide. Thank you.","Terrie Curran - Celgene Corp.","I think after a choppy first quarter that we discussed earlier this year, I think this decline in script volume became more prominent in quarter three. And historically, we've seen increases in September, and that wasn't seen this year. So I think it really is a convergence there of a number of dynamics that the market's softening, increasing competition, as well as the impact from GTN.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Co. LLC","But, Terrie, you're reporting rising script growth, yet declining sales. I'm trying to square that circle.","Terrie Curran - Celgene Corp.","Yeah, it's really a number of kind of dynamics that are driving that, predominantly kind of GTN and then some kind of fluctuation in inventory, but it's pretty minor.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Co. LLC","Okay, thank you.","Scott A. Smith - Celgene Corp.","I would also say \u2013 this is Scott \u2013 that the GTN impact is not something which just happens in the first quarter after you execute. It happens all the way through. And you're discounting all the businesses at the beginning of the year, but new business is being discounted as well, and you'll see increasing \u2013 or impacting GTN all the way through the period. There's no question about that. But that decreased GTN and the ability to get the placement on the plans will drive script volume, and you see particularly real benefit as you get later in the plans. Generally, these are two-year plans or three-year plans. And we always expected that there would be some headwinds from GTN in the first few quarters.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","And maybe just a last comment is, we've been trying to wrap this all into the timing of exactly when market favorability for more growth versus less price concession is something that is in the model, but as we described in our prepared remarks, our assumptions really just missed the mark in this window, particularly in the third quarter. Thanks a lot for the question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Mark, when I look at the decision to formally lower 2020, it appears it's obviously from lower OTEZLA trends and the 0301 setback. Is there anything I'm missing, is the first question. And the second part, more importantly, how does this change your urgency for biz-dev or for deals, and also how does it inform the level of investment behind ozanimod in MS? Thank you.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Yeah, thanks for the question. I think largely your observation about the big changes in 2020 are tied to the miss on GED-0301 and the new dynamics that we're describing today for OTEZLA. As we discussed \u2013 Peter discussed it, I discussed it \u2013 the entire team went through our traditional long-range planning exercise, and we pressure-tested each of the line items, REVLIMID, lymphoma, et cetera, et cetera. So around the edges of a lot of what happens dynamically for the company, we have done some adjusting to probabilities. But that's where we continue to be confident in this top and bottom line growth opportunity for the company. So I think it is driven largely by the observations you're making. And as we've described today, there are some other minor deltas.","With respect to ozanimod, we're quite, quite confident in what we see in the profile. We think it'll be a blockbuster in MS. And one of the deltas that again we've described is the UC program moving out, where the accrual will start to happen a little bit sooner. Now it'll be mid-2018, and that pushes ozanimod UC into more of the post-2020 period in terms of an impact. So, again, marginal differences on each thing that we put into the model, but we feel good about the range that we've provided now.","With respect to business development, appreciate the question. Celgene's track record of doing aggressive business development and continuing to build our innovation engine will continue. I don't know that the miss on GED-0301 makes us more or less likely to do the kinds of innovative partnerships we've done over the years. It's clear that we have a gap, and it's clear that's something we're going to work hard to fill organically. And from an external point of view, we look for opportunity all the time. I've said it many times: Wherever there's great science, wherever innovation's happening, whether it's happening here at Celgene or through another startup or other company, we're interested in following that science to build our company. Thanks for your question.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ronny Gal of Bernstein. Your line is open.","Aharon Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. Two of them, if you don't mind. The first one is OTEZLA. As you now have a visibility into 2018 contracting \u2013 you kind of mentioned you might have longer-term contract \u2013 we always follow your script and revenue based on IMS. Should we think about this as essentially flattish going forward, or should there be another step down as a result of those multiyear contracts on gross-to-net?","And second, regarding IMiD's 340B, as the 340B program expands in the pharmacy setting, roughly what percentage of volume is now impacted by that program? If you can, just give us a feel for how you think about that going forward.","Terrie Curran - Celgene Corp.","Sure, it's Terrie here. On your first question regarding OTEZLA moving forward, I think we've now reforecast low market single-digit growth out to 2020, but we feel volume growth to increase, especially in the U.S., as we benefit from the contracts. I think the underlying dynamics for OTEZLA remain strong, both in the U.S. as well as ex-U.S. In addition to that, we have multiple new indications in the planning period that will get us to about $2 billion by 2020.","Scott A. Smith - Celgene Corp.","And this is Scott. While I think there are some headwinds and some choppiness in terms of particularly on the psoriasis market, a little bit in PsA, we remain very, very confident in what we have in terms of OTEZLA and the fact that it will be a multibillion-dollar product. We've got indications in Beh\u00e7et's disease that \u2013 we just have got the data, and we'll be filing at the beginning of next year. We have life-cycle programs in scalp, we got a QD, we've got UC data. So we've got a very, very big program. There are some managed-care headwinds GTN going on right now. But we still see this as, in this 2020 timeframe, around a $2 billion contributor to the portfolio. So we're very excited about where we're at.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","On the 340B question, thanks for the question. It's Mark. Our exposure has historically been low, and we would forecast it to continue to be low, remain low, relative to our U.S. footprint. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Alethia Young of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to talk, one, about kind of what your expectations are heading into like the ECTRIMS data for ozanimod. Do you think there's the potential that you can get a differentiated class labeling? And then just also, can you talk a little bit more about why the TRUE NORTH study is delayed? It seems like it's delayed almost \u2013 maybe less than a year around enrollment. So I just wanted to understand what's underpinning those trends? Thanks.","Terrie Curran - Celgene Corp.","Yeah, it's Terrie. Just regarding MS, I think we're really excited about the data that we're going to be sharing more fully at ECTRIMS over tomorrow and Saturday. I think if you look within the market, there really is a need for a product that has a profile that's both efficacious as well as tolerable and has a relatively good safety profile. I think if we look at both of the Phase 3 studies that we're demonstrating superiority to Avonex on relapses as well as MRI endpoints at two years, and I think these findings, coupled with safety and tolerability, really demonstrate that ozanimod will have a potential to be a blockbuster.","I think in terms of the label, the base case was that we would have first-dose monitoring in the label. But as we see the data, we expect that we'll able to differentiate on safety.","Scott A. Smith - Celgene Corp.","Second part of the question was around TRUE NORTH and the cadence of TRUE NORTH. It has been a little bit slower than what our original anticipation was. Enrolling a good portion of biologic-naive patients is a little bit of a challenge, both in the Crohn's and UC space, and these studies just generally in the space are taking a little bit longer. It is a relatively minor delay. We want to make sure we concentrate and focus and enroll exactly the right patients to give that study the best chance of success. We feel very, very good about it. It is a relatively minor delay to the overall program, and we'll see what we can do right now to continue to accelerate to get back towards the original timeline, but we don't want to do it at the expense of the wrong patients. We want to make sure we're really enrolling the patients who are likely to be best fitted for this particular study.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Geoffrey Porges from Leerink. Your line is open.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much for taking the questions. I'm not quite sure where to start. I guess, really probably the biggest question is for Mark and perhaps for Bob. So the company has lost a third of its value in three weeks. And clearly investors have lost confidence in a lot of different aspects of the company, including portfolio and now current operations as well. So, Peter, could you give us a little bit more specifics about how you're willing to deploy the balance sheet in the immediate future to support the stock?","And then secondly, a related question on capital allocation, given some of the setbacks that you had with your large business development investments, which clearly also include a reduction in your total oncology revenue forecast by half, what's the sweet spot in the type of deals that you would contemplate now given what you've learned from some of those setbacks? Thanks.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Well, I'll kick it off because you asked a specific question about the balance sheet, and then I'll pass it over to Mark and Bob related to the portfolio and the BD interest.","So as you recall, Geoff, back when we did the Receptos deal, we did increase our debt significantly, and we've worked down the debt-to-EBITDA ratio substantially since that time through very strong EBITDA growth and performance. We have an ongoing discussion with our credit agencies and have a fairly well-established framework in which we could lever up appropriately for a strategic transaction, and we're always looking for good transactions that would make a lot of sense for the company.","There's really nothing that's held us up from a finance standpoint at all in terms of looking at opportunities out there. That said, the classic (54:45) of some of the really good science, often you need to make a decision on that a little bit earlier in the pipeline. The later-stage assets tend to be very expensive but also have potential. And we look at all of those things with equal energy.","But there's nothing holding us back from a finance standpoint. From a balance sheet standpoint, we're certainly willing to work within the framework that we've established with our credit agencies to \u2013 and that really gives us a substantial amount of M&A power, as you can imagine. So relative to the portfolio and what we're targeting, Mark or Bob?","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Peter, maybe just continue a little bit on the buyback program that we've discussed already.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Sure.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","That was part of your comments.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","That would be helpful.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","And then I'll talk about BD.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Yeah, be glad to. So basically we have had a good buyback program since 2009, actually, which has been very valuable to the company. Our average share price over that time \u2013 this is form 2009 to today \u2013 has been well below $100. So we've done very well at that. And quite frankly we love to take the opportunity to jump in when the stock needs support. We will be doing that, as I said, in my comments, very aggressively.","That in no way causes us to have to curtail our BD capacity or our M&A capacity. Really, we have ample authorization from our board and ample balance sheet capacity to make a significant impact on share repurchase in these dislocation short-term periods. I think that obviously we can easily that just do that at the same time as continue to pursue M&A or BD opportunities.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay, thanks.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Geoff, just on business development. And I look to Bob \u2013 he's here as well. You're talking about kind of a historical framework but also a forward-looking framework. The Receptos transaction that Peter talked about was certainly some example of great diversification. We've talked a lot about ozanimod today and its potential in MS and ulcerative colitis being a little bit delayed. But this is an asset where we model in the transaction $4 billion to $6 billion in revenue, and the MS opportunity is now starting to appear.","So I think that example of looking for innovation and bringing in novel mechanisms, novel molecules, yes, in competitive markets, but where we can build around that molecule as a landing position in MS, but then ulcerative colitis, perhaps Crohn's, et cetera. This life cycle approach is how we optimize our business development opportunity.","With respect to a sweet spot, I don't know \u2013 and Peter said that \u2013 I don't know that there's a defined way of looking at the value of assets and\/or companies that we might want to partner with or acquire. It is really how it layers into our strategy to innovate, leverage our efficiencies, and our global strength in hematology, oncology, and increasingly in I&I. So I think we would be looking to build on that strength.","We also have, again, 12 Phase 3 studies that are set to read out between now and the end of 2018 for our pipeline. We did have, A), a problem, if you will, with GED-0301, but with the Phase 3 program we have we have the portfolio, the in-line products, and the opportunity for these new studies and new opportunity to build from where we are today. We feel very, very good about the optionality and opportunity. We will be very aggressive with our capital allocation, and we'll continue to look for the right external opportunities.","Robert J. Hugin - Celgene Corp.","I'm just going to add, Geoff, my perspective on it. We live in an industry that's volatile and has ups and downs, and our company over the last couple of decades had had some significant ups and downs, and I think that's part of the business cycle and the things that we're involved in. I think that the company has done a great job here of recognizing the market trends, the reality of pipeline issues in a risky business, all doing the right thing, oriented towards making a big difference in people's lives.","So I think marking to market so the company can move forward is the right thing to do. We've done this before, many times before, had to deal with this. Adversity turns the strong into even stronger people. So I think it's also important to put in perspective, these things happen, and I think the company is handling it very well, incredibly strong team at Celgene with an incredibly bright future. And I think it's important, again, to mark to market but also recognize that this is just a normal part of the strategy of this company. And there's no reason to challenge what we're doing, why we're doing it. I think the future is bright. There's an incredibly broad and diverse and high-potential pipeline here, great team executing, market-leading top line growth and bottom line growth.","So I think these things happen. The team's got to deal with them, move forward, put the plan together and get going, but there's nothing fundamentally wrong with Celgene. The promise is there. The future is bright, and the team is going to deliver a great outcome. And so we got to move forward and turn this adversity into opportunity and live with it and make the best of it, and that's what everybody's committed to doing.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks, Bob. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Cory Kasimov of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my question. Following up on a similar topic, while it's not formal guidance, in the relatively recent past you've talked about your confidence in growing the company through 2030. In other words, through the pending patent issues you have next decade. So I'm curious where your view of that stands today. And is this something that you think is possible without significant business development efforts? Thanks.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Hey, Cory. It's Peter. Let me start, and I'll let others jump in. But obviously, when you go out through 2030, we're a long way out. But one of the things that does become really clear when you do the long-range strategic plan is how many assets we have in our pipeline that we don't roll into our projections at this point and certainly don't come into play at all by 2020. We have no next-generation CELMoD contributing revenue by 2020, and yet we've got a very strong portfolio. In fact, I'd say internally, we are very focused on the growth rate and the adding to the portfolio and the creating \u2013 finding innovative and valuable assets almost in the post-2020 timeframe. That is really where there's a tremendous amount of value and importance for the company.","Our comments in the past have really highlighted \u2013 and I think each year we update our view \u2013 that the pipeline that's coming through of assets that really in a sense launch around 2020 or 2021 and grow for the next five or six years is really pretty impressive. You've seen at ECTRIMS the bb2121 CAR-T data with BCMA as the target. I think that was a pretty phenomenal set of data. It's early, but we're continuing to drive that forward. We're ramping up manufacturing right now. That's going to be a very high-value asset. You've seen some of the data for luspatercept, and that actually has additional indications. Those opportunities will be coming through. We are involved with Juno on their CAR-T program for lymphoma, the JCAR017 program. And you saw I think from Rupert and his team a tremendous portfolio of CELMoDs coming through as well.","So I think as you consider the next couple of years and some of the market dynamics that we see in psoriasis. And one pipeline asset like GED-0301, which as Mark said, we're disappointed that it didn't come through. Obviously, we would have liked to have seen that. We have a very broad portfolio, and we're going to continue to add to it. The financial strength we have allows us to continue to build this portfolio.","Bob made the comment that we've been making a lot of key strategic investments over the last three or four years. We've got three more years before we even get to 2020, so we're going to continue at that pace and continue to add to our portfolio. We've certainly got the financial strength to do it. We're working in areas where science is really opening up and where the potential to be very innovative is great. Hematology, oncology, immunology, and even possibly neurology in the future are all areas where the science is opening up very rapidly, and we intend to seize that opportunity.","So while I think the GED-0301 is a bit of a setback, I think you're going to see \u2013 and there's been a slight change in the timing in some of our pipeline assets \u2013 we still feel very good about the next decade. Now, whether we'll grow through 2030 or not exactly, I think that something that we always have to keep recalibrating. But nonetheless, I think we're going way out. Now we're talking 13 \u2013 14 years into the future. But I think the momentum, what's coming through our pipeline remains very impressive, and we're going to continue to be aggressive. And maybe, Mark...","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Yeah, just to summarize the point. Cory, thanks for the question. The short answer is yes, we're building the opportunity to optionality. And we have visibility beyond 2020 and feel more confident that we can grow through that key patent expiry window. So whether we're talking about the short term, which is what we're doing today, mark-to-market discussion, we do think that beyond 2020, the opportunity in the existing portfolio, but increasingly the pipeline that we've built, will allow us to be able to grow through that window. As you said at the beginning, it's not guiding to that, it's not committing to that today, but we do have confidence and believe that we have a window of time to really execute and build our next generation of innovation and growth. Thanks, Cory.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Carter Gould of UBS. Your line is open.","Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. On the revisions to oncology guidance for 2020, when you took your numbers down by more than half, should we think about that as just scaling back to the opportunity in pancreatic cancer? And what does that imply around the clinical impact of your I\/O combo data in small-cell lung and breast? Thank you.","Nadim Ahmed - Celgene Corp.","Thanks for the question. This is Nadim, so a couple of things. Remember, the 2015 guidance was pre-checkpoint inhibitor space. And so I think if you think about both lung and breast cancer now, where we have more hormonal opportunities, the market has changed quite rapidly since 2015, so that's one. Pancreatic cancer, obviously we still lead there, and this guidance doesn't bake in the I\/O opportunity. So for us, that's still potential upside as those studies deliver both in non-small-cell lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Yee of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, good morning. And, Mark, I appreciate the update and openness about the disappointment and addressing it quickly. My question, perhaps to you or someone else, is on the solid tumor strategy in two parts. One was at what point you could update us on your PD-1 solid tumor strategy. Obviously, you did a deal last quarter, and how you're thinking about building that out, either through internal or external collaboration. And two, at what point is the urgency there to do more in solid tumors? Thanks.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Thanks, Michael. I'll ask Nadim or Scott to join in. We have done a lot of work on our internal planning for our PD-1 asset. We think by ASH, we'll be in a pretty good position to talk about pivotal programs that are on top of what our partner BeiGene has already put in place. So we're excited about the momentum and the progress for the asset, and we do think it gives us that research toolkit to be able to go back into our own portfolio and then also to look externally for novel combinations. So I think we're in a sweet spot now in terms of planning, and we should be in pretty good position by ASH to be more specific about trials and opportunity.","Back to the pipeline, none of that of course is built into our 2020 outlook. And then when we think about beyond that, a few indications that would come through novel-novel with our PD-1 as an anchor would put us in a pretty good upsized position for that window of loss of exclusivity for REVLIMID, ABRAXANE, et cetera. So it's optionality. We're building the plan. I think we feel really good about our strategy, but we'll communicate more when we get together at ASH. Thanks.","Nadim Ahmed - Celgene Corp.","And I'd add to what Mark \u2013 in addition to BGB-A317, of course, front-line glioblastoma opportunity with marizomib is another tremendous opportunity for us post-2020. So I think our oncology strategy is coming together very nicely, and we'll update you at ASH, as Mark said. Thanks for the question.","Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ying Huang of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I have two quick ones. One is with another challenge from Dr. Reddy's on the generic REVLIMID filing. How confident do you feel about your position for that? And should we expect some generic threat before 2022?","And then secondly, on bb2021 (sic) [bb2121], I understand that you're treating very relapsed and refractory patients in the current trial. But on pivotal trial, do you plan to expand that into earlier lines, such as second-line myeloma patients for bb2121? Thank you.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","It's Mark. So I appreciate the question on Dr. Reddy's. And as we've described many times, our extensive patent estate of 23 Orange Book listed patents covers composition, REMS, method of treatment, polymorphs, all of which any generic would have to overcome. So we think our IP strength remains intact. And so we feel very, very confident that, while anything is possible, we think our estate will defend REVLIMID through the 2020 window.","Nadim Ahmed - Celgene Corp.","Yes, and I'll add to the question \u2013 on bb2121, the short answer is yes, we do plan to expand the development beyond the late-line relapsed\/refractory patient pool. And in fact, our 2020 base case currently in the pipeline setting assumes just the relapsed\/refractory space. So anything else beyond 2020 is on top of that. I think the team is very excited about having a transformational asset that gives this level of activity in late-line settings, and there are tremendous unmet needs in earlier settings that I think bb2121 could very effectively play in. Thanks for the question.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ian Somaiya of BMO Capital. Your line is open.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you could speak to your strategy in newly diagnosed myeloma, specifically your plans for the next-generation CELMoDs, your BCMA antibodies. How do you plan to, I guess, utilize those to basically develop a line extension to REVLIMID? And one thing we haven't heard much about is potential for proprietary combinations in myeloma? And I was hoping you could speak to that as well.","Nadim Ahmed - Celgene Corp.","Thanks for the question. This is Nadim. So the one thing I will point on and remind folks is I think a very good attribute of our multiple myeloma strategy is we don't just rely on one mechanism of action or one class of agent, so we have a multi-modality approach to this disease, which of course then features in the kind of novel combinatorial approaches that you're alluding to, and that's clearly in our sights in terms of our development plans.","As it pertains to newly diagnosed myeloma, in addition to the BCMA play that you mentioned, of course, the next-generation CELMoD is an obvious area of opportunity in that setting. So first, we got to make sure we continue to kind of grow today, newly diagnosed myeloma with REVLIMID and relapsed\/refractory disease with POMALYST, and the teams we're focusing on that. But beyond that, we're thinking about all of the patient segments that could benefit from our very broad and diverse portfolio.","Patrick E. Flanigan III - Celgene Corp.","Hi, Vince. I think we have time for two more callers, please.","Operator","Yes, sir. Our next question is from Mara Goldstein of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Mara Goldstein - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. So just to return for a second around the idea around 2020 forecast. I think in the past, there's been much discussion around the forward forecast that the company had and that those forecasts were risk-adjusted. But quite frankly, with the miss on GED would suggest that maybe the risk adjustment might not have been conservative enough. And I know that obviously there were statements made around pressure-testing your model going forward, but I'm wondering what other adjustments you might have made for pipeline candidates, particularly those that have greater novelty and are less certain.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Thanks for the question. So as you can see, the range from the low end to the high end that we provided in the guidance touches a lot of different areas, I&I, oncology, actually new product indications in the hem-onc space as well. So in many ways what we looked at were things where we don't have final Phase 3 results, and we try to think about what's the range of outcomes plus or minus that we might expect. I think on the hem-onc side it's the most difficult because you have multiple trials still coming through that we don't have any view to, but we think actually have a lot of potential, so that's why you have maybe a slightly wider range on that one.","I think the challenge when you go out \u2013 when we did this in 2016 or 2015 to go out to 2020, I mean you're going on five or six years, so you're dealing with a lot of pipeline development coming through. I think one of the key points we were making is that for our commercial assets we have a very good view that they are well-positioned strategically, and there's a lot of certainty in what you're looking at.","I'd say that if anything, that's actually continuing to be very true. When you look at these sets of guidance, they're based on some assets that are very well-positioned and are doing quite well. That \u2013 albeit that perhaps in \u2013 as we've talked a lot today, dermatology, the market has really slowed down a fair bit at the moment, and we've kind of assumed that's going to be the case going forward, may or may not be. But furthermore, for the pipeline assets, we always thought about, okay, what should we bank on? Where do we have very strong proof-of-concept? And where should we have some caution? So I think we feel quite good about the update and the refresh that we've done. We thought long and hard about it. We've really tried to give a good view.","I would just to reiterate that the combination of our commercial assets, which are well-established, and the pipeline that will be coming through and reporting out in the relatively near term, the next year or two, it does add up to 15% top line growth and almost 20% EPS growth, which I think is quite strong. I think what it also doesn't show, as I mentioned earlier, is a lot of the assets that quite frankly are not even incorporated in these numbers because they come through the pipeline after 2020. And I think that you'll see more and more data coming for that. So we try to do the best job we can in terms of assessing that.","I don't think we exactly anticipated GED-0301 having the challenge that we saw here, but obviously this is the nature of the business. We're making a lot of bets of innovative science, and we're not really a me-too player, and we're going after high-potential assets to make a big difference. And we try to give the best sense of where we're going as possible. Mark?","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","And I think our confidence across the Phase 3 program is still very much intact, but the GED-0301 failure gives us pause and makes us think about on the margin, are there some risks to the portfolio that maybe we haven't captured in the more recent past?","I'll also say that back to the point Peter was making, we've always talked about the mix of opportunity and optionality evolving between when we originally issued our 2020 outlook in 2015, and that was on the back of the Receptos transaction, and then where we are today puts us in a position to reevaluate that mix. Doing that still puts us, even if one would consider this a bit conservative, at a kind of a midpoint between $19 billion and $20 billion with that 14.5% top line growth and almost 20% bottom line growth.","So I'm not saying we're being conservative today. I'm saying we're just using this opportunity to be able to really pressure-test each line item, look at the mix, and come back to you with a forecast that includes \u2013 and where we started the call today \u2013 on the dynamics of OTEZLA, the challenges of a market that we've learned a lot about. We're embedding that learning in our forward-looking outlook, and we're quite committed to take advantage of what we understand and what the proposition for OTEZLA would be. So if you think about the macro difference, it's still OTEZLA, GED-0301, with then puts and takes and some mix of optionality and opportunity across the portfolio. And we still are industry-leading in terms of our outlook to 2020.","Thanks for the question. It was really important.","Mara Goldstein - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Salim Syed of Mizuho. Your line is open.","Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Yeah, hi, guys. Thanks so much for squeezing me in. And congrats to Nadim. Good to hear your voice, Nadim. I had a question on ozanimod versus GED-0301. So there's some debate out there of how much share you can take from the patients that you were modeling for GED-0301 for UC and Crohn's and how much of that can flow now to ozanimod, or was GED-0301 really intentioned to be more of an earlier stage patient population, given there's no PML risk associated with that drug? And then as a related question, a yes\/no question. Is there an interim analysis on the UC Phase 3 trial for ozanimod? Thank you.","Terrie Curran - Celgene Corp.","Firstly to the first question. I mean, as we look at our IBD portfolio, we really have multiple short-term goals for the Crohn's disease and UC with a broad range of MOAs that deliver kind of oral therapy with kind of good efficacy. So I think as we're thinking about the market, I think we haven't kind of segmented and cannibalized each brand across the market. So I think with ozanimod, the opportunity now is significant to bring forward a compound that has an oral profile with potentially significant efficacy and a good safety profile.","And then on the second question regarding an interim analysis \u2013 sorry.","Scott A. Smith - Celgene Corp.","No, go ahead, please.","Terrie Curran - Celgene Corp.","No, there's not an interim analysis.","Scott A. Smith - Celgene Corp.","I just wanted to put a little more granularity around that early question about whether or not ozanimod would take market share, which previously we thought would be favoring GED. One of the things that's interesting, one of the questions that I probably received the most from the external world of all different sorts around the portfolio was, with so many assets in IBD in so many places, how are we going to position them all? And one of the reasons is that that's a little bit of a difficult place to develop, in but tremendous unmet medical need and real market potential.","So if you're going to go after a market like that, you need alternate modalities, and redundancy in your program. And certainly while we're disappointed that GED was not successful in Crohn's, we do have lots of other programs in the space. GED to me was an asset which was \u2013 uniquely played in two places, very early because of the non-systemic absorbed nature, and also in combinatorial approaches. And because of the non-systemic nature, I think the idea of a compound to be used early with relatively newly diagnosed patients fits very well with the profile that's emerging for ozanimod. Or if we went in that direction with OTEZLA, the profile that's emerge for OTEZLA.","So I think there is some overlap in where we would go. And I think those two oral assets are really well-positioned to be used early in therapy. So we do still have a very robust and interesting and good-quality IBD portfolio that we're very excited about.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Scott, so thank you very much. I want to thank everyone for joining us today. Obviously, we've spent a lot of time refreshing the outlook for the company. I would remind you again that this is \u2013 through 2020, the company is going to have a \u2013 we expect to have a 15% roughly top line growth and approximately a 20% bottom line growth, which I think is quite strong, very healthy portfolio in the pipeline. I think based on \u2013 as this settles into the market, obviously I think as you look at the P\/E ratios and the PEG ratios and the view of the stock, I think you'll agree and understand why we've also commented that we're going to have a very strong repurchase program. It's a great opportunity. And with ample balance sheet strength, continue on our BD and M&A strategies.","So thank you very much. We appreciate your interest and support and look forward to answering your questions as we go forward. Obviously, the next step is to be at ECTRIMS, go through the exciting ozanimod MS data, and onward. So it's a long-term game. Thank you very much for being supportive of the company.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes your program.

I would like to remind you this that call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Flanigan, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations.","Patrick E. Flanigan III - Celgene Corp.","Thanks, Kaylee, and welcome everyone to our first quarter earnings conference call. The press release reporting our financial results in addition to the presentation for today's webcast can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the corporate website at www.celgene.com. Joining me in the room today with prepared remarks are Mark Alles, our Chief Executive Officer; Peter Kellogg, our Chief Financial Officer; Michael Pehl, Global Head of our Hematology\/Oncology franchise; Scott Smith, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Executive Vice President Jackie Fouse.","As a reminder, during today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements regarding our financial outlook in addition to regulatory and product development plans. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those forecasted. A description of these risks can be found in our most recent 10-K on file with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date and we undertake no duty to update or revise them. Reconciliation of the adjusted financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available as part of the earnings release.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mark.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Thank you Patrick. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased and excited to be with you to review our excellent first quarter operating results and to discuss several important strategic achievements. Thanks to the continued outstanding work of my colleagues, our business momentum is very strong. We are beginning to deliver on a diverse and powerful set of near and longer term catalysts with the potential to significantly add opportunity and optionality for better than expected growth this year, and places us on track to achieve or exceed our 2020 outlook.","Today we reported year over year net product sales growth of 18% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 27%, representing our 45th quarter of consecutive year over year EPS growth. More importantly, these results reflect the clinically necessary and growing therapeutic value of our medicines for thousands of patients worldwide suffering with very serious diseases.","Given the outstanding performance of our hematology franchise, the excellent first quarter demand fundamentals for our oncology and immunology products and the exceptional leverage of our business model, we are raising our full year 2017 adjusted EPS guidance from a range of $7.10 to $7.25 to a range of $7.15 to $7.30. The midpoint of this increased range represents a 22% improvement from 2016.","Following my comments, Peter will share more details regarding our first quarter results and improved outlook for 2017. This progress reflects both a longstanding commitment to operational excellence and the positive outcome of a number of strategic decisions made to establish, strengthen and grow our commercial franchises. Key to our momentum is a multiyear strategy to aggressively deploy capital, to acquire new molecules from the best emerging scientific and technological platforms linked to our core areas of expertise. These investments, combined with exceptional execution, bring us to a significant and meaningful inflection point with our late stage pipeline programs.","For example during the first quarter, IDHIFA, the new brand name for enasidenib, and coming from our partnership with Agios Pharmaceuticals, received FDA priority review and a PDUFA date of August 30. Just 20 months after our acquisition of Receptos, we received positive Phase III data from the SUNBEAM trial studying ozanimod in relapsing multiple sclerosis. And we expect the results of the second Phase III trial for ozanimod in RADIANCE in relapsing MS well before the end of the second quarter. These ozanimod studies represent just the first of the 19 Phase III programs that we expect to read out over the next two years.","As our late stage clinical assets advance, we also expect our late stage pipeline to expand with the initiation of a number of new pivotal trials this year including BB2121 in multiple myeloma, JCAR017 in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, marizomib in glioblastoma multiforme, and based on recent compelling Phase II results from the STEPSTONE study, ozanimod in Crohn's Disease.","Later in the call, Michael and Scott will discuss details about the first quarter performances of their franchises and the substantial clinical, regulatory and market access accomplishments that have us well positioned for sustained long term growth. The outstanding results and achievements we are sharing with you today are possible only because of the nearly 7,000 Celgene employees around the world who are committed to our culture and to making a meaningful difference in the lives of patients. We're incredibly fortunate to have extraordinary people and outstanding leaders at Celgene.","I'd like to take the occasion of our call today to recognize two members of our management team who have recently been promoted to new executive positions, Scott Smith, our new President and Chief Operating Officer, and Terrie Curran, our new President of the Celgene I&I franchise. Terrie is joining us in the room today and will participate in the Q&A.","On a personal note, Bob Hugin and I would also like to congratulate and thank one of the most impactful leaders and friends we've ever had at Celgene. Jackie Fouse's contributions to our company are well known to many of you, but her passion for what we do will stay with us for many years to come. Before she closes our call this morning and on behalf of the entire Celgene community, I would like to thank Jackie for her dedication to our mission and all that she has done to support, communicate and advance the potential and promise of Celgene. Jackie, we wish you all the best in your retirement. We know that your contributions to whatever you decide to do next will be just as meaningful as everything you have done for us. Thank you very much.","So thanks again for being with us today. And now I'd like to turn the call over to another outstanding Celgene leader, Peter Kellogg.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Mark, and good morning everyone. We are off to another strong start to the year. The momentum that's been building over the last few years is now continuing into 2017. The team's solid commercial performance continues and operating leverage is a little better than expected, leading us to raise our full year adjusted EPS guidance to $7.15 to $7.30 per share. Importantly, we are building upon this momentum by investing in our pipeline of next generation growth drivers for beyond 2020. As Mark covered, we are excited to now be in a two year window in which we expect several inflection points on key mid to late stage pipeline programs.","Now turning to the Q1 performance. Net product sales grew 18% year over year to almost $3 billion. Strong growth was achieved across the portfolio, with key contributions by REVLIMID, POMALYST and OTEZLA. Similar to prior periods, our growth was predominantly volume driven with 15 of the 18 total percentage points of growth coming from volume. The modest contribution from price was partially offset by foreign exchange. Now, we expect foreign exchange to have a greater impact in the second half of the year.","As a reminder, the sequential performance from Q4 to Q1 is always impacted by several items. REVLIMID and POMALYST are impacted by higher gross to net adjustments related to early Medicare, donut hole and other ACA payments. ABRAXANE is impacted by customer contract optimization that results in a buy-in in Q4 followed by a sell-through in Q1. And OTEZLA is impacted by managed care dynamics that drive lower total marketplace prescriptions for psoriasis therapies in Q1.","In addition, a new dynamic for OTEZLA this quarter was a higher gross to net adjustment related to new contracts with several large payers that were implemented in January. These new contracts approximately doubled the number of patient lives who can now access OTEZLA without being required to step through a biologic therapy which has already improved OTEZLA's market share in these accounts. Scott will review this market dynamic and our progress in more detail later. In total and not surprisingly, the market dynamics that I just described across the portfolio resulted in a 1% sequential decline in net product sales from Q4.","Adjusted earnings per share grew 27% to $1.68 per share, with operating income driving $0.38 of the $0.36 per share bottom line growth. In total, financial levers had a negative $0.02 per share impact.","Turning to the P&L line items, the adjusted operating margin improved 410 basis points to 51.7% (sic) [58.1%]. Most of the margin improvement occurred in the R&D expense line. R&D was impacted by the timing and pace of clinical trial activity, in addition to milestone payments to our partners. In Q1, we recorded a $7 million milestone payment compared to payments totaling $65 million in Q1 of 2016. Importantly, if we were to exclude the milestone payments in both years, R&D expense grew 12% year over year, reflecting increased investments in advancing our pipeline programs, which is fully in line with our strategy. SG&A grew 15% year over year with relatively flat growth from Q4.","We ended the quarter with $8.9 billion in cash and marketable securities and we have considerable financial flexibility to make strategic investments that further build the pipeline and create long term shareholder value.","Finally, based on the strong start and the continued momentum in the year, we are increasing the expected operating margin by 50 basis points to approximately 57% resulting in the $0.05 per share increase to both the high and low end of the adjusted EPS range. We expect R&D expense as a percentage of revenue to increase throughout the year while SG&A leverage drives the operating margin improvements. Other guidance items remain unchanged.","Thank you, and now I'd like to turn the call over to my colleague, Michael.","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Peter, and good morning everyone. Hematology and Oncology franchise had a very good first quarter of 2017. We delivered a strong sales performance with 18% year over year growth and 1% sequential growth. We are very pleased with this result, and in addition, delivered against some critical regulatory and clinical milestones.","REVLIMID had an excellent first quarter and overcame the expected buying patterns and U.S. coverage gap challenges that we typically see in Q1. Our newly diagnosed myeloma launch continues to drive global increases in demand and duration. POMALYST\/IMNOVID is significantly growing versus the same quarter in 2016 due to increasing use of triplets and duration gains. Finally, ABRAXANE continues to be stable overall with U.S. buying patterns impacting the Q1 performance.","REVLIMID net sales grew 20% year over year and an impressive 4% quarter over quarter. Growth was strong in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. In the U.S., we had an excellent 24% growth year over year and 4% sequential growth. The U.S. growth in Q1 was driven by an increase in both new and repeat prescriptions. International REVLIMID growth was also very strong, with 13% year over year and 5% sales growth. Year over year and sequential international volume growth were 22% and 13% respectively.","NDMM market share continues to grow outside of the U.S., with a positive uptake both in the EU and in Japan. We have obtained and given NSCT reimbursement in 20 countries around the globe and are finalizing reimbursement in France. With this regulatory approval in the U.S. and EU for REVLIMID as maintenance therapy post autologous stem cell transplantation and we're already able to obtain reimbursement in six European markets. As we mentioned before, we believe this indication will be a significant opportunity for REVLIMID globally.","In the U.S. market, there is still a large portion of patients who do not receive REVLIMID maintenance or who only receive a fixed duration of REVLIMID treatment. The recent approvals will allow us to educate physicians on the unique value proposition of REVLIMID post autologous stem cell transplantation and continue to highlight the need for treatment to disease progression. In Europe, there's an even greater opportunity, with very few patients receiving maintenance therapy to date.","We are also advancing our plans to submit an sNDA for RVd in first line transplant and non-transplant patients. We had positive interactions with health authorities and are pleased with the progress being made. We expect a submission in U.S. by year end. Finally, we are awaiting the Phase III results of our indolent lymphoma programs. The (14:15) RELEVANCE and AUGMENT trials are both expected to read out by the end of 2017.","POMALYST\/IMNOVID net sales grow 33% year over year. In the U.S., POMALYST net sales grew 26% year over year and we saw 1% decline quarter over quarter. The underlying demand is very strong and total prescriptions grew in Q1 versus Q4. Demand growth was offset by the gross-to-net impact of the coverage gap and some inventory fluctuation.","Both in U.S. and internationally, POMALYST\/IMNOVID is maintaining a market leading position in 3rd line+ despite new entrants. We have strong increases in treatment duration for POMALYST\/IMNOVID globally and we expect to see dynamic growth during the rest of the year. An important near term growth driver in the U.S. will be the expected FDA approval of POMALYST in combination with daratumumab for relapsed refractory myeloma by June of this year.","Finally, as mentioned on our Q4 call, we are successfully enrolling key development programs for POMALYST\/IMNOVID to further support the use of multiple combinations. We are pleased to announce that our Phase III OPTIMISMM trial, in combination with bortezomib in second or later treatment line completed enrollment during the first quarter and we expect data in 2018.","ABRAXANE continues to have quite stable demand. ABRAXANE net sales grew 5% year over year and declined by 11% quarter over quarter, impacted by U.S. customer buying patterns that we typically see in Q1. ABRAXANE U.S. sales were flat year over year. U.S. ABRAXANE maintains its leadership position in pancreatic cancer and demand is stable in breast and lung cancer.","Outside of the U.S., ABRAXANE grew 16% year over year and was stable quarter over quarter. We continued to see growth in pancreatic cancer outside of the U.S. and have multiple growth drivers ahead for ABRAXANE. We expect results of the apact adjuvant pancreatic cancer trial to be available by the end of 2017. And the pivotal ABRAXANE (16:17) combination trials in non-small cell lung cancer and triple negative breast cancer will read out in 2018.","The second quarter is always an exciting time with important congresses. This year we will have a strong presence at ASCO. We expect to see the final overall survival data from the CALGB trial with REVLIMID maintenance in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. We will also have updated data from the Phase III MAGNIFY trials with (16:47) in relapsed refractory indolent lymphoma.","In addition, there will be data from the ABOUND non-small cell lung cancer program with ABRAXANE in elderly patients and in patients with poor performance status.","In addition, our collaborations are producing exciting data for ASCO. From our collaboration with bluebird, we will have updated data for the Phase I trial of BB2121 in late line relapsed refractory multiple myeloma. Our collaboration with Juno will see updated data from the Phase I TRANSCEND trial with JCAR017 in relapsed refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.","Finally, updated data will be presented from the Phase I\/II trial with IDHIFA, or enasidenib, through our Agios collaboration. Those data in relapsed refractory AML patients with an IDH2 mutation are the basis of our ongoing FDA submission. As a reminder, the PDUFA date for IDHIFA is August 30 and our U.S. team is fully prepared for a highly successful launch.","Through our Acceleron collaboration, we will have luspatercept data at the MDS Foundation meeting in Valencia, Spain, including Phase II data in early low risk MDS patients who have not received an ESA. We are very pleased with the efficacy of luspatercept in this patient population and are moving forward with the planning for a respective Phase III study in front line low risk MDS.","Our ongoing Phase III luspatercept studies in later line low risk MDS and non-transfusion dependent beta-thalassemia, I expect it to be fully recruited during the second quarter, which represents an acceleration of six months versus original plan with an expected readout of top line results by mid 2018.","In summary, we had a great start to the year for the Hematology and Oncology franchise and we are on track to deliver our 2017 guidance. We have already achieved key regulatory and clinical milestones with the approval of REVLIMID as maintenance therapy post autologous stem cell transplantation. We are awaiting the approval of IDHIFA in IDH2 mutant relapsed refractory AML by the end of August. We are on track to submit RVd in NDMM to the FDA by year end and have fully recruited our Phase III OPTIMISMM study of pomalidomide\/bortezomib in second and later line multiple myeloma.","Finally, our mid and late stage pipeline is making great progress. We are further advancing our pivotal plans for luspatercept in front line low risk MDS and are planning to initiate a Phase II study in myelofibrosis later this year. We are preparing to initiate pivotal programs for multiple additional assets by the end of this year, including marizomib in first line glioblastoma, BB2121 in relapsed refractory myeloma, JCAR017 in relapsed refractory large B-cell lymphoma, CC-122 in relapsed refractory lymphoma, IDHIFA in first line AML and durvalumab in myeloma, MDS and AML.","Thank you and I will now turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Andrew Smith - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Michael, and good morning. Q1 2017 was a strong quarter for Celgene I&I. There were challenging dynamics in the U.S. psoriatic markets but OTEZLA continued to produce significant year on year growth. We initiated a number of activities that will expand the addressable population for OTEZLA worldwide, laying the groundwork for a highly successful year ahead. We significantly advanced development of the Celgene I&I pipeline, taking important steps forward in proof of concept and pivotal programs for GED-301 and ozanimod.","Global OTEZLA net sales for Q1 2017 were $242 million, representing a 24% year on year increase. This revenue growth is being driven by continued gains of market share and geographic expansion. With full reimbursement now in place in major markets in Europe and Japan, uptake is accelerating internationally. In the U.S., the challenging dynamics we faced in Q1 were mainly driven by short-term headwinds. Beyond the normal Q1 market declines we anticipated, this year's contraction was deeper and more protracted. Additionally, we saw significantly higher GTN adjustments in Q1 due to contracting to remove biologic step-edits in several major U.S. health plans and a modest decline in inventory levels. We expect the increased GTN to be more than offset by future growth in these large plans.","Looking specifically at the key performance indicators, we see consistent growth in OTEZLA share in the large psoriasis market. We are closing the share gap on STELARA for second position in the category. In addition, OTEZLA continues to expand the market and it leads all other therapies in new-to-brand share for both psoriasis and PsA. Currently 90% of patients are coming to OTEZLA from something other than a biologic. Looking at the graphic on the right, we can see that early gains are already evident after only one quarter from this contracting strategy. This strategy will allow an additional 70 million to 100 million commercial lives to have biologic step-free access to OTEZLA. We believe that this increasing access will allow us to truly compete for market share leadership in these large and important markets.","Building on our momentum, we are aggressively expanding the foundation for future revenue growth. We are continuing to execute on a robust lifecycle plan for OTEZLA. At the AAD Meeting in March, data from our Phase IV UNVEIL study were presented. These data demonstrated a compelling efficacy and safety profile in the moderate psoriasis population. We also initiated Phase III development in scalp psoriasis and are preparing to file our once-daily formulation in the U.S. later this year. The momentum we see in Q2 across a number of fronts gives us confidence that we will deliver on our full year 2017 guidance of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion.","Turning now to ozanimod, we are very encouraged by the results we've seen to date in both the MS and IBD indications. In the Phase III SUNBEAM MS trial, ozanimod achieved the primary and all measured secondary endpoints with no new safety findings. The second pivotal MS trial, RADIANCE, is on track to read out next month.","The Phase II STEPSTONE study in Crohn's Disease demonstrated positive signs of clinical benefit, supporting initiation of a Phase III development program by year end. We expect these important data to be presented in a major medical meeting later this year. We are very excited about the blockbuster potential of ozanimod across multiple indications.","Q1 was a quarter full of importance advances for the franchise. We executed multiple initiatives to expand the foundation for OTEZLA growth across both markets and indications. We aggressively advanced the development of two potential future blockbuster products, ozanimod and GED-301. Several important data readouts will follow throughout the year.","Going forward, with Terrie Curran as President of the franchise, I look forward to sharing in many future successes for Celgene I&I. There will be multiple milestones and accomplishments coming throughout 2017 and beyond.","Thank you very much for your attention and I'd now like to turn the call over to Jackie.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Scott. Good morning everyone. As you have heard from the Celgene team, Q1 of 2017 was a stellar quarter for many reasons. From my perspective, our performance can best be summarized by three high-level aspects. First, our outstanding execution paves the way for ongoing strong long-term growth. Across all of our teams, from early research to clinical development to regulatory to medical affairs to commercial, and for all of the other operational and supporting functions, our record bodes well for our future ability to make the most, both from the assets that exist within our current portfolio as well as those that will come out of the pipeline.","Second, Celgene's portfolio diversification is well underway and is happening across our research and development pipeline and our marketed product portfolio. Tangible developments in this regard should provide confidence in the company's ability to grow at an industry-leading rate for the coming decade and beyond.","And third, the Celgene strategy is delivering across all of its components. Our focus on science, data and unmet medical need has supported us bringing new blockbuster products to market and generating a steady stream of new data to support the value propositions of our drugs that have been on the market for some time.","Our distributed R&D model for early stage programs is bearing fruit. Witness IDHIFA from our Agios collaboration. And it is creating significant optionality within our pipeline. The mid to late stage acquisitions we have done have delivered on their objectives thus far, including Pharmion, Abraxis, GED-301 and Receptos. And to round out the strategy with respect to operational excellence, we have, are and will continue to leverage our focused global operating model to deliver earnings growth that exceeds revenue growth, even while we invest for the long-term health of our business.","A lot was accomplished in Q1. There is still much more to come for the remainder of this year and well beyond. As we hit these milestones, each event will provide even more visibility and confidence to what the future holds for Celgene.","In closing, I would like to thank my Celgene colleagues around the world and across all functions for a great Q1 2017 and a fantastic past seven years. I would also like to thank our sell side and buy side friends for your support over the years, both your support of Celgene and our teams and your support of me. Many of you have been a part of my professional journey since my pre-Celgene days and I greatly appreciate the confidence you have always placed in me. Today is my last Celgene earnings call, but I'm still around for two more months and I look forward to seeing everyone at ASCO in June.","Thank you and I will now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Carter Gould with UBS. Your line is open.","Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking a question. On OTEZLA, it definitely sounds like you're positioning the performance, the seasonal and sort of temporary and I guess very much in line with what we heard from Amgen last night in the broader segment. Can you just walk through what gives you confidence growth will bounce back or could we see continued pressure in the near term? Thank you.","Terrie Curran - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Carter. Yeah, I think you're spot on. I think there was really three key drivers to the performance in the first quarter. Firstly, we saw contraction in the market as we saw increased GTN as a result of the contracting, but importantly, that really gives us access to double the number of insured lives going forward. And lastly, we saw minimal drawdown of the inventory.","Importantly, if we look at the underlying dynamics to the business, they're exceptionally strong. If you look at the market share, OTEZLA continues to grow market share. We continue to gain more than 40% of new patients and these new contracts will give us access to an additional pool of patients moving forward. Importantly, if we look at the exit run rates out of quarter one and into quarter two, we do see the net sales rebounding and on track to deliver the 2017 guidance.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on your achievement for Jackie. I have a question on BB2121. It sounds like you planned for pivotal trial already. Does that mean you have seen durable response? And then quickly on ozanimod in MS, do you have to clear both the hurdle for clean safety and also you have to see a disability progression benefit in order to make this a differentiated product in the marketplace? Thank you.","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","Yeah, thanks for the question. It's Michael. I'll start with BB2121. So what we are going to present to you at ASCO I think is reflecting updated data, not just with more patients at the clinically relevant dose, but then also a longer treatment duration which is going to allow us to look exactly at what you were just mentioning, the durability of the responses. We think that throughout the course of the year, we're going to have sufficient patient in the clinically relevant dose to look in aggregate on safety, efficacy and treatment duration, so that we can, as you say, make a pivotal decision by the end of the year. But I think ASCO will allow us to have a first look on a sufficient number of patients with a clinically meaningful treatment duration.","Scott Andrew Smith - Celgene Corp.","Specific to ozanimod, we do expect to see differentiated safety data. We saw that in the first initial SUNBEAM trial. We would expect that to hold up and that's a critical part of what we see as commercialization and success of this molecule going forward. Relative to the disability endpoint, no oral therapies have ever shown a P-value on the disability endpoint relative to an active comparator. Only one compound's ever shown it at all. And so what we would expect here is not necessarily a P-value here but clinically meaningful changes in that disability index.","All the competitors have the disability data in their inserts, whether or not it was significant or not. And again, it's only been significant for one compound and not for any oral compound. So our base case was built off clinically meaningful disability end points, not necessarily statistically significant. Now, I will add a little context, that we got agreement from the FDA that we could pool and pre-specify the pool data as the endpoint here that other compounds haven't done. So we'll be interested to see what that looks like.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks and congrats to Jackie on her wonderful tenure at Celgene and to Scott and Terrie on their promotions. Jackie, I'm going to send you my coverage universe so you know where to end up next. Maybe a question for Scott or Terrie. Looks like the U.S. sales of ozanimod were down 26% quarter on quarter, and given that weakness, I was hoping you could just provide a little bit more granularity as to what percent of the decline was gross-to-net, what was stocking, and what was the seasonality that you mentioned. Thanks so much.","Terrie Curran - Celgene Corp.","I think if you look at those two factors, what we can say is that the total impact of inventory drawdown in quarter one was about $35 million to $40 million, but inventory levels exiting the quarter were at the low end of the normal range. If we look at GTN, the GTN actually doubled going from Q1 in 2016 to Q1 in 2017. And then if we look at the contraction of the market, the overall market in terms of scripts was down by about 4%. Having said that, OTEZLA did much better than the contraction, and our roll scripts were only down by 1.5%. So if you actually look at the underlying dynamics of the business, we really see as we have in previous years, that quarter two we'll have a rebound.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore. Your line is open.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Thank you so much for taking my question. I actually wanted to focus on ozanimod's pooled Phase III, the statistical hierarchy, and I guess the question was, will the primary announcements be on the 0.5 milligrams or the 1 milligrams? And also on ozanimod, just while we're at it, clearly MS and GI indications are a high priority for you. And from our perspective, we're just trying to think out loud, what would that mean when you do come to the market as it relates to the price points that are very different between MS and GI? Would really appreciate any color. Thank you.","Scott Andrew Smith - Celgene Corp.","So relative to the first question, we would pool the 0.5 and look at it versus placebo and pool the 1 milligram and look at it versus placebo. That's the way it would go. It would not be a blended-dose pooled analysis. It would be a pooled analysis from the two studies. That's the pooling effect is that you're taking the SUNBEAM study and the RADIANCE data and pooling it. You're not blending the two doses within a study.","Second question was relative to price differences in the marketplace. It's interesting. When we did this transaction 19 months ago or so, the price differences were much more profound, the price points from the two markets, IBD and MS. And they've sort of over the past number of months drifted closer together. Certainly the MS has got a higher price point than the IBD marketplace.","What we would always do in this case is make sure that we get the fullness of the Phase III data and understand the value of the asset, both in MS and then when we get the UC data understand the fullness of that data. And we would be in a position then to really start to move forward on our pricing strategy for both indications for this particular molecule.","But the differences in the market are certainly less acute than they were just a couple years ago. So the problem's a little bit lesser. But we'll get the fullness of the data. Certainly we've done a number of different pricing scenarios and looked at lots of different ways to price in this marketplace. And we feel very good about the economic opportunity for both indications.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Let me add my congratulations to Jackie and wish you the best of luck in whatever you decide to do next. I have a pipeline question for you regarding your Juno partnership. You mentioned that a pivotal trial in NHL set to begin by the end of the year for JCAR017. Do you have an expectation of how this might be designed? Is it a potentially possible to roll the current DLBCL study into a registrational trial by expanding centers and patients? Thanks.","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","Yeah hi, Cory. This is Michael. So the planning is, and we are responsible for planning the registrational study in Europe. So the planning is to have a distinct study in late-line relapsed refracted diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients. And we will probably have the opportunity to do this as a single-arm study and we will have to do a confirmatory trial afterwards. That's where we are.","Operator","Thank you. And now our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Morning, guys, and thanks for the question and Jackie, congrats on retirement, going to miss you. A couple for bigger picture questions for Mark, then one for Scott on OTEZLA. So Scott, is the positioning ahead of biologics at risk given the changes that you mentioned on step-edits? And then for Mark, all the biz-dev activity the past few years should help diversify the concentration on REV. But I wanted to ask you, what would you call out as the highest impact asset on diversification? And what can you tell us maybe about the pace of biz-dev activity from here? Thanks.","Terrie Curran - Celgene Corp.","Just to answer the question on OTEZLA, the contracts that we have implemented actually give us an opportunity to position OTEZLA pre-biologic. So what they actually do is remove the steps, so remove the requirements in these three large contracts to first try biologics. So it's actually the opposite to what you articulated. The strategic reason that we did this was that it's really important for OTEZLA patients to have access without having to have that step through a biologic. So it's going to have a very positive effect for our market share, particularly towards the second half of the year.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Hey, Geoff. It's Mark. Thanks for the question. By the way, that was I think two questions but we'll let you go because you were so nice to Jackie. Hey listen, on the diversification question, you'll remember that we've talked a lot about the pipeline and how excited we are with the optionality and opportunity coming from, give or take, 14 different unique molecules that between now and 2021, 2022 are in late stage development or in proof of concept stage development. They give us the kind of opportunity to diversify from the concentration of REVLIMID over time, so leading up to the loss of exclusivity. But as again, we've spoken to, some 10 of those molecules, we estimate in a bottoms-up forecast about $1 billion in revenue as an opportunity. And another four, we think are multibillion dollar opportunities. Many of those assets you've heard my colleagues talk about during their prepared remarks and on the call already, so that optionality keeps growing.","And then on the pace of business development, we're very excited. I talked about it in my prepared remarks. The strength of our balance sheet, how we see the marketplace, the technological advances that are happening, really are I think virtuous and supportive of our BD strategy, to stay hungry, stay in the market and be the partner of choice across the hematologic, oncologic and the increasingly broader I would call it immunology platform. We've talked a lot about I&I, sort of inflammatory diseases, perhaps versus. But we see this science actually converging now, and it's more about immunology specifically than just inflammation. So thanks for the question and let's go to the next one.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much and Jackie, congratulations and thanks for all the access that you've given us over the years and the sort of candor that you've shared. We'll definitely miss you. So now that you're more or less ready to talk unscripted, could you tell us whether all those upfront payments really should have been pro forma'd out of those earnings numbers? And in case you won't answer that, could you talk a little bit about return on invested capital and how that is trending for Celgene. You didn't comment. Peter didn't mention it on the call. It's something that were accustomed to seeing in the past and just wondering whether there's going be some recovery in that metric. Thanks very much.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","So let me just say one thing. I think I learned a little bit too late in my career that the way to avoid getting any questions during the Q&A is to cry a little bit at the end of your prepared remarks. So I should have learned that maybe 15 years ago or something. On the return on invested capital question, I'll going to punt it to Peter.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Yeah. Absolutely.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Wait a minute. We have to say, and June 30 is still a few days away.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","It is.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Jackie's still here until June 30.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Yeah, no. So absolutely, it's a great question. The return on invested capital as you say, will start to grow. Clearly, when you do a major acquisition of a pipeline asset like we did with Receptos, what you're doing is, you're laying out a lot of value to an asset and that you're not getting any revenue or return in the short term. But now, as is coming true as you can see with the excitement of ozanimod as well as other assets that have come from that company in our pipeline that we haven't really talked about yet, but we will be probably in the future, I think that'll be a very strong contributor to our return on invested capital.","Obviously, for the rest of our portfolio, the company has continued to do extremely well, driving great returns, increasing margins. It's funny, as you said that, I was thinking about how when we gave our 2020 guidance, we highlighted that our operating margin would be in the high 50s. And I remember a few people kind of gasped and said, can you really actually get there. And I look at our results now, already you can see that the trends are very, very strong.","So I think we're on a great track. The return on invested capital metric, if you were just to take out that one big acquisition, would be continuing to drive forward. And obviously once that asset starts to kick in with revenue and returns, you're going to see it really jump forward. So we feel really great about it. We're thinking that our alliance portfolio is very strong. It's interesting there, is in January we highlighted a number of assets there in the late stage that have a lot of potential. Quite frankly, that list keeps getting added to as we go forward. And so we feel very good about the investments we've made, even the up-fronts, Geoff, and also the whole collaboration portfolio approach and the building pipeline which really is going to build our next decade of growth. So it seems like it's come together really nicely.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Alethia Young with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and Jackie, congrats and thanks for everything professionally and personally. You always kept it real with us and you definitely will be missed. So congrats to Peter and Terrie on the promotion. I just wanted to talk a little bit about duration trends that you're seeing with REVLIMID in Europe perhaps maybe now as we move to the post-transplant era and just maybe if you can talk a little bit about the market share dynamics, both in the U.S. and Europe. Thanks.","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","Yeah thanks, Alethia. This is Michael. So I think there's very good numbers that you saw for our first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter, by the way, both for the U.S. and for Europe were really driven primarily by volume. We had a record number of prescriptions in the U.S. and that's a composite of two things. It's the increase in treatment duration and it's market share increases driven by our NDMM launches. And we have the same phenomenon in Europe. We have a very strong 13% sequential volume growth in Europe in the first quarter and this is really a reflection of the starting stem cell transplantation launch. We have reimbursement in six countries but then also the ongoing non-stem cell transplantation launch where we have reimbursement in 17 European countries.","Market share in U.S. and in Europe and in Japan continues to grow and treatment duration continues to grow. And the treatment duration is really driven by a couple of things. I just wanted to say this once again. Of course, the fact that REVLIMID is used in early treatment lines, non-first line, that's helping a lot. There's a lot of appreciation because all the data are pointing to this direction of using REVLIMID until progression. And then of course, you have this phenomenon of triplets which are used in the relapsed refractory setting in U.S., even starting to be used in the first line setting and that is driving treatment duration. So we have all these factors that help us and we have I think a lot of hope that this very positive trend is going to continue very significantly in the future.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Newman with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.","John Lawrence Newman - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks very much for taking my question. Just had one quick additional question on OTEZLA. The contracts that you put in place regarding removal of the step-through biologic edits. I'm just wondering, were those patients already covered? Are you simply looking to modify the contracts that were already there, or will these patients bring in a lot of new patients that previously weren't already covered under the contracts? Thanks.","Terrie Curran - Celgene Corp.","Thanks, John, for the question. So these are new contracts that we've negotiated. They're multiple year contracts that were implemented in the first quarter. And they will establish a new pool of patients for OTEZLA pre-biologic, so they'll actually double the number of lives that are covered by these plans.","John Lawrence Newman - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with BMO Capital.","Your line is open.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks for taking my questions. And Jackie, you are truly going be missed. The one question I had was on mongersen on the upcoming endoscopy data. I don't know if there's anyone willing to just set expectations since we dealt with this issue about a year ago. And then just trying to think about ozanimod versus mongersen. You have data in-house. Just curious how you think data will lead to patient segmentation of those two drugs?","Scott Andrew Smith - Celgene Corp.","Thank you very much. There is a sort of an encore presentation of some of the GED CD-001 data upcoming which takes a look at the relationship between clinical remission and endoscopic improvements. And so I can't get into the specifics of that data, but that will be presented DDW coming up, so we're excited about that. We're very, very, we've got data for GED obviously, and for ozanimod. We're very excited about both assets. The GED registration program has really accelerated over the last little while. We remain on track with timelines there and we think there's tremendous potential.","Before you finalize positioning, you would want to see and make sure that you had the data from both GED and from ozanimod in Crohn's. I think there is some real positives on the mongersen or GED side in terms of the non-systemic absorption characteristics of the product which could make it really I think a very good product, both to be used early first line, but also to be used in combination or in combinatorial approaches with other agents in the marketplace, because again, it's got a very unique mechanism and non-systemically absorbed.","So we're very, very excited about both these assets. When we get the final data, that's really when you start to harden that positioning. But it's an area of extremely high unmet medical need. It's a market that has been not particularly well penetrated. And the idea that we could bring two or even more assets into the IBD space is I think very, very positive for Celgene and for patients worldwide.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Katherine Breedis with Stifel. Your line is open.","Katherine Breedis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you for taking my question and I have to reiterate as well that we will really miss you, Jackie, and look forward to celebrating you at ASCO. My question is about CC-220. We're looking forward to seeing the Phase IIa data at EULAR, particularly after what we learned about the molecule mechanistically at your protein homeostasis R&D day last September. Can you provide some thoughts on how you think about what the structure of the Phase IIb will look like, your targeted enrollment and when we could potentially see these data read out in the future?","Scott Andrew Smith - Celgene Corp.","Yes, we're just working through the in discussion with the agencies what this Phase IIb data is going to look like. We don't want to get into specifics right now because it may be subject to change. I think we have seen some utilization and some proof of concept of IMiDs in SLE in the past in small studies and IITs and is other things. The Phase IIa data was very encouraging that regardless of which biomarkers you looked at in this space, they all seem to be moving in the right direction. There seem to be pretty profound effects in this relatively sick SLE population. So we think we have a good shot at an active therapeutic in this space.","It is a very complex development space as you may know. There's a lot of discussion around endpoints and what are the appropriate regulatory endpoints. We constructed the Phase IIa and we will construct the Phase IIb in a way to give us the broadest read of overall activity before we would select, together with the regulatory agencies, the appropriate endpoint and construct that pivotal Phase III program. But we're very excited about that and looking forward to getting that data out in a couple months.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Mohit Bansal - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my question and, Jackie, thank you so much for all the access you have provided over the years. So my question is regarding Gilenya and then given that your launch would coincide with \u2013 your launch for ozanimod would coincide with Gilenya going generic, could you help us understand how are you thinking about the MS market in 2019, 2020 timeframe? And how comfortable do you feel about the idea that no monitoring would be enough to counter a substantial price difference, especially in the current payer environment? Thank you.","Scott Andrew Smith - Celgene Corp.","Thank you very much for the question. And when we look at the molecule, I think we look at ozanimod and we look at the totality of the safety data and it's not just cardiac monitoring or lack of AV block and some of the other cardiac toxicities. But we see differentiated data in a number of different places, including liver toxicity, the return to normalcy of lymphocytes post dosing looks different for the compound, infection rates. Other things look different than Gilenya.","So we believe we will have an asset which is significantly differentiated from Gilenya from clinical perspective. We see it in pre-clinical models. We see it in the Phase II. We certainly are seeing it initially in the Phase III and we are hoping for the next study in taking a look at that. But the hypothesis that we made this acquisition and investment on, was this idea that it would be differentiated from a safety perspective from Gilenya, not just on first path cardiac monitoring, but on lots of other aspects of the molecule. And we saw that in Phase II and we hope that holds up in Phase III and that will be the fundamental value proposition of ozanimod in this space, even post loss of exclusivity of another compound. But highly differentiated or differentiated data leading to hopefully what will be a best-in-class compound.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jim Birchenough with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Nick Abbott - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for take my question. It's Nick on for Jim, and I'm sure Jim would echo, and myself, everything nice that's been said about you, Jackie. In terms of the BB2121 trial, obviously you could just do a standard trial in relapsed refractory myeloma. I know yesterday Ken Anderson led the (52:02) publication early online in clinical cancer research discussing minimal residual disease and obviously this is a hot topic. So is there an opportunity to do something creative with BB2121 that resets the bar for what to expect in a relapsed refractory multiple myeloma study? Thank you.","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","Yes, thanks for the questions. And you can expect a lot of creative things from us over the time. I think the starting point is really is taking a kind of a late line population where very little treatment options exist. And please recall the data that we've been showing at the Triple meeting in Munich although early, those quadruple refractory patients, where we obtained complete responses and stringent complete responses. So the starting point is obviously kind of a late line population where you can obtain regulatory approval quickly. That said, I think there's all opportunities then to bring BB2121 up in the treatment.","And to your point, an MLV-positive population for example in a first line setting is definitely a population to reflect on, a population with high risk cytogenetic features in a first line setting. That's a population definitely to reflect on. I'm personally convinced that over time autonomous transplant and high dose chemotherapy are not going to stay the mainstay for younger patients. And I think we start to see results that are questioning the role, even in the life of new compounds in multiple myeloma.","So I would also think about is then opportunity to take out this treatment modality and recreate it by something absolutely better. I think this is all things we are contemplating on. But the starting point for us is having a dose, having a great efficacy, having a great duration of response. And hopefully we're going get and obtain all these results and then go into well-defined late line populations, get the drug approved and then come up a great clinical development plan.","Patrick E. Flanigan III - Celgene Corp.","Hi, Kaylee. We're kind of bumping up against the hour so we have time for maybe two more callers.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Mara Goldstein with Cantor. Your line is open.","Mara Goldstein - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. Thank you very much for taking the question. I have a question and it regards the forward growth expectation. And it's perhaps both a theoretical and a practical question in that the company's consistently provided long-term growth rates, which we appreciate, and I believe pipeline candidates are risk-adjusted in those long-term growth rates. And as we're moving close through 2017 and seeing filings and completion of later stage clinical programs, I'm wondering at what point do such programs become a definitive part of these growth expectations and when might you disclose them to the broader investment community?","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Yeah, I'd be glad to. So obviously, when we put together our internal plans for on a long-term basis, what we actually do is we think through which programs do we actually have proof of concept data for and then we include those in our base case. Not probability adjusted, and they're actually, quite frankly, very small relative to our 2020 guidance. It's one of the reasons why we wanted to see some of the Phase III results before we go beyond 2020 just because we want to know how do you add these in for the ozanimods and GEDs and other assets like that.","So what we kind of do is we do a base case based on the composition of our commercial assets or very late stage assets where we have very strong proof of concept already, and only for the indications for those drugs where we have proof of concept. Then what happens is each time we get a Phase III result, we roll that in and we would talk very clearly with you in terms of how that might impact guidance for 2020 or beyond. Now, obviously for 2020 as I mentioned, the late stage pipeline has actually a fairly small impact because it's really launching in 2018 or 2019 for most of those assets. They're just starting to ramp up compared to magnitude of the rest of our commercial portfolio. That adds some nice growth, but it's not a big deal.","Going beyond 2020 with guidance, which would be something we will think about at some point in the future, no question, if we have some of those Phase III results, and we kind of know what the outcomes are and how to add those in with much more clear understanding of late stage data and what the label might look like, then we're really ready to start rolling those in. We don't really have a broad probability adjusted approach to it because, for us, we consider it as more important to have kind of like the binary signal of is this a product and is it a go. And then we have a fairly clear read of how it's going to go forward. So I hope that helps. And I'd be glad to chat offline.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","It's Mark. Just to add one quick comment. All that said, we remain very confident that we're on track to meet or exceed 2020.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Absolutely.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","The timing question that you ask is really an important one but we're just not ready to think that through more completely today given the optionality and opportunity that's in the pipeline. Thanks.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Yatin Suneja with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Yatin Suneja - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my question and I'll also extend my congratulations to Jackie, Scott and Terrie. So the question is on the pipeline. Could you maybe talk about your confidence in IDHIFA upcoming approval given that the NDA was filed on single-arm trial? And how do you envision that market opportunity? Thank you.","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","Yeah, hello. This is Michael. So our confidence starts with the fact that we have a PDUFA date and certainly very intensive and very constructive ongoing interactions with regulatory authorities. The fact that we believe that we can actually get an approval with single-arm Phase I\/II data comes A, from the strength of the data, and then B, from the medical need out of there and C, from the clear definition of the patient population.","And let me just also once again say that we are really excited about this approval because it's the first one that comes from our distributed research model. It comes along with a companion diagnostic that will help us a lot in positioning the drug and getting reimbursement. And then of course, it fits beautifully in the AML pipeline that it's building, not just IDHIFA for us (58:19). So I think from all angles, that looks great.","The initial opportunity for IDHIFA is a bit more limited because if we start in relapsed refractory AML, our first line AML journey has started. We have two trials ongoing. We think the real commercial opportunity that could make this drug a $1 billion drug is coming from the first line data and then also hopefully development plans that we are about to develop. So everything is set. Our launch plans are in place and we are very, very excited about IDHIFA.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","So that completes our call. This is Peter. I'd just like to thank everybody for joining us today. As you can see, we're off to a great start for 2017. We've already increased our guidance range for non-GAAP EPS. The products are doing extremely well. I think a couple of the charts we showed today really highlight the excitement we have actually for OTEZLA.","While it was true the first quarter had some market contraction for the moment, we already see it coming through in March and April with very good volumes, and so we're on track there, as well. And in fact, to the point of the number of covered lives and the market gain opportunities, quite frankly to bring those top accounts up to a market share that's commensurate with the rest of the market is just phenomenal.","So we're excited about 2017. And in particularly, we're excited about getting all of the late stage trial outcomes as it will start coming through as we go through the year. So we're really in a period of a lot of trigger points and opportunities for us, and quite frankly, we at Celgene are very excited.","And let me just finish by saying also thank you to Jackie one more time. But also, it's just been great working with her. And also, we want to really thank her for all the great results. And I'd like to hand it over to Bob, if I could.","Robert J. Hugin - Celgene Corp.","Yeah, no, it's been a great pleasure to serve with Jackie and Celgene's going miss her, but benefit for the long term. And I'm not as much of a crier, but I feel the same emotion.

[Operator Instructions] I would like to remind you that this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Patrick Flanigan, Vice President of Investor Relations at Celgene.","Patrick Flanigan","Thank you, Lee, and welcome, everyone, to Celgene Corporation's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. The press release reporting our financial results, in addition to the presentation for today's webcast, can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the corporate website at www.celgene.com.","Joining me in the room today with prepared remarks are Bob Hugin, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jackie Fouse, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Alles, who's our Chief Commercial Officer.","As a reminder, during today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements regarding our financial outlook in addition to regulatory and product development plans. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those forecasted. A description of these risks can be found in our most recent 10-Q on file with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date and we undertake no duty to update or revise them.","Finally, a reconciliation of the adjusted financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available as part of the earnings release.","I would now like to turn the call over to Bob.","Robert J. Hugin","Thank you, Patrick, and thank you everyone for joining us this morning. I appreciate the opportunity to review the results of the third quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year.","The financial results for the quarter were excellent, highlighted by strong growth in revenue and earnings per share. Based on these results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we're increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $4.85 to $4.90 per share, and narrowing our revenue guidance to a range of $5.45 billion to $5.55 billion. Our global teams are energized and focused on achieving these targets. Jackie and Mark will tell you more about our financial and operating performance in a few minutes.","In addition to the exceptional operating performance in the third quarter, we achieved an important milestone to provide significant growth opportunities for our portfolio. We advanced key strategic initiatives to strengthen our leadership position in hematology, to broaden our oncology portfolio, to build our inflammatory disease franchise and to invest in our long-term future by accelerating our early and mid-stage pipeline. The operating results, the milestones achieved and the advancement of our strategic initiatives position us for extraordinary value creation.","To further strengthen our hematology franchise, we're executing on our strategies of maximizing the full potential of REVLIMID, capitalizing on the blockbuster potential of pomalidomide and accelerating the development of new therapies such as oral azacitidine, CC-292, ACE-011 and ACE-536. During the quarter, significant progress was achieved in accelerating important growth opportunities for REVLIMID in new indications and new geographies.","In mantle cell lymphoma, we achieved the requirements of our FDA special protocol assessment and are finalizing our preparations to submit a supplemental new drug application in the United States by year end. Accrual of other lymphoma and leukemia pivotal clinical programs progressed during the quarter. We expect to full year accrue our first pivotal study in chronic lymphocytic leukemia in the next few months.","We continue you to make progress with our regulatory and reimbursement initiatives in China, Korea, Russia, Brazil and Mexico, with updates on these approvals in the coming months. Each new market that we add to our geographic portfolio allows us to further leverage our global infrastructure and contributes to our long-term growth trajectory. We've advanced the review of our MDS deletion 5q application in Europe and continued to monitor the progress of our newly diagnose and maintenance studies designed to expand our myeloma label.","The clinical and regulatory progress achieved this quarter for pomalidomide, our next potential hematology blockbuster, was outstanding. Just this week, we announced data from our Phase III MM-003 trial demonstrating statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in PFS and overall survival in patients with relapsed\/refractory multiple myeloma. Regulatory reviews in both Europe and the United States are moving forward. We also expect data from our Phase III myelofibrosis trial in the first half of next year. We're committed to delivering on the significant potential of this new breakthrough therapy for cancer patients worldwide.","We're accelerating the development of additional innovative high potential programs that broaden our pipeline. We plan to initiate our Phase III trials of oral azacitidine and MDS and AML later this quarter. Our Btk inhibitor, CC-292, is being evaluated in both CLL and lymphomas. We're also advancing ACE-011 and ACE-536 to proof of concept in MDS, beta-thalassemia and diamond-blackfan anemia.","The approval of ABRAXANE for non-small cell lung cancer in the United States and the recently reported positive results in metastatic melanoma significantly strengthen our solid tumor franchise. As reported this morning, the melanoma data will be presented at the Society for Melanoma Research meeting on November 11 in Los Angeles. Additionally, we're eagerly anticipating Phase III data in pancreatic cancer later this quarter. Our teams are committed to capitalizing on these important developments to the ABRAXANE brand.","The breadth and depth of our hematology\/oncology portfolio is further enhanced by the promise of 20 early and mid-stage programs, including new IMiD class compounds, kinase inhibitors, epigenetic modifiers, cellular therapies and other programs developed by our internal research teams and external collaborators. These programs hold exceptional promise for patients and are of important strategic value to Celgene as we broaden our pipeline and build for the future. Our pipeline programs are highlighted on slides included in today's presentation materials.","As we look to the future, there is no program on our portfolio with greater transformational potential than apremilast. Our team is doing a fantastic job of turning the exceptional promise of this program into reality. We have now completed the largest pivotal program in psoriatic arthritis ever undertaken with impressive results. We're now compiling the data sets from 3 positive Phase III trials for FDA submission next quarter.","As the data is disseminated at upcoming medical meetings, beginning at the American College of Rheumatology meeting in less than 3 weeks, I am confident that you will begin to see the potential of this drug to satisfy the enormous market potential for an efficacious and well-tolerated oral therapy in serious inflammatory conditions.","In addition to the psoriatic arthritis data, we recently announced statistically significant positive data in Behcet\u2019s disease, a debilitating inflammatory condition with very limited therapies. We're evaluating opportunities to incorporate this data into our global regulatory filings.","Our development program for apremilast also includes pivotal programs and modern to severe psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis. Data from our 2 Phase III psoriasis trials are expected in the next 3 months. With positive data, we plan to file a supplemental application in the United States late next summer and a combined psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis application in the European Union in the third quarter of next year.","Apremilast has the potential to transform the treatment of patients with these serious chronic diseases and as such has the potential to transform Celgene. There is no higher corporate priority in capturing the significant value of this new franchise.","These accomplishments illustrate the powerful momentum of our business model and the extraordinary potential of our franchises. During the first 3 quarters of this year, we have delivered outstanding results, achieved multiple major milestones and advanced strategic imperatives that positioned Celgene for sustained long-term growth. It's an exciting time at Celgene, with meaningful new opportunities on the near-term horizon.","Jackie and Mark will now provide their perspective on these results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. Let me now turn the call over to Jackie.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. The Celgene business model produced another set of excellent results for the third quarter of 2012 and our financial and commercial metrics are strong across the board.","Year-over-year Q3 revenue growth of 14% was volume driven, and I will speak to that and our individual product performances in a moment. Operating profit grew over 19% in Q3 over Q3 of 2011 and our margin improved to 49.1% for the quarter and 47.8% for the year-to-date period, an increase for the quarter of 140 basis points on a sequential basis and 230 basis points on a year-over-year basis. This margin increased 280 basis points for the year-to-date comparison.","We also added value with financial drivers and thus grew earnings per share by 26%. On the strength of this quarter's performance and given our full year outlook, we are raising our EPS guidance by $0.05.","Total revenues grew 14% in Q3 of this year versus Q3 of 2011 and sequential growth versus Q2 was 4%. International growth was particularly strong and spread across all of our major products and geographies.","As has been the case for several quarters, our revenue growth was largely driven by volumes with price also being a positive contributor this quarter. The favorable price impact in Q3 is mainly due to the timing of price reductions in the EU for those who had a smaller impact this year than last year in the quarter.","The net impact of foreign exchange fluctuations in the quarter was 2 percentage points negative. We hedged the amount of our operating profit exposure in any given currency by executing those hedges against our revenues. For this reason, we have very little to no impact from currency fluctuations in our profits, but can have a minor impact in our revenues because those are typically not 100% hedged.","The combination of revenue growth, reductions in both cost of goods sold and R&D expense as a percentage of revenues and a reduced share count versus 1 year ago allowed us to increase earnings per share by 26%. Our overall P&L dynamic continues to demonstrate the power of our business model, and we saw that again in Q3 as revenues grew by 14%, while operating profit grew by 19% and earnings per share by 26%. To summarize the drivers of earnings per share, $0.20 of the $0.27 year-over-year quarter improvement came from operating income growth, and $0.07 came from the lower share count as a result of our share repurchase program.","This quarter, our products and total revenues grew at the same rates on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. The cost of total revenues include royalty and collaborative revenues. They will be impacted by changes in those line items and we would expect our royalty revenues to come under pressure in the future as generic competition to both Focalin and Ritalin may enter various markets around the world.","Turning to our products and geographic sales breakdown, we see the continued strong performance of REVLIMID globally on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. Overall, year-over-year growth for the quarter was a quite solid 18% and relatively evenly spread across the globe. 2% sequential growth in the U.S. comes on the heels of a very strong 10% sequential growth in Q2 over Q1 and our international business turned in its second 7% sequential growth quarter in a row in Q3.","VIDAZA logged yet another excellent quarter with 15% year-over-year growth and 9% sequential growth. We are particularly pleased with the products performance outside the U.S. with sequential international growth of 15% and 16% year-over-year.","ABRAXANE posted a strong showing outside the U.S. with 29% year-over-year international growth and 13% sequential growth. ABRAXANE revenues in the U.S. declined on a year-over-year basis partly related to the fact that Q3 2011 sales were positively impacted by the generic paclitaxel shortage last year. We feel very good about the future for ABRAXANE as we now have a lung cancer indication in hand and other indications still to come. Mark will talk more about the market dynamics to our key products in just a moment.","During the quarter, we saw 160 basis point year-over-year improvement in our gross margin to almost 95%, mainly due to a favorable variance in our revenue mix. Total R&D expense as a percentage of revenues declined, partly due to the timing of our spend as well as the evolution of our clinical trial portfolio and some leveraging of fixed costs within R&D.","For the quarter, SG&A expense rose as a percentage of revenues, partly related to the timing and amount of expenses associated with patient assistance programs as well as prelaunch spend for ABRAXANE lung. Our effective tax rate remains at 16.5%, a 50 basis point improvement versus last year.","Comparing our year-to-date P&L performance to our full year guidance, we see that growth margins are at the high-end of our guidance range, while R&D as a percentage of revenues is slightly favorable to our guidance and SG&A as a percentage of revenues is somewhat higher than our guidance. This is due to patient assistance expense and also related to the addition of some commercial expense to support the launch of ABRAXANE in lung cancer and the planning for the launch of pomalidomide. Our long-term expectation for a downward annual trend in SG&A as a percentage of revenues remains unchanged. With all of the above, we are on track to hit our 48% operating profit margin target for this year at the high end of our original guidance and our effective tax rate target of 16.5%.","The next slide shows the trends in the key line items of our P&L for the past 5 full years and the year-to-date figures for 2012. Here, we clearly see our business model performing as it should, with the expenses declining in a sustainable way over time as a percentage of revenues and operating margin improving.","Our strong P&L performance is driven -- is driving strong cash flow generation. We generated $1.5 billion of net cash from operations in the first 9 months of this year and we have repurchased $1.5 billion of our own shares in those 9 months. Our balance sheet is strong and we leveraged that's strength to issue $1.5 billion of 5- and 10-year bonds during Q3, thus securing long-term financing at a very attractive cost and reinforcing our financial flexibility.","The trends on our return on invested capital remains on a positive trajectory as our business model performs well and as we manage our asset base and capital structure with a view to optimizing returns over time.","Regarding our guidance, on the strength of our Q3 performance and given our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our earnings per share guidance about $0.05 to a range of $4.85 to $4.90, up from the previous range of $4.80 and $4.85. We are narrowing our revenue guidance range given that only one quarter remains in the year, while maintaining the midpoint at $5.5 billion. We are also narrowing our REVLIMID revenue guidance by maintaining the lower end of the range and reducing the upper end of the range, in line with comments we have made previously regarding our full year expectations for the product.","To summarize, our revenues continue to be volume driven and our operating profit growth continues to outpace revenue growth as we leverage our global business model. We are performing well across all of our operational, commercial and financial metrics in doing so while we invest for the long-term health and growth of our business. We saw success on a number of key milestones during the past quarter and we'll see results on several others over the coming quarters as we move towards a strong finish to 2012 and an exciting start to 2013.","Thank you and I will now turn the call over to Mark, who will elaborate more in our commercial dynamics and the new developments we expect to see in our product portfolio.","Mark J. Alles","Thanks very much, Jackie, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter net product sales were strong. Our global business experienced a relatively typical impact of the summer months and some newer competitive challenges, but successfully produced record quarterly sales of REVLIMID and VIDAZA.","For ABRAXANE, we expect the recent FDA approval for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer and emerging Phase III data in metastatic melanoma to significantly accelerate momentum. Our cancer portfolio is extremely well positioned for continued sales growth. Significant opportunities to increase length of treatment duration, increase overall market share and add new market approvals remain key drivers of short and longer-term brand performance. New data, new indications and new products are also beginning to add important commercial opportunities for growth.","Global third quarter REVLIMID sales were $970 million, representing 4% sequentially -- sequential quarter growth and 18% year-on-year growth. Following a very strong second quarter, REVLIMID sales in the United States grew 2% quarter-on-quarter to $547 million. Year-on-year sales were up 17%. Quarterly, overall market share trends continue to be 50% to 55%, treatment duration improved and new patient starts grew 3% quarter-on-quarter.","The recent market introductions of subcutaneous bortezomib and carfilzomib are creating new considerations for how hematologists will treat multiple myeloma. Our research reports that the market use of subQ bortezomib is rapidly replacing intravenous bortezomib, including a combination used with REVLIMID. Carfilzomib was launched late in the quarter, and early market share data suggests single agent use as third or fourth line treatment and some combination used with REVLIMID in earlier lines of therapy.","In the market and in clinical research, REVLIMID continues to be the foundation of treatment for patients with multiple myeloma. This bodes very well for the product's long-term growth trajectory, both in the U.S. and globally. International REVLIMID sales were excellent. Sales were $423 million, an increase of 7% quarter-on-quarter and 20% year-on-year.","Broader demand in Latin America, Australia, Germany, Canada and the United Kingdom and very good results in our other core markets combined to produce record international REVLIMID sales. We are moving closer to opening up new emerging markets for REVLIMID. We expect public reimbursement in South Korea by year end. We anticipate regulatory approval in China very late this year or in early 2013, and we expect reimbursement in Russia and approval in Brazil next year.","New market expansion is a key growth driver, expanding the REVLIMID label is another. Let me share my perspective on our ongoing efforts to broaden the approved indications for REVLIMID. First, long-term follow-up continues for REVLIMID efficacy and safety in the newly diagnosed multiple myeloma trials MM-015, IFM-0502 and CALGB 100104. Recall that in each Phase III study, treatment with REVLIMID led a highly statistically significant improvements in progression-free survival.","While there is broad clinical and regulatory agreement about the overwhelming efficacy and in clinical benefit represented in these studies, regulatory concerns that the second primer malignancies may have a negative impact on overall survival trends require more mature survival data. These analyses are event-driven. Based on our current projections, we expect to be able to initiate discussions with European and other regulatory agencies with mature data from MM-015 during the first half of 2013 and with mature data from the IFM and CALGB studies during 2014.","On a separate and equally important note for newly diagnosed myeloma, we expect data from our international Phase III study, MM-020, to be available during the first quarter of 2013. The timing and comprehensive data from MM-020, MM-015, IFM and CALGB studies should provide a range of options for us to achieve global regulatory approvals for REVLIMID in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.","Second, in Europe, regulatory review of the REVLIMID marketing application for low-risk, transfusion-dependent deletion 5q MDS is ongoing, with an opinion from CHMP expected during the first half of 2013.","Third, given the strong efficacy and safety results of MCL-001, the REVLIMID special protocol assessment study in relapse or refractory mantle cell lymphoma, we plan to submit a supplemental new drug application to FDA by the end of this year. If approved, this opportunity would become the first in a series of lymphoma indications we hope to achieve over the next several years.","Fourth, the development of REVLIMID as a single agent in novel combinations for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a high priority. Our program is on track. The pivotal Phase III study CLL 008, comparing REVLIMID to chlorambucil as first-line therapy, is projected to complete accrual by early next year and we expect updated and new clinical data to be featured at this year's American Society of Hematology meeting.","Celgene has established our immunomodulatory drugs, REVLIMID and THALOMID, as distinct therapies for the treatment of multiple myeloma. From newly diagnosed patients with smoldering disease to the most heavily pretreated patients, our franchise products have helped and continue to help hundreds of thousands of patients. The constant and most critical need is to discover and develop and bring to market new therapies for those patients who have exhausted all existing treatments. This need is the focus for the development of pomalidomide.","As you know, we announced that the international pomalidomide Phase III study, MM-003, has demonstrated significant progression-free and overall survival advantages for heavily pretreated patients. We will provide these promising results to European and U.S. regulatory agencies in support of their ongoing regulatory reviews. It is our understanding that the MM-003 study investigators will submit an abstract to this year's ASH to be considered as a late-breaking presentation. Clinical follow-up on our fully enrolled Phase III study of pomalidomide in myelofibrosis continues with results expected in the first half of 2013.","In the third quarter, Celgene made significant progress advancing our strategies to expand strong global leadership position in the treatment of patients with MDS. Across all global markets, VIDAZA continued to gain share in intermediate-2 and high-risk disease. Global third quarter sales were excellent, a record $220 million, up 9% quarter-on-quarter and 15% year-on-year. In the United States, VIDAZA share of the hypomethylator market is steady and above 8%. Sales grew 1% quarter-on-quarter and were up 13% year-on-year. International sales grew strongly, led by Australia, France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom. VIDAZA sales increased 15% quarter-on-quarter and 16% year-on-year. We also made progress in the quarter to strengthen the VIDAZA label. We completed patient enrollment in the Phase III registration study in acute myeloid leukemia. Results are expected within 1 year and, if successful, should support label expansion to include all patients with AML.","Our clinical and regulatory teams have made excellent progress advancing CC-486 oral azacitidine to the point where we plan to initiate 2 special protocol assessment designated Phase III studies by the end of this year. One study will test CC-486 in the subset of lower-risk MDS and the other Phase III study will test CC-486 as maintenance therapy in AML. Beyond MDS and AML, investigators in Celgene have developed and are pursuing clinical strategies with CC-486 to enhance the antitumor activity of traditional chemotherapies for lung cancer and pancreatic cancer. We are early in this investigation, but we have seen dramatic results in some patients.","During the third quarter, the clinical and commercial potential of ABRAXANE came into sharper focus. Our strategy to optimize ABRAXANE in traditional taxane markets like breast cancer and lung cancer was advanced by the October 2012 FDA approval of ABRAXANE plus carboplatin for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Important information about the differentiated response rates by histologic subset is included in the improved labeling. This marketing approval provides an immediate and significant opportunity to expand the benefits of ABRAXANE to completely new patient segments. Please recall that ABRAXANE is now FDA approved in breast cancer and lung cancer based on superior Phase III direct comparisons with paclitaxel.","Our strategy to develop ABRAXANE in solid tumor cancers where very few treatment options exist and where taxanes have demonstrated limited benefit was at least partially validated by the positive Phase III results of the ABRAXANE CA-33 metastatic melanoma study. In this study, 529 patients who had not been treated with prior cytotoxic chemotherapy for metastatic melanoma were randomized to be treated with weekly ABRAXANE or standard dacarbazine. The primary end point is progression-free survival with key secondary end points, including overall survival.","ABRAXANE met the primary end point of this study by demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival with a median PFS of 4.8 months versus 2.5 months for dacarbazine. The interim analysis for the key secondary end point of overall survival shows a meaningful trend in favor of ABRAXANE with a median overall survival of 12.8 months versus 10.7 months. The overall safety profile is comparable with other ABRAXANE Phase III studies.","Cross-study comparisons have limited value, but the median PFS and overall survival demonstrated by ABRAXANE in this unselected group of patients with advanced melanoma compares very favorably to the Phase III results of the B-Raf inhibitor, vemurafenib, and the results of the combination of ipilimumab plus dacarbazine. Full results of the CA-33 study, including efficacy analyses based on B-Raf status, will be presented on November 11 at the Society for Melanoma Research meeting. We are accelerating regulatory discussions that could expand the global ABRAXANE opportunity to include melanoma.","Unresectable pancreatic cancer is a disease with decades of failed drug development and modest gains in patient benefits. Extending the overall survival is the major goal of therapy. It is this background that led to the development of ABRAXANE in combination with gemcitabine for patients with pancreatic cancer. As Bob noted, we expect overall survival results from our pivotal Phase III study before the end of this year.","The 2012 American Society of Hematology meeting will be held from December 7 through December 11 in the great city of Atlanta. We are currently aware of more than 140 abstracts reporting on the results of our in-line and development stage products across virtually every hematological malignancy. Of note, there are more than 30 REVLIMID abstracts in NHL and CLL, 20 pomalidomide multiple myeloma abstracts and 19 azacitidine AML or MDS abstracts. From this substantial amount of meaningful clinical information, there are 6 abstracts I would like to highlight now.","First, the benefit of REVLIMID in the second line treatment of multiple myeloma after patients have been treated with REVLIMID maintenance therapy is an important regulatory end market question. Important follow-up data from MM-015 will be presented that demonstrates no diminution of REVLIMID benefit or a new safety consideration for patients who are treated with REVLIMID following progression after the first line treatment regimen in MM-015.","Second, the MCL-001 or emerged study abstract has been selected for oral presentation. Recall that these data are the basis for our year end REVLIMID sNDA submission.","Third, in CLL and NHL, the clinical synergy of REVLIMID in combination with the approved therapeutic antibodies, ofatumumab or rituximab, will be featured. In relapsed or refractory CLL, the combination of REVLIMID with ofatumumab demonstrates high response rates, including in patients with high-risk cytogenetics. In a randomized Phase II study, significant benefit has been demonstrated from the use of REVLIMID or the combination of REVLIMID plus Rituxan as maintenance therapy for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or at high risk for relapse.","Fourth, we hope that the pomalidomide MM-003 study results will be presented during ASH, but we know that the Phase I study combined pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone with bortezomib will be in oral presentation.","Lastly, an oral presentation of the safety and efficacy of CC-486 in the treatment of lower-risk MDS should provide strong rationale for patients to enroll in our 2 pivotal Phase III studies. ASH is always a pivotal cancer conference for Celgene. We think this year's meeting may be one of the more compelling and informative meetings for our brand and for our scientific platforms.","Our third quarter net product sales were excellent. Total sales grew 4% quarter-on-quarter to $1,390,000,000 and 14% year-on-year. REVLIMID sales are approaching $1 billion per quarter, with multiple existing and future catalysts for robust growth.","We are just beginning to realize the impact of the many clinical and regulatory milestones achieved in the quarter. We look to the momentum that these and others will create for us through the end of this year, all of next year and beyond.","Thank you for your time this morning and I will turn the call back to Bob.","Robert J. Hugin","Thank you, Mark, and thank you, Jackie. It was an extraordinary quarter, during which the Celgene team around the world produced excellent results and made substantial progress on key strategic initiatives, positioning us for sustained long-term growth and exceptional value creation.","I want to thank all of my colleagues for their dedication and commitment to making a meaningful difference in the lives of patients in need around the world.","Thank you for joining us this morning. Operator, would you please now open the call to questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I had one for you on MM-020. What's the percent of events you'll hit that have data first quarter of next year? And probably, the more important one is given the focus on overall survival now from the maintenance trials, why not just wait for this trial to mature a little bit more?","Mark J. Alles","Geoff, it's Mark. We expect the PFS analysis to be on 70% events and the, of course, interim overall survival would accompany that PFS analysis.","Operator","The next question in queue comes from the line of Geoff Porges with Bernstein Research.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","My question and -- lots of moving parts here, but perhaps ABRAXANE -- just a couple of questions. Jackie, could you remind us of what ABRAXANE component there is to the $8 billion in 2015? And then given what you're seeing, what's your conviction about the achievability of that? Or do you think that you can actually do better now with some of the data points that you're seeing in the approval in lung cancer?","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","Geoff, thanks for the question. So the range that we have for ABRAXANE is a 2015 target, is $1 billion to $1.25 billion for all indications. And I will hand the question over to Mark in just a second. But I think with the lung cancer approval, with some of the other things that we see, as they continue to develop, we're increasingly confident in our ability to deliver on those targets by 2015. So let me turn that over to Mark, maybe...","Mark J. Alles","Yes. Now thanks for the question. ABRAXANE is becoming a product with multiple differentiated segments in the solid tumor market for progress against the revenue target, the sales target that Jackie just spoke to. So the melanoma data, we certainly see as upside in the short term because those results, we think, are quite compelling. Of course, we will follow-up with regulatory agencies quickly to understand what's the market label potential. But with pancreas coming with the lung cancer approval, we expect to be able to, on a composite basis, with a lot of those different opportunities, to be able to produce the sales number that Jackie spoke to.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Marshall Urist with Morgan Stanley.","Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So I want to touch on REVLIMID in the front line in Europe. We've all obviously gotten to take a look at the regulators, in-depth thoughts in the EPAR. So it will be helpful, I think, for you guys to talk about your strategy kind of in light of the kind of many layers that's in the EPAR in terms of how they're thinking about the data, number 1. Number 2 is when are we going to get an updated look at the overall survival trends from the 3 front-line studies? Are we going to get that at ASH? Or is that some time next year? And then just a little bit more on kind of what's driving the 2014 timeline for post-transplant maintenance. Do you think you're going to be over sort of 50% of events in those studies by that point?","Robert J. Hugin","Thank you for that. I think it was an 8-part question, but I'm not sure. This is Mark. Let me just remind you what I said in my prepared remarks. So at ASH, we will see a very important follow-up set of data on MM-015 that addresses directly one of the regulatory concerns. And that is if patients who progress after REVLIMID maintenance were to receive REVLIMID or any other therapeutic agents for myeloma, would there be inherent resistance in that setting. We think that abstract addresses the issue very nicely, so that's the first that we'll follow-up. When we think about the maturity of 015, the CALGB and IFM studies, we're now projecting, as I stated, that we'll see more mature survival trends and a follow-up for SPMs for MM-015 during the first half of '13. But given the event rate, the projection for IFM in CALGB is -- has moved to 2014. A little bit of follow-up on MM-020, if I might, I apologize if I didn't address the longer-term follow-up component of that study. Remember that the study is blinded, and in fact, it would be up to the independent monitoring committee to recommend at the interim for PFS, whether or not we should stay in a period where follow-up for survival would be important. So that's really not a consideration that we would take independently, but would consider on advice from the independent monitoring committee. So I think the composite for European expansion in Europe and around the world is intermediate timing in terms of follow-up. But starting at ASH, important data that informs the market about REVLIMID at second line after maintenance therapy first line, and then follow-up on 015, MM-020, CALGB and IFM over a period of months.","Operator","Our next phone question comes the line of Rachel McMinn with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a follow-up on that, Mark, I wanted to better understand. In your prepared remarks, you did say that you'd have a range of options for European approval. But I guess my understanding was previously, you didn't think MM-020 really kind of played into that. So can you kind of walk through, I guess, the scenarios of what could happen? So if 015 reached the threshold, do you file on that, but then 020, you'd let it mature for longer? I'm just trying to understand the different kind of branches of the tree of how European -- your filing strategy would shift based on various data points.","Mark J. Alles","Well, thank for the question. Bob and Jackie may also have some commentary. But it really is a rich set of data, a comprehensive set of data that will come together. And I really believe that we have opportunities to combine data sets based on the timing and maturity of those data sets for potentially a broad newly diagnosed myeloma label. But also as the data is available to us and based on the nature of the data, we can take a strategy of sequential submissions and label expansion for either a transfer in eligible maintenance post-transplant, et cetera. So I think we're in a position where the data will give us many opportunities and a range of opportunities to decide how, when and what type of regulatory submissions we'll make.","Robert J. Hugin","And there isn't any need for us to link or not link. It really depends on the timing of the data and what's in the best interest to get the broader label as soon as possible. But there is no requirement for us to hold for any one study or another. They're -- they all would stand on their own our ability to submit that with a strategy that we think is best for us and for patients.","Operator","Our next phone question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with Wells Fargo Securities.","Brian Corey Abrahams - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","My question is a question on ABRAXANE for pancreatic cancer. Wondering what's your view as to the bar for overall survival improvements relative to gemcitabine that you think would be prestigious by clinicians is clinically meaningful? Do you think the survival, meaning overall survival, will need to be as high as what we've seen historically for folfirinox or perhaps lesser would be acceptable because of the potential side effect differences?","Mark J. Alles","Now, thank you for the question, Brian. Yes, I'm not going to speculate for the market in terms of what's meaningful. What is very obvious is that even and in quote of the folfirinox data, no matter what, this patient population around the world needs desperately new treatments and therapeutic options to help improve and extend their life. So we believe a positive outcome in our study that leads to regulatory approval will lead to a very meaningful market opportunity simply on the basis of the desperate need of the patients. We will do our best, of course, once we know the data to make sure ABRAXANE gemcitabine could become the global standard of care.","Operator","Our next question comes the line of Yaron Werber with Citigroup.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So I just wanted to follow-up and my apologies for belaboring this but I think it's important. So are you saying that you're expecting data from 020 in Q1? And so are you sort of hinting that you think that you're going to be hitting the interim based on 70% of the events? Or is -- or you're just saying you're going to have a look at that point? And then secondly, is there any way you can tell us what's the -- how many events are you guys expecting in the study? What's the final event count that you're looking for on the final analysis?","Mark J. Alles","So Yaron, this is Mark. So the -- we are saying that we should have data in Q1. I think what I've said before is important. There are a number of considerations in these lines that study about the number of events for PFS and\/or for OS because it is event driven that would create a scenario for us to understand data in Q1. Exactly how that will play out is unknown, but our projection put data that would inform Celgene in Q1 of 2013.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","With -- just to be clear, with 70% of the PFS events having occurred.","Operator","The next phone question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Guess what I'm going to ask about. First line REVLIMID in Europe. The one thing that I wonder about, what gives, Mark -- perhaps what gives you so much evident -- sorry, conviction or confidence that you don't need a statistically significant overall survival benefit than instead you just need, I guess, for the hazard ratio to be below 1?","Mark J. Alles","Thanks for the question. Again, let's remind ourselves. These studies we're discussing 015 CALGB IFM unblinded early against a robust, well-regarded end point of progression-free survival. The difference is meaningful and clinically beneficial. That is a strong agreement across all constituencies so far. This idea that we need overall survival in the context of what is the impact or not of second primary malignancies is an open question that requires mature data we've discussed. But we are very confident because we have a very robust result against the primary end point of these studies and we have trends, we believe, that will support that SPMs do not have a deleterious effect on the overall survival trends. Of course, mature data will tell us and the regulators if that's the case.","Operator","Next question comes from Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Maybe I'll move on to a different topic. Just on the apremilast, Mark, and the data we're going to see in psoriatic arthritis at ACR. I'm wondering if you think in terms of a competitive profile you need to be as good on a safety and efficacy standpoint anti-TNS in order to compete on convenience.","Robert J. Hugin","Yes, well, thanks for the question. It's Bob. I think it is important for people who want to follow this to come to ACR because we will have the opportunity to really talk about the efficacy profile, what we're seeing in psoriatic arthritis and the safety profile and different subsets in patient populations and to really understand the competitive positioning of this compound. We believe we're going to have a big, big opportunity here to have a highly efficacious compound oral in front of biologics. But that's what you're going to see as the data rolls out, and that strategy become clear at ACR in just the next few weeks. So I think you'll begin to see more data there, then you'll have to grow your own conclusion about that. But we're very confident that we're going to have a big opportunity here.","Operator","Next question comes in the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Actually, a question on ABRAXANE and melanoma. So we have the data presented, at least in the press release. Are you committed to filing this data? And given the other products that are approved in melanoma today now, what would you think are the pros and cons of -- that the regulatory agencies are going to think about, whether or not to accept your filing and whether or not to approve it without a survival benefit yet?","Mark J. Alles","Now thanks for the question. We have a few very near-term regulatory meetings that I think will give us more information that would help address some of your question. I think that from a, again, a progression-free survival end point and what we see as an interim analysis for overall survival, we think that trend, the comparability of what we see across these studies, again, selected patients in the B-Raf mutated group with vemurafinib, then looking at the combination of ipilimumab with dacarbazine, we think that ABRAXANE joins these drugs in showing regulatory agencies and clinicians that dacarbazine really has become a drug that is really limited in its use for patients with melanoma. So I think the overall picture is one of confidence. We need to do some follow-up to see if the current overall survival trend improves. But we will engage regulatory agencies in the near-term and we remain committed to that and confident that it will be a market-shaping event for us.","Robert J. Hugin","And as we get more clarity on those discussions at upcoming events, we'll provide that clarity as we receive it.","Operator","Next question in queue is Matt Roden with UBS.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","With respect to pomalidomide, can you talk about how the new PFS data from MM-003 will be handled in the context of your ongoing reviews? It seems like you get -- you might be able to submit this as an amendment to the U.S. filing, but would have to wait to file this with EU until after action is taken? And then lastly, do you think it would impact the probability of approvals in either jurisdiction -- either geography?","Mark J. Alles","So let me start with the point about the data. It clearly strengthens the value proposition for pomalidomide right out of the gate. We met and exceeded at the overall survival interim the boundary for superiority. So that can give you some sense about how significant the survival advantage is. In addition, the progression-free survival end point is quite meaningful. And as you will see, if presented at ASH, we see consistency in the type of PFS from 02 to the data that now are in the 03 study. So the composite for regulatory agencies is that these applications are in front of CHMP and FDA, and we are in the middle of providing the data to these regulatory agencies as they ask for it and per the requirements of ongoing regulatory notification. So certainly, we think that this is a slight positive to major positive. But in terms of approvability, that really is part of the regulatory process. We certainly don't think it's a negative.","Operator","Next question comes from Chris Raymond with Robert Baird.","Christopher J. Raymond - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I was just kind of struck by some of your commentary on the competitive dynamic in -- with respect to REVLIMID in the addition of the subQ Velcade label. I think you mentioned it as a new consideration as is carfilzomib. Can you talk a little bit more, maybe give us some more color on that dynamic? Are you seeing, with the onset of the subQ label, more combination use? Or are you seeing perhaps more decisions to use Velcade instead of REVLIMID? And then also, is there a -- you mentioned some combination use of carfilzomib upfront or earlier lines of therapy. Can you put a little bit more brackets around that? Exactly how pervasive is that?","Mark J. Alles","Thanks for the question, Chris. It's Mark. So the market dynamics are interesting in that we see a bit of choppiness quarter-to-quarter. But there's no question that REVLIMID is maintaining that strong steady share in the range I quoted. Remember that the RBD regimen now has been in the market for, I want to say, 3 maybe even 4 years. And there are new data for the combination of REV, carfilzomib, dexamethasone that have been presented at a number of meetings over the past year. So I think it's quite natural that physicians would want to swap out the proteasome inhibitor of carfilzomib for bortezomib and we see that happening. But at an aggregate basis, this is a very, very tiny percentage of the overall market dynamic. I would remind you as well, on a go-forward basis, that the full clinical development program for carfilzomib requires approval through the combination trial with REV\/Dex, the so-called Aspire trial. So that dynamic favors, we think, more use of REVLIMID, when or if those data are positive. So I think what we were trying to do is recognize within the short-term, Velcade is a slightly different product because of the subQ administration, and that is really a shift in the use of Velcade. But REVLIMID is advantaged by being the combination therapy for these drugs now and in the future.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Mara Goldstein with Canter Fitzgerald.","Mara Goldstein - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","My question actually relates to sales force resource allocation and expansion. And I guess, specifically, are you currently adding sales or estimates? So where will they be allocated? And I'm thinking in particular about promotional activities for solid tumor indications. And as for apremilast and the field sales force, is the plan to utilize existing labs versus adding to a new field sales force?","Mark J. Alles","Thanks. It's Mark. Thanks for the question. In fact, we are realigning and enhancing our U.S. hematology sales force to more fully focus on the multiple myeloma market, in particular, because of the upcoming launch of pomalidomide. So strengthening our share voice in the market and then having the diversity of the myeloma portfolio that now where we expect will include pomalidomide shortly. On the solid tumor side, we have good capacity to launch the lung cancer approval with the existing team. What we may decide to do based on the new melanoma data, and perhaps what we would hope is the readout on the pancreatic study, is we may decide to increase from our current base. But right now, we're evaluating that strategy.","Robert J. Hugin","And then specifically, our hematology\/oncology commercial organizations are extremely expert, experienced and focused to the areas of, again, the areas where we're focused, and that any type of buildout commercially which we'll about in the coming months in terms of our strategy for taking advantage of apremilast, will be the same way, a very experienced, expert, focused group separate from hematology\/oncology.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Thomas Wei with Jefferies.","Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I had a question on MM-020. Just in relation to second primary malignancies, should we have the expectation that there would actually be a lower rate of SPMs in the REV\/Dex arm relative to MPTs and REV in that arm is not being given with melphalan, whereas THAL is being given with melphalan. And then just a clarification on the potential for the DSMP to recommend continued follow-up for overall survival when you get to that interim in the first quarter of 2013. What exactly does that mean about the disclosure of the details around the PFS overall survival and SPM data?","Mark J. Alles","Tom, this is Mark. Thanks for the question. Bob or Jackie might want to jump in as well because of the flavor of your question. So with respect to second primary malignancy, we don't, of course, have any specific information because MM-020 remains blinded. But because melphalan is not part of 2 of the arms of the study, and we have such global pharmacode vigilance experience with REVLIMID and dexamethasone in the first, second and even maintenance lines of therapy, it would be our expectation that REV\/Dex would have a lower rate of SPMs, a lower incidence rate of SPMs, particularly AML, NDS as a consequence of melphalan exposure, but we will see. In terms of disclosure, I don't want to speak to that directly. But Jackie, would you want to comment?","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","Yes, Thomas, I mean, I think we'll have to see what the timing on that data is and there would be a couple of opportunities to think about. We, as a company, will have to consider whether or not we do some kind of headline disclosure. But you also might want to keep in mind that I believe the International Myeloma Workshop meeting is in May. I don't remember exactly the date. But that certainly is a medical meeting that would provide a forum for potential more detailed discussions of that data, assuming that it's available. And maybe just to clarify one point on that, back to a question that was asked, I believe that at the 70% PFS event, right, that would put you at the number of events at around 1,000.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Joel Sendek with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Joel D. Sendek - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I have a question on apremilast. In the impact on the operating margins, we've seen the operating margin increase a lot over the last couple of years. If apremilast is as good as or is as strong as you all anticipate, will the impact be positive or negative? And then could you also share with us the contribution of apremilast to your 2015 guidance?","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","Joel, it's Jackie. I'll take that one. So this is a great time for Celgene for a lot of reasons. But with respect to the P&L dynamic and given the amount of leverage that we have in the business model on the existing business, it bodes very well for our ability to make the right long-term decisions about go-to market strategy for apremilast, where we think that based on what we see and as you have more visibility to the data, you will be able to form a better opinion about this as well. The potential for having a business model with a very targeted commercial group that, in terms of its general characteristics and potential for margin generation, could look a lot like the hematology\/oncology model that we have today. And then from a platform with multiple indications possible for the product, that would generate quite strong top line growth. So we will, as Bob mentioned, discuss more of the specifics of the go-to market strategy for apremilast and you'll have data to be able to think about those 2 things together. But we could be in a position of moving ahead with that platform and use some of the leverage generated by the existing business and P&L to make those investments, but still be able to deliver leverage in the overall Celgene business on a go-forward basis. And then once you got full year revenues from apremilast, you get very much into another round of extremely strong leverage generation and very, very strong top line growth. So that's the way that you should be thinking about this. When we think about the 2015 targets, as we've said before, in that $8 billion to $9 billion revenue range we have, $6 billion to $6.5 billion is our assumption for hematology, $1 billion to $1.25 billion for ABRAXANE, and then the balance in other, which actually could include some indications like melanoma for ABRAXANE, that was not in our original range. But apremilast will be the biggest part of that, and if you just back into that number, it's $0.3 billion to $1 billion, I think it's the range that you get for that other category in 2015.","Operator","Next question comes from John Sonnier with William Blair.","John S. Sonnier - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I'm just curious with all of the discussion about the long-term risk reward profile of REVLIMID. You guys haven't talked much lately about the internal Celgene database. I think a couple of years ago, when this discussion was hot and heavy, you'd said that 177,000 patients have been mined at that time, and the SPMs, I think, at that time, was only 0.4% and significantly lower among the 130,000 front-line patients. Does that still look the same? Any plans to update that? Will that be part of the filing in Europe when you resubmit?","Mark J. Alles","And I appreciate the question. We do have a robust pharmacovigilance as part of our risk management programs around the world. And you're right, it's been a while since we commented on it, in part because even with the denominator of patients growing dramatically, these rates of observations are essentially the same. We've seen nothing new, different in our pharmacovigilance, our internal database. And of course, we provide these updates to regulators every single quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Birchenough with BMO Capital.","Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So just following up on a couple of prior points. In terms of positioning of apremilast in front of anti-TNS, do you think you need radiographic response data and will we get sharp score data at the ACR meeting? And then on what to expect around the 015 update that we'll get early next year, what we've seen typically, when you're looking to exclude some risk as you look at the upper bound of the confidence intervals, and it would seem that EMA is saying they want to see that below 1. So if you're looking at an upper bound confidence interval below 1, isn't that statistically significant? And if instead you're talking about trends, aren't you really talking about upper bound risk that goes above 1 and why would that be acceptable? I'm just try to understand that better.","Mark J. Alles","Now thanks for the question. Bob, did you want to [indiscernible]","Robert J. Hugin","[indiscernible]","Mark J. Alles","Okay. Now thanks for the question. So the question about overall survival is significant with respect to confidence intervals. I think it's an important perspective. What we are unclear about is in the end, of course, with the trends and with analyses where SPMs are included for overall survival, will the regulators ultimately require an overall survival advantage to formally and finally decide on benefit risk? It's our impression from everything we know that the PFS advantage, the event-free survival analyses and then trends with hazard ratios that are below 1 for these 3 studies would be acceptable to regulators. In the end, this technical question is going to require review and specific regulatory interpretation of our resubmitted dossier. The apremilast question?","Robert J. Hugin","And the apremilast, we'll have more discussion of the data that the ACR meeting. But generally, radiographic data is not part of a PSA program, but it is part of the ankylosing spondylitis data that we're accruing now.","Operator","Our final question for today will come from the line of Ian Somaiya with Piper Jaffray.","M. Ian Somaiya - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I had a question for you, Mark, on CLL and [indiscernible] broadly speaking. Obviously, those 2 programs are advancing fairly quickly. Can you give us a sense of what the current off cycle sales are for REVLIMID in those indications? And what do you think the opportunity is? Is it like REVLIMID in myeloma, is it less? What are some of the considerations.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","It is Jackie, and I'll turn it over to Mark. But just, when you take the total numbers of patients in the -- all of the non-Hodgkin's indications and CLL, you get a total patient pool that's about 2.5x the number of patients in myeloma. So when you think about the opportunity, that's maybe the place to start. And then you can run through the different non-Hodgkin's subsets of patients and the timing on approvals that we expect and you can see that in our top line charts for REVLIMID to layer that in from a timing standpoint. But it is more than 2.5x the total number of patients versus the myeloma pool. With respect to the other part of the question, I'll let Mark answer that.","Mark J. Alles","Yes. Now, Ian, thanks for the question. So we're excited about the acceleration of our clinical programs. We mentioned CLL 008. We also have the CLL 002 study ongoing, that's the maintenance trial. In lymphoma, we have a number of strategies, starting with the mental cell opportunity that is near term, but we're making good progress with the remark study and other strategies in combinations with rituximab. So I think using the number that Jackie spoke to, we, still, on the longer term, see the REVLIMID opportunity in those markets, CLL, NHL, to be multibillion. In the current book of business that we have, this has been the trend for a while. There is very little use of REVLIMID in the setting of relapsed\/refractory CLL or NHL. We do have, in the U.S., compendia listing for REVLIMID in lymphoma. And based on, we think, more data, the compendia for CLL would likely get updated in, let's say, the next year or so. So I think this opportunity that you asked about remains robust. We have great data now and it will grow from here. And we're very committed to making REVLIMID a standard in various settings for CLL and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse","With that, thank you, everybody. I think we've run out of time. So thanks, this morning, for being on the call with us, and we look forward to seeing you at upcoming events that we will host for investors at ACR for the first time this year. We're very excited about that. And also we're looking forward to an extremely exciting ASH meeting in December. So we will see you soon. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you, presenters.

I would like to remind you this call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Flanigan, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations at Celgene.","Patrick E. Flanigan III - Celgene Corp.","Thanks, Crystal, and welcome, everyone, to our First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. The press release reporting our financial results in addition to the presentation for today's webcast can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the corporate website at www.celgene.com.","Joining me in the room today with prepared remarks are Mark Alles, our Chief Executive Officer; Peter Kellogg, our Chief Financial Officer; Terrie Curran, Global Head of our Inflammation & Immunology franchise; Jay Backstrom, our Chief Medical Officer; and the Global Head of our Hematology & Oncology franchise, Nadim Ahmed. Also available for the Q&A portion of the call are Jonathan Biller, who heads up our Tax and Treasury group; and Rupert Vessey, Global Head of our Research and Early Development Group.","As a reminder, during today's call we will be making forward-looking statements regarding our financial outlook in addition to regulatory and product development plans. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those forecasted. A description of these risks can be found in our most recent 10-K on file with the SEC.","These statements speak only as of today's date, and we undertake no duty to update or revise them. Reconciliation of the adjusted financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available as part of the earnings release.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mark.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Thanks, Patrick. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We appreciate the opportunity to review our excellent first quarter results, the meaningful progress our teams have made advancing key research and development programs, and to provide a detailed update on the ozanimod NDA for relapsing multiple sclerosis.","Let me start the call by offering my perspective on the state of Celgene. Operating excellence has long been the foundation for us to build our company into a global leader in hematology, oncology, and major inflammatory markets. It has also been the bedrock for confidence, credibility, and the key to creating value for all stakeholders.","Our commitment to building a preeminent biopharmaceutical company has never been greater. In Q1, management took the time to evaluate and understand what we need to do better to achieve this long standing goal. We have changed people and processes, embedded key learnings, and are on track to deliver on the promise and potential this year and well beyond.","We are entering a critical period for our mid and late stage pipeline. Over the next 12 to 18 months, we expect meaningful value inflection points coming from multiple pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones.","During their prepared remarks, Nadim and Terrie will highlight many of these catalysts, and Dr. Backstrom will describe the significant regulatory progress we have made to define the path forward for ozanimod.","As announced in our earnings press release, we now expect to both resubmit the NDA and to submit the MAA for ozanimod in relapsing multiple sclerosis during the first quarter of 2019.","Looking past ozanimod, our first quarter 2018 financial results and progress building Celgene were exceptional. This strong start to the year continues, leading us to raise our 2018 revenue guidance to the higher end of the previous range, approximately $14.8 billion, and positions us to exceed the previous adjusted EPS range of $8.70 to $8.90 prior to accounting for the impact of the Juno acquisition.","I'd like to thank the Celgene and Juno teams for coming together so well following our Q1 acquisition of this immunotherapy pioneer. With the continued outstanding progress we're making on JCAR017 in lymphoma and with our partner bluebird bio on the development of bb2121 in myeloma, Celgene is now very well positioned to become a leader in the field of cellular immunotherapy.","Additionally, our global therapeutic and commercial leadership in myeloid diseases was expanded by the early first quarter acquisition of fedratinib, a highly selective JAK2 inhibitor for the treatment of myelofibrosis. We expect to submit the NDA for this important new therapy later this year.","Beginning in 2019, these promising developmental stage hematology products have the potential to incrementally add top line sales. Just the expected launches of fedratinib and JCAR017 in 2019 will enable us to absorb the financial impact caused by the delay in the expected launch of ozanimod. Based on our most current forecasts, we are again reaffirming our 2020 outlook, revenue of $19 billion to $20 billion and adjusted diluted EPS of greater than $12.50.","Finally, we are continually evaluating opportunities to strengthen our organization to fully capitalize on our next wave of innovation. Key examples include the recently announced changes to our Board of Directors, adding three new directors with expertise in areas critical to our future success. In early April, we changed our executive management structure to enhance communication, accountability, and focus on building Celgene for long term success.","In areas of increasing complexity and scale, we are adding highly experienced executives to improve strategic thinking and operating excellence. At the start of this week, we announced the appointment of our new Senior Vice President for Global Regulatory Affairs, Dr. Jennifer Dudinak, reporting to our Chief Medical Officer Jay Backstrom. And Jennifer has been added to our Global Executive Committee. We plan to continue to update you on new executive appointments as they happen.","Our very good start to the year, multiple near term catalysts, continued balanced deployment of capital, and recent success strengthening our organization give us renewed confidence that we're effectively advancing our strategy for continued growth. The management team is aligned, focused, and committed to delivering on our potential, starting with our excellent first quarter performance.","Thanks again for joining us today. And please welcome Peter, who will provide a detailed review of our operating results.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. We are off to a strong start to 2018. And with the momentum seen in the fourth quarter last year, has been continuing into the first quarter.","Our performance also continues to be driven by volume or usage of our therapies globally. We take a strategic and balanced approach to our capital deployment. In Q1, our investments in two acquisitions further build our pipeline for future growth. While at the same time, our share repurchase program continued. Celgene's strong performance in Q1 has led us to update our full year guidance, which I'll discuss shortly.","Turning to our Q1 performance. Net product sales grew 20% year-over-year to $3.5 billion. Our growth continues to be primarily driven by volume with 15.5 percentage points of the total 19.6 percentage points of revenue growth coming from volume. This strong growth was achieved across the portfolio with key contributions from the major brands REVLIMID, POMALYST, OTEZLA, and ABRAXANE. Nadim and Terrie will discuss these results in a few minutes.","This top line momentum was successfully converted into strong Q1 earnings. Our adjusted EPS increased 23% versus prior year. In fact, our momentum actually drove Q1 earnings over those of Q4 last year, which is particularly strong, given that we were absorbing the additional expenses, including the R&D of our two acquired companies' major pipeline programs.","This performance was achieved through outstanding operational growth. As you can see from this chart, operating income on the right grew $0.34 per share or 20%, while despite absorbing the additional operating expenses of both companies.","Below the operating income line, we offset both the additional debt issued in support of our acquisitions and the slightly increased tax rate that arose from U.S. tax reform, through the benefit of the opportunistic share repurchases executed in the weak markets during both Q4 and Q1.","Turning to the P&L line items, both R&D and SG&A were in the 19% to 20% of revenue range for the quarter. The adjusted operating margin remains quite strong at roughly 58%. Our tax rate was 17.3%, reflecting both the impacts of U.S. tax reform and the acquisition of Juno.","We ended the quarter with $4.74 billion in cash and marketable securities. During the quarter we deployed over $10 billion to acquire two important late stage pipeline companies, Impact Biomedicines and Juno Therapeutics. Supporting these strategic actions, we issued $4.5 billion of debt.","In Q1, we purchased $2.7 billion of shares, bringing our total share repurchases over the last two quarters to $5.7 billion, reflecting our belief that the recent share price pressure presents a compelling investment opportunity.","For the full year 2018, we anticipate total share repurchases in line with our historic program and financial policy.","In the first quarter, our board also reauthorized $5 billion for the share repurchase program, of which approximately $3.1 billion remains outstanding as of March 31.","Finally, I'd like to mention one additional note. In our GAAP results this quarter, our investments in equities are now subject to new \u2013 to two new accounting standards, which require equity investments with readily determinable fair values to be measured at fair value at the end of each quarter with a corresponding impact gain or loss to net income. This is essentially a mark to market.","Implementation requires two steps. First, the cumulative catch-up of our equity portfolio gain\/loss performance was booked and recorded to our balance sheet in retained earnings. This amounted to a cumulative gain on our equity investment of $875 million. This brought us up to current for year-end 2017.","Now secondly in Q1, our portfolio has achieved an additional significant gain of $959 million, just in Q1, which is in our GAAP results under other income. But this gain is excluded from our non-GAAP P&L, since we view it as really non-operational. And this treatment will be applied in future quarters. Hence, future gains or losses each quarter on this new mark to market standard will be adjusted out of our non GAAP P&L henceforth.","Finally, we have updated our 2018 guidance based on our strong start to 2018 and expected continued momentum. The updated guidance chart shown here also incorporates the dilution from the Juno acquisition as a separate column to aid in your review.","The total revenue guidance has been raised to the higher end of our previous range and is now approximately $14.8 billion. REVLIMID net sales are now expected to be approximately $9.5 billion. POMALYST net sales are now expected to be approximately $2 billion. Expected net sales for OTEZLA and ABRAXANE remain at approximately $1.5 billion and approximately $1 billion respectively.","Operating margin is now expected to be approximately 56%, incorporating the R&D and SG&A expenses from our strategic transactions. The adjusted tax rate is now expected to be approximately 17%.","Now, without the Juno acquisition, adjusted EPS would now be $0.05 per share above the higher end of the previous guidance range of $8.70 to $8.90. Incorporating dilution from the Juno acquisition sets adjusted EPS guidance for the year at approximately $8.45.","Please note that going forward, weighted average diluted shares are expected to be about 755 million.","So in summary, a very strong quarter. And this strength has been reflected in our updated full year outlook.","Thank you. And I'll now turn the call over to my colleague, Terrie.","Terrie Curran - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Peter, and good morning. The fourth \u2013 first quarter was another strong quarter for the Inflammation & Immunology franchise, highlighted by significant year-over-year revenue growth for OTEZLA. We've initiated multiple activities that have the potential to expand the treatment eligible population for OTEZLA worldwide, laying the ground work for future growth opportunities.","Ozanimod is an important priority for Celgene. We've had productive interactions with U.S. and European regulators to resubmit the U.S. NDA and submit the European MAA for MS in the first quarter of 2019. We're encouraged by the recent data presented at AAN, which reinforced ozanimod's potential for a differentiated clinical profile. Dr. Jay Backstrom will provide a detailed regulatory update in a few minutes.","We remain committed to advancing novel oral therapies in inflammatory bowel disease with ozanimod and OTEZLA. And we'll discontinue development of GED-0301.","OTEZLA had another strong quarter, as worldwide sales grew to $353 million, representing a 46% growth in both sales and volume versus Q1 of 2017. OTEZLA sales growth in the U.S. was primarily volume driven, due to increasing demand and improving access pull-through in contracted health plans.","OTEZLA year-over-year growth in international sales of 79% was largely driven by increasing adoption in key ex U.S. markets.","While performance and lead indicators year to date are very solid, we are holding to OTEZLA guidance at this point, as we have observed variability in prior summer months, when category growth has historically softened.","2017 was an important year for OTEZLA with a number of managed care contracts implemented in the U.S. Additionally, Celgene was able to secure differentiated access positions for key international markets, such as France and Japan.","Now onto 2018. There are numerous global initiatives underway to further advance the future OTEZLA opportunity, including programs for potential new indications such as mild to moderate plaque psoriasis and Beh\u00e7et's disease. Label enhancement such as scalp psoriasis and a once daily formulation.","Psoriasis is an increasingly crowded market with physicians evaluating multiple treatment options for their patients. As an oral therapy for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, OTEZLA has established a solid position in the pre-biologic post topical setting. And we remain focused on further expanding this opportunity.","Though only one quarter of the way through 2018, we're observing share gains in our contracted U.S. health care plan. Access pull-through has been enhanced by our multi-channel strategies to accelerate new starts in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, including a new direct-to-consumer campaign launched in February. The strategies we implemented have resulted in a pre-biologic segment accounting for the majority of OTEZLA volume.","France and Japan represent major contributors to the long term brand performance of OTEZLA, and they both demonstrate continued acceleration in patient uptake. In France, OTEZLA leads in share of new patient starts, securing greater than 30% of the dynamic share. And after only 10 months post-launch in Japan, OTEZLA is the branded market leader in systemic psoriasis.","We're pleased to start 2018 with a very strong quarter and look to execute against milestones of extending our portfolio. With OTEZLA, we have a strong foundation to build on the momentum realized over the last two quarters. We're actively pursuing the life cycle of this important asset and remain committed to expanding the pre-biologic opportunity for appropriate patients.","We're encouraged by the recent data presented at AAN regarding both the safety and efficacy profile of ozanimod in patients with relapsing MS, reinforcing the potentially differentiated profile we saw in the pivotal program.","Our novel IBD portfolio continues to evolve and progress. The ozanimod phase III TRUE NORTH trial in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis is well underway and is now targeted to complete enrollment by mid-2019. This is a large trial in a very competitive landscape.","We're also beginning pivotal program initiation activities for OTEZLA in mild to moderate ulcerative colitis, which represents another large underserved patient population. The I&I team is focused on executing against our strategic priorities, delivering value from our growing portfolio of assets and disease targets across multiple phases of development.","I would now like to introduce Dr. Jay Backstrom, who will provide an ozanimod regulatory update.","Jay Backstrom - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Terrie. Good morning. We have made significant progress since our call with you in February toward the resubmission of the NDA for ozanimod in relapsing multiple sclerosis. Before I describe our progress, I want to take the opportunity to review the results of the SUNBEAM and RADIANCE trials that will form the basis of our regulatory submission.","As previously discussed and recently presented at AAN, both studies met the primary endpoint, demonstrating a significant reduction in annualized relapse rates compared to beta interferon.","As noted in the updated safety presentation at AAN, ozanimod was generally well tolerated, as reflected in the low incidents of serious adverse events with less than 5% of patients discontinuing treatment due to adverse events. No patient experienced second degree or higher AV block, and the rate of infection was comparable between treatment groups. Together, these results support a favorable benefit risk profile.","Turning to our progress toward resubmitting the NDA for ozanimod. As we indicated on the February call, the key issues for the refusal to file centered on the completeness of the clinical pharmacology and the non-clinical portions of the NDA. These issues relate to the major active metabolite CC-112273.","To put CC-112273 into context, after acquiring Receptos, Celgene initiated several clinical pharmacology studies for ozanimod, including a radiolabeled human mass-balance study. These additional studies were initiated at a time when the phase III RMS program, comprised of the two FDA SPA approved protocols, RADIANCE and SUNBEAM, was underway.","The results of the human mass-balance study identified CC-112273 as a major metabolite accounting for approximately 90% of the activity. CC-112273, which has a similar structure and the same selectivity and potency as ozanimod for the S1P1 and S1P5 receptors, is disproportionately formed in humans and was not identified as a major metabolite in the non-clinical pharmacology studies.","The PK profile of CC-112273 is similar to ozanimod with respect to Tmax, 6 to 10 hours with a half-life of 10 to 13 days.","Based on the totality of the clinical data, including safety in approximately 4,000 patients, the similarity of CC-112273 with respect to structure, selectivity, and potency per the S1P1 and S1P5 receptors, we proceeded with the NDA submission. However, FDA requested further characterization of CC-112273.","Since our call in February, we submitted a plan to address the information required by FDA and participated in a Type A meeting to review and discuss our plan. Based on our discussions with FDA, we plan to address the non-clinical safety assessment of CC-112273 by bridging to the existing non-clinical study and to address the clinical pharmacology assessment for CC-112273 by utilizing the PK\/PD data from the completed and ongoing clin pharm study.","This work is well underway and will be incorporated into a new submission now targeted for Q1 2019.","In addition, we held discussions with the European Medicines Agency and are planning to submit the MAA in Q1 2019 as well.","We fully expect our regulatory team to deliver a high quality submission by Q1 2019. Considering the pivotal efficacy and safety data will be based on the two positive Phase III studies, SUNBEAM and RADIANCE, we are well positioned to achieve regulatory success.","I will now turn the call over to Nadim.","Nadim Ahmed - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. The hematology and oncology franchise had a robust first quarter with total revenue of $3.2 billion at 17% year-over-year growth. REVLIMID and POMALYST\/IMNOVID continued to drive our overall growth with market share and duration gains across geographies.","Based on this positive momentum, we have now raised our 2018 guidance for our myeloma brand. We are awaiting several key Phase III data readouts later this year, including REVLIMID in lymphoma, ABRAXANE in adjuvant pancreatic cancer, and our pivotal Phase III program with luspatercept in low risk MDS and beta-thalassemia.","We also continue to make progress with the advancement and expansion of our pipeline program. We closed our acquisition of Juno Therapeutics in March and are positioned to rapidly advance JCAR017, or liso-cel, towards submission and approval.","Enrollment has completed in the pivotal TRANSCEND U.S. trial in third line plus diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The pivotal bb2121 KarMMa trial in fourth line plus multiple myeloma is currently enrolling. And we are also advancing JCARH125, another BCMA CAR T therapy, into the clinic, building on our strategy to become a global leader in cellular immunotherapy.","We expanded our near term myeloid portfolio with the acquisition of fedratinib. We have also made progress with other multiple myeloma pipeline assets. A Phase I study of our new CELMoD CC-92480 has started. We also moved to CC-93269, our BCMA T cell engager antibody, into the clinic.","REVLIMID had a very strong first quarter with global sales growth of 19% year over year. In the U.S., the brand grew 21%. Market share and duration continues to increase. And we continue to see a positive impact from the non-stem-cell transplant and post-stem-cell transplant maintenance launches. And we expect to see continued increases in duration from the use of triplet combination regimens.","Outside of the U.S., REVLIMID net sales grew 15% year over year with 21% volume growth. REVLIMID's share in frontline non-stem-cell transplant patients continues to grow outside the U.S. And we are also seeing duration increases with the impact of REVLIMID based triplets.","Beyond multiple myeloma, we also expect to see additional Phase III data this year from our lymphoma program. We also expect multiple Phase III data readouts for ongoing studies utilizing REVLIMID based triplet regimens in the frontline setting of multiple myeloma throughout 2018.","POMALYST\/IMNOVID net sales increased by 24% year over year. In the U.S., POMALYST net sales grew 39%, driven by duration and share gains. POMALYST is growing rapidly with the adoption of the triplet regimen of POMALYST, daratumumab, and dexamethasone for relapsed\/refractory myeloma. Similar to REVLIMID, we expect to see additional POMALYST share and duration gains through the use of triplet regimens.","Outside of the U.S., POMALYST\/IMNOVID revenue grew 3% year over year. Volume increased by 13% in spite of competition from new entrants. Revenue growth was affected by price reductions in some markets.","The OPTIMISMM trial reported out earlier this year, and achieved its primary endpoint of PFS improvement with an oral presentation at the upcoming ASCO meeting.","ABRAXANE continues to maintain stable demand overall. We did see an increase in revenue in the first quarter, which was positively impacted by buying patterns across the globe of approximately $30 million.","The positive results of the IMpower 131 trial in first-line squamous non-small cell lung cancer for ABRAXANE in combination with atezolizumab will be presented at ASCO as an oral presentation. And we look forward to additional ABRAXANE data readout later in 2018 for the APAC adjuvant pancreatic cancer trial as well as the pivotal I\/O ABRAXANE atezolizumab combination trial in triple negative breast cancer and non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.","Our teams are preparing for a robust presence at ASCO this year, including the oral presentation of the Phase III OPTIMISMM study results of POMALYST in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in second line plus multiple myeloma.","The Phase III RELEVANCE study comparing R-squared versus the gold standard of rituximab plus combination chemotherapy has also been accepted as an oral presentation. We will also see updated CAR T data from the ongoing Phase I bb2121 dose escalation study in relapsed\/refractory myeloma and JCAR017 in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, which have both been accepted as oral presentation.","As mentioned earlier, the Phase III IMpower 131 trial with ABRAXANE in combination with atezolizumab has also been accepted as an oral presentation.","In summary, the Hematology & Oncology franchise had an excellent first quarter in 2018. We are very pleased with our sales performance with strong volume growth across brand and regions. We have many upcoming catalysts with near term Phase III data readouts for REVLIMID in lymphoma, luspatercept in low risk MDS and beta-thalassemia, as well as ABRAXANE in adjuvant pancreatic cancer. We also plan to file the NDA for fedratinib later this year.","Our pipeline also continues to progress. We are advancing our multiple myeloma strategy with two major campaigns, BCMA targeted therapies and our new CELMoDs. And we look forward to sharing our pipeline strategy during our upcoming multiple myeloma deep dive meeting on May 24.","Our ambition in lymphoma continues with the progress of liso-cel and CC-122. Additional pipeline assets entering into pivotal programs this year include tislelizumab in non-small cell lung cancer, marizomib in glioblastoma, and luspatercept in frontline MDS, representing the advancement of our cancer pipeline across a wide range of unmet medical needs.","Thank you. And I will now turn the call back over to Mark.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Nadim. Thanks, Terrie, Jay, and Peter, and thanks to your teams for delivering an excellent start to the year. As you heard, our business momentum is strong. We're very confident that the regulatory path for ozanimod in MS is understood and back on track. And in the next 12 to 18 months we anticipate multiple catalysts for realizing our long term growth to 2020 and beyond.","Thanks for your attention this morning. And, operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks so much for the question. Just have a few related ones for Jay on the ozanimod filing. I know it's a step-wise process, but does your first quarter filing guidance (30:13), does it require another FDA meeting? I guess I'm trying to see if there's room for it to be faster or risk that more work may be needed?","And then, related for Mark, I know given the ozanimod delay, how much of a strategic priority really is neuroscience compared to other categories at Celgene? I know you guys just signed a Prothena deal. I just want to get some context for it. Thank you.","Jay Backstrom - Celgene Corp.","Yes. So, hi. This is Jay. Just to start. From the Type A meeting, as I reflected in my comments, I feel we have a path forward and our understanding of what needs to be done. So that's in motion.","But just to underscore, this is a new NDA, so we will intend to have a pre-NDA meeting as we would for other programs. So that will happen as we get closer to the end of the year.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Geoff, it's Mark. Thanks for the question about neuro. Let me start by saying that we're very confident in the path forward for ozanimod in MS. And I don't think that that is a direct link to what we think broadly or specifically about neurosciences.","We're taking a step-wise approach to neuro as you know. We have a Prothena deal, which is exploratory, on a number of known proteins in neurodegenerative disease. I'll remind you that we have a partnership with Evotec to screen chemical matter for certain hits in neuro.","So I would say that in MS we have a full commitment to optimize ozanimod. And then beyond that, we're being very, very thoughtful and programmatic in how we understand a broader, deeper approach to neurosciences.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Abrahams from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Brian Abrahams - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks very much for taking my question. I guess another question on ozanimod. Maybe you could clarify a little bit more specifically exactly maybe what still needs to be done? How much has been done so far? Whether you see any particular risks to the results meeting FDA and EMA's comfort? And whether or not the longer half \u2013 there's any risk maybe with longer half-life and accumulation there? And then lastly whether this issue may play into ultimate late comfort around labeling, and I guess understanding the safety profile well enough to potentially not have class labeling on cardiac monitoring? Thanks.","Jay Backstrom - Celgene Corp.","This is Jay. Maybe I'll just start kind of in reverse order and talk about the safety. I think it's important to recognize that the safety data that we presented in these public settings really reflect ozanimod and all the metabolites.","So that safety profile I think takes that into consideration, which I think is a really important point, particularly considering now we have close to 4,000 patients on study and some well over two years exposure. So I think we have a very nice safety database.","In terms of the work, the work is really kind of following through on our conclusions from the Type A meeting over the bridging work with the non-clinical legacy tox studies. And so those are well underway. Our teams are very good at generating that data.","And then to continue to work on the clin pharm package and characterize that, which again from our timing, we are comfortable that we should have that included in time to maintain the Q1 submission.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Your line is open.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I have one for Mark and a couple for Jay, if I may. Mark, Dr. Reddy's decided not to move forward with the Markman hearing. I'm just curious to get your take on why and how that happened and what that means?","Jay, two for you. First, if you looked at the lymphocyte recovery period with Gilenya, it was about three to four weeks or longer, and that's what Receptos management used to flag a lot. And then for ozanimod, lymphocyte recovery period was about three days, and that was an important differentiation.","So I guess my question is, have you looked at the lymphocyte recovery period with this metabolite? And I ask because the metabolite is 90% of ozanimod AUC, so in theory is it the same as three days? Or is it materially longer? So that's one.","And the other one for me and maybe this is a very basic drug development question. If the half-life of this metabolite is 10 to 13 days, and the metabolite is 90% AUC, then why isn't the dosing weekly or every other week? Thank you very much.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","So, Umer, it's Mark. I guess we'll start with the Dr. Reddy's question. The plain construction argument was resolved, so of course then a Markman hearing was unnecessary. We are defending our patent state, the 30 month stay I think as everyone knows is early March of 2019 (sic) [August of 2020], and that's the status of Dr. Reddy's and Celgene for now. Thank you. Jay?","Jay Backstrom - Celgene Corp.","Yeah. With respect to the half-life in the lymphocyte recovery, just a couple points. I think one, first, to recognize that we still have a lot of patients on trial and to characterize that will really begin with a subset. Part of our work as we look forward to going through this year would be to further characterize that, so we'll have greater insight into that as the year proceeds.","And with respect to your interesting question around dosing, interesting question. Of course at this point in our program, I think we're going to stick with the daily dosing that we have.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges from Leerink. Your line is open.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks, Jay. I have to follow-up on these questions on 2273 (sic) [CC-112273], the metabolite. So could you tell us how the metabolite itself is metabolized? And then if \u2013 even if it's not synthesized or it doesn't appear in animals, why can't you synthesize it and give it to animals? And then do you know what the safety liabilities of the metabolite are, where it accumulates in animals or people? Thanks.","Jay Backstrom - Celgene Corp.","Yeah. So first the metabolic profile is similar to the parent, Geoff. So quite similar in terms of how it metabolizes.","With respect to your second question about how to assess it in animals, I think you laid out two potential strategies. One is to give the parent where you have sufficient exposure to detect it. The other would be to consider synthesizing the metabolite and going ahead and actually giving that to animals.","So where we are currently is we are making sure that we have the opportunity to demonstrate that we have adequate exposure through that bridging and through potentially considering those strategies. So at the end, then a non-clinical reviewer feels like they have sufficient data to accepting this.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Patrick E. Flanigan III - Celgene Corp.","Hey, Crystal, actually I think Mark has a couple additional comments he wants to add, before you go to the next caller.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Yeah. Just on \u2013 back to Umer's question about Dr. Reddy's. The 30 month stay is \u2013 it actually expires August of 2020. I misspoke. And then the question about, does a trial get scheduled? We don't see a trial at all this year. And it's very, very difficult to know if something would be scheduled for 2019. So thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So two things. So first, since you've been in these long discussions with the FDA, is there anything you have \u2013 is the metabolite, the single (38:16) different than Gilenya? Can you give us a sense on whether or not you got a sense that you could definitely not have a first dose monitoring label, because FDA does view this as a differentiated product?","Second, is any updated thoughts on would you launch if you do not get that label?","And then lastly for Mark, you mentioned that you thought really hard about the company during first quarter and what kind of changes needed to be made? Can you go a little bit more into depth on your thinking and what you think needs fixing (38:45) with the company going forward? Like what mistakes have you made? What changes do you think need to be made? Thanks.","Jay Backstrom - Celgene Corp.","This is Jay. Maybe I'll start with your question about first dose monitoring and the differentiated label.","Again, I think just kind of go back to the way the program was conducted with the opportunity with us (39:06). The underscoring that there's no effect on QT, the selectivity, et cetera. And that the data that we have today reflects the totality of the data from ozanimod metabolites. I don't know we're in any different place today on 112273 than we were before. I think those data are what they are.","We'll continue of course to round out the clinical pharmacology program through the way I described, bridging back to the existing PK\/PD data. But I don't think this changes that potential.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Robyn, thanks for the question on Celgene and the state of Celgene. I think a number of important steps have been taken to really improve off of what was already a pretty good baseline of operating excellence, the accountability, the strategic planning, this notion of better communication, leadership focus on value drivers.","So I think a lot of what we've done now has been embedded into who Celgene is. And I think on a go forward basis, we feel like we're in a very, very good place. As I said, the management team came together, spent a lot of time thinking about certain elements of our performance, starting with that. As you see from the results, we're executing very well in our core commercial areas.","The regulatory experience with ozanimod is something that we've dissected and worked through, so that the path forward is very well understood. And anything that we learn from that has been applied and worked through. So we think about, first, ozanimod, but then future regulatory opportunities.","I think really the changes we've made amplify our ability to think more strategically and to make sure that we don't make just assessments, judgments, or assumptions about where we are at any given point in time. But I think we're in a really good place.","In terms of go forward, I like the structure, I like the team a lot, and I think we're in a great position to execute for this year and beyond.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to also ask about ozanimod, but from the perspective of UC. So looks like enrollment for the pivotal phase III TRUE NORTH study slid somewhat again. And I'm just curious whether or not accrual was slowed down in response to the RTF to gather more information? Or is this just about the competitive landscape you referred to in the prepared comments as well as in the past. Thanks.","Jay Backstrom - Celgene Corp.","Yeah. Cory, this is Jay. Maybe I'll start. It's the competitive landscape. This is a \u2013 there's a lot of programs. We're being careful to select. But this is a difficult place to recruit patients. So I don't believe it's related to the RTF.","Terrie Curran - Celgene Corp.","Yeah. It's Terrie here. I'll just add to that. I mean it's right what Jay said. There's over 60 programs ongoing in either phase II or phase III in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. And importantly we've executed a number of initiatives to try and accelerate the trial.","We've recruited now over 60% of the biologic to exposed patients. And now importantly, we're focusing on those that haven't had exposure to biologics.","And in the last month we had the highest rate of screening and randomization. So moving forward, we're hoping to kind of really clearly focus on those patients where we think treatment will be most appropriate for in real life.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions as well. I have one for ozanimod. So when you talk about a 1Q 2019 resubmission, can you elaborate which one is the gating study? Is it a two-year carcinogenicity study in animals, because that takes obviously longer? Or do you have any other considerations about that?","And then quickly on a follow up to the last question on UC. The completion of the enrollment has been slipping a couple times. How confident are you that you will be able to complete the enrollment in mid year next year?","And then lastly on the Impact NDA. Have you engaged FDA about the NDA submission for fedratinib? Is it going to be second line for sure? And whether the study will satisfy that requirement? Thank you.","Jay Backstrom - Celgene Corp.","Yes. So with respect to what we need by Q1, it was reflected in my comments, the bridging back to non-clinical programs and the additional clin pharm work that's underway.","Terrie Curran - Celgene Corp.","So I think in terms of the timing of TRUE NORTH, we've done some really deep analysis looking at the recruitment rates and looking at some of the activities that we've implemented, so I would think that the timing that we've just communicated is on the conservative side.","Nadim Ahmed - Celgene Corp.","And maybe \u2013 this is Nadim here. Thanks for the question. I'll pick up the question on fedratinib and NDA submission. Remember we had the acquisition, so previously it was Impact Biomedicines that were doing the interactions with FDA. We of course have our own meetings planned with the FDA. And that's what we'll do. And we'll make sure we file the NDA later this year, as Mark said earlier on.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Your line is open.","Aharon Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, everybody, and thank you for taking my questions. Since it was not said yet, congratulations on the strong quarterly results. I have two, none of them on ozanimod.","The first one in OTEZLA. First, congratulations on the gain share. And obviously you were early in finding your path into the preferred product list. We are now seeing Cosentyx and Taltz engaged in a bit of a price war to try and get a position on the preferred list. Does that essentially mean that you're already there? Or does that mean you might have to either take a little bit of a price discount or face a less favorable position in the formulary?","And then to Nadim, CC-480 (sic) [CC-92480] you're putting into the clinic. How does it differ from other CELMoDs? And you're looking at this as a treatment for primarily folks with poor prognostic? Or can this with the new MRD negativity optionality be used actually as a potential competitor to the IMiDs on a future development path?","Terrie Curran - Celgene Corp.","Yes. So thanks for the question. Just regarding OTEZLA and the formulary list. We did a lot of work in 2017 with managed care. And it was very important for us to contract with those plans.","We're heading into 2018 in a really solid position, having contracted with over 80% of the commercial lives. And importantly, we're getting earlier in the treatment paradigm. So our source of business is coming from topical pre-biologic patients.","Aharon Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Right.","Terrie Curran - Celgene Corp.","So in this space, we're really kind of playing in that post biologic segment. So heading into 2018 we see the GTN impact to be really minimal.","Aharon Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Rupert J. Vessey - Celgene Corp.","Yeah, hi, this is Rupert Vessey here, Research and Early Development. Regarding CC-92480, we're very excited about this molecule. But I would strongly encourage all of you on the phone to come to our myeloma deep dive research day where we'll be presenting for the first time some of the discovery and early development features of this novel CELMoD. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Yee from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, congrats, and I also will not ask an ozanimod question. Two parts. One is luspatercept data is coming up imminently. Maybe you can talk to your expectations here? And what is clinically meaningful data? Since that's an important partnership that you did and I think it's in guidance.","And then second is Juno JCAR017 data is expected. Can you just remind us if you fully expect that this year? And on which part of differentiation that would you expect versus Yescarta and talk to your confidence around that? Thanks so much.","Jay Backstrom - Celgene Corp.","Yes, so, hi. So this is Jay. So yes, the luspatercept program as we discussed earlier had accrued beautifully. We're waiting for that final time point, which gets us mid-year.","The way those protocols were designed was in terms of the overall response and ability of the transfusion independence for the MDS. We believe that should be significantly meaningful and really an important contribution for treatment, assuming in fact our results play out the way we anticipate.","Nadim Ahmed - Celgene Corp.","And for JCAR017, we mentioned that we completed enrollment in TRANSCEND U.S. at the end of the first quarter. So I think we'll continue to follow those data. Of course, we mentioned we have an oral presentation at ASCO which will be the early part of that study, the dose escalation and dose expansion cohorts.","And then as the core (48:12) patient population used for the pivotal study and subsequent submission, we'll continue to follow those data and present them at the right time.","In terms of differentiation, we are still seeing a favorable safety profile relative to the other assets out there. And we'll continue to follow-up for efficacy also and update you as we glean those data. Thanks for the question.","Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Salim Syed from Mizuho. Your line is open.","Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Yeah, hi, thanks for taking the questions, guys. I guess the flow here is multiple questions is okay, so if I may. Just one on fedratinib. Mark and Nadim, you both emphasized that you plan on filing later this year. I think the previous guide there was mid-year. So maybe if you can comment on what's exactly going on with fedratinib NDA submission?","Two, just on the litigation front with REVLIMID. Do you view the filers beyond Dr.Reddy's as prominent filers? Or is Dr. Reddy's really the last filer that we should be thinking about as substantial?","And then the last one is just, Mark, if you could just give us your thoughts on Trump's speech coming up on May 8, what should we be looking out for there? Thank you.","Nadim Ahmed - Celgene Corp.","Hey, Salim, I'll pick up the fedratinib question. Going back to what I said earlier, we still plan to file the NDA later this year, as we had said. We want to though make sure that we have our own engagement with the FDA and have a good discussion. And so that's the only reason that I'm characterizing it that way. We need to have that sit down discussion with the FDA. But again, we plan to file the NDA this year.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Nadim. Of course I agree with that. On litigation, we take every filer seriously. I don't think there's a prioritization. And as filers come along, we will defend our patent state accordingly.","And then with respect to the President and the administration, I think that Secretary Azar, and then FDA Commissioner Gottlieb have been pretty clear in the last couple of days, I think almost advancing the notion of what the President will likely touch on. Certainly, we're looking for reinforcement of private sector reform, maybe certain negotiations from Part D could be crossed over into Part B.","I think that the commissioner, FDA Commissioner Gottlieb yesterday really projected the notion that there could be some consideration for revisiting safe harbors in the context of the rebate mechanisms that right now are considered safe harbor between parties. So it could be as detailed as that.","And then we would fully expect that the President would speak in some way to what he's been talking about off and on. And that is the difference between international prices for pharmaceuticals and the U.S. prices.","So I think any or all of those could be part of it. And we look forward as always to working with the administration, with FDA, with HHS on what we hope are market based solutions to access and affordability.","Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Alethia Young from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Two of them. I guess, Mark and maybe Terrie and team, just like what are some of the key learnings over the past couple years with the I&I business, even as it relates to acquiring assets or competing in a very crowded aggressive payer commercial environment? How do you apply that kind of going forward from here?","And then just also on OTEZLA, just talk a little bit about the impact of DTC. It seems like every time I turn on the TV, I see a commercial. So I just want to know if you think that's having like a meaningful impact? And whether that was kind of a force in what drove kind of the beat there? Thanks.","Terrie Curran - Celgene Corp.","So I'll answer the question on OTEZLA and DTC. I'm glad that you saw \u2013 you've been seeing the ad. We've definitely been now putting some investment into that.","Yeah, I think in this category particularly, when we're trying to focus on a patient that is not necessarily on treatment, that's on a topical, ensuring that the patient has an idea of what the options are for them is really critical.","We kind of measure the ad, both the impact on the ads, where the patients kind of go to their doctor and request a brand. And when we look at our competitive set, the ad really is working, in that more than 70% of patients will see the ad, go to a doctor, and ask for a script. So yeah, it really is having an impact.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Thanks, maybe we should all just not watch TV I guess anymore. I don't know.","On lessons learned, couple of the things that I think are important to look and put ozanimod and the RTF in this in context. It was not that long ago that we would have a conversation about OTEZLA. And the idea was that Celgene not being an I&I company or used to the big markets of dermatology, rheumatology, et cetera, arthritities, that maybe we should partner OTEZLA out. Maybe we should not build the competencies and capabilities to launch a product like OTEZLA.","As everyone knows, this has become a very important medicine in a very, very important segment of psoriasis. And we hope increasingly in psoriatic arthritis.","That was something from zero to 60 in about 2.9 seconds, right? The company did not have that legacy history. We built it. We hired great people. And then we developed a profile of a molecule that today is a blockbuster and doing quite well with a lot of opportunity ahead of it.","I think when we think about the Receptos acquisition and ozanimod winning, as Jay reviewed again today so nicely, in two large randomized Phase III trials in relapsing MS, the (54:44) of that trial was really outstanding. The work was done in transition from Receptos to Celgene.","And so the clinical program so far has been done beautifully by legacy Receptos people and the Celgene clinical operations footprint worldwide.","I think what we learned is that as we become bigger, more complex, as we have a lot of moving parts, there are times when we need to slow down and double and triple check where we are in certain judgments about what we're doing in areas of the company. And I think that we learned from this that while we stand behind the decision on benefit risk, as Jay talked about, to submit the NDA, the hindsight view is that the characterization of metabolite was something that we simply underestimated in the context of FDA's decision.","I wouldn't then associate that with an indictment of our ability to build the company around new therapeutic areas and new opportunities. And I certainly wouldn't put that against our ability to license and\/or execute our business development strategy, which has been so profoundly strong.","During today's call, we talked about ozanimod being a very, very important drug in relapsing MS on the data. We got questions about luspatercept, and that's our partnership with Acceleron and MDS.","Fedratinib is an acquisition for the start of the year that is NDA ready, despite perhaps a little bit more time, depending on what FDA does tell us when we meet with them.","And then when I think about JCAR017 and our partnership with Juno, we had jumped into cellular immunotherapy with blue [bluebird biosciences] and Juno years ago. And here we are now executing on cellular immunotherapy I think on a grand scale.","So I'd be careful and we are certainly careful to not look at aspects of maybe one disappointment or one delay and then apply that to the entire company's ability to continue to be operating at a high level and delivering outstanding results.","We learn things. We think communication is much, much enhanced in the last couple of months. And so there's a benefit to challenges like this that gives one pause to re-examine processes and think through everything we're doing, so that we're as good as we can be. So I appreciate the opportunity to address that point.","Patrick E. Flanigan III - Celgene Corp.","Crystal, I think we have time for two last callers, please.","Operator","Okay. And our next question comes from Carter Gould from UBS. Your line is open.","Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. And, Mark, thanks for the comments right there. That's really helpful.","I guess I wanted to follow up on the earlier luspatercept question. And I guess for Nadim and Jay, specifically wanted to get your view on kind of expectation on the safety side in the Phase III pivotals, relative to the Phase II data sets.","And then for Mark, just want to follow up on sort of your capacity for additional sizable deals here, not just in light of $10 billion but also the shakeup of the executive management team here. And if you need to sort of take a pause and digest things for a bit. Thank you.","Jay Backstrom - Celgene Corp.","Yeah. So this is Jay. Maybe I'll start with luspatercept and the safety. I think the advantage of having Phase III trials is you continue to have additional exposure and more opportunity to define that safety profile.","I mean to this point from the ongoing assessment monitoring \u2013 and as you know for our Phase III programs we have data monitor committees in place, et cetera, to give us guidance and advice \u2013 we've not seen anything to date that was \u2013 that's different from the Phase II data.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Super. And, Carter, this is Peter. I guess I'll take the question on the M&A and first, at least from a capacity standpoint and also from a strategic intent, I think that we've always had the strategic intent that we want to look for great science. And we view that in our partners. We look for that in anything we acquire.","We always want to be on the edge of innovation and really where we can make a big impact on unmet needs in the medical community and the patient community.","In many ways BD and M&A is just the vehicles with which we access additional great science and innovation that's out there. We do on a regular basis, and we talk a lot about it and Jonathan [Biller] is here with me, we're constantly in great dialogue with our debt agencies, as well as all of our fixed income investors and others to make sure that we're really managing our capacity well.","And as you know, we have very strong cash flow. And we have very strong \u2013 as you can see today, very strong growth. And so that capacity in a sense tends to grow.","And periodically, as you do a larger deal like we did for Receptos and now we've done for Juno, it does in a sense reduce some of that capacity in the short term. But it grows right back very quickly.","I would say that, Mark, I think it's fair to say Q1 was a busy quarter.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Just a bit, yeah.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Maybe that's the understatement of the day. We have done a lot.","I think, as a lot of the people in the room, who are really pulling together here and really executing like crazy. And we feel we're very proud of having gone through a tough period here. We had a couple things we had to work through. We've got a lot more to do. But we're going to still be looking for opportunities. There's nothing like right, instantaneously. We never talk about that stuff. But we're really going to be motivated more by science and really a chance to make a difference in that next decade.","Everything would be done in the typical Celgene way, very professionally, very well organized, coordinated with everybody.","We did do a lot in the first quarter. If you think about it, if you combine the amount of M&A activity as well as the amount of share repurchase we've done the last two quarters, it's a reasonable investment.","I think it's all really well targeted and against really valuable initiatives on all sides, including the share repurchases. And I think we're going to be really happy in the future about having done all that.","But I think, Mark, as we say, our job is never done, right?","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Yeah.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","So we're always kind of the look. But it's not driven by kind of, are we slowing down now or anything like that. It's more I think really about, when we really see good science, I think that's what drives us. Mark?","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Absolutely. And that's the story of Celgene for the last 10, 15 years. It's been reinvesting in building the company through the strategic capacity of the company, the expertise of the company, and of course the strong financial performance, including the first quarter.","I would say that the sense of urgency isn't different. So we still look for opportunity all the time, even though we were very busy in the first quarter. And we have a lot of integration still to go, a lot of things that we want to make sure we're getting right. That doesn't mean we can't at the same time continue to look externally. And even as Rupert and his team will show on the deep dive, or during the deep dive May 24, our organic pipeline is starting to come along pretty nicely as well.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Yeah.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","So I think we're excited about where we are. We think there are opportunities. And we're still hungry for those opportunities. But we are executing, we are focused on executing on what we've done.","Maybe just on the structure, before we go another question, let me take another opportunity to welcome Jennifer Dudinak as the Head of our Global Regulatory Affairs team. She's got tremendous experience across specialty markets, including oncology and certain areas that are key to us.","But bringing Jennifer in as a dedicated leader for our regulatory affairs function \u2013 and by the way, we were looking for the right person for, Jay, would you say around about a year?","Jay Backstrom - Celgene Corp.","Yes, correct.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Something like that. So we took our time to find someone who we think is a great leader, an accomplished professional in regulatory affairs. But also someone who fits our culture and our management team very well.","An example of something that is slightly different than perhaps the past, using Jennifer's hire as an example, is the functionality of regulatory affairs is so important that Jennifer was added to the Executive Committee of the company. This is a committee that I chair, and these are direct reports, and then other areas of the company that are highly important to our ability to be successful.","In the past, that would be something that would be more of an ad hoc nature to how we manage the company now. We see Jennifer routinely for the cross functional discussions about where our portfolio is independent of function. So it's a portfolio oversight for the whole company.","And more and more, we're thinking about how to connect people less from a structural point of view and more from a governance committee point of view. And we'll continue to do that.","As I said in my prepared remarks, we're looking for other talent, and we'll update you as we bring that in. I'll just say this about the marketplace. The Celgene name still travels very well.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our final question from Laura Chico from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Laura Chico - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, and thank you very much for the question. I'm just wondering if you could follow up on the ex-U.S. REVLIMID trends in pricing. I think you commented that duration for rest-of-world REVLIMID was increasing. I guess where does it stand? And where should we be thinking about it at this point in terms of relative to the U.S. duration?","And then lastly, just on pricing trends ex-U.S. What should we be expecting near term, intermediate term, in terms of any headwinds? I think you articulated that was a bit of a headwind for POMALYST.","Nadim Ahmed - Celgene Corp.","Yes. Thanks for the question. So let's start with POMALYST. So what we saw were some of the routine, and in some markets now have become annual, pricing reviews as the access environment outside of the U.S., as well as of course now the U.S., continues to be tough. And so that's what we saw with POMALYST.","The other thing to note with POMALYST though is, even when we saw some competitive pressure on volume, much of that was actually absorbed by a REVLIMID based triplet regimen. So the company was still getting the credit for that displacement in the marketplace.","And then in terms of duration, we're still at around 25 to 24 cycles in the U.S. and 14 to 15 cycles ex-U.S. And of course as we get more and more approvals in the frontline setting ex-U.S., we expect to see that continue to increase ex-U.S. Thanks for the question.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Well, super. This is Peter Kellogg. I'll just wrap it up. So really thank you very much for joining us. We've run a little bit over, and we apologize for that, but we wanted to share with you what we think is a really strong start to 2018. You can see it in the numbers.","We've tried to be very transparent in exactly everything that's going on financially with the integration of acquisitions and so forth. But also all the different regulatory processes. A great set of questions today, so I thank everyone for that.","We continue to take a strategic focus and a balanced approach to how we drive this business forward. We're strong financially. We're going to continue to really have a tremendous focus on both the execution in our \u2013 in the marketplaces where we've got great assets, at the same time, building our future through the BD development, execution on our pipeline.","And we certainly recognize the Q1, we wish we had a little smoother time during Q1, but we've really pulled together, and we really appreciate the support \u2013 appreciate and thank you for your support. We look forward to having a great year. Thank you for joining us today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

I would like to remind you, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Flanigan, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations & Treasury at Celgene.","Patrick E. Flanigan III - Celgene Corp.","Thanks, Crystal, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter earnings conference call. The press release reporting our financial results, in addition to the presentation to today's webcast, can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the corporate website at Celgene.com.","Joining me in the room today with prepared remarks are Mark Alles, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Peter Kellogg, who's currently our Chief Financial Officer; Nadim Ahmed, Global Head of our Hematology & Oncology franchise; Terrie Curran, Global Head of our Inflammation and Immunology franchise; and Jay Backstrom, our Chief Medical Officer. Also available for the Q&A portion of the call are Rupert Vessey, Global Head of our Research and Early Development group; Jonathan Biller, our General Counsel; and David Elkins, our new Chief Financial Officer, effective on August 1.","As a reminder, during today's call we will be making forward-looking statements regarding our financial outlook, in addition to regulatory and product development plans. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual results to differ from those forecasted. A description of these risks can be found in our most recent 10-Q on file with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we undertake no duty to update or revise them.

Alles - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Patrick. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We're excited to share our second quarter results, representing excellent financial performance and significant progress advancing our pipeline of near-term value drivers.","Our global commercial team delivered another strong quarter of volume-driven sales growth while we simultaneously integrated Juno Therapeutics. First half and Q2 momentum supports raising our 2018 revenue guidance from $14.8 billion to $15 billion. Accounting for the impact of the Juno acquisition, lower share count, and operating momentum, we are also updating our 2018 adjusted diluted EPS guidance from $8.45 to a range of $8.70 to $8.75. Driven by five late-stage potential blockbusters expected to launch by the end of 2020, the next stage of our innovation cycle is well underway. During the quarter, our teams made substantial progress on the regulatory applications for fedratinib and ozanimod. We are preparing the NDA for fedratinib in myelofibrosis for submission by the end of this year, and we remain on track for U.S. NDA and EU MAA submissions for ozanimod in relapsing multiple sclerosis in the first quarter of 2019.","Data updates at ASCO provided additional evidence of liso-cel's potentially best-in-class and bb2121's first-in-class clinical profiles. Our strategic intent is to become a global leader in the field of cellular immunotherapy, and we're advancing these two assets to regulatory submission as soon as possible.","In the last four weeks, we announced positive top line results from three pivotal Phase III trials, the luspatercept trials; MEDALIST in myelodysplastic syndromes, and BELIEVE in beta-thalassemia; and the just-announced AUGMENT study of REVLIMID plus rituximab in follicular lymphoma. Including these studies, our clinical development teams and partners have delivered more than 10 positive Phase III trials for our commercial and investigational medicines across multiple sclerosis, Beh\u00e7et's disease, multiple myeloma, lymphoma, MDS, beta-thalassemia, and breast and lung cancer, all in the last 12 months.","Like most dynamic organizations, we are continuously working to strengthen our company by developing internal talent and hiring the strongest and most accomplished leaders. In the second quarter, we were pleased to announce three significant leadership changes.","Jonathan Biller was appointed Executive Vice President and General Counsel. Jonathan is an accomplished attorney and a finance professional who has been at Celgene since 2011, leading our tax and treasury team. He has previously worked as a partner at a major law firm and served as General Counsel at Bunge Limited.","David Elkins has joined as Executive Vice President and our next Chief Financial Officer. David comes to Celgene from Johnson & Johnson, where he was Worldwide Vice President and CFO for consumer products, medical devices, and corporate functions. He has held financial and operational roles of increasing responsibility throughout his career, including serving as CFO of Becton, Dickinson and Company. Welcome to the team, David.","David succeeds Peter Kellogg, who will remain at Celgene as Executive Vice President and Chief Corporate Strategy Officer until his retirement, planned for mid-2019. In this important role, Peter's insight will be critical to the progression of Celgene's strategy for sustainable long-term growth.","As this is Peter's final quarterly earnings call as our CFO, I'd like to extend my personal thanks for his wisdom, his friendship, and his immeasurable impact on Celgene since joining us in 2014. Our financial performance in this timeframe has been industry-leading, and we are grateful for his leadership and continued involvement well into next year. Peter, on behalf of everybody at Celgene, thank you very much.","Before we move to a detailed review of our financial results, I would like to address Celgene's participation in the very important dialogue occurring in the United States around value, access, and the affordability of healthcare. We begin with the principle that after spending many years and significant resources to discover and develop innovative new therapies, our greatest priority is ensuring that patients have access to them. Celgene has been proactive and transparent on these issues.","In May, we published our first annual Value and Innovation Report for U.S. and other healthcare policymakers and opinion leaders. This report offers comprehensive evidence on the value our medicines provide to patients, the healthcare system, the economy, and society. In June, we updated our principles for the pricing of innovative medicines. Going forward, as Celgene increases the price of any individual therapy across our portfolio, that price increase will be limited to no more than once a year and at a level no greater than the CMS projected increase in national health expenditures for the year. For 2018, this rate is 5.3%. Our pricing principles also consider circumstances in which additional clinical or health-economic evidence demonstrates a significant increase in the value of one of our medicines, where this standard would not apply.","Earlier this month, we increased the list price for REVLIMID and POMALYST by 5%, and no further pricing actions for these or any of our other products are anticipated in 2018. We believe this transparency provides greater certainty for all stakeholders and helps to contribute to collaborative solutions that address healthcare access and affordability.","As the business environment in which we operate rapidly evolves, Celgene's year-to-date performance has been defined by industry-leading top and bottom line growth, meaningfully advancing our late-stage portfolio, and continuing to invest in the pipeline and the people that will shape Celgene's future.","Thanks again for joining us today, and I'll now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Peter Kellogg.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Mark, and a warm welcome to Celgene, David, and congratulations to Jonathan. Good morning, everyone.","Momentum in operational excellence we saw in the first quarter has continued into the second quarter. Our net product sales performance continues across our portfolio. Our increased visibility into the full year allows us to raise 2018 guidance for total revenue and REVLIMID net sales. Finally, we are continuing to integrate Juno Therapeutics operations as we advance to become a global leader in cellular immunotherapy.","In Q2, we took advantage of our lower stock price to accelerate our planned share repurchase program. In summary, the way to think about it is that the shares that would have been bought over the next few quarters were pulled forward into Q2, including the May ASR. The resulting reduced share count impact has been incorporated into our revised full-year adjusted EPS guidance.","We also continue to support growing the pipeline with our M&A and BD investments. Year to date, we have deployed over $10 billion on M&A and BD, so it should be very clear that this remains our top priority.","Turning to our Q2 performance, total net product sales grew 17% year over year to $3.8 billion. Our growth continues to be strong. Volume grew 15.1% and total net product sales grew 16.8%, clearly a volume-driven result. This strong growth was achieved across the portfolio, with key contributions from REVLIMID, POMALYST, and OTEZLA. Nadim and Terrie will discuss these results in a few minutes.","Our adjusted EPS increased 16% versus prior year. In Q2, our P&L reflects the first full quarter of Juno operating expenses, which impacted operating income by about $0.14 per share. Despite that, our operating income grew $0.13 per share. Additionally, the accelerated timing of our share repurchase program into Q2, as mentioned earlier, reduced our share count in Q2 and affects our Q2 results, as shown in this chart here.","Turning to the P&L, R&D and SG&A expenses increased as a percentage of revenue versus prior year. As just mentioned, the Q2 financials include a full quarter of Juno's significant pipeline and operations. We also had increased expenses related to regulatory submission work on multiple programs. The increase in operating expenses drove a decrease in Q2 operating margin of about 500 basis points year over year. This increase was fully planned and incorporated in our guidance provided on our Q1 earnings call, and we are on track for full-year operating margin guidance of approximately 56%.","We ended the quarter with $3.4 billion in cash and marketable securities. In the second quarter, our board authorized an additional $3 billion in share repurchases and a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase. We entered into an agreement for the ASR on May 30, and it is expected to be completed on or before August 31. We purchased $3.3 billion of shares and have approximately $2.8 billion left under the program. However, you should expect a very low level of share repurchase activity in the balance of 2018.","Turning to the 2018 guidance, based on the strong performance of REVLIMID, we are increasing full-year guidance for REVLIMID net product sales from approximately $9.5 billion to approximately $9.7 billion. Accordingly, we are increasing full-year total revenue from approximately $14.8 billion to approximately $15 billion. All other product sales guidance remains unchanged from before. There's also no change to our full-year adjusted operating margin guidance, as I mentioned earlier, nor to our adjusted tax rate.","Now, looking ahead to Q3, we expect approximately $90 million in potential milestone payments in the third quarter, which together with our ongoing late-stage activity and our filing preparation efforts, will cause R&D to rise to a higher third quarter and full-year level, a strategically positive dynamic given our important pipeline assets. Now, Jay will provide an overview of this activity in a minute. However, for your planning, you should expect our Q3 adjusted EPS to be similar to the Q2 result. However, on a full-year basis, we are raising adjusted diluted EPS from approximately $8.45 to a range of $8.70 to $8.75. Our raise of full-year adjusted EPS guidance takes into account the expected top line performance from our portfolio, the reduced share count for the year, but also takes into account our increased R&D investments for our late-stage programs.","Now, to help with your financial modeling, please note that the share count in Q2 reflects a partial quarter of the ASR, as it was implemented in late May. Q3 and Q4 share count should be roughly in the 720 million share range, leading to a full-year average share count of approximately 735 million shares. Hope that's helpful.","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to my colleague Nadim.","Nadim Ahmed - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone.","The Hematology & Oncology franchise had a robust second quarter, with revenue of $3.4 billion at 18% year-over-year growth. REVLIMID and POMALYST\/IMNOVID continued to drive our overall growth, with volume gains across geographies. Based on this positive momentum, we have raised our 2018 guidance for REVLIMID.","Earlier this week, we announced positive results from the Phase III AUGMENT study. REVLIMID plus rituximab, the R2 regimen, achieved a highly statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of progression-free survival in patients with relapsed\/refractory indolent lymphoma. In addition to achieving the primary endpoint of the study, a favorable trend was also observed for overall survival during this analysis, and follow-up will continue for the mature survival results. We plan to submit global regulatory dossiers in the first quarter of 2019.","We also recently announced that the Phase III IMpassion130 study, sponsored by Roche, met its coprimary endpoint of progression-free survival. This is the first Phase III trial to demonstrate a statistically significant PFS improvement in first-line, metastatic, triple-negative breast cancer. These results are extremely encouraging for women with this highly aggressive form of breast cancer, for which there are limited options. These data, together with the recent lung cancer readouts, demonstrate the potential role of ABRAXANE as a preferred chemotherapy partner for immune-oncology combinations in breast and non-small-cell lung cancers.","We continue to make progress with the advancement and expansion of our pipeline programs, including luspatercept with our partner Acceleron, with two highly positive Phase III studies in MDS and beta-thalassemia. We also continue to advance our leadership position in cellular immunotherapy through updated data presented at ASCO with liso-cel and bb2121. Jay Backstrom will cover the pipeline in more detail later on in the presentation.","REVLIMID had a very strong second quarter, with global sales growth up 21% year over year. In the U.S., the brand grew 17%, as market share and treatment duration continue to increase. We continue to see a positive impact from the transplant-ineligible and post-stem-cell-transplant maintenance launches. And we expect to see continued increases in duration from the use of triplet combination regimens.","Outside of the U.S., REVLIMID net sales grew 28% year over year, with 38% volume growth. These results also included some one-off purchases for the quarter, such as an approximately $65 million Russian tender and some clinical trial material purchases. REVLIMID share in front-line non-stem-cell transplant patients continues to grow outside the U.S., and we are also seeing duration increases with the impact of REVLIMID-based triplets.","As I mentioned earlier, we expect the AUGMENT results to be a key future growth driver for REVLIMID. In addition, we await the results of the REVLIMID ROBUST trial in first-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Remember, this is an event-driven trial, and we continue to monitor the status of patients. We also expect multiple Phase III data readouts for ongoing studies utilizing REVLIMID-based triplet regimens in the front-line setting of multiple myeloma throughout 2018.","POMALYST\/IMNOVID net sales increased by 30% year over year. In the U.S., POMALYST net sales grew 41%, with the majority of growth coming from increasing market share and duration. POMALYST continues to grow rapidly, with the adoption of the triplet regimen of POMALYST, daratumumab, and dexamethasone for relapsed\/refractory myeloma. Similar to REVLIMID, we expect to see additional POMALYST share and duration gains through the use of triplet regimens. Outside of the U.S., POMALYST\/IMNOVID revenue grew 10% year over year, with volume increasing by 15%, in spite of competition from new entrants including daratumumab and REVLIMID-based triplet regimens.","ABRAXANE continues to maintain stable demand overall. We saw a 4% decrease year over year in second quarter revenue, which was impacted by higher Q1 distributor buying patterns, as described during the Q1 call. In the near term, we have very positive data flow for ABRAXANE. We look forward to the ABRAXANE data readout later this year for the APACT adjuvant pancreatic cancer trial. We now also have the readout of four positive Phase III studies demonstrating a potential clinical benefit of ABRAXANE in combination with checkpoint inhibitors for the first-line treatment of breast and non-small-cell lung cancers.","In summary, the Hematology & Oncology franchise had an excellent second quarter in 2018. We are very pleased with our sales performance with strong volume growth across brands and regions. At the same time, we significantly advanced our pipeline with the recent readouts of three highly positive Phase III studies for luspatercept in MDS and beta-thalassemia and REVLIMID in lymphoma.","Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Terrie.","Terrie Curran - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Nadim, and good morning.","Quarter 2, 2018, was another strong quarter for Celgene I&I, with continued positive momentum in OTEZLA sales and focused execution on our key strategic priorities. OTEZLA utilization continued to increase in both the U.S. and internationally as demand and access further improved. We continue to execute on our core strategy to increase pre-biologic access to OTEZLA for appropriate patients worldwide. Despite increased competitive intensity, the brand's underlying performance metrics remain solid.","OTEZLA, an oral therapy, has established a unique value proposition, a pre-biologic foundation in the treatment paradigm for plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. We are investing for sustained growth with multiple studies underway \u2013 for example, scalp psoriasis \u2013 to reinforce the OTEZLA base business and to further expand the post-topical market opportunity, opportunities that will potentially enhance the profile and expand the addressable population for OTEZLA worldwide.","We also advanced our next-generation growth catalyst, ozanimod. An update on the relapsing multiple sclerosis regulatory submission will be covered later in the call. In parallel to this regulatory work, we have used the time to gain additional market insights and execute a number of market-shaping activities. I'm very pleased with the team we are building with deep MS experience, who are focused on preparing an impactful launch.","Global OTEZLA net sales for Q2 2018 were $375 million, which represents a 5% increase year on year. On a year-to-date basis, revenue in the first half of the year grew 21% versus the same period a year ago. The U.S. showed midteen volume growth in the quarter versus a year ago. However, this increase in demand was offset by gross to net and inventory fluctuations versus the previous year. International sales in Q2 climbed 62% year on year, propelled by accelerating adoption in key markets. In Japan and France, we've seen record-setting uptake for OTEZLA in the psoriasis market. In Japan, after one year, OTEZLA has taken the lead in new-to-brand systemic share.","With strong OTEZLA performance year to date, we remain on track to achieve our full-year guidance of OTEZLA sales of $1.5 billion. Subsequent sales growth will be enhanced by growth drivers currently in development. By the end of 2018, we expect to see data readout of the Phase III trial in scalp psoriasis, FDA decision on the once-daily formulation, U.S. and Japan NDA submissions for Beh\u00e7et's disease, and trial initiation activities for development in mild to moderate plaque psoriasis.","With the breadth of life-cycle programs we are pursuing in OTEZLA in dermatology and rheumatology, we've decided to focus our efforts in IBD on the continued development of ozanimod and are reconsidering the OTEZLA Phase III program in ulcerative colitis in the context of our overall portfolio.","Over time, OTEZLA has continued to command a leadership position in new-to-brand share, a solid market share position, and over 80% post-topical, pre-biologic source of business. Together, these performance indicators have stirred continued TRx growth, largely driven by uptake in the systemic naive patient segment.","With an increasing number of therapeutic options available, competition and payer management in the psoriasis category has reached new levels. However, by implementing managed care contracts, securing biologic step-free access for OTEZLA, we have carved out a distinct part of the market to solidify OTEZLA's competitive advantage for both now and in the years to come.","I'd now like to introduce my colleague, Dr. Jay Backstrom.","Jay T. Backstrom - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Terrie. Good morning.","As you heard from Mark, Nadim, and Terrie, we continue to make excellent progress in advancing our five near-term pipeline products toward regulatory approvals over the next 18 to 24 months. As we look across the five programs, each has been significantly derisked. Ozanimod, fedratinib, and more recently luspatercept all have positive Phase III studies, which will form the basis of the regulatory applications. The two CAR-T programs, bb2121 and liso-cel, have demonstrated compelling clinical data, leading to Breakthrough Therapy designations, providing the opportunity for accelerated review and approval.","Turning to ozanimod, the NDA preparation for the relapsing multiple sclerosis indication is advancing as planned, and the U.S. and EU applications remain on track for Q1 2019 submissions. Progress is also being made for the GI indications of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Over two-thirds of the enrollment has been completed for the global Phase III TRUE NORTH ulcerative colitis study, which remains on track for completing enrollment by mid-2019. The Phase III study in Crohn's disease is open and enrolling.","Moving to fedratinib, we're also making excellent progress in advancing this product toward regulatory approval. As part of our NDA preparation, we held a pre-NDA meeting with FDA and are on track for an end-of-year submission. In addition, we are working to initiate a full clinical program with fedratinib, including combination studies with luspatercept and other pipeline assets.","Since our earnings call in May, we've reported on a series of positive Phase III results, including the MEDALIST and BELIEVE studies for luspatercept. As we discussed at ASCO, we had confidence in our assumptions for the MDS and beta-thalassemia studies given the Phase II data, and we now look forward to advancing the U.S. and EU applications in the first half of 2019 and to advancing the COMMANDS study, a Phase III trial in ESA-naive low to intermediate risk MDS. Considering the positive results in two distinctly different diseases, MDS and beta-thalassemia, luspatercept has the potential to be a platform drug for chronic anemias.","In keeping with our goal to be a global leader in cellular immunotherapy, both bb2121 and liso-cel continue to advance and remain top priorities. For bb2121, the updated dose escalation data from the CRB-401 study were presented at ASCO, highlighting a safety profile that to date has been notable for the low rates of severe cytokine release syndrome and grade 3-4 neurotoxicity. The pivotal KarMMa study continues to enroll rapidly, and the randomized Phase III study in the third-line setting is expected to begin by year end. Overall, the bb2121 program has excellent momentum and remains on track for an expected 2020 approval.","Finally, turning to liso-cel, enrollment in the TRANSCEND trial in the third-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is complete. The BLA preparations are underway, and the program remains on track for an expected 2019 approval. Regarding the full clinical program for liso-cel, TRANSCEND WORLD continues to advance, and we're in startup for the TRANSFORM and PILOT studies in second-line transplant-eligible and transplant-noneligible diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, respectively. Finally, TRANSCEND CLL is enrolling, with data expected to be available later this year.","Regarding our overarching approach to lymphoma, the recent positive results from AUGMENT supports the potential benefit from the R2 regimen and helps to solidify our efforts to bring new treatment options to patients with lymphoma. Overall, we continue to make excellent progress toward delivering the next wave of innovative therapies.","I'll now turn the call back over to Mark.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Peter, Nadim, Terrie, and thanks very much, Jay. Congratulations on a very good first half of the year. Our commercial performance is strong, our pipeline is delivering, and we are poised for more potential value inflections over the next 12 to 18 months.","The recent late-stage clinical success we highlighted today is being matched by the continued productivity of our research and early development team. Year to date, Rupert Vessey and his discovery group have filed four unique INDs and CTAs and continue to make meaningful progress with the early clinical development of 15 new molecules or cellular therapies across 19 indications. As they advance toward late-stage development, these programs represent our next generation of transformative medicines for patients with serious unmet needs.","In the first half of 2018, we strengthened our organization and sharpened our focus on operating excellence. The management team is energized and optimistic about the promise and the potential we have to create long-term value for patients, employees, and shareholders.","Thanks for your attention, and, operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Phil Nadeau from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, first, just a question on the AUGMENT data and the R2 regimen. I know you mentioned that that was likely to be a growth driver in the future. Our academic consultants suggest that they're already using R2 in this indication, in this situation. So can you talk a little bit about what you think the incremental revenue opportunity is and who will be the adopters once there is a label for the R2 regimen? Thanks.","Nadim Ahmed - Celgene Corp.","All right. This is Nadim. Thanks for the question. So I think our observation in the U.S. marketplace is that there is some use of REVLIMID currently. However, we do feel that having the Phase III data will actually impact clinical practice more so. So we do think there's definitely opportunity for REVLIMID across histologies, potentially, when considering the ROBUST study also. So we do see incremental growth from REVLIMID.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Your line is open.","Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI","Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. I wanted to ask on ozanimod from a slightly competitor sort of a perspective. And my question was Novartis has a large Phase III coming up in the next few weeks comparing a quarter-milligram GILENYA versus half-milligram, the currently approved dose. How do you expect the profile of that quarter-milligram GILENYA to compare versus ozanimod? And then separately, does Celgene know in this stage in the ongoing Dr. Reddy litigation to what extent their amorphous converts to a crystalline form in a normal environment? Thank you.","Terrie Curran - Celgene Corp.","It's Terrie here. Just to answer the first part of your question, I think as we look at the clinical data, the Phase III program for ozanimod, the two large clinical trials, we really do see very clear differentiation from both GILENYA as well as the low dose, particularly when you look at the cardiovascular profile and the safety profile. So we really think that that will be a very clear differentiation for the compound.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Umer, it's Mark. Thanks for the question on the ongoing litigation with Dr. Reddy's. Your question's really specific and, of course, in the context of an ongoing process, we really just can't comment to address what you asked. So thank you.","Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI","I totally understand. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Yee from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Thanks for the question. My question was on BCMA. Of course, there's been some debate since ASCO on bb2121, and I'm sure we look forward to the pivotal data around the corner. I guess my question was around the multiple products you have and ultimately how you feel the hurdle is to take additional ones forward. I know it's early, but where the differentiation would be to make go\/no-go decisions. And particularly is that persistency? Is it durability? Is it response rates? Et cetera, et cetera. And then I guess since it's Peter's last call, I guess I have to ask him one question, which was regarding capital allocation and to what extent you think there would be changes in the aggressiveness of more deals, or do you think you guys are taking a break? Or how do I think about the business development activity going forward? Thanks.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Hey, Michael. It's Peter. Thanks for the question. So I'll go first, actually, on that one, and then we'll get back to the BCMA portfolio that we have. First of all, thanks for the question because I just want to make sure it's clear that while we seize the moment, let's say, in Q2 and pull forward a lot of share repurchase activity that we normally would have done over the next few quarters, you should see it that way. It's not a change in capital allocation strategy or anything like that. Sometimes you get these disruptions in the stock price, and we just want to take advantage of it. And I think that'll pay out nicely over time. But clearly our top priority remains building the next generation of assets through any form of BD, whether it's BD or M&A or whatever. And obviously, we also \u2013 as Mark highlighted, we have quite a good portfolio coming through our own pipeline.","I want to assure you that we are constantly scanning the environment for all potential assets and doing very rigorous analysis on everything possible. Obviously, we've done a lot of deals already year to date, probably \u2013 on a year-to-date basis we're probably one of the leaders in the industry right now with $10 billion and two big M&A deals and a lot of smaller BD deals. So you should expect us to continue to be aggressive.","Now, obviously we work closely with the credit agencies, so from a capital structure standpoint, we're very cognizant of our credit rating. We want to make sure we're really working within that framework. But we feel very good about the outlook. We meet with the credit agencies regularly. So you should expect us to continue to have as a top priority as we go through this year into 2019 and into 2020 building the pipeline, building the next generation of assets, obviously delivering the exciting five assets that Jay just talked about, but also continuing to add to that portfolio. Because we're working in exciting areas of science. There's a lot of new developments and a lot of interesting opportunities.","Nadim Ahmed - Celgene Corp.","Yeah, and I'll pick up the second question, Michael. So first a reminder that we do actually have two major campaigns in multiple myeloma, both CELMoD and BCMA. And since the question was specific to BCMA, again within BCMA, I think we're uniquely positioned because we have both CAR-T approaches as well as antibody approaches.","So specifically on the CAR-T perspective, especially in the later lines of therapy, response rates \u2013 complete response rates \u2013 are going to be more important. But as you move earlier up in the treatment sequence, of course durability, long-term outcomes like progression-free survival and overall survival are going to be important. So we're going to make sure that we build all of those endpoints into our studies.","And the other thing about CAR-T, of course, is unique that it's a one-time treatment versus a lot of the treatments out there where you have to continue to treat patients indefinitely. So I think we feel very confident about the expansion of our BCMA campaign, both on the CAR-T side and the monoclonal antibody side. Thanks for your question.","Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC","Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges from Leerink. Your line is open.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much for taking the question. A couple just on \u2013 first on pricing. Peter, could you clarify how much positive price contributed to the top line result in the quarter? And then, Mark, is the pricing commitment to healthcare inflation, is that per product or for the whole portfolio in the U.S. or for the whole portfolio globally? And then just on the AUGMENT data that you highlighted, Nadim, do you see R2 being competitive with BR in that second-line setting? Specifically, do you think that your \u2013 do you have to show comparable PFS and potentially OS to be competitive there, or are there other advantages?","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Okay. Hi, Geoffrey. Let me take the first question. So in the second quarter, our revenue grew 16.8%, and so of that, 15.1% was volume \u2013 this is on a global basis, obviously \u2013 and 2.3% of the 16.8% was pricing. And that's a blend of all the products that we have globally. So that's kind of the number for Q2, and I think that's actually been a reasonably consistent pattern for quite some time. So we are getting significant volume growth in our portfolio.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Geoff, it's Mark. On pricing, we've been quite specific that we're talking about indexed to inflation looking at each individual product, not a portfolio approach but a product approach. The other aspect to this, as I said in my prepared remarks and as we published on our website and provided to HHS, we look at incremental value that could come for an existing drug or in the future higher value products where we would be thinking about price-to-value at the moment of launch. So I hope that answers your question. Thank you.","Nadim Ahmed - Celgene Corp.","I'll take the AUGMENT question, Geoff. So I think our view on R2 is obviously we haven't presented a full data set yet, so we'll do that at an upcoming meeting. But very encouraged by the top line results that we see. And I think with follicular lymphoma, given again that this is a chronic indolent disease, I think the opportunity to have a chemo-free option versus something like a bendamustine\/rituximab with the attendant side effects, potential long-term impacts with secondary malignancies, I think we feel very, very good about the profile of R2 being a completely chemotherapy-free option. Thanks.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Your line is open.","Jason Zemansky - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. This is Jason Zemansky on the call for Geoff. Thank you so much for taking the question, and congrats on the quarter. Just a few quick questions. In terms of RELEVANCE specifically, stemming from your comments from ASCO, has there been much of a bump in that kind of first-line, kind of off-label setting for a chemo-free option? Has it been in line with your expectations? And then secondly, in terms of OTEZLA, do you have a sense of when the gross-to-net and inventory issues will sort of become steady moving forward? Can you provide any color on that? Thank you so much.","Nadim Ahmed - Celgene Corp.","Maybe I'll take the RELEVANCE question first. So I think we continue to have very good feedback from the KOLs in the space in terms of again having this chemotherapy-free option. And I think, of course, you have the data and you have the results, and it takes time to kind of see and observe the impact on clinical practice. So certainly encouraged by the feedback so far. We'll continue to monitor the space. And also, of course, we'll monitor the NCCN Compendium guidelines to see when this would be added based on the review of the panel. So very encouraging so far, but we'll continue to monitor the changing clinical practice. Thanks for your question.","Terrie Curran - Celgene Corp.","Thanks, Jason. It's Terrie. So just regarding the inventory as well as the gross-to-net, as noted, we did see some drawing down of inventory in quarter 2. And so when you compare that particularly to 2017, we see some fluctuations. I think importantly, as we head into 2018, 80% of our business is contracted. So from a GTN perspective, you'll see a much more stable year moving forward. And as we look to quarter 3, we've also seen some stabilization of the inventory. So I think as you're looking at your modeling moving forward throughout the year, I think we'll see less of that bumpiness that we saw in 2017. That won't play out in 2018.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Jason, it's Mark. I just wanted to come back a moment to your very appropriate characterization of the RELEVANCE data and, for that matter, the AUGMENT data that we've talked about on the call as being off-label. These are market circumstances, as Nadim points out perfectly well, that a third-party endorsement, for example, the NCCN guidelines, which is independent of anything that we do, the way physicians would think about a chemo-free option, these are things that we cannot promote and aren't marketing. These are clinical choices based on data and endorsements by academia. So I just want to make it clear that you are correct in pointing out that it's off-label. So to the extent that there is utilization, it's really on the back of the value the data sets represent, not a typical commercial environment. So I just wanted to highlight what you said and close out that point by agreeing with you.","Jason Zemansky - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you so much for the color.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So the first one I have is it's increasingly looking like you'll have quite a few regulatory filings going into the first half of 2019. By our count, there could be at least six of them. So clearly a good, high-class problem to have. But could you just talk about how the regulatory organization is structured at this point and whether you have any concerns about capacity constraints?","And then since people are starting to ask more than one question, I'll squeeze one other in, and that's just how should we be thinking about the potential timing of KarMMa data for bb2121, given the protocol amendment to add the 450 dose? Thanks.","Jay T. Backstrom - Celgene Corp.","Yeah, so this is Jay. Let me start on regulatory. We've been aligned and continue to be aligned around not only therapeutic area but products. And we have anticipated and planned for success. So the teams are poised, focused, and so at this juncture we have no capacity issues. We're just continuing to focus on getting these applications in. So that's quite good.","With respect to increasing the 450 dose, we have the good fortune \u2013 this is such an interesting product. We have very much engaged investigators, and they continue to move amendments through. There's actually a waiting list for patients, and that trial continues to accrue. So we'll continue to update as those data go, but right now the clinical trials are really moving nicely. Thanks.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I was just wondering if you could just give us a little bit more detail on the pre-NDA meeting that you had on fedratinib. And it sounds like your plan is still the same plan that you outlined when you acquired the asset at the beginning of the year. And then maybe just talk a little bit about the combination studies and the timelines associated with those that you might pursue. Thanks.","Jay T. Backstrom - Celgene Corp.","Yeah, so for the pre-NDA meeting, those are always very good meetings to get aligned with what we anticipate and what FDA is expecting. So really it was that formality. Generally get good ideas from FDA, and that's being incorporated in the application, but no change in strategy. The basis for that submission is going to be JAKARTA-1 and JAKARTA-2, and so we're framing that and we'll get that in.","And in terms of the combination studies, we really have an interest. We are exploring certainly luspatercept with fedratinib, and I look to Rupert and his team as we have other assets. So those are either in flight or soon to be started.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Brian Abrahams - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi there, thanks for taking my question and congrats on all the progress in the quarter. A question maybe for Jay and\/or Terrie. Just wondering if you could give us any additional color on what you're seeing coming out of the ongoing characterization and bridging work for ozanimod. And how much should we read through to the deprioritization of OTEZLA in IBD as an endorsement of your confidence in maybe how things are going with this ozanimod work? Thanks.","Jay T. Backstrom - Celgene Corp.","Hey, Brian. This is Jay. So what I could say and what I tried to state in my prepared remarks is that our work is proceeding as planned, as expected. We anticipated what we would see, and no surprises as we're pushing on. And we're still on track for Q1.","And with respect to deprioritization and ozanimod, we like ozanimod in UC. We're waiting for that to finish enrolling. We started Crohn's. I think this has a profile and activity that really lends itself well. So that's what we're doing. But beyond that, we're confident in ozanimod at this juncture, for sure.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Brian, it's Mark. Maybe just to add, I think it's important that we think about the scope and the breadth of what the team is talking about today across the five near-term opportunities that we were very specific about, but also how our pipeline is progressing and growing. So let's just, for example, look at luspatercept. On the two studies that we highlighted today and that we look forward to being presented hopefully very soon academically, that opens up a whole question about how to develop something that now has a proven mechanism of action and, as Jay points out, Nadim points out, is a potential platform approach for chronic anemia.","So when we think about the portfolio, I think it should be a conscious discussion for analysts and us that we've got lots of opportunity, and so we're not vertically just looking at portfolio prioritization in a particular franchise or disease category. Increasingly, the company has to look across all of its opportunities and make rational choices about best opportunity, unmet need, consistent with the mission of the company. So I'm not suggesting that that's not the case with OTEZLA UC. I think exactly what Jay talked about and Terrie talked about is important. But as we look forward into the next three to five-year window, we have a lot of robust opportunities to think about investing in. And we will prioritize off and on and shift as we see perhaps differentiated value drivers across the portfolio, not just in a vertical.","Brian Abrahams - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter. First one on JCAR017. I didn't see in the milestones that you're going to present the data for JCAR017 in the diffuse large B-cell. Can you just clarify whether we'll see updated data from that?","And then secondly on bb2121, one of your competitors, GSK, mentioned recently that they're starting a second-line trial for their BCMA ADC. Do you have any plans to start a second-line trial in the near term for myeloma? Thanks.","Nadim Ahmed - Celgene Corp.","Thanks for the questions, Ying. So I think with JCAR017, we of course have been presenting data from the TRANSCEND U.S. study, not the pivotal cohort, because we want to make sure that we're protecting the regulatory submission. So we'll present that at the time that we feel is appropriate to present. So that's the JCAR017.","And I think with the BCMA question, I think I'll go back to what we covered in the previous question. We feel we're uniquely positioned because, again, we have both antibodies and CAR-Ts, and of course we have talked about going from late-line setting all the way up to the front-line setting. So we have a very ambitious plan across our BCMA assets. Thanks for your question.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, Nadim.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Citi. Your line is open.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and a great quarter. Mark, I just want to ask a follow-up question about some of your statements around pricing, two parts. I guess help us understand. I know that Obamacare is changing the rules for the donut hole next year and how that might influence Celgene and your part, given that there's less being paid out of pocket by the manufacturers and by drug manufacturers.","And second, you've talked about limiting price increasing, and you've never rebated. Do you think that will ever have to happen? It seems like the headlines are, we want to see price discounts. We want to see greater discounts given. Give us your thoughts on whether that's ever going to be a reality and then how to think about that donut hole next year. Thanks.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Thanks, Robyn. So on some of the fundamentals, like the donut hole liability that is in the current BBA of 70% versus what was 50%, and then as we looked at our pricing approach going forward, all of those variables have been factored into our outlook for 2019, 2020, and beyond. And so we would be reaffirming our 2020 outlook on the basis of those variables. And so thank you for asking that, because it's very clear that we've looked at that. And whether they change it or not, meaning how the government looks at rebates, whether it's within a program like Medicare Part B or they update Medicare Part D in some way, we've put in a number of conservative assumptions about that, including our new pricing approach.","For us, working with the government, with HHS, we really think about three fundamental things that are important. And that is, first, dealing with patient out-of-pocket costs so that access and affordability will be improved. And we're engaged on that routinely with Secretary Azar and his team. The second area is this development of new, very clear, value-based payment approaches, and that would come from modernizing Part D, and then let's see what happens with Part B. There was an announcement last night about how a demonstration project would likely begin in Part B as in boy. And then the last area that you know that we've been involved in for a very long time is this notion of the virtuous cycle where patented medicines run their course, and then access to samples for generics to do bioequivalence testing would happen as appropriate. So we want to make sure that the Hatch-Waxman provisions that have been so powerful at creating value for patients and healthcare, that we don't shortcut that or undercut that in some way that puts patients at some risk. And the safety systems that have been created over a very long period of time are not somehow modified in the spirit of creating easier access as opposed to safer access.","So those are places where we're working, but I'd just close my comment and tell you what you already know. There are so many moving parts, there are so many considerations with the President's blueprint and how to think about that, that what we're trying to do is make sure that the different scenarios in a conservative way would be built into our shorter- and longer-term financial profile. After that, if it's a little better, that's great. But we're preparing for a lot of these things as if they would happen, so that we know what our position will be and how to operate in an environment that is very fluid.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Newman from Canaccord. Your line is open.","John L. Newman - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Kind of a broad-based question here. You've talked a lot at some of your focused R&D days about your next-generation CELMoDs. What I'm curious about is, is there potentially a way to incorporate those next-generation CELMoDs into treatment where you either combine or sequence with bb2121? Thanks.","Rupert J. Vessey - Celgene Corp.","Hi, it's Rupert Vessey here. So you're talking about CELMoDs as applied to multiple myeloma, and I just want to remind you that of course we have a very broad CELMoD program that goes far beyond just multiple myeloma and looks at a range of other tumors as well. And we've talked about some of that previously in our Protein Homeostasis Day back in 2016. But, yes, absolutely. I think all of the modalities that we have in our myeloma portfolio could be looked at as different types of induction, maintenance, combinations, and we're certainly exploring the latest CELMoD we have in \u2013 or we will be exploring it in earlier lines of therapy for multiple myeloma, as well as the initial trials that we're conducting now. So I think your supposition is accurate.","John L. Newman - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Yatin Suneja, from SunTrust Bank. Your line is open.","Yatin Suneja - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question, and congrats on all the progress. Maybe I'll ask a question on the partner program or the partner compound that is being launched, IDHIFA. Can you comment and give us a little bit more detail on how the launch is progressing? Are you seeing any uptake in the front-line setting, as the NCCN guidelines suggest? It also seems like there was some uptake outside U.S. territories. Can you tell us which territory was that, and how the discussions are ongoing with the European regulator body on that front? Thanks.","Nadim Ahmed - Celgene Corp.","Thanks for the question, Yatin. So we'll do this in two parts, and Jay will address the regulatory part. So I think firstly, I want to congratulate our partners, Agios Pharmaceuticals, on the approval and launch of the IDH1 molecule. I think it's a great day for patients when that happens. So that's really great news. Second, with IDHIFA in the U.S., the launch is going very well, and in fact what we're seeing is continued increase in testing for IDH2, which I think is very, very encouraging. So I think we continue to be pleased with the progress of this subset of patients that really seems to be benefiting from this unique and novel molecule. So things are going very well in the U.S. And I'll pass on the regulatory question to Jay.","Jay T. Backstrom - Celgene Corp.","Yeah, and we continue to advance through other markets or other regions, so in Europe, et cetera. So we're continuing to advance the IDHIFA, yes.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Hey, Crystal, we have time for one last caller.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from Carter Gould from UBS. Your line is open.","Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. Thanks for fitting me in and taking the question. Questions for Nadim and Jay. It was encouraging to hear Mark emphasize luspatercept as a platform for chronic anemias. Any color on the specific additional indications you might be looking at beyond MDS, beta-thal, and MS, and when we might hear on that front? And I guess given that importance, should we be thinking about those efforts starting post-approval or potentially earlier? Thank you.","Nadim Ahmed - Celgene Corp.","Thanks for the question. So actually a couple of things. So, one, again, I think I'm going to reemphasize a point we made earlier in the quarter: The fact that we now have very impactful impact in anemia from distinct diseases, this has got us very, very excited. But of course life cycle management was going on way before we got the results for the Phase III study. So I think the team is working up all the potential scenarios and indications that we could be looking at. So we'll keep you updated as that progresses. But clearly this has the opportunity to be a platform molecule in the chronic anemia space. Very exciting.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","And as we work to define that further, we're going to continue to advance, as I mentioned, and commence in moving this upfront, so we've got a lot of motion going now, and we'll have more to come.","Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","So thank you very much for the questions. This is Peter. I'm just going to wrap up. I think obviously you take away from this Q&A and the discussion of the slides and the financials, this has been an exciting quarter. Obviously a lot of momentum building. We're pretty excited about having three sets of great clinical data, luspatercept in MDS, luspatercept in beta-thal, AUGMENT. In addition, all the ABRAXANE work that's been going on, also very exciting. Jay and his team, as highlighted earlier, have got a really rich agenda going forward on a regulatory front, and the team is, I know, fully engaged on that. So that's pretty exciting.","We did seize the moment in the first half of this year from a share repurchase standpoint and pulled forward what we saw was a great opportunity. So hopefully the guidance helps you think through how that plays out. But think of it clearly as a pull-forward, and so you should expect lower levels of share repurchase going forward.","And then obviously we've done over $10 billion of M&A and BD already year to date, so we are building the pipeline aggressively. We're seeing success in the pipeline. We're very excited about the future. So as was highlighted in one of the questions, 2019 and 2020 are shaping up to be very event-driven and eventful years ahead. So that's really exciting.","And I guess I'd like to wrap up by thanking Mark, but also welcoming, again, David to Celgene. I think we're very excited to have David on board, and I'm looking forward to my role from a strategic standpoint continuing the momentum at Celgene. So thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect.

I would like to remind you that this call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Flanigan, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations at Celgene. Please go ahead.","Patrick E. Flanigan - Celgene Corp.","Thanks, Stephanie, and welcome, everyone, to our third quarter earnings conference call. The press release reporting our financial results in addition to the presentation for today's webcast can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the corporate website at www.celgene.com.","Joining me in the room today with prepared remarks are: Mark Alles, our Chief Executive Officer; Peter Kellogg, our Chief Financial Officer; Jackie Fouse, our Chief Operating Officer; Michael Pehl, President of our Hematology & Oncology franchise; and Scott Smith, President and Global Head of our Inflammation & Immunology franchise.","As a reminder, during today's call we will be making forward-looking statements regarding our financial outlook in addition to regulatory and product development plans. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those forecasted. A description of these risks can be found in our most recent 10-Q on file with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we undertake no duty to update or revise them. Reconciliation of the adjusted financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available as part of the earnings release.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mark.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Patrick. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We had an outstanding third quarter and are excited to review and discuss the results with you, our outlook for the remainder of the year, and our confidence and optimism in our future.","During the quarter, our global therapeutic franchises continued to build strong demand momentum for our major cancer and immunology products. The value proposition these therapies bring to patients, physicians, and providers combined with exceptional execution led to a meaningful acceleration of sales, allowing us to again raise our full-year 2016 guidance and provide an update to our 2017 outlook. Following my comments, Peter will review these numbers and the drivers of our financial performance.","In addition to providing their insights about our commercial results, Michael and Scott will review the progress we are making advancing several major late-stage programs in their franchises. Important new and updated clinical information supporting these programs was recently presented, especially study results that continue to demonstrate the transformative potential of both GED-0301 in Crohn's disease and ozanimod in ulcerative colitis. They will also preview the range of data we expect to be published or presented at major medical meetings during the fourth quarter.","I'd like to again thank many of you and your colleagues for joining us at the September investor deep dive into one of Celgene's core areas of research expertise, protein homeostasis. We are at the forefront of research aimed at understanding and manipulating the biological pathways within cells that control the function and degradation of proteins implicated in cancer and inflammatory diseases. The early programs that are emerging from this important scientific platform combined with our internal discovery efforts in immuno-oncology, inflammation, epigenetics, and with external collaboration partners are increasing our opportunities to discover and develop more best-in-class or first-in-class molecules.","Our novel approach to drug discovery, complementing organic expertise with a network of collaboration partners, is delivering. Working together, we have filed eight investigational New Drug Applications this year while continuing to invest in discovery platforms with the potential to deliver breakthrough medicines for patients with serious diseases.","At this time every year, our executive leadership team comes together for an in-depth review of our long-range strategic plan. We conducted our 2016 review just last week. In addition to reaffirming Celgene's mission and purpose, we reinforced our understanding of and confidence in the robust opportunities we have for sustained high growth. The momentum of our existing products, the potential of our pipeline and broad collaboration network, and the innovation and execution of our high-performing teams are key drivers of our optimism.","We also focused on our financial strategies to ensure we are investing in research, commercial, business development, and capital structure programs that have the greatest potential to make a meaningful difference in the lives of patients and to generate long-term shareholder value. Our business model creates the most value for all stakeholders when we invent medicines that improve and extend the lives of patients today while we invest in therapies that may cure patients in the future.","Our principled approach to pricing innovative therapies is driven by the value they deliver to patients and to healthcare systems. At Celgene, we continuously seek to work collaboratively with providers, payers, patient advocacy organizations, and governments to maximize patient access and ensure that incentives exist to encourage research that improves outcomes and ultimately that lowers the total cost of healthcare around the world. Discovering and developing medicines that have clearly differentiated benefits for patients has and always will determine the level of our success.","Before opening the call for your questions, Jackie will provide her perspective on our operating performance, business drivers, strategic positioning, and the exceptional potential we have for long-term growth.","We are incredibly energized by our year-to-date progress, and I'd like to thank my colleagues across all functions and around the world for their committed efforts on behalf of patients we serve today and the patients we seek to serve in the future.","Thank you, and please help me welcome Peter to the call.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone.","Q3 was another exceptional quarter, driven by strong operating performance across the organization. The continued commercial momentum with our core products enables us to raise our 2016 guidance for the third consecutive quarter. Due to the strong positioning of our products within the marketplace, we expect this increased momentum to continue into next year, and we now expect to achieve the high end of the previously revised 2017 range for total product sales and adjusted earnings per share. We are delivering this level of financial performance while we advance our pipeline and make strategic investments to access external innovation, all of which positions the company to grow through 2020 and well beyond.","Turning to the quarter, total net product sales in Q3 were over $2.9 billion, a 28% year-over-year increase, a significant acceleration versus Q3 growth rates in the prior two years. Consistent with prior periods, our growth was predominantly volume-driven, as product volume grew 25%. The contribution to growth from price remains relatively small and can fluctuate in any given period due to the timing of pricing actions throughout the year.","Now the third quarter benefited from approximately $70 million in tender offer sales of REVLIMID to Russia. Excluding these Russian purchases, total net product sales still grew 25% year over year. Please recall that last year the Russian orders occurred in the second and fourth quarters. And for your modeling, we do not anticipate any Russian tender business in the fourth quarter. What is clear is that REVLIMID, POMALYST, and OTEZLA are having outstanding years and are greatly expanding usage. Michael and Scott will share their perspectives on this strong underlying volume growth and the demand drivers for these products later in the call.","Third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $1.58, a year-on-year growth of 28%. Operating income accounted for the entire increase in earnings. Below operating income, the benefit from a lower diluted share count was offset by a full quarter of interest expense related to the debt issued to acquire Receptos in August last year and a higher tax rate due to geographic mix.","Our operating model remains flexible and aligned with our strategic direction. During 2016, we have continued to increase our R&D investment as we support our growing pipeline and research efforts. At the same time, we have leveraged our global commercial infrastructure despite increasing coverage of our international I&I sales organization. The net result is a continued improvement in the adjusted operating margin of 80 basis points in Q3 and a 200 basis points improvement year to date when compared to prior periods.","We ended the third quarter with approximately $6.9 billion in cash and marketable securities. Now we continue to balance deploying capital between our share repurchase program and strategic transactions to access external innovations such as the EngMab deal. Striking the right balance is critical as we prioritize our strategic initiatives to position the company to grow through the next decade. For the first nine months, we repurchased $2 billion in common stock and entered into six strategic transactions.","In summary, the business is performing very well. The year-to-date operating momentum places us on track this year to achieve sales of approximately $11.2 billion and adjusted earnings per share of between $5.58 (sic) [$5.88] and $5.92 per share. This implies a fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS growth rate in the range of 31% to 35%. So as you can see, we expect the earnings momentum to continue right through to year end. For 2017, we are now on track to achieve the high end of our previously revised ranges for total net product sales and adjusted earnings per share, so really a great quarter.","I would now like to turn the call over to my colleague, Michael.","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone.","Q3 2016 was another great quarter for Hematology & Oncology, my sincere thanks to our teams worldwide for an outstanding performance, with impressive growth in key brands and across geographies. In addition, we made robust progress with key development programs for multiple pipeline assets.","We had a record performance in Q3 with 24% year-over-year and 8% sequential revenue growth. REVLIMID end demand growth continues in launched countries, and we have secured reimbursement in most key markets where we have not yet had a full year of revenues in many European markets.","POMALYST\/IMNOVID continues to grow, and IMNOVID-based triplet combination is increasing utilization, driving share and duration. ABRAXANE is maintaining its position in the U.S., with stable market shares in breast, lung, and pancreatic cancer, and is growing outside the U.S. in pancreatic cancer.","We made significant process on our pipeline during the quarter. We expect to submit a New Drug Application to FDA for AG-221 in relapsed\/refractory AML by year end. We have further advanced our CC-122 program in a variety of diseases, and our FUSION program for durvalumab continues to enroll six trials in hematologic diseases. Our luspatercept and CC-486 programs enrolled well into pivotal programs in myeloid malignancies.","Through our recent acquisition of EngMab and their lead molecule, EM901, Celgene is now uniquely positioned to pursue many (13:09) development opportunities using two key platforms, CAR-T and CD-3 redirected killing.","Our teams are diligently preparing for the upcoming ASH [American Society of Hematology] conference in San Diego. We expect to have a robust set of data presentations across both our inline brands and pipeline assets.","REVLIMID had an outstanding third quarter with 30% year-over-year and 11% sequential revenue growth, reflecting strong underlying demand across the globe. The ongoing immunological advice (13:38) provides significant market share gains in key markets where we have reimbursement. In addition, we secured NDMM [Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma] reimbursement for Italy in September. We expect to have reimbursement in Switzerland by the end of the year and in France by Q1 2017. Duration continues to increase in all geographies.","REVLIMID [RD] benefits from a stream of positive data, including another New England Journal of Medicine publication, the PALACE trial. As a reminder, these data for RD plus daratumumab in relapsed\/refractory myeloma demonstrate an estimated progression-free survival for the combination of well over 14 months. Coupled with the FDA Breakthrough status for RD plus daratumumab for treatment in relapsed\/refractory myeloma, we are optimistic about a major growth opportunity ahead for REVLIMID.","In addition, we have submitted applications to the FDA and EMA for REVLIMID as maintenance treatment in NDMM patients after receiving autologous stem cell transplantation. The FDA has provided the application with a Priority Review designation and a PDUFA [Prescription Drug User Fee Act] date of February 24, 2017. The decision of the European authority is expected in the first half of 2017.","Furthermore, we are excited about the REVLIMID myeloma data to be presented at ASH this year, including final overall survival data for MM-020 and key analysis for Myeloma XI. This trial, conducted by the MRC [Medical Research Council] study group in the UK, randomized more than 3,800 transplant-eligible and transplant-ineligible newly diagnosed myeloma patients, and is the largest myeloma study to date. REVLIMID has been investigated both in the induction and maintenance setting, and respective results will be presented at the congress.","POMALYST\/IMNOVID had strong growth, with 33% year-over-year and 7% sequential growth. Most launched markets have achieved leadership positions in the third-line-plus patient segment, and duration continues to grow. POMALYST\/IMNOVID demand continues to grow in spite of some competitive pressure in the fourth-line-plus patient segments with the launch of daratumumab. We have seen overall demand increase due to the use of POMALYST in triplet combinations, including in combination with daratumumab. NCCN guidelines were recently updated to include three POMALYST-based triplets for relapsed\/refractory myeloma. In addition, FDA has recently granted Standard Review to daratumumab in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for relapsed\/refractory myeloma, with a PDUFA data in June 2017.","During the third quarter, we received EMA approval for an IMNOVID label update for patients with renal impairment, facilitating the use of pomalidomide in this difficult to treat patient population. We expect all of these growth drivers to lead to share and duration gains in the future.","We are successfully enrolling key development programs for POMALYST\/IMNOVID to further support the use of multiple combinations. Our Phase III OPTIMISMM trial in combination with bortezomib in second or later treatment lines is on track to complete enrollment in the first half of 2017.","ABRAXANE continues to have stable performance. ABRAXANE grew 1% year over year, with growth coming from outside of the United States. U.S. ABRAXANE maintained its leadership position in pancreatic cancer, and demand is stable in breast and lung cancer in spite of the underlying competitive dynamics. Outside of the U.S., ABRAXANE grew 5% year over year and 20% quarter over quarter, driven by pancreatic cancer in markets with reimbursement, including Germany, Spain, and Italy.","ABRAXANE has generated additional impactful data in difficult to treat solid tumors. Data from multiple studies evaluating the use of ABRAXANE alone, in standard combinations, or in combination with novel agents in pancreatic cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, and non-small-cell lung cancer represented during the ESMO [European Society of Medical Oncology] meeting in October. We plan to present the results of the ABRAXANE randomized Phase II TENACITY trial in first-line triple-negative breast cancer at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December. Data from the ABRAXANE abound lung cancer studies will be presented at the World Congress on Lung Cancer in December. And we are awaiting the results of the ongoing pivotal ABRAXANE\/Tecentriq combination trials in non-small-cell lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer.","Additional Celgene data will be presented at several key congresses by year end. In addition to the Myeloma XI and MM-020 studies that I already mentioned, data presentations at the forthcoming ASH Congress in San Diego includes our REMARC study of REVLIMID maintenance in elderly first-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients, data for REVLIMID maintenance in CLL from the CONTINUUM trial, an interim analysis of our ASCO MAGNIFY study in indolent lymphoma, as well as CC-122\/CD20 combination data in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and indolent lymphoma. In addition, a number of our collaboration partners will be presenting data on early and midstage assets.","As I noted earlier, we'll have key ABRAXANE presentations at the World Congress on Lung Cancer and the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium before year end. We also very excited about the very encouraging Phase I marizomib data in combination with AVASTIN in glioblastoma, to be presented by our partner Triphase at the Society for Neurooncology in November.","In addition to the excellent performance of our inline brands, we are making very good progress in advancing our early and later-stage pipeline. The luspatercept collaboration with Acceleron continues to advance. Our two Phase III trials in lower-risk MDS and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia are enrolling extremely well. And we are actively engaged in planning to further maximize the opportunity of the assets in additional patient segments and indications.","We are making progress with our I-O pipeline and CD9, CMPC (19:38), and CAR-T programs with our partners Juno and bluebird bio. We received an EMA Prime designation for the development of JCAR015 in adult relapsed\/refractory ALL in Europe, which may enable accelerated development and approval.","The FUSION program is advancing, evaluating durvalumab in combination with key inline brands and novel agents. We expect data readouts to begin in early 2017.","Our recent acquisition of EngMab and their lead molecule EM901 further complements our industry-leading portfolio and pipeline of myeloma assets. We see B-cell maturation antigen, BCMA, as an ideal target from immune-based therapies such as CAR-T and CD3 redirected killing. Celgene is uniquely positioned to pursue BCMA development opportunities using both platforms, which we view as highly complementary. In addition to monotherapy, both platforms provide the opportunity for rational combination therapies with our CELMoDs and checkpoint inhibitors in order to further improve treatment efficacy, as well as for clinical department in other BCMA expressing B-cell malignancies such as lymphoma.","Finally, we are aggressively pursuing our protein homeostasis pipeline. The CC-122 program is enrolling multiple proof-of-concept studies in myeloma, lymphoma, CLL, and hepatocellular carcinoma both as monotherapy and in combination with new agents. The data obtained will allow us to start making pivotal decisions in the first half of 2017. In addition and as highlighted at our research meeting in New York earlier this month, our new AML CELMoDs, CC-90009, has progressed into Phase I. And we have identified additional CELMoDs successor compounds with high potential in various hematological malignancies.","In summary, our Hematology & Oncology franchise has had another outstanding quarter. Our key brands have delivered strong financial performance, and the momentum gives us the confidence to raise our outlook for 2016 and 2017. Our early and late-stage clinical programs have advanced nicely during the quarter, and the acquisition of EngMab is a perfect fit for our myeloma and lymphoma pipeline.","Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Scott.","Scott A. Smith - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Michael, and good morning.","Q3 was an important quarter for I&I, full of advancement for both our marketed and pipeline assets. With OTEZLA, we've seen revenue continue to accelerate throughout the quarter, with growth in both psoriasis and PSA indications, as demand, market share, and persistency continue to increase. At the same time, we have expanded the global access footprint for OTEZLA. As of this month, reimbursement for OTEZLA has now been achieved in 20 countries worldwide. In Q3, we advanced development of our pipeline programs, progressing multiple assets through important milestones.","Turning now to OTEZLA, global net sales for Q3 were $275 million. This represents a 98% year on year increase. Sales in Q3 continued to grow despite the regular market declines in prescribing typically seen in the summer months. While we remain focused on launch execution in Germany and other early launch markets, we were able to achieve critical reimbursement decisions in several key European markets.","NICE created a positive opinion for OTEZLA in psoriasis, which reverses previous guidance and enables access for patients in England and Wales. With multiple positive reimbursement decisions in hand, we are now preparing to execute the next wave of launches in the EU.","Focusing now on the U.S. market dynamics, the physician and consumer campaigns continue to drive increases in demand for OTEZLA. With a sustained leadership position in new-to-brand share, we are seeing a continued rise in market share for OTEZLA, which now represents more than 1\/5 of the systemic treated psoriasis market. Consistent with the OTEZLA value proposition and pricing strategy to date, much of this growth is coming from the pre-biologic market segment.","Last week, the interim results from the GED-0301 CD-001 trial were presented as a late-breaker at the UEGW [United European Gastroenterology Week] meeting in Vienna. These results represent an early exploratory look at the data and are part of a broader development program that is well underway.","As a reminder, the objective of this study was to evaluate clinical response, clinical remission, and endoscopic improvements in a broader, more difficult to treat Crohn's population than studied previously. It enrolled 63 patients across three active treatment groups. All patients had confirmed endoscopic damage at baseline and clinically advanced disease. The CD-001 results are generally consistent with the clinical outcomes seen in the placebo-controlled IGON program and support GED utilization across a broad Crohn's patient population.","With the IGON studies, there was compelling evidence to view GED-0301 as a potentially transformational therapy. As an oral treatment with unprecedented rates of clinical response and remission and negligible systemic exposure, it could allow patients to be treated in a fundamentally different way than other therapies in development or on the market.","In CD-001 with a more heterogeneous population, GED-0301 demonstrated meaningful clinical and endoscopic outcomes across different patient types, including TNF-naive and failures, those with prior surgeries, as well as patients with proximal and distal disease. Once confirmed in pivotal programs, we are confident that this product will be transformational for patient care.","Data rollout is expected to continue through the rest of the year. The focus of these data will be the 3 and 4-year results from the PALACE and ESTEEM programs, which show a highly differentiated benefit\/risk profile for OTEZLA relative to other competitive products. Data from positive Phase II studies for RPC4046 in EOE and CC-220 in lupus will also be disseminated.","Q3 was a quarter full of advancement for Celgene I&I. OTEZLA's share and duration continued to improve, while access gains expand the geographic breadth of the product. OTEZLA is well on track to achieve blockbuster status in 2016 and in the years to come.","We moved all major development programs ahead and look forward to multiple upcoming proof-of-concept study readouts, including GED and OTEZLA in UC, ozanimod in Crohn's disease, and CC-220 in cutaneous lupus.","We are very excited and optimistic about the future of OTEZLA and the rest of the I&I portfolio.","Thank you for your attention this morning, and I'd like to turn the call over to Jackie.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Scott.","Q3 was a fabulous quarter for Celgene. Quarters like this are only made possible by the cumulative hard work of our teams around the world, work that builds over time to produce the type of momentum we are currently generating. Our Q3 performance demonstrates we are stronger than ever, and we advance into 2017 and the coming years in a great position.","Our 2016 milestone chart shows us well on track to achieve what we set out to achieve this year, and we feel very good about where we are at this point in the fourth quarter. Even though there are only two months remaining in the year, there is still exciting data to be presented at ACR [American College of Rheumatology], ASH, San Antonio Breast, and other medical meetings, so stay tuned for those presentations.","This year, we started to see data readouts from the Phase III trials in our pipeline. This is just the beginning of a multiyear period, during which we will have readouts on a number of potentially transformative programs. Michael and Scott spoke about some of these. The Phase III trials still to read out over the coming 12 to 24 months give us the potential: to see upside for ABRAXANE in immuno-oncology combination therapies; to expand ABRAXANE's presence in pancreatic cancer; to take REVLIMID into lymphoma; to further expand and diversify our myeloid business; to see the expansion and diversification of our I&I franchise with two new compounds, ozanimod and GED-0301, and two new therapeutic categories, multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease; and much more.","We will also have Phase II and proof-of-concept data for a number of indications across several compounds, including CC-122, CC-220, durvalumab, CAR-T, CC-486, and demcizumab, and the flow of data will be strong and steady for some time to come.","On the commercial side, building on the strong momentum of 2016, in 2017 we look forward to launches across multiple geographies for REVLIMID in the stem cell transplant setting of newly diagnosed myeloma; the U.S. launch of AG-221 in IDH2-mutated AML; the ongoing global uptake of triplet regimens on IMiD backbones; and the geographic expansion of OTEZLA, including the important market of Japan.","These commercial catalysts and the clinical catalysts I highlighted give us high confidence in our ability to deliver on our 2017 and 2020 targets and produce strong growth for many years beyond.","Let me close by thanking our teams around the world for their performance and thank you for listening to our call today.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Thank you, Jackie. This is Peter.","Just coming back for one second, I guess I was a little bit dazzled by the Q3 numbers, so I misread actually our adjusted 2016 EPS range. I just want to clarify. As it says in our press release and our slide, we expect our EPS for 2016 on an adjusted basis to be in the range of $5.88 to $5.92. I apologize for missing that one.","But with that, great quarter, we look forward to answering your questions. Operator, we can take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and let me be the first to say great job on the quarter. So my question is on REVLIMID, and there is two parts. So the first is when thinking about NDMM, so post-transplant maintenance, how do think doctors are going to feel about this benefit? You highlighted it at the market. And what gives you confidence that the regulators are confident in filing? And is it being used here at all? So help us understand. What is the opportunity here and what doctors think?","And then second, you talked about duration of therapy going up for REVLIMID with these combinations. How do we think about where the inflection point is, given duration, or triple combos probably started a year ago \u2013 or you started. How do we think about when there could be a greater inflection point on duration of therapy to come up? Thanks.","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","Hi, Robyn. This is Michael. Thanks for the question. So on NDMM, there is a very distinct post-transplant opportunity in Europe. So transplantation maintenance has been developed a lot by European investigators, but there is no usage because there is no approval and reimbursement at this moment of time. So there's a very distinct opportunity.","When it comes to the U.S., there is usage, driven by the data, but I can remind you as to what happens with our NDMM launch in elderly patients. So once we have the launch and the opportunity to really talk about it and educate, the market shares and the duration went up, and we're going to see the same thing happening in the U.S. in this situation. So it's an opportunity for both sides of the Atlantic, although I would say the opportunity for Europe is probably slightly bigger. So that's the first part of the question.","With the second part, you're right. Talking about treatment duration, you just have to think about where we are with progression-free survival with the triplet combination. At this moment of time, those which are approved already provide anything between 20 to 28 months. Our current treatment duration in the U.S. is 18 months. And then you have the PALACE trial that was recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine, where we are talking about progression-free survival of 40 to 50 months.","Treatment duration needs a little bit of time to build up, and that's the point that I wanted to make. Once a drug is available and the clinical data is there and the approval is there, it needs a little bit of time to build up. So we need to go beyond the 18 months. I think when you're looking at our results, we already see the impact of the treatment duration really impacting very positively with our new label in transplant-eligible NDMM. And with the PALACE data, we think this is going to accelerate even further.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alethia Young with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. I just wanted to talk about REV a little bit in Europe. And maybe you can characterize with Italy or France where you are in market share. Have doctors started to already adopt this, or are you very low, in the 10% range of market share there? Thanks.","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","Thanks for the question. This is Michael again. So when we're thinking about REVLIMID in Europe and the performance of NDMM, it all starts with our ability of reimbursement. So we have reimbursement now in 20 European countries. As I said in my prepared remarks, we just got reimbursement in Italy. In Q4, we're going to get reimbursement in Switzerland, and France is coming in Q1. When we're looking at our market shares worldwide driven by our NDMM launch, they are absolutely what we expected. In the U.S., market shares are going up. In all the European markets, they are going up. In Japan, they are going up very nicely, so we are actually very, very confident and very happy about that.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Do you think in France, they're still very low so you have an opportunity to go into the mid-50s?","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","There is some uptake in France because in France there's a situation where, under certain circumstances, physicians can actually can prescribe REVLIMID in a first-line setting, but it's not yet fully reimbursed, so we have a base level of usage. And we expect a significant acceleration as from Q1 when the full reimbursement is going to be achieved.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Katherine Breedis with Stifel. Your line is open.","Katherine Breedis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for taking my questions. These are excellent, really volume driven results, and it's nice to see another solid guidance raise for the year. With respect to the upcoming ASH meeting, we were also hopeful we might see data from the Phase 1 study investigating POMALYST in combination with durvalumab in multiple myeloma as well as the Phase 1 study investigating CC-122 in advanced solid tumors, NHL, and multiple myeloma. Do you think these may still be possible potentially as late breakers, or should we turn our sights to a future medical meeting in 2017?","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","Hi, Katherine. Thanks for the question. This is Michael. So I think what we're going to see when it comes to the combination with daratumumab, there's going to be an update to be provided with pomalidomide. The durvalumab combination data are still going to take a little bit of time. As with all I-O therapies, the response rates and the benefit builds over time. So what I said in my prepared remarks was actually like we have to wait a little bit and we're going to have the readouts by early next year.","Regarding CC-122, we're going to see I think really intriguing and interesting data with combination with CD20 in follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Particularly to your question of durvalumab, we really want to give the data the time that it takes in order to really facilitate decision-making. So it's taking a little bit more time, but by the beginning of next year we are there.","Katherine Breedis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great, thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mara Goldstein with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Mara Goldstein - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Thanks very much for taking the question. I had a question on AG-221, which you expect to submit an NDA for by the end of this year. Can you just maybe \u2013 I just want to explore for a second how that product will be positioned within the portfolio of in other hematological products and what we should specifically expect from a carve-out perspective for AG-221 versus REVLIMID and POMALYST and all the other indications you guys are working on.","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","Hi, Mara. This is Michael. Thanks for the question. So we are extremely confident to be able to submit AG-221 by the end of the year for two reasons. Number one is really this very distinct medical need, especially in relapsed\/refractory AML where there's very little available. So if you have targeted therapy that is extremely well-tolerated and very effective, that makes you very confident when you go in front of a regulatory authority. The other thing is that our data has matured. So when it comes to the efficacy of the drug, the response rates, and the duration of the response, we feel very, very confident.","The positioning of this drug is really targeted for this subset of patients that come along with an IDH2 mutation. We're starting in relapsed\/refractory AML. We have actually also an ongoing randomized study, and then we bring it up into the first-line setting, and respective studies are running already. I can remind you that we have a combination study with VIDAZA. We have a combination study with 7+3 ongoing. And that complements the other things that we are developing in AML. I was talking briefly about a new AML CELMoDs which makes us very excited, and we should really expect very deep responses. And we certainly have our immuno-oncology therapy program ongoing. So there's a lot of stuff ongoing in I-O. This drug is particularly for the subset of patients coming along with an IDH2 mutation.","Mara Goldstein - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. And just from a detailing perspective, is this something that REVLIMID reps will detail as well, or this will be a specialty carve-out sales force?","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","As we have an ongoing myeloid business, I think we can use our existing infrastructure very nicely.","Mara Goldstein - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay, thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much. Michael, a follow on the theme of REVLIMID. First, it was very helpful to hear the duration in the U.S. Could you give us a sense of where you think average duration is outside the U.S.? And then just related to that, you highlighted daratumumab and of course the imminent approval of the daratumumab-REVLIMID-dexamethasone data. That's a second line label, of course. And could you talk about how your market research suggests physicians are going to change their practice patterns to accommodate daratumumab-REVLIMID-dexamethasone? Would that have a negative effect perhaps on POMALYST? And also, do you think it will change any of their prescribing in the front-line setting as soon as that's approved? Thanks.","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","Hi, Geoff. This is Michael. Thanks for the questions. So starting with the duration in the U.S., when we're looking at the first use of the product, we are currently at 18 months. As you probably know, REVLIMID is not just used once. The combination with other drugs allows others to use it once again. So the overall treatment duration is now 24 months, and it's constantly increasing.","The REVLIMID-daratumumab data is actually really intriguing because 40 to 50 months of progression-free survival in relapsed\/refractory myeloma is absolutely intriguing. It's not going to have an impact on the overall treatment sequence in pomalidomide yet likely. But I think it's going to be in a way that, especially in the U.S., REVLIMID-daratumumab is going to be quickly taken up to first-line usage, as it is such a great regimen. And that allows pomalidomide to then really go into the second-line space and be used immediately after. So if you have a great triplet to start with, you want have another triplet to go on with. And the sequence of REVLIMID and pomalidomide is actually extremely compelling, and that's something we're seeing already in the market happening.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks so much. Regarding OTEZLA, I'll give Michael a break for a second. Hey, Scott, on OTEZLA, strong growth here, which actually looked like it was different than a lot of third-party data. But my question actually relates to 2017 and your confidence around hitting those numbers. It wasn't necessarily cited related to comments around guidance for 2017 there and your confidence.","And then I guess for the company just generally, I think most people know about the additional Paragraph IV filing that was filed to the FDA. Could you just make a brief comment and put some perspective around that and remind about of the importance of that and where you stand as it relates to IP on REVLIMID? Thanks so much.","Scott A. Smith - Celgene Corp.","Thank you very much for the question. I feel very confident in the direction of OTEZLA for finishing this year and going into 2017. I think we have a lot of momentum. And specifically to 2017, I think we have a high degree of confidence. I'm very excited about the fact that we are just now starting to launch in some really major impactful countries, France, England, and Wales, Japan early next year. There's a lot of geographic expansion, and we see the market shares in the U.S. continue to grow. So we feel very good about the targets that are out there.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Hey, Michael. It's Mark.

So thanks for the question, but we're pursuing all legal defense of our patent estate.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Raymond with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, thanks. I wonder if I could go back to maybe the situation in Europe with REVLIMID and IMNOVID. So I know you probably don't want to talk too much about pricing specifically. But now that you've gone through maybe a round of yearly discussions in at least a few countries with the new label, generally are things with respect to pricing versus what you expected in the beginning of the process?","And maybe a related question, as I recall when REVLIMID was initially priced in Europe, it was priced higher than the U.S., with the thinking that there would be maybe a convergence over time. Where are we generally with that trend? Have the two trends crossed, et cetera? Any color there would be appreciated. Thanks.","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","Thanks, Chris. Hi, this is Michael. And I still owe Geoff also the question that you were just asking. So the treatment duration in Europe is not quite where the U.S. is, and it's understandable because a lot of the duration in the U.S. of course is driven by this year-long availability of the first-line treatment. So in Europe, we are roundabout 13 to 14 months at this moment of time, increasing foreseeingly with the NDMM launch. And as I said in the U.S., first usage 18 months, and then aggregate use 24 months. So there's still a really good way to go for Europe, and the NDMM launch is going to absolutely drive this.","With your question of NDMM pricing, I think the speed upon which we've been getting the 20 reimbursements in Europe should provide you with confidence that there's a lot of appreciation of the data and the value proposition of REVLIMID in newly diagnosed myeloma with payers. And by the way, the overall survival data in the MM-020 data is really driving that, and we are happy to be able to provide an update of these data. At ASH, though, you can all look at this.","As a consequence, the price reductions that you have to have in some European markets, not in all but in some, with the new label will absolutely moderate and 100% in line with our expectations. Of course, there is this trend in the U.S. where you can maintain a price or increase a price upon value proposition. And in Europe, payers are driving you down, so the trends of course of prices in U.S. and Europe are absolutely not the same. What I can tell you is that we are extremely happy with the speed but then also with the appreciation and support that we got by payers in the NDMM situation in Europe.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","Hi, it's Mark. Just setting aside the mechanics of price for a second, what we've seen, and I think Michael would agree with me, the value proposition of the triplets is being well recognized by payers around the world. So as we negotiate value and look at the opportunity that these triplets offer, remember, the clinical profiles are essentially taking what was becoming a chronic disease and making it virtually a chronic disease. In that context, duration is going to be a big driver, but we've been very pleased at how across the board and around the world, negotiation on the basis of value versus costs are playing out.","Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great color, guys. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, thanks for taking the question. You mentioned in the slide and your remarks about REVLIMID data from the CONTINUUM and MAGNIFY trials. I just wondered if you can give us any more insights there. And I know you had press released the REMARK data, but why not press release the data from these two studies? Thanks.","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","Hi, thanks. This is Michael. Thanks for the question. So what I can share with you and for everybody on the call, so CONTINUUM is a randomized study of REVLIMID maintenance in relapsed CLL post-induction therapy, so we're testing maintenance therapy here. So what I can share with you is that the co-primary endpoint, which is progression-free survival, was achieved in CONTINUUM and that the overall survival data is still immature. That said, these data are really going to provide us with very, very important information for the future positioning and investigation of CELMoDs in CLL.","And we think that there is a very distinct need for better therapies in CLL, and we think also that CELMoDs are an excellent drug class for that purpose. When you're thinking of patients who are relapsing out of ibrutinib, when you think about the really low CR rate and when you're thinking about the very high number and proportion of MLD-positive patients with CLL, there is a distinct need for better therapies. We are very excited in that context about CC-122. With think it has a really differentiated immune profile, and CC-122 is going to be the drug to be moved forward. But CONTINUUM is going to help us to do this in the best possible way.","The data that we're going to show with MAGNIFY, which is our R-squared study in indolent lymphoma, is an interim analysis. So we'll be able to compare the data, the Phase II data that adds actually less to our programs than ongoing our pivotal programs, and confirm those with a much, much bigger patient population that we've been including and magnifying. We feel extremely positive about that, and so we're going to show the data at ASH.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Eric Schmidt, Ph.D. - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning. I was a little surprised by Peter's open-ended guidance for REVLIMID sales in 2017. I didn't think that was very much like him, at least his historical conservatism. So is this drug now on a different growth trajectory? For the last three or four years we've seen very, very steady high teens year-on-year growth, and obviously in this quarter ex-the Russian shipments it was 25%. Are we seeing an inflection? Thank you.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","Hi, Eric. It's Jackie. I'm just going to say we're trying to have a positive influence on Peter. Go ahead, Peter.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","I think there's a compliment in there somewhere, but anyway. Maybe I'll turn to Michael first. I think the first thing we talked about perhaps on the basis of your question is really the trend in REVLIMID when you stand back. Worldwide, you can see the results in Q3. We commented; with or without the Russian tender, the growth rates are just great. And obviously, it's the impact of data that's been built up over quite some period of time. So maybe, Michael, you could just comment on that in a broader...","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","I'm just repeating the growth drivers that I was trying to summarize in my prepared remarks. So the MM launch in U.S. and Europe, the ongoing MM launch upon MM-020 and the label that we have is one. The triplet combination \u2013 and many of them have been approved and reimbursed in U.S. and in Europe are another one. Now we have the next accelerator, and we were just saying that we were receiving Priority Review designation NDMM treatment maintenance with a PDUFA date in February in the U.S. is our transplant-eligible label that we're going to get. We're going to show Myeloma XI data in induction and maintenance from the biggest myeloma study ever. And I hope you're all going to be there when those data are going to be presented. So there are really multiple amazing drivers for REVLIMID. And I think yes, there is some inflection at this moment of time, yes.","Eric Schmidt, Ph.D. - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ying Huang with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering how you would prioritize development of the BCMA bispecific antibody you just acquired through EngMab versus the CAR-T BCMA you have in cooperation with Juno. Thank you.","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","Hi, this is Michael. This is a great question. And I think the right way of answering it is just reminding ourselves that when we're thinking about multiple myeloma, there are still segments with a very distinct medical need. So there is absolutely the need to bring better therapies, although we see now all these triplet data reading out. When we're thinking about patients who are relapsing very, very quickly, and it's actually 25% to 30% after post-REVLIMID and daratumumab, when we're thinking about patients with high-risk cytogenetic features, when we're thinking of patients who are relapsing after daratumumab with pomalidomide, there are many patient segments that even with the available current therapies are really not doing well. That's the first point that I wanted to make.","The second point, BCMA is really a great target. It's selectively expressed. It's almost expressed in 100% of the multiple myeloma patients. It's got a really ideal target for immune therapy. And having both platforms available, which is CAR-T and CD-3 redirected killing, gives us really the opportunity to start thinking about treatment sequence. So you could think about using one earlier and the other one later. Using it in the same patients, think about induction therapy, or if a patient relapses after one, you can use the other one. And then there is a third element that I think is very important. CAR-T is not for everyone. CAR-T is for younger patients, and there will be some reimbursement questions around CAR-T. So you're really happy then if you have an antibody in your portfolio going against the same target.","And then finally, I just wanted to make this remark. Apart from having both, we really have very distinct combination opportunities. We will be able to combine with IMiDs. We will be able to combine with checkpoint inhibitors. Everything we have in our portfolio is extremely complementary, so we feel extremely good about that.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","I just to make sure one thing is clear because I think you said Juno. The program is with bluebird.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I'm sorry, I meant bluebird.","Jacqualyn A.

Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on the REVLIMID IP question, as there were also headlines that just hit before your call started about two of the patents being ruled invalid under the IPR hearing. So I was just curious if you can provide any perspective there or views on what this might mean in the bigger picture for REVLIMID. Thanks.","Mark J. Alles - Celgene Corp.","No, thanks for the question. It's Mark. So we did receive the PTAB decision late last night, and thanks for the question so we can address it head on. We continue to believe in the validity of these challenged REMS patents, which are due to expire in 2018 and 2020, and right now, because we just received the decision, are considering options for rehearing and appeal.","Just as a reminder, we have 13 other patents that cover REMS, including nine patents that expire in 2020. These are not patents subject to this decision. And then there are additional non-REMS patents extending as far as 2027 for REVLIMID, and we will continue to assert those patents. So I don't think that this decision was necessarily unexpected. We're disappointed, but as you can tell, we're prepared to move forward.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Your line is open.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I just have a couple. For ABRAXANE, we had very good data for accelerated (54:04) chemo at ESMO, but the feedback so far from oncologists has been muted. So looking to your I-O ABRAXANE studies, how are you guys thinking about the evolving attitudes towards I-O\/chemo versus I-O\/I-O combos in lung cancer?","And then for Scott on OTEZLA, when you look at the inflammation markets like psoriasis, PsA, RA, patients are typically well controlled and then eventually switch. I wanted to see if you could tell us anything about the commercial experience on it so far for OTEZLA on things like compliance or duration. Is anything notable when patients do move off OTEZLA? Thank you.","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","Hi, James. Thanks for the question. This is Michael. I think I'll take the first part and then Scott takes the second one. I think there was a lot of really important learnings for those who were at ESMO and coming back. I think the way to look at the space at this moment of time is that there is a rather small and well-defined population of high-expressing PD-L1 that is going to be treated with monotherapy. Everybody else is obviously needing a combination, and there's an option of treating those patients either with I-O\/I-O combinations or with I-O\/chemo combinations.","When I'm looking at the data and I'm talking to key opinion leaders, there's a little bit of a sentiment to say like if you have a very low or no PD-L1 expression, there would be a preference for chemotherapy. And of course, the data from the larger end of my studies has to play out at the end of the day, and there will be some overlap between those segments in the usage of both. But I think what's definitely worth to be said is that it at ESMO, the combination of chemo and I-O was absolutely strengthened. We think we are extremely well positioned with that. The data that we've been showing with ABRAXANE and Tecentriq are extremely positive, and we're looking forward to having our data being reading out.","Scott A. Smith - Celgene Corp.","So thank you for the second part of the question. What we're seeing from a commercial perspective, and I do believe I had a slide that addressed it, is approximately 90% of patients are coming to OTEZLA therapy from something other than a biologic. So they're either switching off an oral, switching off topical, or coming onto OTEZLA from nothing at all, and only 10% are coming on from a biologic therapy.","In terms of duration, what we're seeing is duration at one year, which looks at the high biologic range. And so we feel very good about that duration, certainly well above what you see for other oral compounds in the space. So the duration of therapy actually looks quite good. One thing from the clinical studies that is very heartening to me, and there's some four-year data which will come out in a little while, and that says that 65% of the patients who finished one year in the clinical trial were still on drug at four years, which is really unprecedented, and these were in PsA studies, which is really unprecedented relative to data from any other comparator or any other clinical trial. So the compliance is good through one year. I don't have the commercial experience to say what it looks like for two years or three years because we don't have that data yet. But we believe that compliance will continue and continue to get better over time.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Awesome, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ian Somaiya with BMO Capital. Your line is open.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. I just had a question on the future of maintenance therapy within myeloma. At the ASH conference, we're expected to get data for subcutaneous delivery of daratumumab, with that drug potentially given every four to six weeks. And I was just hoping to get your thoughts on that as an option when considering maintenance therapy, so REVLIMID versus daratumumab as a maintenance option in the future. And whether the conversation should be limited just to REVLIMID, or are there CELMoDs that you have earmarked to develop for that setting?","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","Hi, Ian. This is Michael. Thanks for the question. I think I would like to start your question with what we've been saying a couple of times already. I think with the upcoming approval of REVLIMID CE and NDMM maintenance, this is going to be the standard and it's going to be broadly applied. It's already used very broadly in the U.S., based, by the way, upon data that we've been obtaining from three studies, and we've done a meta-analysis really nicely that's showing a 2.5-year overall survival benefit. Those are very strong data. Now the application and the usage and the uptick is going to start in Europe. That's the first thing I wanted to say.","There is an ongoing study of daratumumab in that indication, but maintenance is really a long-term game. If you think back about when we started to put REVLIMID into maintenance, and we are now at the point of really going to the finish line, this is something that takes multiple years. And I just wanted to once again say the usage and the approval is driven upon overall survival data that we've been generating from multiple studies. And the bar here is 2.5 years of overall survival benefit.","Thinking about our future IMiDs, is there a place for them in maintenance? Maybe, we are particularly excited when we're looking at those IMiDs, and Rupert [Vessey] has been talking about those in New York because they have a very, very deep B-cell kill effect. So whether those are going to be primarily used in maintenance or not needs to be decided, but I would not rule it out.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Birchenough with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Jim Birchenough - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the results. I'm just wondering, Michael, if you could break down the use of REVLIMID in the U.S. in particular between combination use in earlier lines and single-agent use. And then following that, what's the strategy with your next-generation CELMoD to have them potentially displace REVLIMID longer term as a standard of care in combinations? Because one of the problems with having such great data is it becomes difficult to displace something that's so well entrenched. And longer term as you think about generic risk, how difficult will it be to displace REVLIMID with a potentially better CELMoD? Thanks.","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","Thanks for the question, Jim. This is Michael. So even in the U.S., I would say the use of REVLIMID is still primarily as a doublet, so in combination with dexamethasone. But the use of triplets is really picking up very, very quickly, and the reason is very, very clear. When you're looking at the progression-free survival and the response rates and the depth of the response that you can get, there is a compelling reason to do so. There is multiple opportunities. But I would make the argument that also in the foreseeable future, if you are an elderly frail patient or if you're a standard risk patient, doublets remain a very attractive option. So that's the first point that I wanted to make.","Then coming to the second point of your question, we really think that REVLIMID and pomalidomide are great drugs. We really are compelled by the New England Journal publication that we've been seeing in The New England Journal of Medicine. But even when you look at the best available data \u2013 and I was trying to say this \u2013 25% to 30% of patients, even with REVLIMID-dexamethasone- daratumumab, are relapsing after 6 to 12 months. There is extremely limited options if a patient is relapsing after daratumumab or after pomalidomide. And the overall survival of patients with high risk such as genetic features, despite all these new available therapies, is still only three or four years. That's very bad. That's absolutely not good enough. We can define these patient populations very clearly. We can define them clinically. We can define them molecularly, and this is exactly where we want to test our new CELMoDs in, and we feel extremely good about that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Yatin Suneja with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Yatin Suneja - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Maybe I'll ask on POMALYST, I think those results were overshadowed by REVLIMID performance. So could you maybe comment on where we are in terms of recent duration there? I think in the past, you had mentioned that POMALYST is gaining share in the second-line setting. So could you maybe comment on how do you see the dynamics shifting there and where do you see the drugs eventually moving? Thank you.","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","Thanks, Yatin, for the question. This is Michael. So when we're looking at the pomalidomide duration both in the U.S. and Europe, it's steadily increasing. What I can share with you is that the treatment duration in the U.S. is now over 10 months. A lot of that is driven by two factors, A), the use in combinatorial therapy. There's a lot of data available. NCCN guidelines have recently been updated and there's going to be, by the way, increasing use, as you heard. Pomalidomide-daratumumab is submitted to the FDA and there's a PDUFA date available. So that's one element driving pomalidomide is duration, the usage in combination.","The other element is the increasing usage earlier in therapy. So if you use REVLIMID either in combination, as I was trying to say earlier, and patients are relapsing afterwards, do you want to have another triplet right after, again, with an IMiD and another combination partner? And that's exactly what we are seeing. I think the great performance of pomalidomide that we had in the third quarter is really a reflection of exactly that.","Yatin Suneja - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Abrahams with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for taking my question and congrats again on the strong quarter. Scott, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the potential for expanded indications for OTEZLA, in particular atopic dermatitis and ulcerative colitis, the next steps there, and maybe how the product profile as well as competitive landscape in those spaces potentially influences your prioritization of what to pursue next. Thanks.","Scott A. Smith - Celgene Corp.","Thank you very much for the question. There are four current indications that we're looking at in terms of expansion. There's also some expansion opportunity within the psoriasis space to go into subtypes, scalp psoriasis and other things, so there is some expansion there. We have a Phase III program ongoing in Beh\u00e7et's disease. We have a Phase II proof-of-concept going on in ulcerative colitis, which should read out next year.","We do have long-term radiographic data from the AS program, MRI and radiograph data which looks very positive, which shows the majority of patients not progressing during two years of treatment, and so we're having some discussions to see how we can move that forward. And then we're also taking look at atopic dermatitis. Specifically to atopic dermatitis, we do have data in from a proof-of-concept study. The study did make its primary endpoint. There were some \u2013 a little bit of mixed data in terms of which endpoints were met in which weren't.","We also have another asset that we acquired through the Receptos transaction in RPC4046, an IL-13 antibiotic, which there's good strong proof-of-concept of IL-13 in atopic dermatitis. So we're taking our time, looking at all the data, and we'll have a comprehensive atopic dermatitis strategy in the coming months.","Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Newman with Canaccord. Your line is open.","John Lawrence Newman - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi, guys, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First question I have is you mentioned in your prepared remarks and your press release that you have increased contribution to the patient assistance organizations. I just wondered if that is simply in response to high levels of REVLIMID sales, or if that is a way to make sure patients have access to some of these triplet regimens which would be more expensive.","And the second question I have is, are you seeing any evidence from the payers that they are looking for higher levels of discounts and rebates on OTEZLA in terms of a percentage of sales? Thank you.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","Hey, John, it's Peter. Let me take the first one and then I'll ask Scott to join in on the second part. So basically all of our contributions on patient support are really demand-driven. So it's really a question of what's going on in the market and that we don't make exactly the same amount of contributions every quarter, so it does tend to be a little bit irregular in timing. It's more just based on updates from the different independent groups.","I would say that, obviously, our business has grown. And so when you think about growth rates of our products above 20%, then yes, over time that will accumulate and cause the patient support needs to grow as well. So I would say those are two of the drivers really as opposed to anything related to usage of the drug differently. Jackie, would you add anything?","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","I just, and you said it, these are independent groups that are working with myeloma patients irrespective of the regimen that they may be on. So we have no idea what regimen the patients may receive when we make these donations to these groups.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","And it's the nature of these independent groups across the cancer space, whether it's myeloma, whatever the disease is, that they are there helping patients get access through whatever mechanisms are provided. They're not drug specific. Scott?","Scott A. Smith - Celgene Corp.","Specific to OTEZLA rebates, the rebates or discounts to any particular organization will be different and individually negotiated, and we don't necessarily talk about those publicly. Right now the rebate levels I think are relatively low with most of the major payers.","We're at a place where market share and prescription trends continue to move forward. I think that puts some \u2013 driving that demand creates a situation in the market where you have an opportunity to talk to the individual payers in a thoughtful way about changing the overall footprint from an access standpoint, moving it up, eliminating steps, some of those things. And so we're constantly in those negotiations. The currency to get into those negotiations is driving demand and making sure that the product is being utilized, and we've done that to this point. And so we may move into a period where we see some deeper discounts and deeper rebates happening for increases in access and decreases in steps.","John Lawrence Newman - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Scotti with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","John Scotti - Evercore Group LLC","Good morning, thanks for taking my question. So I want to ask again on REVLIMID. As you said with daratumumab coming online in second-line, duration of therapy, perhaps in a double and then a likely move into first-line, so in the case that REVLIMID sees those tailwinds from a duration of therapy perspective over the next few years, and I guess specifically as we look to the future, a couple things. One, is it unreasonable to view any trial hitting in lymphoma as upside potentially to the 2020 guidance for REVLIMID? And then two, as we think about the evolution of Celgene post-REVLIMID genericization in the mid-2020s, how do you think about Celgene's ability to grow through a REVLIMID patent cliff in a theoretical scenario where REVLIMID outperformance makes it more difficult to grow through that cliff or even keeps flat through that cliff? Thanks.","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","Thanks, John, for the question. I think I'm going to start. As you rightfully say, there are a lot of tailwinds for REVLIMID at this moment of time, and we were explaining them for multiple myeloma. We are going to provide you with an update of our lymphoma program at ASH. And we also invite you to look at the data that we're going to show for the MAGNIFY study at ASH. We are feeling very confident about the ongoing ASCO studies, both in the first-line and second-line setting for indolent lymphoma. So definitely further upside coming from lymphoma until 2020.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","It's Jackie. So just maybe the other thing, I think we have always had a tendency to be a little bit conservative in terms of when we look forward, what we put in our models for duration, and we have wanted to wait and see what actual experiences in the marketplace and think about how the data supports that. So I think as everything has played out, it's gone extremely well. And on a go-forward basis, we would expect that to continue.","So with respect to your question about the patent issue, and I think we've highlighted this if not completely quantitatively, directionally in some of the things that we have been presenting. We have a tremendous number of things going on in the pipeline, not only in the multiple myeloma area where all the things that Michael and Mark and others have spoken about today, including BCMA and other things that we have going on. So we see great potential to continue to have a very strong multiple myeloma franchise for a long time to come.","While that is happening, we've also got this great diversification coming in the I&I business, tremendous growth there. We have a lot going on in the myeloid space, where the franchise that we talk about a little bit less maybe just because today it's nowhere near the size of the myeloma business, but we see that business growing tremendously. And then Michael has also talked about some of the things that we've learned with respect to CLL and other diseases that are not in the model at all. So I think there's a lot of optionality in the portfolio, and we feel very confident in our ability as we get out there to continue to grow for a long time beyond 2026.","Patrick E. Flanigan - Celgene Corp.","Stephanie, I think we have time for the last two callers in the queue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dane Leone with BTIG. Your line is open.","Dane Leone - BTIG LLC","Hi, thank you for getting everyone's questions in here and congrats on a great quarter. I'm just asking something that hasn't really been discussed but keeps coming up in all of your presentations. When we think about CC-90002, the mechanism of action presumably is going to be quite orthogonal to your other assets in the developmental pipeline. And I was just curious. Even though you haven't gone through great detail of discussion, how are you thinking about that asset ultimately being developed and the lymphoma versus the leukemia and the AML space?","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","I'm sorry. Is that a question related to our CD47 program? Sorry, we just had somebody sneezing in the room when you said the name of the compound.","Dane Leone - BTIG LLC","No problem. Yes, the CD47 program. I was just curious about your thoughts, especially that maybe your initial efforts now in AML, how you're thinking about, I guess, that asset potentially being developed in the AML versus leukemia broader or the lymphoma space as you're pushing into certain assets there, especially with REVLIMID and maybe CC-122 there.","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","Thanks. And sorry once again, as we all have a big cold and we pass it to each other in this room. So the first thing I really wanted to say is \u2013 on CD47 is really a part of this growing opportunity and pipeline that Celgene has been building in I-O. We have new CELMoDs that play in that space. We have cellular therapy, and we talked about BCMA, CAR-T, and we talked about our CD19 program. We have multiple opportunities regarding T-cells, not just through our cooperation with AstraZeneca. but also other checkpoint inhibitors that we are extremely interested in both on the activating and on the suppressing side. And I think CD47 plays extremely nicely into this whole building toolbox that we have \u2013 having as it's an ability to really activate macrophages.","So we see this in the context of building our I-O pipeline. That's number one. And of course, we are trying to test it very broadly. We're starting an acute \u2013 in AML. As you well know, there is the opportunity to take this asset into more diseases. Lymphoma comes to mind. Solid tumors come to mind. But AML\/MDS is certainly amongst the first indications that we're interested in. We also obtain a strong signal, and then we're going to see how to take it forward.","Jacqualyn A. Fouse - Celgene Corp.","I think you get credit for a most creative question too.","Dane Leone - BTIG LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Our final question comes from Konstantinos Aprilakis with JMP Securities. Your line is open.","Konstantinos N. Aprilakis - JMP Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So my question was actually already asked, but I'll ask a variation and try to get more granular. Regarding the combination regimens for REVLIMID, you mentioned doublets are currently being used. Triplets are coming online. Could you get more granular? Which triplets, where do you see it being used most often?","Michael Pehl - Celgene Corp.","So thanks for the question, Konstantinos. So we see a very steep increase at this moment of time in the U.S. And the situation is not exactly same in U.S. than in Europe. Triplet usage in U.S. is of course is already broader. In Europe, you always have to take the reimbursement hurdle. But triplets are increasingly also reimbursed in Europe. So where we see a really steep increase at this moment of time is through the combination of REVLIMID and dexamethasone with Velcade. Based upon the data of SWOG SO777, the first-line study that has been presented roundabout a year ago \u2013 and just to remind everybody, compared with REVLIMID alone, there's a 12-month overall survival benefit, so that's quite a lot. There's a lot of usage of this combination not just in an elderly population \u2013 that's what we see \u2013 but then also certainly in the induction setting.","What makes this very compelling when we're thinking about Europe is certainly the fact that at a certain time point, Velcade is going to become generic. So you have a very well-tolerated, very effective triplet which may come along with a very reasonable cost. We're putting a lot of effort behind this combination. And then of course, there is the combination of \u2013 and I just wanted to point it out once again because The New England Journal of Medicine was so nice, the REVLIMID\/daratumumab combination, 40 to 50-month progression-free survival. That's going to drive our treatment duration big time, and we see that as a catalyst, again starting in the U.S., but I have no doubt that it's also going to come to Europe.","Peter N. Kellogg - Celgene Corp.","So thank you, Michael, and listen, thanks for all the questions. We've run a little bit over, so I'll just quickly wrap up. This is Peter. Based on all the comments that Michael and Scott have made and Jackie as well and Mark, you can tell that we've got very strong commercial momentum right now. And so obviously, Q2 results we're very pleased with. More good stuff to come, obviously, as we finish up the year, and as we move into 2017 and look ahead and 2020, we actually feel like we're very much on track to do extremely well against those targets.","Obviously, we're in an exciting period. The fourth quarter is always fun for us. There's a tremendous amount of news flow at the medical meetings on our products and our pipeline. We continue to enrich our pipeline and move it forward, which you saw on the deep dive just for protein homeostasis. But obviously from a business development standpoint, you can see we've broadened the range of things that we're looking at. There is just a tremendous set of opportunities for us to pursue. So it's an exciting time to be part of Celgene. We're really pleased with our results, and thank you for your support.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's conference. You may all disconnect, and everyone have a great day."]}}
