My name is Christine, and I'll be your operator for today's conference. [Operator Instructions] Please note today's conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pete Miller. Sir, you may begin.","Merrill A. Miller","Thanks, Christine, and good morning and welcome to the National Oilwell Varco Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. With me on this call today is Clay Williams, our CFO. Loren Singletary, our VP of Investor Relations, is normally on this call, but he is traveling today and will return when we do the call at the end of the year.","Earlier today, we announced quarterly earnings of $612 million or $1.43 per share on record revenues of $5.3 billion. Included in this number are transaction costs of approximately $57 million pretax. Net income for the quarter, excluding the transaction charges, is $650 million or $1.52 per fully diluted share. We are very pleased with these results and we believe they reflect the continued excellent execution of our employees around the world and the demand for our products and services in all the areas of globe. Clay will expand upon these results in just a moment.","Additionally, we announced new capital equipment orders of $2.3 billion or quarter-ending backlog of $11.7 billion, just below our record backlog that we achieved in the third quarter of 2008. The book-to-bill for this quarter was 1.2:1. I will address the backlog later in the call when I give an overview on operations.","At this time, I will ask Clay to provide color on these results.","Clay C. Williams","Thanks, Pete. Before we begin this discussion of National Oilwell Varco's financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2012, please note that some of the statements we make during this call may contain forecasts, projections and estimates, including, but not limited to, comments about our outlook for the company's business. These are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws based on limited information as of today, which is subject to change.","They are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. No one should assume that these forward-looking statements remain valid later in the quarter or later in the year. I refer you to the latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q National Oilwell Varco has on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a more detailed discussion of the major risk factors affecting our business. Further information regarding these, as well as supplemental financial and operating information, may be found within our press release on our website at www.nov.com or in our filings with United States Securities and Exchange Commission.","Later on in this call, we will answer your questions. [Operator Instructions]","Turning to results. As Steve mentioned, National Oilwell Varco generated $1.43 per fully diluted share in earnings in its third quarter of 2012 on $5.3 billion in revenues. Excluding $57 million in pretax transaction charges or $0.09 a share, third quarter 2012 earnings were $1.52 per fully diluted share, up $0.06 per share or 4% from the second quarter and up $0.26 per share or 21% from the third quarter of 2011 excluding transaction charges from all periods.","Operating profit ex-transaction charges was a record $946 million, up 4% from the second quarter and up 22% from the third quarter of last year. Below the operating profit line, we saw a variety of puts and takes in the third quarter income statement as compared to the second. Results were helped by slightly lower sequential tax rate, but also hurt by lower sequential equity income from our JV and by higher bank charges and FX expenses, which I will discuss a little bit more detail.","Excluding transaction charges, EBITDA was a record $1.1 billion during the third quarter of 2012, up about 2% sequentially and up 17% from the prior year quarter. Record sales of $5.3 billion rose 12% sequentially and 42% year-over-year. Performance was solid across all 3 of our segments in the third quarter owing to terrific execution, once again, by the professionals who manage these businesses for National Oilwell Varco. All of us here greatly appreciate your dedication and hard work.","This was a complicated quarter. The crosscurrents and divergent trends are rising across many of our major market areas. While demand for deepwater offshore drilling rigs is high and rising and most international markets are steadily pushing activity higher, headwinds intensified in North America as domestic rig counts moved downward with both gas and oil plays affected.","Canada is usually up big in the third quarter, but this year's seasonal recovery out of breakup was pretty tepid. All across North America, it seems everybody is hesitating. Large cap E&Ps are laying down rigs and a new parsimoniousness is sweeping through the North American oilfield complex. However, we are simultaneously hearing a clear chorus of \"drill, baby, drill\" from overseas in Spanish, Russian, Portuguese, Arabic, Bahasa and Mandarin voices. Tenders are picking up as drilling contractors increasingly adopt modern AC power and electronic controls, and as overseas operators increasingly employ horizontal well pads and hydraulic fracture stimulation techniques refined in North American laboratories.","Following a doubling of U.S. rig count up mid-2009 bottoms and an unprecedented surge in U.S. oil production, we now seem to face a world with North America playing defense while the rest of the world plays offense, specifically, Argentina, Kuwait, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Oman, Iraq, Indonesia, all busy. We are investing in Eastern Europe, Russia, Africa and Latin America to continue to position NOV to support growing activity in these regions.","We are developing new fixed cutter bit technologies, a new pad drilling rig design, a new CE ATEX-rated land rig to European standards to support international growth. We are building out several facilities in Brazil to support Petrobras' ambitious plans for the Santos Basin, and we added new aftermarket facilities in Sub-Saharan Africa this quarter.","We are selling more well stimulation equipment into the Middle East, China and Russia. Offense is fine. Defense, not so much. The North American pressure pumping customers face an oversupplied market and fierce price competition and have cut orders to about 0. Although we believe land drilling day rates in the U.S. have remained relatively firm, contract terms are continuing to shorten, falling from 3 years to well-by-well lately. And day rate pressure is likely to emerge soon as rig counts are down 168 rigs since the beginning of the year. Without payback on a new rig construction project fully locked in contractually, most domestic drillers seem unwilling to build new rigs without better clarity and are reflexively retrenching on all spending.","For example, last quarter, we referenced slowing orders for new drill pipe and noted that our backlog declined. Drill pipe is one of many products we manufacture within our Petroleum Services & Supplies segment, which is about 3\/4 sales of manufactured consumable products or manufactured short-lived capital products. Although we don't report them publicly, we do track backlogs of orders for certain PS&S products internally.","During the third quarter, we saw backlogs drop across most, with many falling 10% to 30% during the quarter. Although 1,839 rigs drilling in the U.S. last week is a solid level of absolute activity, which is consuming an awful lot of what NOV makes, our customers can cut purchases and use their own inventories of consumables for a time if they so desire. We believe that, that's what's happening now. Orders are slowing out of an abundance of caution as customers across North America hunker down. Price pressure has now emerged and will take a toll on margins in the fourth quarter as a result.","Interestingly though, domestic demand for certain products -- certain other products and services have held up well. For instance, our Tuboscope pipe services business remain relatively flat sequentially with higher tubing and casing volumes offsetting declining drill pipe volumes. Our Downhole Tools group put up third quarter revenue gains in the U.S. even in the face of some price pressure, primarily due to some new technologies we've launched recently that are performing well in the marketplace. While rentals and leasing of solids control equipment declined in the U.S., declines were at least partly offset by higher solids control capital equipment sales here, partly due to rising activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico bucking the trend a bit probably due to offshore new builds.","Theories about North America abound. You hear anecdotally the E&Ps on this continent have burned through 2012 budgets and are waiting to reload 2013 budgets before resuming activity. Or that after outspending cash flows for several quarters, they are perhaps unwilling to stretch balance sheets further. Or that they don't believe crude will stay at $90 for WTI, owing to macro concerns like slowing growth in China or one big final European sovereign debt meltdown.","With oil relatively stable around $90 per barrel through the quarter, the last few days notwithstanding, and with gas in the $3.40 range and trending up, we are surprised that North American activity isn't more robust. We are therefore optimistic that this North American decline is transient. After all, North America has been the most successful of all regions at growing production. Solid commodity prices, coupled with drilling and completion costs that are certainly falling sharply right now, should yield improving economics for E&Ps and a drilling recovery in North America soon. And as a major provider of critical technologies and products in to unconventional shale plays, National Oilwell Varco is exceptionally well-positioned to benefit from a resumption of North American drilling growth, just as we are benefiting from the steady growth of shale development overseas today.","Growth, which is helping make dispositions outside of North America, much sunnier. The deepwater offshore outlook is very bright, owing to a growing supply gap of floating rigs, which is driving day rates and new build economics higher. Inbound inquiries for new floating rigs are steady, and offshore drillers are smiling. And we expect a solid quarter of orders again in the fourth quarter, following strong orders in the third. We still have several tenders out in Brazil which could further contribute orders in the fourth quarter or in 2013.","We believe that the strength of deepwater day rates in 2012, despite several years of meaningful fleet growth and highly visible capacity additions, supports our thesis that the world has and will continue to build out a large deepwater capability well into the 21st century to exploit new deepwater frontiers opened by new technologies. More recently, we have seen a sustained level of interest in deepwater new builds that we hope may be tracing out a new, more stable pattern of orders per NOVs floater drilling equipment packages. Shipyards are underemployed, hungry and aggressive on pricing. Deepwater day rates are high and rising. Capital is available and cheap. Construction time is shortening and execution risks is approaching 0, at least for our customers.","Importantly, the situation has been stable for 8-plus [ph quarters and our deepwater drilling contractor customers seem to be exhibiting a growing confidence with, what we hope is, a new era. A number of drillers tell us that they are prepared to move forward with a fixed number of new build at any given time. And that as they contract one new build, they will, in turn, sign up for another. Strategically, we believe that they are comfortable devoting a certain constant level of management bandwidth and risk capital to new building on spec, but no more and no less. In essence, we believe order patterns may be evolving from ad hoc opportunistic boom bust, systematic, thoughtful and strategic.","Offshore rig orders may always -- will always be somewhat volatile for NOV. And as we know, things can change quickly in our business. Specifically, a downturn in day rates and evaporation of credit, tightening shipyard capacity, a spike in steel prices and 10 other things I can't even think of, can end the party. But what may be different now is the mindset of our customers who no longer dismiss new rig building out of hand who are less constrained by the dogma of the last generation. This relatively new industrial paradigm, if true, signals a shift in thinking among our customer base that has the potential of generating somewhat steadier order patterns for our Rig Technology segment. Time will tell.","Solid demand for floaters and international activity is helping offset some of the weakness in North American land. We see 58 floaters that should be ordering drill pipe between now and the end of 2013 and already expect orders on the books for large premium offshore drill pipe to partly offset slowing land bookings.","Similarly, solid control equipment, mission pumps and manifolds and other products within Petroleum Services & Supplies are seeing offshore demand partly offsetting slower land demand.","Jackup demand has slowed in spite of the compelling fleet demographics. 317 jackups in service around the globe are more than 25 years old, which means that they must be replaced soon. Lately, price competition has been fierce for the small number of DEPs in play for new builds in that arena. Generally, inquiries are coming more from second and third tier drilling -- drillers associated with NOCs, or for a small number of very high-spec jackups sponsored by IOCs.","Our Distribution & Transmission segment posted record results having done a terrific job of pulling together a much larger organization this year. The new mix is a little more heavily weighted towards North America, so lower drilling activity took a toll. The rising midstream activity associated with pipeline build-outs and rising well hookup activity helped offset, particularly in the Permian, Eagle Ford and Mississippian plays.","Sales of artificial lift equipment and valves into international projects rounded out a solid third quarter result for the group. Consolidation has preceded very, very well and we expect continued success into 2013 as we begin a lot of heavy lifting around converting to a common ERP platform.","One quick update regarding Robbins & Myers. Earlier this month, we announced that we have received their request for information, commonly called a second request, from the U.S. Department of Justice pursuant to their review of the transaction under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act of 1976. Gathering and submitting this information will take time and resources, but we are nevertheless confident that after review, the transaction will be able to proceed as planned.","However, this extra step does put pressure on timing and though we are still targeting a fourth quarter closing, it is possible that events slip into 2013. We remain very excited about this transaction and believe it will be a great fit with NOV, expanding our product lines, adding capacity and strengthening our capabilities to service our customers. We look forward to welcoming the Robbins & Myers employees to the NOV team soon.","Turning to our segment operating results. The Rig Technology group generated revenues of $2.5 billion in the third quarter, up 6% sequentially and up 29% compared to the third quarter of 2011. Operating profit was $610 million and operating margins were 23.9%, up slightly from the prior quarter. Incremental leverage or flow-through was 27% sequentially and 14% year-over-year. The segment benefited from a full quarter's contribution from NKT and Interflow, as well as higher revenues out of offshore project backlog which increased 10% sequentially. Aftermarket revenues increased both sequentially and year-over-year, with higher sequential spare parts partly offset by lower service revenues. Overall, non-backlog revenues grew 8% sequentially, and our outlook for aftermarket sales next year is bright.","The first floaters constructed this cycle will begin to turn 5 years old next year, which means that they will be returning to shipyards for their 5-year surveys. Since the opportunity cost of going off day rate in the shipyards is so high, drillers use this time to also perform maintenance and upgrade activities, often buying lots of NOV spares and kit as part of the effort.","The offshore rig delivery curve of the last few years provides a great window into NOV's potential aftermarket sales for the next few years, and we have been deploying capital into facilities to make sure that we can meet the needs of our customers as their new sophisticated rigs go in for survey.","Strong demand for floaters this quarter overcame sluggish sales of land rigs and jackups and a sharp downturn in demand for frac spreads. Orders of $2,289,000,000 were up 3% from the second quarter, excluding $511 million of backlog flowing in, in the second quarter with the NKT and Interflow acquisitions. New orders were partly offset by record revenues out of backlog of $1,913,000,000, and led to a backlog of capital equipment orders for the segment of nearly $11.7 billion at September 30, 2012, up 3% sequentially and up 13% year-over-year. Approximately, 87% of the backlog is offshore and 13% land. 95% is for international markets and only 5% is for domestic markets.","We expect $1.9 billion to flow out of backlog in the fourth quarter of 2012, $7.1 billion to flow out in 2013 and the balance to flow thereafter.","The group won orders for drilling equipment packages for 7 floaters and 1 jackup during the third quarter. 5 of the floaters were for Brazil, to be delivered over the next several years. Again, the overall rig cost -- again, with overall rig cost down about 15% from 2008 peaks, day rates high and financing available at least for established drillers, we expect fourth quarter orders to be strong.","Orders for flexible pipe for subsea developments were solid this quarter and orders for FPSO turret mooring systems improved sequentially. However, generally, the FPSO market remains soft as vessel operators exhibit little appetite for financing new vessels or assuming project risk as they have in the past. Nevertheless, all signs point to growing pent-up demand for lots of FPSOs.","We believe that a new paradigm must emerge for this industry, one that more fairly partitions risk and capital across participants. We suspect that the ultimate source of demand for these vessels, the IOCs and the NOCs, will bear much more of the capital and risk of execution than they have in the past decade, but until this sorts itself out, orders will likely remain slow. Interestingly though, the aftermarket demand for APL has picked up recently related to interest in extending vessels beyond the end of their original planned service lives.","Looking forward into the fourth quarter of 2012, we expect revenues to grow 1% to 2% and margins for our Rig Technology segment to be about flat with third quarter 2012 results. Declining North American pressure pumping and well servicing demand and start-up expenses associated with certain plant expansions abroad are expected to offset gains in offshore projects.","The Petroleum Services & Supplies segment posted revenues of $1,717,000,000, down 3% sequentially and up 18% year-over-year. Operating profit declined slightly sequentially to $383 million, and operating margins were 22.3%, up slightly from the second quarter and up 180 basis points from the third quarter of last year. Compared to the second quarter of 2012, the $59 million revenue decline carries 17% decremental operating leverage or flow-through compared to the third quarter of 2011 to 18% sales growth, generated 33% operating leverage or flow-through.","The group saw little benefit from sequential recovery out of break up in Canada where higher activity-related services were more than offset by lower sequential sales of drilling tools which led overall Canadian revenues 4% lower in the third quarter. The U.S. saw 9% lower sequential sales spread across a number of product lines, most notably drill pipe, as land drillers slowed purchases to instead rely on their existing stocks of drill pipe. The group also saw lower sequential sales of composite pipe, coil tubing, conductor pipe connectors and mill inspection equipment. As I noted earlier, backlog for most products declined, pointing to a difficult quarter ahead, with weakness mostly seen in domestic markets. International markets generally appear to be continuing on a growth track. Overall, the segment's third quarter sales mix was approximately 60% North American and 40% international.","As we enter the fourth quarter of 2012, we expect Petroleum Services & Supplies segment sales to be about flat to down slightly compared to the third quarter due to declining North American sales. Margins will decline with rising price pressure we began to see late in the third quarter, and are likely to end up around 20%.","The Distribution & Transmission segment posted 69% higher sequential sales from the second quarter to the third, and 174% higher year-over-year sales due to its additions of Wilson Supply, CE Franklin and Ensco over the past few quarters, which have flowed in at a little lower margins. Revenues were $1.3 billion and operating profit was $78 million. Operating margins were 5.9% of sales, down from the second quarter due to the changing mix. Sequential flow-through or operating leverage was 4% and year-over-year operating leverage was 5%. Mix for the group's third quarter was 84% North America and 16% international.","In addition to rising midstream and well hookup demand I mentioned earlier, Distribution Services also benefited from the recovery of deepwater drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, along with rising demand for cables and other components into new build offshore rig projects in Asia. Transmission grew sequentially with the addition of Wilson's tubular business.","Looking into the fourth quarter of 2012, we expect Distribution & Transmission group revenues to decline in the mid single-digit range, owing to North American headwinds, but for the group to produce operating margins in line with the third quarter as continued cost savings roughly offset volume decline effects.","Turning to National Oilwell Varco's consolidated third quarter 2012 income statement. Gross margin declined 137 basis points due primarily to NOV's much higher mix at distribution revenues as compared to the second quarter. SG&A increased $51 million primarily due to the new business additions as well. SG&A as a percent of sales was 8.7% in the third quarter, unchanged from last quarter, and down from 10.5% last year. Interest expense of $10 million was up due to new debt taken on through the summer. Equity income in our Voest-Alpine JV was $7 million, down $12 million sequentially due to lower OCTG sales, lower [ph] mix and 2 weeks of shutdown for mill maintenance in the third quarter.","Other expense increased $9 million from Q2 to $14 million due to higher bank charges and FX expense, and we expect about the same in the fourth quarter. The book tax rate for the third quarter was 30.3%, lower than our expected rate of 32% to 33% due to a higher mix of overseas income at lower rates, lower nondeductible expenses in foreign jurisdictions and higher U.S. manufacturing deductions in the third quarter. Expect the fourth quarter tax rate to return to the mid-32% range.","Unallocated expenses and eliminations on our supplemental segment schedule was $125 million in the third quarter, up $14 million sequentially due to acquisitions, IT costs and higher intersegment sales eliminations. Depreciation and amortization was $157 million, flat with the second quarter. EBITDA, excluding transaction charges, was a record $1.1 billion, up $17 million sequentially. EBITDA was 20.8% of sales.","National Oilwell Varco's September 30, 2012, balance sheet includes total debt of $1.5 billion, an increase of $81 million sequentially to finance cash working capital and tax payments made during the quarter. Cash was $1.7 billion at quarter end with approximately 94% of the balance located overseas.","Consolidated working capital, excluding cash and debt, was $6.6 billion, up $733 million from the second quarter due in part to changes in customer progress billings on new rig orders. The net of billings in excess of cost, customer prepayments and cost in excess of billings was a use of cash of $198 million during the third quarter.","Additionally, acquisitions added $166 million and the inventory in Rig Technology grew $266 million related to aftermarket, BOPs and backlog. Faster shipyard construction cycles are accelerating component deliveries from us, requiring more inventory to support deliveries. Working capital as a percentage of annualized sales was unchanged from the second quarter at 31.2%. Our current utilization of working capital is a little higher than we'd like and we plan to focus on better inventory management in particular in the next couple of quarters.","Cash flow used by operations -- I'm sorry, cash flow generated by operations was $137 million for the third quarter. It levered cash flow at $769 million offset by changes in working capital items. CapEx was $129 million in Q3, and we expect it to rise in Q4 and to finish the year in the range of about $600 million.","Now, let me turn it back to Pete.","Merrill A. Miller","Thanks, Clay. Those of you who have listened to our calls in the past know that we have some fairly common themes. And I want to hit those themes again because I think they all really are staying with a lot of traction and they're really what's kind of dictating the business as we go forward. And those themes are essentially shales, the deepwater, the -- our international presence and the best-in-class technology. And as I look at these, on shales, the reality is it's all about efficiency today. When you look at the efficiency gains, if you've listened to some of the service companies on calls here the past couple of weeks or the past week or so, they've talked about the great gains that you're seeing in shales. A lot of those gains are because of the equipment that we manufacture. When you talk about the fit-for-purpose rigs, when you talk about downhole tools, our new bits, motors, frac spreads, different things like that, you're starting to see those efficiencies really, really come into focus a lot, and we are also starting to see much more of the international presence in shales -- we've always talked about that coming. It would be a little bit slower, but we believe, over the next couple of years, that's going to be a very attractive amount of business for NOV.","The deepwater demand continues. As Clay pointed out, we had a good quarter of deepwater rigs. We expect, as we look to the future, there's still an awful lot of interest. And the bottom line is, with our unparalleled execution and our state-of-the-art equipment, we're positioned very, very well to benefit greatly as we look at this. And in addition to that, we're starting to see more drilling permits come on the deepwater which in fact, helps all of our other businesses, our PS&S and our distribution business as well. So we don't see any abatement at all in the near future of what's going on in the deepwater, and we think that's going to be something that will be very, very attractive for NOV.","In the international arena, again, our presence there is felt. As Clay pointed out in his comments, the international business continues to be a good business, a robust business. And we really have the footprint to be able to take advantage of that.","Some of the more interesting areas right now are Latin America. We're starting to see, obviously, everybody that has followed us knows about Brazil, but we're seeing more and more things in countries like Columbia, Argentina, Ecuador and other parts of Latin America. We think that's going to be something that will really help drive a lot of our businesses as we look into the future.","Russia is a very attractive place for us right now. Clay mentioned that we're making investments there. We are building a facility there that will handle a lot of our PS&S equipment, as well as build rigs. We're excited about the prospects for this new facility and we think it's really going to enhance our market position there as we look to the future.","The Middle East continues to be a very positive arena as we look at land rigs in particular. We have a very good set up in Dubai. The Jebel Ali trade free zone where we're able to manufacture rigs. And that really, in fact, reduces a lot of the lead times associated with that. A lot of times, when the land drillers want rigs, they want them now. And when you're talking about the deepwater guys, they know they've got to wait a couple of years, 2.5 years, to get their rig. But the land drillers want it now, and being able to be in places like Russia and Dubai and China really makes the logistics line that much slower and we can actually deliver the rigs much more quickly, which is a real, we believe, competitive advantage. So we think that's going to continue well into the future.","And then you take a look at Asia. China and Australia, again, are very attractive markets for us. I think they will also be markets that will parlay a lot into the shale plays and the advantages that we'll be able to take -- bring to bear, to bring our equipment into those arenas, so we can in fact, help them really exploit their shale plays.","So I think, again, the shales and the deepwater in the international arena all fit very, very well to what we're doing today.","And then finally, it's the best-in-class technology. It's really about having, what I believe, are the new products that are out there, that really kind of get the marketplace excited. Just here, recently, we won 2 of the World Oil Awards for some of the best products to be introduced in the past year. And that included our NOVA automation system and our IntelliServ smart drill pipe. We're very proud of those awards but we think they're definitive of what we're doing and show that we're kind of leading the way when it comes to new product development.","Other things that we're working on. You take a look at 20,000 psi BOPs, a more robust top drives in our rough decks. So top drives now that can actually deliver 100,000-foot pounds of torque to be able to drill these much more challenging wells that are out there. A biggie -- a big one for us is going to be smart equipment, as we go to the future and we are building smart equipment now. We're going to be able to remotely monitor this smart equipment and be able to help reduce the cost to our customers, which we think puts us in great shape when people are looking at what they want to build. Clay mentioned the new CE ATEX rig that we're building for the shales in Eastern Europe and different places like that. And we're also working on a new design FPSO, one that we really think will help the industry be able to standardize, if you will, and be able to not have to work every project like it's a separate one off.","So there's a lot of exciting things going on in that arena. We continue to invest in that. Our backlog as, I pointed out earlier, was just below a record and we feel very good about where the order intake's going. And I will also tell you that on some of the acquisitions that we've done, our integrations are going very, very well. And we're very pleased and we welcome all of our new employees the National Oilwell Varco family.","So at this point, Christine, I will end my comments and turn it over to anybody that might have any questions for us.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Doug Becker from Bank of America.","Douglas L. Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Maybe just starting off on PSS. Revenues really seem to be hanging in there well in light of what the rig count's doing. You did highlight that there could be some margin pressure in the fourth quarter. I just wanted to calibrate what you're thinking about in terms of rig activity in North America and how that should -- relationship should be with revenues as we go forward?","Clay C. Williams","Yes, Doug, we think, I guess -- I mean, and first let me qualify, I don't think our crystal ball is any better than anyone else's. But in terms of the next quarter or 2, a little bit more the same. We're hearing specific plans of customers, in Canada for instance, trimming drilling programs, more cuts to come in North America. The flip side is though we see continued growth overseas and so net-net, I can't tell you if that ends up in net increase or not. But call it flat to maybe a little bit of a downward bias in terms of activity. The nature of our PS&S business, though may be just a little bit different than what a lot of investors perceive in that, it is more manufacturing than other service businesses that may be viewed as comparable or peers. And that's one of the things I tried to highlight in my comments, about 3\/4 of PS&S is actually manufacturing of consumables and short-lived capital. And so what that does, in a way, is to just delay by maybe a month or 2 kind of the effect of a downturn in activity and when we see it in PS&S. Some of the businesses are services and they are very rig-count driven and we fill it in rig time, but others have a little bit of a backlog, maybe a few weeks of orders that help us kind of buffer that. So that enabled PS&S to post pretty good revenues. They were down 3% sequentially in Q3, and kind of forestall a downturn in sales. But Q4, we're calling for maybe a little more of the same, I would say flat to maybe down slightly.","Merrill A. Miller","And also, Doug, one of the things that's good about our PS&S side, when I talked about the efficiency gains and a lot of the wells being drilled, while the demand for rigs is declining a little bit, the efficiency gains and the footage being drilled is still pretty -- is still pretty good. And a lot of the tools that we're putting in there, whether they're Helios drilling bits or whether our -- they're our new downhole motors, are really doing very, very well. So there's -- it's kind of a 2-sided coin right there, but we do have some positive things because of those efficiency gains.","Douglas L. Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That makes sense. So if newest rig count were to kind of flatten out as we go into 2013, international presumably still improving, would you expect margins to still be kind of around the 20% level or actually improve?","Clay C. Williams","I think, if we have growth overseas, that's a good foundation for margin expansion as we kind of move to through 2013. And so, if North America just hangs in there and stabilizes, we can certainly -- we've got terrific managers who are good at managing the cost side of the equation here, and then with little growth overseas and we see the same sorts of adoption of new technologies of these new products blossom in shale plays overseas, that's -- you're moving from 1 continent to another 5 or 6, that's a pretty good tailwind in 2013 to drive margins a little higher towards the end of the year.","Douglas L. Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then, Pete, I think I know the answer to this, but Clay was mentioning the potential of a new paradigm for rig orders, just more stable. And I guess I'd argue, all else equal, this should mean higher multiples for the stock. What does this make you think about capital allocation? Does it make share repurchases more attractive in your eyes, or you still tend to focus more in the acquisition and dividend angle?","Merrill A. Miller","Doug, I think our -- we're going to probably continue more on the M&A and the dividend issue, but we look at everything all the time. I mean, whenever we have a Board meeting, we review with our Board strategically where we are and what the best allocation of capital is. And I've got an awfully good Board and astute Board, and I think they will chime in and give us our guidance as well. But I would say right now, we still believe we do emanate very, very well and we'll continue to look at that and, of course, our dividend payments will remain there. But you're right, I think that as we take a look at this new paradigm, what we believe is there, we also believe that we do deserve a higher multiple. So I will certainly not argue with you on that one. But again, as I tell everybody, everything is always on the table for us, it's just a matter of what the best determination is at that point in time.","Clay C. Williams","We've -- I think the key thing here is we've used both acquisitions, as well as capital investments internally to support our customers to meet their needs. We've seen rising demand across a lot of our businesses. And throughout Rig Technology and PS&S both, as well as some businesses and distribution, we've deployed a lot of capital or CapEx. Our plan was the CapEx move up very sharply in 2012. We're actually probably going to under spend what we budgeted for simply because our eyes are a little bit bigger than our stomach. But the capital is available there to grow these businesses and we are happy to put it to work to take care of our customers.","Operator","Next question comes from Brad Handler from Jefferies & Company.","Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","A couple of unrelated things, please, and I guess they are probably both pretty quick. The first is, I guess I was surprised -- I know you tend not to talk about specific rigs and so, I'm just going to ask you to reach however you can. But I was a little surprised that the orders this quarter included 5 rigs from Brazil. Maybe it's almost that it didn't include other things. So I was sort of anticipating less from Brazil and more from the rest of the world. If there's any color you can add to that, to the timing of how that plays out and maybe suggestions about your anticipation for Q4 or Q1 in that context, I'd appreciate it.","Merrill A. Miller","Sure, Brad. As we've talked many, many times, the timing of the backlog is always a very interesting phenomena. And we cut it off. We basically -- if we don't have an order by the 30th of September, that's that. And a lot of the times, what you'll see, what people will be making announcements about, we're going to do this or we're going to do that. We also don't put anything notional on our backlog. It's got to be -- its got to have a signed document and it's got money with it normally as well. And so, a lot of the things that you read about, that people say we're ordering, they aren't necessarily ordered last quarter and they'll push out into another quarter. And that's one of the reasons that we've -- we talk about this all the time about -- as you take a look at backlog, you really have to look at it over a more extended period because, again, if that date's certain that we always cut things off. And I think, if you look over the last 4, 5 quarters, you can see that we've always been over -- I can't remember the last quarter that we weren't over a 1:1 book-to-bill, but new orders have stayed very, very, very steady and we feel very good about where we're going into the future.","Clay C. Williams","Yes. Actually, 8 out of the last 9 quarters, I think, our book-to-bill was in excess of 1. In this quarter, we had record revenue out of backlog and orders exceeded that by 20%. So 120% of record revenue book-to-bill is pretty strong.","Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Absolutely. No question about it. I guess, I was -- well maybe a constructive question, just to ask, were the 5 -- were the 5 coming out of the Sete, Brazil orders?","Clay C. Williams","Yes. That's -- yes.","Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. All right, Fair enough. The unrelated follow-up, if you may -- if I may is, maybe just a little help on the distribution guidance. In third quarter, how much of the quarter included CE Franklin, as well as Wilson?","Merrill A. Miller","We had a full quarter Wilson and almost a full quarter CE Franklin.","Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Almost. Okay. So in other words...","Clay C. Williams","You're getting a pretty good window in sort of a go-forward capability of Distribution & Transmission. And the other point on that too, and I mentioned this in my comments, but the mix shifted towards North America, which is slowing a little bit. So that's the headwind in Q4 baked into the guidance on Distribution & Transmission I gave a few minutes ago.","Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got it. I understand. All right, so it's a pretty straight comparison quarter-on-quarter. Okay. Very good.","Operator","The next question comes from Jim Crandell from Dahlman Rose.","James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Pete and Clay. Just to follow up on that last question, that was my exact question too. I had expected these BrasFELS orders to fall into the fourth quarter and beyond. I didn't think you were near. Are we talking about the BrasFELS orders when you say yes from Sete?","Merrill A. Miller","Jim, we -- you know us when it comes orders. We always let our customer kind of tell you what it is. In this particular case, they are from Sete. I mean, that's pretty well known because Sete is doing just about everything there. But we always defer to our customers to talk about that.","James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","So BrasFELS hasn't ordered any rigs through you or they would come through Sete as well?","Merrill A. Miller","Yes. The way Brazil's working right now, Jim -- and we've kind of talked a lot about this. Sete is actually the people that are ordering rigs, and then the customers, they come to us when we work with them. And so, the ultimate customer on those is, in fact, Sete. There's -- the bottom on it, to put Brazil in context, there is more rigs to come out of Brazil yet. There's still some that have not been -- orders have not been placed and we would expect those orders to be placed probably in the next quarter to half a year. So it could be Q4 2012, could be Q1 of 2013.","James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, good. That's what I needed.","Merrill A. Miller","I mean, I think that's probably what you really wanted to get to, so [indiscernible] there.","James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","And Pete, are you having any discussions today with customers that haven't ordered rigs before? People that might not be in the business. And we're talking ultra-deepwater rigs here. Are there likely to be some new ultra-deep rig orders coming from other companies or investors in the business?","Merrill A. Miller","Yes. Jim, I think the potential is there. If you kind of go back and look historically, and you think about what Seadrill did and people like Pacific, and DryShips and folks like that back in the '05, '06 timeframe, I think there'll be some others that will come out. But today, it's probably being driven much more by, what I would call, your traditional players. When you take a look at the Atwood Oceanics and the Rowans and the Diamonds of the world that are actually out there with those rigs today, there will be some nontraditional folks out there. But a lot of our emphasis today is really on some of those. Those more traditional, conventional players.","James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Pete, and my last question, you know that I think that competing with National Oilwell Varco in deepwater rig orders is probably about the most challenging thing any company could ever undertake. And in that context, do you think you're at risk at all to losing any of your traditional customers to a new player for deepwater rig packages?","Merrill A. Miller","Jim, I like the way we do things. This is a complex business and I think a lot of people don't really realize the complexities associated with what it is we're doing, because we do it quite well. We've got a bunch of people that really know how to get it done. The key, all this stuff is execution. I listened to a couple of calls earlier. People talk about supply change -- challenges and different things like that. There's -- you've got to really know how to do those things. And if you look at our track record over this -- over the past 6 or 7 years, on being able to deliver these things on time, on budget, that's pretty darn attractive to our customers. And so, we think the best defense against anything is just to continue to execute and execute flawlessly. And if we can do that, we like where we are.","Operator","The next question comes from James West from Barclays.","James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Guys, or Clay, really, in your comments, you talked about, on deepwater, this new industrial paradigm and how the deepwater drillers are starting to really embrace this new era. Are you suggesting that we could see a deepwater driller or a series of deepwater drillers come out and say something along the lines of, \"We're going to build a couple of deepwater rigs per year for the next decade.\" Or are you just kind of commenting that it will be more the same this kind of, \"We got a contract for a new build rig and let me order another one.\"","Clay C. Williams","Yes. I'm not sure if they're going to come out and talk in those precise terms and for that kind of time period. I guess my comments are more around I get the feeling that they're more comfortable with a certain level of building, that the projects are going pretty well. They're able to finance them, They're able to contract these rigs at attractive day rates. There -- I think there's a growing level of comfort in rig building that wasn't there 3, 4, 5, 10 years ago, and that's more what I'm referring to. Strategically, I can't tell you and they're not sharing with us something that long-range, although internally, they may be considering it. But I just get the sense that they buy into this idea that worldwide production is going to continue to shift more and more into deepwater. That's the new frontier for the 21st century. It takes a lot of rigs to make that happen, and that their internal organizational effort and financing efforts going into new build rigs is working pretty well. And we saw this on the land side maybe a few years earlier with drillers like H&P. They set up a system internally, for instance, in that case, to build flex [ph] rigs. And once they got it up and running, it worked pretty well. You sort of develop a more systematic process around building these rigs, the rig design, staffing the rigs, training crews, financing the rigs. And I think that's what's at work amongst the more established drillers now. It's that it's become a more systematic process, they're comfortable with it. Strategically, it's a great path to earnings growth and a great path to deployment of capital for their shareholders and just a kind of a more steady-state world. Let me, though -- also point out though that we get the fact this is always going to be a cyclical business and we're always going to be subject to external factors like the availability of credits, steel cost, shipyard slots, et cetera, et cetera. So this is going to have some volatility in it. The point I'm trying to make is, what's really changed and what we're trying to highlight is that perhaps the strategic thinking of our customers has -- is evolving and shifting in a positive way for NOV.","James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful, Clay. And then one last kind of unrelated follow-up from me. On the M&A side of the business, obviously, Robbins & Myers, a big transaction for you. I know you guys are still focused on M&A along with dividends, not share buybacks necessarily. But are you comfortable with that scale of a transaction given the series of transactions you've made over the last couple of quarters, plus Robbins & Myers probably come into fruition and close in at some point later this year or early next year.","Clay C. Williams","We put a lot of capital to work through acquisitions in 2012. And as a result of that, our folks are very, very busy. They have a day job in that they devote a lot of effort into taking care of our customers. And in addition to that, they're integrating all these new businesses as well. So we've been very, very busy. In the long run, yes, we -- as Pete mentioned earlier, we view that as an important strategic initiative at NOV. We think we're good at integrating businesses and buying businesses, and so, we want to continue to deploy capital through that pipeline, and we'll see what 2013 holds.","Operator","Next question comes from Robin Shoemaker from Citi.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Pete and Clay, wanted to just clarify a couple of things. On these Brazilian orders, were these complete packages, rig equipment packages, including BOPs?","Merrill A. Miller","I can't -- I don't recall. I don't know if it's -- they were good orders, Robin.","Clay C. Williams","They were good orders.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Well the first 7 that you booked, I guess a year ago, were -- included BOP systems.","Clay C. Williams","They did, they did. Pretty sure [ph] I think this does, but I don't know that for sure.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And on the -- are these very long lead time kind of -- these are long backlog items, right, as are the original 7 there. Are these like for rigs that will be completed in 2016 or '17?","Merrill A. Miller","Yes, Robin. I mean, obviously, in the timeframe that we're talking about here, it's going to be a little bit longer than what you're doing in Korea because these shipyards are dealing with a little bit more of a learning curve, but you start recognizing revenues earlier than that. But I would say most of these deliveries are in the 4-year timeframe.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. And I think you've commented before like in this kind of rig construction cycle, margins on Rig Tech are -- you've kind of guided to mid-20s versus high-20s in the last rig construction cycle. And is that still your view that the margins that are -- you're achieving in Rig Technology sales are a little lower than in the past cycle?","Clay C. Williams","Yes. Robin, that's a good question and probably worth taking a couple of minutes to speak to the factors. There's a lot of factors at work there in 2012, 2013 that a little different than what we saw in 2007, 2008, which is kind our prior peak as part of the cycle. So to start with, pricing has never returned to where it was early 2008. We're probably 6%, 7%, 8% lower on drilling equipment packages than we were winning in 2008 today. And the reasons for that is it's a little bit different world in the sense that, if you remember back '07, '08, the very capable shipyards are building rigs had very -- they were pretty filled up with other vessels and had very few slots to devote to building drilling rigs. Today, there's a lot of idle quayside [ph] space amongst the most capable rigs in Asia, and there's less urgency in the system as a result of that. And so the drillers, I think, can order more at their leisure, and so they can put more energy into beating up their DEP providers like NOV. And so, it's kind of a little slower pace of orders and less urgency that's kept pricing down a little bit. We also face price competition out there. As Pete mentioned, I think we have the best execution and we still command premiums, when it -- premium prices when it comes to our kit, but we've got a lot of competitors shooting at us and bidding below us. And so, that's made a little bit of a difference, too. But pricing is down from 2008, that's number one. Number two is, we've talked a lot on previous calls about the fact that the shipyards are delivering rigs faster than they used to. They've shaved 12 to 18 months off of a drillship for instance. And what that has done, if you think about NOV manufacturing pieces of kit to go into that project, it has stepped up the velocity of kit through our system. Now you might assume that, that equals better absorption for our Rig Technology group, and it does. But what we're finding is that, that's more than offset by some of inefficiencies that arise out of the higher velocity, more urgent pace that we have internally. So for instance, we're going to more second and third shifts to accomplish the manufacturing that we need to accomplish, and those are usually less efficient in the first shifts. We're going to second and third and fourth tier suppliers to help us meet our needs. We're doing more outsourcing. There's just generally a lot more complexity in our system now because of that higher velocity to fit with the vessel construction schedule, and that's taken a little bit of toll as the marginal cost of the last few pieces of kit that we make rises a little bit. The third factor is we have a lot of organic expansion underway across Rig Technology. With the growth in demand and the growth in velocities through our system, we have expanded places like our West Little York plant where we make blowout preventers. We're now adding a sixth and a seventh rig-up pad. And to do that, we had to rearrange a lot of our operations and actually, move offices and the like, and that's very disruptive. We're expanding our plant out in California where we make top drives. And to accomplish that, we moved products out of there into a plant in Mexico. And so, that's -- this rearrangement, this expansion is carrying some start-up cost in that business that are going to be with us for next several quarters. The fourth factor is, as you know, we've added a couple of businesses in Rig Technology in the last couple of years devoted -- that are in the deepwater space, FPSOs and flexible pipe. And those have flowed in at margins that are a little lower than the segment margins. And then the fifth, which is more of a later development here in the last quarter, is that demand for pressure pumping and land equipment in North America is clearly falling, so that's a little bit of a headwind. So you kind of go through all of that and it means that getting margins back up into the high-20s where they were a couple of years ago, while we see a path to margins above 25%, the next few quarters at least, are going to be a little more challenged. It is worth pointing out though, this segment in the third quarter, the one we just reported, on a no-pad [ph] after-tax operating profit basis, generated about 25% returns on capital which is outstanding, and returns on tangible capital north of 50%. So the business is performing very, very well and 23%, 24% more operating margins for manufacturing businesses are -- it's fairly rare. So our guys are doing a great job.","Merrill A. Miller","And, Robin, to also demonstrate the wonderful execution of NOV, after I've said that I wasn't sure on the BOPs, I just did get some emails that said \"Yes, in fact, those rigs in Brazil include the BOPs.\" So that should answer that question for you as well.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back for final remarks.","Merrill A. Miller","Thank you, Christine. And I appreciate everybody who dialed in today, and I look forward to talking to you on our next call for the year-ending results of 2012.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Mr. Loren Singletary, Chief Investor and Industry Relations Officer. Sir, you may begin.","Loren Singletary","Welcome everyone to National Oilwell Varco\u2019s second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With me today are Clay Williams, our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Jose Bayardo, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of today\u2019s comments are forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measures are in our earnings release available on our website. ","On a US GAAP basis, for the second quarter of 2018, NOV reported revenues of $2.1 billion and a net income of $24 million or $0.06 per share.","Our use of the term EBITDA throughout this morning\u2019s call corresponds with the term \u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d as defined in our earnings release.","Later in the call, we will host a question-and-answer session. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up to permit more participation. ","Now, let me turn the call over to Clay.","Clay Williams","Thank you, Loren. This morning I am pleased to report that National Oilwell Varco posted solid results in the second quarter of 2018, with revenues increasing 17% sequentially to $2.1 billion. EBITDA was $226 million, representing 21% incremental leverage to our first quarter 2018 results.","On the whole, we continue our steady march out of the worst oilfield downturn of a generation, and I am very proud of the fight that our employees have demonstrated as we\u2019ve navigated this ordeal. ","NOV has emerged with a great team focused on producing great results for our customers and our shareholders alike. All three business segments performed well during the second quarter. In fact, all three posted double-digit revenue growth sequentially, with each segment benefiting from stronger second quarter demand in most major international markets. ","Canada was the exception, declining 16% on a consolidated basis due to its seasonal breakup and road travel bans, which occur every year during the spring thaw. All three segments also posted solid sequential top-line growth in the United States, with the company continuing to gain share in key products and services in the most active unconventional shale basins.","Specifically, Wellbore Technologies posted brisk growth in bits, MWD tools, downhole drilling tools, and solids control technologies which we\u2019ve invested in and introduced through the downturn. ","Drill pipe sales increases were helped by our new Delta premium connection, and we expect to Delta drill pipe sales to double this year. Completion & Production Solutions achieved higher pressure pumping and wireline equipment sales, both here and abroad, along with higher sales of fiberglass tubulars and process and flow equipment. ","Rig Technologies finalized the creation of our joint venture with Saudi Aramco during the quarter, which brought in an order for 50 land rigs for the Kingdom. This was the largest land rig order ever placed. ","The Rig Technologies segment also sold three drilling rigs into the Vaca Muerta unconventional shale play in Argentina. After steadily declining through 2015, \u201816 and \u201817, we are pleased to see Rig Technologies backlog being replenished, back to $3.5 billion, its highest level since the fourth quarter of 2015.","During the second quarter of 2018, we saw inflationary headwinds building, particularly in the United States. Labor costs are rising in many markets, not just Midland, Texas, due to very low unemployment levels across the country. We are managing higher steel costs arising from tariffs as best we can, with most, but not all, business units reporting that they are able to pass at least a portion of higher costs on to our customers. Other commodities we buy are also seeing cost increases. ","Resin for our fiberglass pipe products, for instance, has risen 61% since the beginning of the year. All these factors can take a toll on our incrementals and our margins. However, our ability to recapture cost increases through pricing appears to be improving, as oil prices remain high, and as macro-driven winds continue to shift slowly to our backs.","We believe that 3.5 years of E&P underinvestment; depletion-driven well declines; strengthening, synchronized global economic growth; and geopolitical flashbang events are all conspiring to drive the world-wide excess production capacity cushion down, and oil prices up. Our oilfield service customers who comprise about 70% of our revenues -- revenue base are very good at postponing maintenance and cannibalizing equipment and keeping it all together with duct tape and bailing wire, through at least the first part of a downturn. ","But, as we\u2019ve said since the beginning, they can only do that for so long. So we are not surprised to see higher demand for spare parts for rigs, to see more orders for conductor pipe connections, to see higher demand for tubular coating and inspection services, to see more offshore special-purpose surveys or SPSs. ","Embedded in this demand mosaic are indications increasingly clearer that the E&P industry is getting back to playing offense in a $70 per barrel world. The growth that we are seeing in international markets points to E&P\u2019s around the world stretching and warming up and readying themselves to get back in this game. This includes the offshore. ","Strong second quarter demand for conductor pipe connections for the offshore, for instance, is a good leading indicator of more offshore wells to be drilled in future quarters. Although still mostly focused on smaller tie-back opportunities and brownfield developments, our rising levels of quotation and tendering activities for flexible pipe, processing skids and FPSO equipment are beginning to address more medium and large scale opportunities, consistent with industry forecasts for more offshore FIDs in 2018. ","We are excited about the prospect of bringing new and better ways of producing oil and gas from deepwater basins to the next upturn, technologies that we continued to hone and develop throughout the downturn that will further reduce our customers\u2019 cost per barrel.","In the offshore drilling rig space, we are quoting pipe handling, hookload and motion compensation upgrades to enable rigs to stand out in a crowded field of competitors. Rising SPS project volumes indicate contractors are gearing up for more bidding activity, although we had an urgent phone call to come fix equipment following a failed Do-It-Yourself project by a customer attempting to perform their own overhaul. Since you are not the OEM, please do not try this at home. ","Predictive analytics and new total cost of ownership aftermarket models represent new and growing opportunities for NOV that we are pioneering with our customers. We are in the process of installing NOVOS, our exciting, new drilling rig operating system, on the first offshore rig, with several more installations planned for customers in queue. ","We have over 40 land and offshore rigs either installed or slated to be installed and interest in this technology is keen. Several third parties including major oil companies are developing apps to drive rig efficiency through this transformative, open-platform NOV operating system, which will add to an already robust and growing app library. The apps permitted by NOVOS, together with multi-machine control, will continue to transform the job of the driller from rig-driver to process manager. This will unleash the individual driller\u2019s experience and judgment on more important big picture rig processes than tedious manipulation of tools and tongs. NOVOS is empowering drillers to do their very best work.","Technology and best practices never cease evolving in the E&P jungle. The current downturn is demonstrating that low oil prices merely prompt brilliant minds in this industry to think harder, and these brilliant E&P minds have steadily lowered the marginal cost to develop and produce oil and gas from conventional basins, unconventional basins, and offshore basins. NOV has been a leader in all these basins, as we have designed, built, tested and iterated new technologies to help drive this evolution. ","We are well positioned for the upturn, which creeps a little closer every day.","The Middle East continues to be an area of great interest for us. NOV will bring key technologies needed to efficiently exploit the vast resources of this region. NOCs there remain keenly focused on the potential of shale technologies developed in North America, specifically extended reach drilling of long horizontal laterals and multi-stage hydraulic fracture stimulation and completion, to drive better efficiency and productivity. ","The region is in need of upgrading its rig fleet and pressure pumping capabilities to achieve these results, which can be further enhanced with new capabilities like higher levels of automation enabled by our NOVOS control system. Likewise, the Vaca Muerta in Argentina will also benefit from better drilling and completion equipment and technologies. ","Long, precisely placed horizontal laterals and hydraulic fracture stimulations will continue to be employed globally, and will continue to transform the oil and gas industry for decades to come.","To our employees who are listening, I want to offer my thanks and congratulations on the outstanding work that you do every day to take care of our customers. Loren, Jose, and I appreciate everything that you do.","I\u2019ll turn it over now to Jose to provide more operational color.","Jose?","Jose Bayardo","Thank you, Clay. To recap the quarter, NOV consolidated revenue was $2.11 billion, an increase of 17% or $311 million sequentially. EBITDA improved $66 million to $226 million, or 10.7% of sales. Operating profit was $52 million, or 2.5% of sales and we posted net income of $24 million or $0.06 per share.","Looking at a couple notable items on the P&L, SG&A increased $15 million sequentially, primarily due to higher incentive compensation and labor costs. Other expense fell $44 million, due to the losses associated with FX and certain assets in Q1 that did not repeat in the second quarter. ","Cash flow from operations was $239 million and capital expenditures totaled $63 million.","Last quarter, we mentioned that we felt the M&A environment remained constructive and we were optimistic about closing several acquisitions. During the second quarter, we completed four strategic transactions for total consideration of $244 million. While our M&A pipeline is not as robust today as it was last quarter, we continue to see interesting possibilities in the M&A market and we remain well positioned to opportunistically pursue compelling transactions.","Turning to results of our operations. Our Wellbore Technologies segment generated $793 million in revenue in the second quarter of 2018, an increase of $82 million or 11.5%. The segment delivered 37% incremental margins, resulting in a $30 million increase in EBITDA to $133 million, or 16.8% of sales. Each business unit within the segment experienced robust growth. ","Demand for our technologies that help customers more efficiently and precisely drill wells, meaningfully outpaced growth in activity levels in the US, and the Eastern Hemisphere shook off its lethargic start to the year. ","Our US operational results were partially offset by the Canadian spring break-up, resulting in a 7% sequential revenue improvement in the Western Hemisphere. Significantly improved demand from the Middle East and Asia led to a 13% sequential improvement in our Eastern Hemisphere revenues.","Our Grant Prideco drill pipe business delivered a sharp sequential increase in revenue due to strong bookings in Q1. This increase was a welcome change after experiencing meaningful revenue declines over the past few quarters. ","More importantly, bookings remained strong in Q2 as they improved slightly from Q1. We are seeing more demand emerging from international markets, particularly the Middle East, an area in which we are realizing growing adoption of our Delta connections.","While drill pipe market conditions are rapidly improving, the business continues to face challenges associated with low volumes, customers who remain capital constrained, and inflationary pressures that have been further compounded by tariffs. ","Notwithstanding these challenges, we remain very encouraged about the potential for this business to deliver outsized growth and strong incremental margins in the mid to longer term, as we continue to see customer inventory levels decline to extraordinarily low levels.","Our ReedHycalog business saw an 11% sequential improvement in revenue during the second quarter. Comparable growth was achieved by each of our three major product families in this business unit, which include our bits, borehole, and coring products, our downhole measurement tools, and our eVolve drilling automation and optimization services.","NOV\u2019s bits, borehole, and coring product line realized particularly strong growth in the US and in the MENA region. Our industry-leading ION shaped-cutter technologies combined with strong execution of repair and maintenance services are driving market share gains and commanding premium pricing.","We typically give our drill-bit technologies a disproportionate amount of well deserved air time during these calls, but it\u2019s also worth highlighting that our coring and borehole enlargement offerings are well recognized by our customers for delivering compelling value to their operations. ","Our dogleg reamer has become a standard part of the bottom hole assembly for several customers in Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and Egypt due to its ability to deliver more than 50% reductions in back reaming trip-out times. ","And our coring business is gaining share in the Middle East where we recently received a four year contract from a large customer covering all conventional and enhanced oil saturation coring product solutions.","In our downhole measurement tools operation, NOV\u2019s Tolteq MWD products drove solid growth in the US, Russia, China, and Turkey, where we recently secured a large package order for our iSeries MWD products together with Vector drilling motors. ","NOV\u2019s unique ability to independently provide these products supported our customers\u2019 efforts to establish a new directional drilling service operation in the country.","Our Downhole business unit realized a 9% sequential increase in revenue with strong EBITDA flow through. This improvement was led by 10% growth in the US and a sharp rebound in fishing tool sales and motor rentals the Middle East. ","We are also seeing greater adoption of our Agitator axial oscillation systems in the region due to their ability to meaningfully improve drilling efficiencies.","For example, NOV recently worked with a major service provider in the Middle East to improve performance while drilling an 8.5 inch curve section. We recommended using NOV\u2019s AgitatorHE PLUS with our HEMIDRIL motor, which improved the service provider\u2019s ability to drill through the curve section and extend horizontal reach setting a new field record.","Our latest motor technologies and Agitator tools are also driving better performance for our customers in the US. Using NOV\u2019s ERT power section and our Agitator product, a major operator in the Bakken averaged 286 feet per hour while drilling a well to a target depth of 20,960 feet. The 72.8 hour spud-to-TD time set a record for the company.","Outcomes like this create our reputation for industry-leading motor performance and longevity and help us drive market share gains. The results come from design teams that constantly challenge themselves to drive down the cost for our customers while delivering more torque and improved reliability, and from operational teams who leverage the latest manufacturing equipment and statistical process control techniques to ensure we deliver quality products to our customers.","Our WellSite Services business posted a 7% sequential increase in revenue led by growth from our solids control services in the US, Argentina, and Middle East. We are realizing market share gains in part due to our recently introduced SABRE shaker system, which has been proven to handle 1.5 to 2 times the amount of drilling fluids compared to other high-performance shakers. SABRE also reduces oil retention on cuttings by approximately 10%, decreasing haul-off and disposal costs. ","The business unit\u2019s MD Totco operation notched key wins in West Texas and the Mid Continent, the most notable of which was a 20-rig data acquisition system conversion for a customer in West Texas.","Lastly, our Tuboscope business unit delivered a 6% sequential revenue increase. US coating operations improved 12% from increasing demand for drill pipe coating services. Our coating operations in the Middle East also saw significant growth due to the delivery of a large order of our Thru-Kote connection sleeves. The delivery helped us set a record during the second quarter for our highest sales volume of this patented product, which protects internal pipe coatings during welding operations.","For the third quarter, we expect our Wellbore Technologies segment to again outpace global activity, which should lead to mid to upper single-digit percent top-line growth. ","Near-term, we expect the impact of improving absorption and pricing on margins to be tempered by inflationary forces resulting in Q3 incremental margins that are in line with Q2.","Notwithstanding near term inflationary pressures, we continue to see a multi-year time horizon in which this segment can deliver attractive top-line growth with strong incremental margins.","Our Completion & Production Solutions segment generated $738 million in revenue in the second quarter, an increase of 10% or $68 million sequentially. Robust demand for capital equipment in North America and strong operational level execution more than offset the ongoing challenges affecting our offshore focused businesses. ","Despite these challenges, the segment delivered 31% incremental margins, resulting in a $21 million increase in EBITDA to $94 million, or 12.7% of sales. Shipments slightly exceeded our bookings of $398 million, providing us with a 95% book-to-bill. ","We also realized a $35 million FX reduction due to a 15% devaluation of the Brazilian real to the US dollar. Total segment backlog at quarter end was $955 million.","Our Intervention and Stimulation Equipment business unit posted an 18% sequential improvement in revenue. This growth was a result of the significant increase in deliveries of pressure pumping equipment, improving demand for wireline equipment and coiled tubing, healthy contributions from the business\u2019 new line of cementing equipment, and improving execution in our aftermarket operations.","Bookings for the business unit were in line with the first quarter, resulting in a 99% book-to-bill on substantially higher shipments. The pickup in demand for new coiled tubing equipment we saw in Q1 carried into Q2, and we also realized a sharp increase in demand for wireline equipment. ","While we are seeing some trepidation in the North American market for pressure pumping equipment, bookings for support equipment remain solid, and we continue to see opportunities for pump sales to customers who need to replace aging fleets, as well as steady demand for repair and refurbishment related work.","Industry conditions are improving and driving demand for new equipment, as are the technology innovations offered by NOV. Our latest data technologies, advanced designs, and industry-leading capabilities allow our service company customers to be more effective and more efficient in pushing the boundaries on complex extended reach completions.","The market welcomed our recently introduced GoConnect technology for intervention and stimulation equipment. During the first six months of this year, one major independent oil and gas operator has leveraged 248 days of our GoConnect Asset Link data to improve operations on their completion jobs. The data was streamed from seven different coiled tubing service companies. ","Recently, one of our coiled tubing service provider customers committed to equipping their entire fleet of coiled tubing units with our GoConnect data links.","Our latest asset designs are also realizing strong market adoption. We believe our new Genesis line of coiled tubing units is the industry\u2019s most technologically advanced product offering. ","A number of innovative features enable the units to safely and efficiently use the largest tubing loads possible for a market that continues to demand longer lengths of larger diameter tubing for extended reach completion operations. ","Additionally, the units offer high visibility control cabins, providing a panoramic view of the wellsite as well as new electric controls with customizable displays. ","Since we debuted the product at the ICoTA Coiled Tubing and Well Intervention Conference, we received eight orders for the new Genesis product.","Our new DynaWinch iMaxx wireline truck is also seeing rapid uptake in the North American market. The unique design configuration offers the industry\u2019s most expansive range of vision of the well site, providing wireline crews with significantly more visibility than any other wireline truck on the market. The design alleviates challenges associated with poor visibility, enabling crews to operate equipment faster without compromising safety. Despite an extremely short time on the market, we\u2019ve already sold 14 units, and demand continues to increase.","Our Fiber Glass Systems business unit also realized an 18% sequential increase in revenue. Growing inflationary challenges stemming from increasing costs of raw materials, labor constraints, and other inflationary pressures partially restrained EBITDA and flow through. However, the operation executed well as it significantly increased deliveries in the US and South America from its backlog.","After posting three quarters in a row of bookings over $100 million, orders decreased in the second quarter, but we expect bookings to return to the $100 million plus range in Q3. This improvement will be driven by more and more domestic and international customers recognizing the long-term cost advantage of corrosion proof composite pipe in a wide array of applications.","Our Process and Flow Technologies business unit realized a 10% sequential top-line improvement as demand for reciprocating pumps and progressive cavity pumps for the US midstream market remains robust. The business unit also executed well against its Wellstream Processing backlog. ","While order intake for the land-oriented production and midstream portion of this operation is strong, bookings in its offshore oriented Wellstream Processing operation remain soft, although tendering activity for large projects is high.","Market fundamentals are improving, resulting in increasing tendering activity for all our offshore businesses. However, awards continue to be delayed, and most are not likely to be issued until late 2018 or early 2019. We expect our offshore businesses to find bottom in the second half of 2018 and we believe current market dynamics are setting up an environment in which our well positioned offshore business units will see substantial improvement in 2019.","Our Floating Production business continues to struggle with the challenging offshore market, as new orders have remained scarce, even though bidding activity is high.","Our Subsea Production Systems business unit saw a sequential improvement in revenue after the torsional stress related challenges faced in Q1 was resolved. ","Despite the higher revenue, EBITDA declined due to its mix of offshore projects, and orders remain slow.","However, supporting our optimism for an improving market outlook for the offshore is what we are seeing in our XL Systems conductor pipe connector business, which tends to be a leading indicator for offshore activity. ","Our backlog is building, and Q2 marked the fifth quarter in a row in which the business unit exceeded a 100% book-to-bill.","Looking at the third quarter, we expect to see an additional 6% to 7% sequential improvement in segment revenue, with incremental margins ticking up to the mid-30% range as the rate of decline in our offshore businesses begins to moderate.","Our Rig Technologies segment generated $651 million in revenue, an increase of $168 million or 35%. Revenue out of backlog increased $123 million to $276 million, due primarily to much improved progress on the construction of offshore newbuild drilling rigs and the delivery of two land rigs in the Middle East. ","Aftermarket revenues increased 14% sequentially, achieving their highest levels since the fourth quarter of 2015. EBITDA leverage was 23%, resulting in a $39 million increase in EBITDA to $84 million, or 12.9% of sales. We posted our third quarter in a row of improving bookings. ","Excluding the $1.8 billion order associated with our Saudi JV, we realized a 12% sequential increase in orders. ","As noted in the press release, we recently agreed to terminate a long-dated drillship contract with a customer in exchange for commitments to continue forward with other projects and certain other consideration. After deducting this contract, we exited the quarter with $3.5 billion in backlog for the segment.","As Clay mentioned, in addition to the 50 rig JV commitment, we also booked three land rigs, all destined for Argentina. We see more opportunities emerging in international markets. And since quarter end, we booked an additional rig sale for the Middle East.","In the US, at $25,000 a day, land rig day rates are at levels that can support super-spec newbuilds, and we are discussing opportunities with some smaller domestic drillers. Larger contractors are more focused on upgrading their existing equipment as opposed to building rigs. We are also seeing rising demand for higher capability well servicing rigs emerging in the US.","Orders for offshore equipment improved 42% during the second quarter, primarily due to a large package of equipment for a mid-water semi, which included a subsea BOP stack and other equipment.","We continue to anticipate that demand for newbuild floaters will remain limited outside of a few potential rigs for niche markets. However, we remain very encouraged regarding the opportunity NOV has to help the industry reactivate and upgrade the existing offshore fleet. ","Customer dialogue remains constructive, and we are seeing meaningful increases in projects related to reactivations and recertifications for assets preparing for future drilling campaigns.","Near term, we anticipate volatility in our quarterly bookings to continue as the business hovers near cyclical lows. We also expect margins to be pressured from our recent focus on converting inventory that has been slow to move during this prolonged downturn into cash while rewarding first-mover customers. ","Specifically, for the third quarter, we anticipate 1% to 3% top-line growth, with margins falling between 100 to 300 basis points.","We delivered solid results in all three segments during the second quarter due to strong execution by the many talented employees at NOV. While there are some near term challenges associated with takeaway issues in West Texas, an offshore market that has not yet fully healed, and inflationary pressures in the US, we believe that a stronger global recovery is beginning to take hold and that NOV is exceptionally well positioned to capitalize on the market opportunities that will emerge.","With that, we\u2019ll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. ","Clay Williams ","James?","Operator","Please check your mute button. ","Clay Williams ","Sabrina, I hope you didn\u2019t put him to sleep. Go to the next question. ","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Byron Pope with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. ","Byron Pope ","Good morning guys and I\u2019m lot awake here. ","Clay Williams","Good, at least not like him by the way, so. Go ahead, Byron. ","Byron Pope ","I will keep my question to one and it relates to Wellbore Technologies. Clay, I trend to think of that segment as being the top-line growth drivers -- driver for you guys over the next year or so. Could you frame where you guys are today in terms of the mix of shorter cycle and longer cycle, products and services? And the reason I asked the question is that, it seems as though you\u2019ve got some tailwinds starting to pick up as it relates to some of the longer cycle product lines like Grant Prideco, So I\u2019m just trying to get a feel for the relative mix today?","Clay Williams","Yes. Good question, Byron. About 80% of that business is shorter cycle, components that go directly into optimizing our customers drilling efforts and the remainder being longer cycle for the capital equipment like drill pipe and some shale shakers and things like that. So, yes, it has been performing really well with the resumption of drilling activity across North America. And we\u2019re pleased to see that, that business unit\u2019s performance over the last several quarters really. But what I\u2019m most excited about within that space is there are all the technologies that we been investing in through the downturn that are specifically focused on delivering lower tortuosity wellbores that are closely geosteered into the sweet spots of the targets that the oil companies really want to aim at. And I think we\u2019re really now just starting to get traction of some of those technologies, I think Jose highlighted a number in the -- in his remarks that we\u2019re pretty excited about. ","On the longer cycle stuff, drill pipe had a really good quarter, a bounce back in the second quarter, and good sequential growth. And so, very pleased to see that through -- likewise through the downturn there. We\u2019ve pioneered some new premium connections with our Delta connections, our Delta threads and that\u2019s getting really good traction in the marketplace. ","Unfortunately, though, in the second quarter, the mix shifted to be a little lower and smaller size and less -- fewer landing strains. And so, that took a little bit of hold on the incrementals here. But on the whole, very pleased with where we are in the drill pipe business within Wellbore Technologies. And, of note, we store drill pipe for our customers next door to our manufacturing facility in Navasota, Texas and our customer owned inventory within that yard is at the lowest level we\u2019ve seen since 2010 setting a pretty good backdrop I think the future drill pipe orders.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question will come from the line of James Wicklund with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please check your mute button.","James Wicklund","I\u2019m sorry. Thanks, guys. Sorry. ","Clay Williams","You\u2019re putting everybody to sleep this morning. ","James Wicklund","Now, a very good step up Clay from Q1, nice recovery, well done. ","Clay Williams","Thank you. ","James Wicklund","Within there is little down I don't think in anybody's mind that over the next couple of years as the cycle unfolds, you'll do better. You make everything that's made in the business, you make it better than most everybody else in the business and eventually we need to replenish capital and equipment. It's more the pace that has everyone a little questioning. But I noticed in the consensus for revenue growth for \u201819 the street has you at higher revenue growth than the other big four oilfield service companies? ","Clay Williams ","Yes.","James Wicklund","And I'm just wondering if you kind of agree with that. And I realized that we don't have crystal balls into the back half of \u201818, so \u201819 is a little bit of a stretch. But when you think about the spending surveys and the work you've done preliminarily and you guys are always good about thinking forward in the future, is the 15% top-line revenue growth in \u201819 higher than everybody else, achievable and likely?","Clay Williams","Well, Jim, we -- as a matter, I don't generally like to comment on consensus numbers and so forth and we rarely give that sort of quantitative outlook on growth. What I would tell you is as I mentioned with drill pipe as a great example here, 3.5 years of underspending across this sector. And as we can both agree, this is a very capital consumptive sector and activities that our oilfield service customers undertake consumes a lot of capital that a resumption of buying that's meaningful and material and will drive that top-line growth at NOV, I think very realistic that that's going to be a powerful engine for our revenues in 2019 and beyond. ","Jose Bayardo ","And also just to add to that, that the nature of the capital equipment business is a bit different than that of the service business as Clay is just describing there. So it\u2019s really across all of our segments. We think the businesses typically inflect in a different period of time and you expect service companies to inflect and often times they inflect a bit harder once they actually do inflect. ","Clay Williams","Yes, the other thought here too Jim is, that I would add is, what's been missing for all of us and this includes NOV and as well as the big four is the offshore, and that's an important revenue and margin driver for everybody. And although it's very early, our prepared remarks noted that we're starting to see rising levels of bidding activity and quotation activity and specific sales like conductor pipe, flexible pipe was up this quarter, signs of encouragement. And the offshore does come back in 2019, will probably all exceed growth forecasts that are out there. ","James Wicklund","Which actually leads to my follow-up question is, deepwater coming back in \u201819, I look at Exxon's, Chevron\u2019s, BP\u2019s and Shell\u2019s and wonder how much of their \u201819 budgets they\u2019ll jam into deepwater just yet. And so, the bids you're getting, the tenders you're getting, the conductor pipe orders that you're getting, are these -- do you think that there is going to be a resurgence in drilling and development activity overall or is this just a transition year in what's going to be a material improvement later on. I'm just curious to know what you all think about how much deepwater can improve in \u201819? You sound very bullish. ","Clay Williams","Well, again, I'll stress, this is very early. We're seeing indications, a lot of bidding and discussions. What's lacking so far though are FIDs are picking up, but we're not seeing as many purchase orders as we would like. So, I want to frame it realistically for kind of what we\u2019re seeing. ","Specifically with regards to our conductor pipe connectors, just about everything we sell through that product line is for the offshore. And so -- and the group that you mentioned is back to buying more of these, so that would point to more wells that they have, they have planned. So we\u2019re really pretty excited about that. ","And one of those companies that you mentioned told me about three weeks ago that their deepwater offshore portfolio now is probably more compelling economically than their unconventional portfolio. ","So I think it may progress on their economics. And so, we\u2019re kind of setting up for -- I think we\u2019re covering the offshore. And so, that\u2019s why we\u2019re more optimistic about the out years.","Jose Bayardo ","Yes. I\u2019ll add one more thing, Jim, it\u2019s Jose. We\u2019re not -- we\u2019re optimistic that we see improvement in offshore market in 2019, but there is also an international land market out there. And if you think about our performance \u2026","James Wicklund","And this I examine that, right. ","Jose Bayardo ","Well, it\u2019s really just getting started, right? ","James Wicklund","Agreed but -- and we can see that. ","Jose Bayardo ","Right. And if you think about our results to-date, so really look at our segment like Wellbore Technology, we\u2019re about 45% up from the trough in that business unit with virtually all of that improvement coming from one country called United States of America and it\u2019s really the rest of world is just starting to wake up and a for global enterprise like NOV that helps a lot and you can see the same dynamics in our CaP segment as well. So, we\u2019re excited about where things are shaping up for 2019.","James Wicklund","Okay, guys. Thank you very much. I appreciate. ","Clay Williams","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. And the next question will come from the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons. Your line is now open. ","Bill Herbert ","Thank you. Good morning.","Clay Williams","Hi, Bill. ","Bill Herbert ","Hey. Jose, can you provide us with at least what you have -- kind of violating Clay\u2019s diction here in terms of providing forward guidance on revenues. But I\u2019m just curious with regard to your thoughts on Rig Tech revenue out of backlog, the forward patch for that for the next two to six quarters, as it were, what should we expect for the balance of the year and then what are the thoughts for 2019?","Jose Bayardo","Well, Clay is in the room so how about if I limit it to just 2018. But I\u2019ll give you a little bit which, this numbers will become in our Q when we file a little bit later this afternoon. So if you look at the last six months of the year expectation for revenue out of backlog for Rig Tech is about $587 million. So, as you can sort of get a sense from the guidance that we provided is a small tick up from where we were in the second quarter for Q3.","Bill Herbert ","Got it. And then with regard to the Aramco contract, great win for you guys. Do you have a sense as to what that represents likely in terms of annualized revenue generation for you? I mean it\u2019s 50 rigs. So how many of those get out of the door on an annualized basis do you think at this juncture?","Clay Williams","We\u2019ll be ramping up Bill with first rig deliveries expected 2021, maybe recognizing whole revenue on a [PFC] basis before that. But building up to that sort of notional five rigs per year and you could do the math it\u2019s about $36 million a rig on average, I will tell you there is a mix of different rig sizes in that between 1,500 horsepower and 2,000 horsepower. But our customers may have the option to upgrade those to larger rigs with additional revenue possible.","Bill Herbert ","Okay. And then last one from me is, you talked about a little bit in your prepared commentary but drilling activity in the Permian slacked the past two months, completions activity in June, flattened out month-over-month, clearly the sector outlook for the Permian is awesome but we\u2019re likely ahead of speed bump here with WTI and then going to 53, who knows if it\u2019s going lower. Do you have thoughts with regard to how that impacts your shorter cycle businesses\u2019 lever to the Permian?","Clay Williams","Yes. Certainly like everybody else here, we\u2019re facing a little softer outlook I think over the next couple of quarters. But I don't think on a whole it\u2019s going to be terribly material to NOV at this point. What we expect -- our near-term outlook for our stimulation and equipment sales to pressure pumpers in the US is softening as a result of this as well. But what\u2019s encouraging is we\u2019re hearing from those customers kind of the same perspectives that I know you've heard as well, which is that the current level of operations consumes a lot of equipment. And so, we\u2019re still having conversations with lots of pressure pumpers for replacement and sort of support equipment to go in to replace pump trucks as they wear them out. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. ","Sean Meakim ","So starting with the shorter cycle businesses Wellbore and CaPS, I was wondering if you could maybe talk about the cadence of how those businesses could feel impact if the completions activity gets curtailed in the Permian and to a lesser degree rig activity and by impact I mean we could see some reduction in maintenance needs, if activity slows. But then on the other hand, we have heard from a largest pumper that there\u2019s value in taking advantage of some work apps maybe catch up on some maintenance work. So just curious what other razor could be for your business if and when that materializes?","Clay Williams","Yes, it\u2019s hard to say but you raised something that we see there which is when things -- areas like this slow down a little bit and equipment comes back in the shop, a lot of customers will actually step up spending to get that equipment ready to go again. And I think consensus view out there is that this takeaway capacity issue in the Permian is transient. And so, I think you\u2019ll probably have pressure pumpers spending time kind of upgrading and maintaining that equipment and which means spending money on aftermarket parts and services with NOV. I think you will also see activity shift to other basins as well, which will probably help mitigate the impact of the Permian. But look it\u2019s early days out there, none of us were quite sure how this was going to unfold but we are certainly keeping a close eye on it. ","Sean Meakim ","And then also thinking about just cash sources and uses. On sources, Jose, we talked about -- you mentioned a push towards liquidating inventory to a degree, incentivizing customers\u2019 order equipment will generate some cash here near term. Are you seeing signs of ability to maybe improve your receivables metrics? And then on uses, you mentioned the M&A pipeline maybe a bit smaller after some of the deals that you\u2019ve done to other uses of cash, maybe owning shares, this will move up the priority list, just how you\u2019re thinking about sources of uses I think could be helpful?","Jose Bayardo ","Sure. Yes, as it relates to sources, the quarter and year-to-date has sort of played out as we expected. We needed first half would be a little softer from a cash flow generation standpoint than kind of what we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years but anticipate improving as we move through the course of the year. And we started to see some lines of that improvement during the second quarter. So we saw things headed in the right direction. We had $311 million increase in revenue with a decrease in working capital, even though it was pretty modest, it's definitely heading in the right direction, and on the AR front we saw that go down about $135 million. So things heading in the right direction. And as you can probably get a sense from the bookings and orders that we're talking about, we're seeing more and more opportunities to move some of that inventory that has been sitting on the shelves over here throughout the course of the downturn. ","So definitely seeing more opportunities, definitely making more progress, but we still have quite a ways to go. So as we usually talk about our working capital metric, working capital as a percentage of annualized revenue run rate was down about 44% this quarter. We still are striving to get down into the mid-30% range by the end of next year. So I said, heading in the right direction and think that the cash flow generation will pick up -- continue to pick up as we move through the course of the year. ","As it relates to uses, so we've been very pleased with the opportunities that we've seen to-date to invest capital that we think will turn out to be investments at very high rates of return for our shareholders. Nothing has changed from our perspective in terms of our capital allocation hierarchy and our belief that this business will generate tremendous amount of cash over the next 24 to 48 months. But our number one priority is to make high return investments for our shareholders. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks that the pipeline isn't as robust as it was at this time last year, but we're still seeing interesting opportunities and we're optimistic about finding some good opportunities to deploy capital. But in the event they do not emerge, the balance sheet is in great shape right now, and we're heading towards a point where we might be ourselves of being overcapitalized. And if we see that scenario playing out, we'll look to return that capital to shareholders. ","Clay Williams","Yes. I'd add too on the M&A front. I mean we had four big closings in Q2, so a lot of good progress here. But very recently we had another opportunity to sort to reemerge that we thought it disappeared. So there are things like that, that can pop up, that are really good application to capital, and to Jose's point, earn great returns for our shareholders and we certainly want to make sure we're taking advantage of those. ","Operator","Thank you. And the next question will come from the line of Marshall Adkins with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Marshall Adkins","Good morning, guys. All your businesses did awesome this quarter, but Rig Tech was a particular standout after -- it seems like forever of declining offshore stuff. Give us more color on that? Specifically I'm looking for -- we have a whole bunch of unfinished rigs in the shipyards. Are we starting to see that come around? The after market you mentioned is up really nicely. Is that going to be the driver going forward? Is it more the land stuff, you got the Saudi thing little further out? I've got several questions on how sustainable this Rig Tech recovery is? So could you give us more color on that sustainability? ","Clay Williams","Great question, Marshall. And what I would say is if you look back over the last eight plus quarters, I think Rig Tech after declining over 80% has traced out a pretty stable business in the five to -- we just did $651 million range, so 500 -- call it $700 million range at high single-digit or double-digit -- low double-digit EBITDA margins. And so, fantastic effort by the team over there dealing with pretty extraordinary downturn in the business. What that business comprised of in second quarter that we just reported was nearly half aftermarket and the other half capital equipment and the resumption of progress on offshore rigs being built in Asia and yes that contribute a little bit, but it was more -- a little more broad-based in that, in the offshore, and then pretty good quarter with regards to land rigs, we shipped two to the Middle East. And so, what you\u2019re seeing in that business is continuing to transform itself to be more balanced between land and offshore and I think for the foreseeable future it\u2019s likely to continue to be that. ","Jose, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that since the close of the second quarter we\u2019ve now sold another rig in the Middle East. And so, that\u2019s -- it's going to continue to be a little lumpy and margins are going to continue to move around a little bit. But I think we are -- after the big downturn, I think we\u2019re achieving stability here. And then looking forward what\u2019s most exciting to me about Rig Technology is the fact that these new NOVOS control systems are really creating a lot of buzz in the marketplace. And we\u2019ve got major oil companies keenly interested in putting these to work to improve their operation. ","We\u2019ve got real commercial big data predicted analytics products that now are in their third year of being used in the field that have the masterably improved operations. And we\u2019ve taken the next step of signing up with customers to harness the power of these things to reduce their total cost of ownership. And so we\u2019ve got aftermarket agreements with a couple of the offshore drillers around that. ","So, in terms of kind of Rig Technology, I think we found front footing. We\u2019ve got great execution by the team there. We\u2019ve continued to invest in the next generation of technology and I think that we\u2019re set up for future prosperity. ","Marshall Adkins","Alright. So, we\u2019ll check the sustainability box there. Just unrelated follow-up on the Wellbore side. Jose, on the margin bump we saw, it sounds like most of that was throughput related, you\u2019re starting to fire back up the drill pipe factories. How much of that\u2019s pricing? And then going forward, help us kind of weigh that, you mentioned costs are going to go up. Should we think about this more as a throughput issue or pricing issue and how are costs going to affect that out for the next year?","Jose Bayardo ","Yes. I guess we\u2019re going say to-date through the recovery what we\u2019ve mostly seen in terms of delivering, almost 50% incremental is off of the bottom that\u2019s since Q2 of 2016. A majority of that comes from improved utilization and throughput offsetting all the absorption challenges we were having in the depths of the down cycle. We\u2019re now starting to get more and more opportunities to ratchet up pricing and actually our incremental margins for Q2 were a little lighter than what we had expected due to some of those inflationary forces coming in as well as, as Clay alluded to a little bit of mix issues with the huge bump up that we saw from our Grant Prideco drill pipe business. ","So, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we feel really good about the ability for that business to deliver very strong incrementals over a long period of time because utilization certainly helps a lot. We\u2019ve got that in the US now. We\u2019re going to start to build that in the international markets over the coming years and then we\u2019ll still have pricing opportunity to layer across that, plus drill pipe business tends to further enhance incremental margins over the longer term. So we feel really good about where that business is headed. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Marc Bianchi with Cowen. Your line is now open. ","Marc Bianchi","Thank you. Maybe to start with Jose, just a housekeeping item. Can you give us any guidance on the unallocated expense that you're expecting here for the third quarter, it increased quite a bit in the second, I suspect that\u2019s somewhat related to Rig Tech but curious how you\u2019re thinking about that for the third quarter?","Jose Bayardo ","Yes, you\u2019re right. So that the revenue lines in particular tend to follow the -- our revenue associated with our rig business with all the inter-company business with our Wellbore segments and CaPS business units, selling to the rig segment primarily with some sales going opposite direction as well. So when you see a big pick up in Rig Technologies, you\u2019re going to typically see both those numbers pick up on the revenue as well as the EBITDA or OP side. So a little bit disproportionate pick up on the profit side due to the fact that we saw some increases associated with payroll, really what we\u2019re talking about is incentive comp. We obviously had a pretty rough Q1 and had to make up some loss ground on that front in Q2. So ultimately depends on how Q3 shakes out, what we're seeing right now is we expect it to be flattish overall. ","Marc Bianchi","Okay, that's great. And then on completion production, you\u2019re talking about a second half bottoming in the offshore part of the business. Can you remind us what proportion of revenues coming from offshore right now and maybe help frame what the downside looks like between here and the bottom recognizing timing is really difficult to call on that?","Clay Williams","Yes. I would say on the order of 20% something in that range is probably the offshore mix. We\u2019ve got a number of business units in there sort of sell to both land and offshore. And so, that's kind of our exposure there in that business.","Marc Bianchi","Okay. And then would you say something like 20% downside would be extreme in your view in terms of pure at the bottom and offshore?","Clay Williams","Yes. ","Marc Bianchi","Great, okay. Thanks, guys. I will turn it back. ","Clay Williams","By the way sorry, I think I misspoke on the last one. Our offshore mix in the second quarter I\u2019m looking at here is 29%. So 71% land. ","Jose Bayardo ","That\u2019s the question that\u2019s being asked, that\u2019s for the segment overall. But if you look at the pure -- the more pure play type offshore business is in that 15% to 20-ish percent range, so. ","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Clay Williams for closing remarks. ","Clay Williams","Thank you, Sabrina. Appreciate everyone joining us this morning. And we look forward to hosting you when we report our third quarter results in late October. Thanks, everyone, have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude your program. You may all disconnect.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session with instructions given at that time.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Loren Singletary, Vice President, Investor & Industry Relations. Mr. Singletary, you may begin.","Loren Singletary - Vice President-Investor & Industry Relations","Thank you, Kevin, and welcome, everyone, to the National Oilwell Varco second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With me today is Clay Williams, President, CEO and Chairman of National Oilwell Varco. Before we begin this discussion of National Oilwell Varco's financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2015, please note that some of the statements we make during this call may contain forecasts, projections and estimates including but not limited to comments about our outlook for the company's business.

Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Loren, and welcome, everyone. This morning, we announced that National Oilwell Varco earned $0.74 per fully diluted share in its second quarter ended June 30, 2015 on a U.S. GAAP basis, excluding $17 million in pre-tax charges or $0.03 per share after tax related to severance and facilities closures. Earnings were $0.77 per fully diluted share, down 32% sequentially from the first quarter of 2015 and down 48% from the second quarter of 2014 excluding other items from all periods.","Revenues were $3.9 billion in the second quarter of 2015, down 19% sequentially and down 26% year-over-year. Consolidated operating profit excluding other items was $455 million or 11.6% of sales in the second quarter. Decremental operating leverage was 26% sequentially and 36% year-over-year. EBITDA, excluding charges in the second quarter was $627 million or 16% of sales, down 25% sequentially and down 45% year-over-year.","Almost all of our business units posted lower sequential sales due to lower-oil prices and lower activity around the globe, with only a few areas like Argentina and the Middle East bucking the trend. We also felt the full-quarter effect of customer discounts implemented during the first quarter along with cost absorption challenges in manufacturing facilities.","Generally, we still see some pricing pressures in certain products, mostly in international markets, but most North American business units are reporting that pricing is stabilizing at new lower levels as the rig count flattens. Consolidated revenues for the U.S. declined 29% sequentially. Canada was down 37% sequentially and international revenues fell 14% sequentially.","Orders improved 33% sequentially for rig systems, but they still remained low at $313 million. The second quarter included a jack-up drilling package and a production platform drilling rig. The rig systems backlog declined 13% sequentially to $9 billion. At this point, we're expecting orders to remain roughly flat in the third quarter, but to start to pick up in the fourth quarter driven by higher demand for land rigs and rising inquiries around capital components. Offshore order recovery is still many quarters away and we expect national oil company-driven jack-up demand to recover before floaters do.","Within completion and production solutions, orders fell 19% to $264 million leaving backlog 18% lower sequentially. We expect orders to remain low in the third quarter although we may get some incremental help from flexible pipe orders.","The oilfield services industry we sell to is very good at stopping expenditures when oilfield activity turns down, which they're demonstrating right now. We believe these spending levels are not sustainable because they support ongoing operations by depleting their inventories of consumables and equipment they have on the shelf or by raiding idled rigs for parts, components and drill pipe.","As oilfield service companies gradually destock, they will eventually run out of opportunities to cannibalize their existing fleets and we expect orders to begin to flow again to NOV, given that oil and gas remains a highly capital intensive undertaking and that NOV is one of its largest capital manufacturers and suppliers of technology.","Our visibility into how long they can live destocking and cannibalizing varies by product. We know drill pipe, for instance, is cannibalized from idled land rigs by some, but not all, drilling contractors, and drill pipe is probably a year away from meaningful recovery.","On the other hand, some products feel much closer to the turn. We are beginning to see some inquiries come in for drilling motor parts and relines. Last week, we began to see some new orders for fiberglass pipe. Our XL Systems conductor pipe unit, which sells mostly into the offshore, had a record quarter for inquiries during the second quarter.","Demand for wireline units is holding up pretty well with a brightening outlook for the second half. After declining every single month since last October, spare parts orders within our Rig Aftermarket group finally picked up for the first time in July.","A few weeks of improved order inquiries does not necessarily signal the turnaround, and we're hesitant to call bottom yet. But we know from past downturns that once the rig count stabilizes, the end of destocking and cannibalization is just a matter of time.","I would add too that I don't believe that fastidious equipment maintenance for the long run is at the top of our customers' priority list right now. Equipment is being run hard in the field and parked next to the fence and hosed down.","Customers living hand to mouth aren't sure if that particular unit will ever get another job and sure don't want to put cash into equipment without a firm job on the board. Just about everything on land can be cannibalized, but offshore typically only top drives, racker arms and iron roughnecks can be cannibalized cost effectively.","This time around, we will be helped by the fact that a lot of new generation equipment has flowed into the fleet. So the large overhang of mechanical equipment and SCR equipment will be less usable and less relevant on the new Tier 1 AC rigs that the industry is migrating to.","We also believe that the level of drilling we are stabilizing at is not sufficient to grow production, which will one day be required to meet rising demand. Unfortunately, North American shale production is not rolling over yet like we had hoped as operators are apparently high-grading their drilling into core areas of the shale place, and as completions slowly catch up with drilled wells.","And now, we are dealing with slowing economic growth in China and the potential return of 700,000 barrels of oil per day from Iran, meaning that our outlook for recovery gets pushed at least a couple more quarters into the future.","So, in the meantime, we have three areas of focus, one of which is to manage what we can. We're cutting costs. In the second quarter, we reduced SG&A 14% sequentially and 21% since the end of 2014.","Within our cost to sale structure, we are insourcing much more of our work from outside suppliers, seeking to preserve our core NOV employee base and utilize NOV machine shops and fabrication capabilities as much as possible. Our downhole tools business decreased outsourced manufacturing spending 58% sequentially.","Year-to-date, we've insourced 36,000 hours into one of our large rig systems manufacturing plants. By reducing overtime, winning discounts from our suppliers and high grading our supply chain across the organization, we were able to increase the margins we achieved on existing project work in Rig Systems. The segment posted 120-basis-point margin improvement sequentially despite a 24% sequential reduction in revenues.","Our drill pipe business is pacing production to match orders at about half of capacity to preserve our core team and core capabilities. These reductions were difficult but necessary and effective. We will emerge more efficient when the inevitable recovery finally does arrive.","Second, we continue to invest in our long-term strategic plans which will shape our opportunity set when we ultimately emerge from the current downturn. We're striking a balance between prudent cost reductions in the short run and investments in a future which will see the oil and gas industry continue to rely on sophisticated technologies to supply an energy-hungry world. We intend to emerge a better company in that world.","These initiatives include, for instance, within our Completion & Production Solutions segment, constructing a more comprehensive package of equipment for floating production systems by acquisition, by investing in R&D and working with industry partners.","Over the past few years, we quietly added promising new technologies to our Process & Flow Technologies Group that separate oil from produced water, separate sand from production streams and inject sea water into deepwater reservoirs. These have been added to our offering of pumps, valves, manifolds and other products, and they complement offloading systems, cranes, deck machinery, composite piping systems, turret mooring systems and flexible pipe, and a patented design for an FPSO hull that can reduce steel cost by as much as 20% and boring cost by as much as 25%.","By offering a more complete package of components and by developing standard modular packages for floating production units, we are simplifying the supply chain for these complex vessels, reducing both the cost and the construction risk. This is precisely what our deepwater E&P customers are looking for. We continue to work a handful of potential large FPSO projects as the sponsors re-work and reduce cost. Our engineering activity has risen year-over-year and generally, we are seeing larger vessels, buoys and turrets within these projects.","Elsewhere in the deepwater arena, we see demand for gas tight conductor connections we have developed within our XL Systems product line, which helped fuel higher sequential sales in the second quarter and strong incrementals. We have been steadily investing in technology and adding capacity in this product in West Africa and the Gulf Coast. Likewise, our flexible pipe capacity additions in Brazil led to slightly higher sequential results for this group in the second quarter, although pricing pressure on this product remains very high.","Our Completion & Production Solutions segment has also assembled the global leading supplier of coiled tubing and coiled tubing units, pressure pumping, blending, mixing and other fracture stimulation equipment along with wireline units and composite piping systems, including quick installation, reeled composite pipe that are impervious to corrosion, technologies which are enabling the shale revolution and for which we see further growth internationally in the long run.","Our large installed base of equipment offers opportunities for NOV to invest in aftermarket support and periodic recertification of high pressure frac fleets and wireline equipment through the next few years. Our Wellbore Technologies segment is pressing new developments in big data, software answer products, closed loop drilling automation systems and managed pressure drilling within the Dynamic Drilling Solutions business unit to continue to drive safer, faster drilling operations to drive higher returns for our customers.","Lately, we've seen large directional drillers bring new technology to lower-tier marketplaces to win businesses. We believe this will create new opportunities for our downhole tools unit to also sell new technologies into these areas as well.","We began operating our new test rig in Navasota, Texas earlier this year, which provides us a great new laboratory to pioneer new technologies like these, and we expect to undertake a half-dozen or so drilling automation jobs through the remainder of 2015.","Within the segment, these new transformative technologies build on several trusted global franchises, like Grant Prideco, which pioneered premium drill pipe designs that are able to execute the challenging horizontal drilling well pads that are fueling the shale revolution.","Earlier this year, Grant Prideco launched a new Intervention Riser product, and has sold three strings already, including the industry's first 7-5\/8 inch string. Our Tuboscope franchise worked closely with Grant Prideco to inspect, coat, hard band and repair drill pipe, along with providing critical coating, threading and quality assurance services for tubing, casing and line pipe globally.","Shale programs are highly consumptive of both drill pipe as well as production tubulars which has helped drive good growth within Tuboscope through the past several years. Likewise, our WellSite Services business foresees longer-term growth prospects in solids control to improve drilling speeds, drilling fluids technologies, waste management around drill coatings and water handling and management, some of the largest and most costly challenges faced by operators both onshore and offshore.","NOV is, for instance, the leading provider of thermal desorption cuttings treatments units globally, and we are seeing new markets emerge in places like North Dakota, West Africa and China which is implementing zero-discharge rules. Our Rig Aftermarket segment declined more than we expected through the first half of 2015 due to the cannibalization I mentioned earlier. Spare parts purchases in particular continued to slip, which rising SPS work failed to fully offset.","We expect to see the SPS project count increase again in the third quarter but at a lower rate than we would otherwise expect as customers are scrapping some rigs scheduled for SPS and postponing others until they get a contract.","Customers are also trimming the scope of SPS' moving forward to bare bones rather than seeking to upgrade and differentiate their rigs. We expect rig aftermarket segment revenues to be roughly flat from the second quarter to the third quarter and fourth quarter but to again resume growth in 2016 due to its large and growing installed base of sophisticated equipment requiring close OEM support.","We've invested in training and support facilities closer to our customers' operations around the globe and in condition monitoring technologies that will further differentiate NOVs level of support. The extraordinary installed base of NOV equipment in the oilfield following a decade of intensive retooling and the nature of this equipment and the high level of sophistication it embodies, creates a remarkable aftermarket support opportunity unique to NOV which we will continue to vigorously prosecute.","Turning to Rig Systems, we also see potential for future opportunities despite a very weak order environment today. Our Rig Systems segment continues to invest in rig designs for tomorrow: Configurable rig floors, low cost vessels, more highly automated land rigs, NOVOS control systems that enable third party developed apps and retrievable subsea BOP pods.","While offshore rig newbuilds demand is expected to remain low for an extended period, we believe demand for land rigs, specifically AC Tier 1 walking, electronic control, high pressure mud system capable land rigs could resume in earnest as early as late 2015 driven by several conversations we have underway in the Middle East, Latin America, and in North America. We see the new rig technology strategy, AC-powered, electronic-controlled, high levels of automation, prevailing strategically in all rig categories, land and offshore.","So, to summarize, our second current initiative is to recognize that the industry will recover and to make sure that we have continued to invest in technology that will maximize our position in that recovery. NOV is unique in its ability to pioneer new technologies, new business models, and capabilities to serve the industry, and we will not let this downturn distract us from our long-term vision.","Our third initiative is to deploy capital into acquisition opportunities which will emerge in this downturn. The strategies I outlined earlier can be enhanced and accelerated by combining businesses. We're actively seeking M&A opportunities. But, to be clear, we will be disciplined in our approach.","We have closed three bolt-on acquisitions so far this year and have letters of intent with several more. But thus far, we find making the bids and asks converge continues to be a challenge.","As most of you know, we have a long history of building NOV through acquisitions, and we have a lot of experience in this area. That experience teaches us to be patient until it's time to be otherwise. In preparation for potential opportunities, we expanded our revolving line of credit to $4.5 billion during the second quarter.","So, to summarize, we're reducing costs, we are continuing to invest in our long-term plans, and we are pursuing M&A opportunities to accelerate and enhance those long-term growth opportunities, all to position NOV for future growth and profitability.","This could not happen without the terrific employees that make up NOV. And I want to thank them for their hard work and leadership through this difficult time. In a challenging market, our customers need us more than ever to provide great service and technology and crisp execution, and I'm proud to be a part of the team that does that better than anybody.","Now let me touch on a couple more subjects before I turn it over to Loren. Unfortunately, in Brazil, we don't have a lot more clarity on the resolution of Sete's rig building and financing than we did last quarter.","While there have been press reports of reductions in rig building, we have not received any cancellations from our customers on the 22 floater packages for which we have binding contracts in hand to provide. Consequently, we continue to report these contracts in our backlog and at June 30, 2015, they totaled $3.1 billion within our Rig Systems backlog. And during the second quarter, we recognized $80 million in revenue related to the shipyard where we continue to be paid. We have suspended activity in the other three shipyards.","Next, the liquidation of working capital is proceeding more slowly than we would like for a couple of reasons. We had extraordinarily large cash tax payments in the quarter related to a foreign tax matter that we reported in the first quarter. The unwind of our Rig Systems backlog and associated customer financing will naturally soak up calculated working capital as we earn revenue against projects for which we have already been paid.","Third, the negotiated delay of several rigs in the shipyard means we will hold inventory for these projects longer than we originally planned. But as we noted on our last call, we expect the margins that we earn on this projects to benefit as a result as you saw in the second quarter.","Finally, our customers have been slower to pick up their equipment given market conditions resulting in inventory remaining on our books a little longer than normal. We remain focused on improving cash conversion and expect to make better progress over the next few quarters. We're also aggressively pursuing more repatriation of cash from overseas after good progress last year on this front. We believe the second half of 2015 will see further improvements in this area.","At this point, let me turn it over to Loren to discuss our second quarter performance and outlook in more detail. Loren?","Loren Singletary - Vice President-Investor & Industry Relations","Thanks, Clay. I will now discuss our segment operating results for the second quarter of 2015. NOV Rig Systems generated revenues of $1.9 billion, down 24% sequentially and 19% compared to the second quarter of 2014.","Revenue out of backlog was down 24% sequentially to $1.7 billion. We completed eight offshore drilling equipment packages during the quarter. Improved project execution and the impact of several cost reduction measures, including renegotiating vendor pricing, improved logistics and supply chain optimization, allowed for an increase to the segment margins.","Operating profit for the segment was $395 million, yielding operating margins of 20.5%, up 120 basis points from the first quarter of 2015 on improved margins on projects. Decremental leverage was 16% sequentially and 24% year-over-year, well below normal leverage for the business in the 30% to 40% range due to cost reductions. EBITDA was $419 million or 21.7% of sales and EBITDA margins increased 140 basis points as a result of these cost-saving measures. Q1 to Q2, offshore revenue declined 18% and land revenues declined 35%.","Now, let's discuss capital equipment orders and the resulting backlog for NOV Rig Systems. In the second quarter, we received $313 million in new orders, resulting in a book-to-build of 18%, a moderate increase from Q1. We ended the quarter with a backlog of $9 billion, down 13% sequentially. Of the total $9 billion backlog, approximately 91% is offshore and 92% is destined for international markets. As we move into the third quarter of 2015, we expect total NOV Rig Systems revenues to decline approximately 20% into the $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion range. We expect to see revenue out of backlog slowing to the range of $1.3 billion as we will ship fewer land rigs and continue to work through deliveries of offshore rigs, which have been rescheduled for delivery later than originally planned.","We continued cost-cutting reduction initiatives to reduce overtime, to increase supply chain cost which is helped by easing congestion in the shipyards, but lower volumes are expected to lead segment operating margins to decline into the mid-to-high-teens for Q3.","Rightsizing and efficiency savings will likely be more than offset by under-absorption resulting from revenue declines. We expect orders for offshore newbuilds to remain low but we do see a few opportunities for specialized equipment like 20,000 psi and arctic offshore rigs and jack-ups for drilling contractors to go into national oil company programs through the next 18 months or so.","On land, we are seeing rising inquiries for an international bright spots in Latin America and in the Middle East as there is growing appetite for high horsepower desert rigs suited for those regions. We also have North American customers committed to their long-term strategies of high grading the technology of their rig fleets to Tier 1 ACs with high pressure mud systems, and we believe we will begin seeing meaningful higher land rig orders later this year.","We also expect capital equipment orders to slowly recover later in the year and into 2016 to support the ongoing rigs' continuing work. Nevertheless, we expect book-to-bill for the segment to remain below 1 for at least the next several quarters.","Our NOV Rig Aftermarket segment sales declined more than we expected in the second quarter. It generated revenues of $657 million, down 9% sequentially, and down 16% compared to the second quarter of 2014. As Clay noted, the sharp decline in both offshore and onshore drilling activity led to sharp reductions in cash expenditures by drilling contractors, most notably, in spare part sales as customers continue to consume inventories and cannibalize equipment off stacked rigs before making any new purchases.","Customers are doing the absolute bare minimum in terms of maintenance and repair, only what's necessary to keep their fleets running. Operating profit for the segment was $145 million, resulting in operating margins of 22.1%. Margins were down 560 basis points sequentially, and 550 basis points year-over-year. And sequential decremental leverage was an extraordinarily high 87% due to lower revenues, pricing pressure and inventory charges related to older equipment. Excluding the charges, sequential decremental leverage would have been in the mid-50s range.","EBITDA was $152 million or 23.1% of sales. Land sales were approximately 25% of the total segment revenues, very consistent with Q1.","As we move into the third quarter, we believe Rig Aftermarket revenues will be roughly flat with Q2, with slight increases across most spare parts product lines and additional repair work. This will be offset by less demand for field services and fewer manifold and expendable sales from our Mission Product line.","Operating margins are expected to increase slightly from Q2 on a higher mix of spare part sales and on reduced charges. Long term, our outlook for this segment remains very bright as the industry is high-grading its fleet of equipment with much more NOV technology within the installed base.","When worldwide drilling activity recovers, drilling contractors who are currently delaying purchases will need this segment to respond quickly. And an increase in demand, accompanied with efficiencies and cost reductions currently being implemented, will position this segment for sharp improvement. For the second quarter of 2015, Wellbore Technologies generated revenues of $956 million, down 18% sequentially and down 34% compared to second quarter of 2014 on lower global drilling activity.","Operating profit for the segment was $47 million, resulting in operating margins of 4.9%, down 570 basis points sequentially and 1,370 basis points from the second quarter of 2014. Segment-wide cost reduction efforts in the face of falling rig counts helped mitigate some of the intense price pressure felt across the group, which helped hold sequential decrementals to 36%.","Pricing appears to have stabilized across North American markets as the rig count has more or less stabilized and has ranged from low-single digits and on up. Some international markets are continuing to receive invitations to discount as international activity has slowly declined. EBITDA in the second quarter was $146 million or 15.3% of revenue.","As we've noted in the past, drilling activity tends to drive results for the segment overall. But portions of this business are more related to production and well servicing. So, areas like tubing reclamation and line pipe coating within Tuboscope are helping offset drilling-related declines.","Looking into the third quarter of 2015, we believe Wellbore Technology revenues will be down in mid-single-digit percentage terms as backlog for drill pipe and other manufactured products from the group have declined through the second quarter. As Clay noted earlier, our customers are destocking inventories and some of our products within Wellbore Technologies are closer to resumption of orders than others.","We expect margins to decline slightly from the second quarter on mix and continued discounting in certain areas. Nevertheless, we are also continuing to implement strategies to reduce cost while also increasing operational efficiencies around the world. And we are defending our strong market positions within the Wellbore Technologies segment by investing in R&D and innovating new technologies to position ourselves for an inevitable upturn.","NOV Completion & Production Solutions generated revenues of $873 million for the second quarter of 2015, down 8% sequentially and 23% compared to the second quarter of 2014. Operating profit for the segment was $81 million, resulting in operating margins of 9.3%, down 210 basis points sequentially and 470 basis points year-over-year.","Sequential decrementals were 36% and second quarter EBITDA for the segment was $141 million or 16.2% of sales. Sequential sales across this segment varied widely with XL Systems and NOV flexibles posting improvements while sales of coiled tubing and pressure pumping equipment declined sharply on lower backlogs and on customers delaying pickup of equipment they ordered in prior periods.","Turning to our capital equipment orders and resulting backlog for NOV Completion & Production Solutions, the second quarter saw an order intake of $264 million and recognized $538 million of revenue out of backlog resulting in a book-to-bill of 49%, and a quarter-ending backlog of $1.2 billion, down 19% sequentially. Orders were down 19% from the $327 million won in Q1. And of the total $1.2 billion backlog, approximately 71% is offshore and 82% is international.","As we move into the third quarter of 2015, we believe revenues will be roughly flat with Q2 results. We expect revenue out of backlog to be in the range of $450 million. Lower revenues and continued pricing pressures across the segment should offset cost reduction efforts which will result in a slight margin decline in the third quarter.","We expect the next few quarters to be challenging in the FPSO space, but we expect to continue to help NOCs and IOCs develop cost-effective solutions to improve the economics of offshore projects. Low oil prices have prompted these customers to reevaluate project scoping and seek ways to reduce cost. The Completion & Production segment is well positioned to help.","Now let's discuss our financial statements. Working down the consolidated statement of income for the second quarter 2015, you will see that gross margin declined to 22.3%, generally reflecting pricing pressure partially offset by cost reductions.","SG&A decreased 14% or $69 million sequentially due to cost reductions and was 10.7% of revenue. Other items were $17 million in the quarter due primarily to severance and facility closure cost. Equity income decreased to $7 million, and we believe that will continue to fall through the remainder of the year due to the sliding demand for OCTG.","Other expense for the quarter was $30 million which represents a $26 million delta sequentially primarily due to fewer foreign exchange losses and asset write-offs during the second quarter of 2015. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 26.9%, down from the 37.6% rate we posted in the first quarter of 2015.","The first quarter's rate included a discrete foreign exposure which did not reoccur. The low second quarter rate reflects a much higher mix of income from low-rate foreign jurisdictions which we expect to have a smaller effect later in the year. Looking forward to Q3, we expect the tax rate to be a little higher in comparison to the second quarter.","EBITDA for the second quarter excluding other items was $627 million or 16% of sales. Turning to the balance sheet, our June 30, 2015 balance sheet employed working capital excluding cash and debt of $6.1 billion, up $343 million or 6% sequentially. The increase was driven entirely by accrued taxes which declined $408 million in the quarter on a large cash tax payment.","Other movements within working capital saw accrued liabilities and accounts payable decline, which were offset by a decrease in accounts receivable, down $548 million sequentially.","Net customer financing. The net of prepayments, progress billings and cost in excess of billings was a use of cash of $124 million in the quarter due to our declining backlog in Rig Systems. Inventory ticked up slightly due to delays in customers picking up frac equipment and the negotiated delays in offshore rig deliveries, partially offset by inventory reductions in almost all of our business units.","For the quarter, the company generated $194 million in cash flow from operations and capital spending was $104 million, down 20% sequentially and 41% year-over-year. In the quarter, we also made dividend payments of $178 million and spent $447 million to repurchase 8.6 million shares of NOV stock for a total of $2.6 billion in share repurchases under our current $3 billion authorization.","Debt increased $60 million to $4.3 billion. And our net debt to capitalization was 9.3%. As a result, we ended the second quarter of 2015 with a cash balance of $2.5 billion, down $480 million sequentially. Of that $2.5 billion in cash, 3% of the balance was in the U.S. as of June 30, 2015.","With that, we'd like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Our first question comes from Jim Crandell with Cowen.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Jim.","Jim D. Crandell - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning, Clay and Loren. Clay, my first question was about acquisition strategy and you've been great in terms of bolt-on acquisitions, but how is your acquisition strategy changing given the collapse of the industry? And is NOV becoming more proactive in regards to larger acquisitions?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I'd say generally in a cyclical downturn, and this is one of many we've been through, our view is that it becomes much more of a buyer's market. The risk, I think, in transactions tends to go down a little bit, but it can be a challenging market to get deals done because most companies don't particularly want to sell at the bottom. And so it's a challenge making bids and the asks come together and to reach a price that all parties view as fair and move forward.","So, the way we've kind of adjusted our strategy here is to increase the number of conversations that we're having, and these include both the smaller bolt-on deals that I referenced. I think we've had three close so far this year, and we've got another half dozen letters of intent that we've entered into along with some larger transactions that we've reached out to some companies to begin to explore.","So, what we're trying to do is approach this really from a portfolio standpoint. NOV is diverse in terms of what we do. We operate through four reporting segments, 15 business units. And we have exposure to a lot of areas. So there are a lot of potential targets that are interesting that can potentially enhance our strategic positioning. And statistically, what we want to do is stay close to the hoop across multiple conversations to be ready when the stars align and when both parties can reach a price that we can both view as fair.","Jim D. Crandell - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Good. Okay. That's a good answer. Secondly, Clay, it would seem that most companies who've ordered offshore rig packages from you have asked to stretch out the timetables under which those would be delivered which should mean a sharper drop, I guess, in the near term but a more gentle decline as we get out into, maybe, 2018, 2019, and 2020. Can you talk to that phenomenon and how much it might affect \u2013 what kind of a drop you're looking at maybe in the next year or two in your offshore rig package deliveries, and how you would expect decremental margins to perform in that environment?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, you're kind of seeing that phenomenon unfold here in real-time, Jim, including second quarter. In our second quarter results, we had Rig Systems down 24% sequentially at 16% decremental leverage so the group's done a great job managing decrementals down. And actually, you saw a lift in their EBIT margin despite 24% lower revenues. But the shape you're describing is exactly what we foresee. As we push those deliveries out, it sort of spreads the revenue recognition across more quarters.","As we explained on our last call, we benefit operationally because it enables us to execute these projects with our A-team and allows us to utilize our top-tier suppliers and execute the projects more systematically, less overtime, less interference between, for instance, our installation and commissioning teams and shipyard activities that are \u2013 quarter two were going on in parallel, and we're trying to schedule around and step around each other on these rigs. So, it actually is kind of a better world to execute these projects and maximize the efficiency and returns on the projects, but the impact on the top line is really sort of baked in our guidance.","So, we saw Q2 down 24%. I think for Q3, we're forecasting top line for Rig Systems to be down another 20%. I think then we maybe start to level out a little bit and the quarter-to-quarter transitions become a little smoother, not to say that revenue would continue to decline with backlog borrowing a big influx of orders, which we don't foresee at this time. So, that's probably the most likely outcome. But that's kind of the general shape of things.","But again, I would stress we have great, experienced teams managing this business. It's not our first choice to delay things, but the silver lining on that is that we are able to execute these projects more efficiently to manage costs of these projects, and you saw evidence of that in our second quarter results we just reported.","Jim D. Crandell - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Good. Thank you, Clay.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet. Thanks, Jim.","Operator","Our next question comes from Marshall Adkins with Raymond James.","Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Marshall.","Loren Singletary - Vice President-Investor & Industry Relations","Hey, Marshall.","Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","It sounded, Clay, like you're somewhat optimistic about an order recovery in Rig Systems back half of this year and going into next year. We've kind of been running $250 million, $300 million a quarter. Did I hear that right? And if so, could you give us a little more color on why you think things could improve, at least on the order side for Rig Systems?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. A couple things. There's a lot of conversations underway around land rigs. And I think generally, our land rig customers are much more optimistic about recovering commodity prices driving higher levels of activity.","And against that, I would add it's almost unanimous now, the drilling contractors that we speak to all want to convert their fleets to AC-powered Tier 1 rigs. And they recognize we're in a cyclical downturn, it gets tough to do. They're cutting CapEx budgets. But longer term, they see, hey, this is where the market is going. And to be relevant and to remain competitive in that market, they really need to offer the latest and greatest technologies. And it's a way for them to differentiate themselves against smaller competitors that can't afford to write a $20 million check to buy an AC Tier 1 land rig.","So, I would say that their strategic plans to upgrade their fleets are largely intact in North America. And then, we've also seen that interest in AC land rigs spread to other markets. So, the Middle East is moving hard in this direction as well, adopting new technology. Those tend to be much bigger rigs, higher horsepower, bigger ticket items. And then, in South America, still a lot of interest in the Vaca Muerta shale in Argentina, and opportunities to add rigs there.","So, generally, a higher level of optimism in a growing number of conversations with land drillers that could result in orders. I don't think it'll be a Q3 phenomenon, but Q4. We may start to see some orders flow in around land.","And then, on the offshore, I think we're going to see rising demand for offshore components going into the rigs that are working. And then, we also had some conversations going on with drilling contractors that are affiliated with national oil companies. And these are drilling contractors that many on Wall Street, maybe, have never heard of but interested in buying more specialized rigs. Rigs that are more fit for purpose to go into specific drilling programs around the globe. So we sort of plunged into this deep freeze here through the first half of 2015. I think midway through 2015, we're starting to have some conversations now with some customers that are sort of looking past this maybe and that gives us cause for hope that \u2013 again, this won't be a Q3 phenomenon but maybe Q4. And once we get into 2016, a little brighter outlook for orders.","Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Perfect. That's helpful. A follow-up kind of unrelated, where are we on the cost reduction curve? What inning or however you want to phase it? Are we still fairly early in the game or have we gotten most of the cost reductions in place?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Pretty well into it. It's unfolding through the year. But I would say we've got great leadership across our business units who have really rolled up their sleeves and tackled the difficult challenge of reducing costs, having been through many downturns themselves.","And so, I really applaud the leadership of pushing through that. There are additional measures to come, but I would say, I think a lot of them \u2013 perhaps most of the cost savings that we foresee are done. It also varies by business unit out there a lot. But it's well underway.","Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Seventh or eighth inning?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I'm going to stay clear of using the baseball. Other than \u2013 you're seeing I think pretty good management of decrementals on sliding revenues showing up in the income statement. So I think there's good evidence that so far we're managing this closely.","Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Perfect. Thanks, guys.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet. Thank you.","Loren Singletary - Vice President-Investor & Industry Relations","Thanks, Marshall.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Tillery with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Jeff.","Loren Singletary - Vice President-Investor & Industry Relations","Morning.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Clay, as I think about the more medium-term decremental margin potential within Rig Systems, so the guidance for Q3 would imply something in that high 30%-range decrementals as we...","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Right.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","...think about longer-term backlog continuing to erode into 2016. Is that a reasonable range to think about the kind of absorption issues impacting margins?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. There's a wide range of variable margins within the products that Rig Systems sells. You did ask about Rig Systems, right Jeff?","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Correct.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. And so what we foresee in third quarter is we're kind of going to revert to what's a more normal level of operating leverage for the business ex-price pressure and some extraordinary costs, things that were done. So, that's kind of I would say in the essence of all other factors, that business would normally move up and down somewhere in the mid 30% range and our guidance for Q3 really sort of embodies that natural operating leverage.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then as I think about the potential cash generated out of working capital kind of over the next two or three quarters, what order of magnitude you think is a reasonable expectation?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We think we're going to make good progress. Our working capital has a lot of unusual moving pieces, and as I've mentioned on my comments, we were a little disappointed it went up sequentially. That was entirely due to large cash tax payments which was an extraordinary item that we had in the second quarter. But even beyond that, we have costs in excess of billings on our balance sheet and billings in excess of cost both related to our POC projects and they're a little unusual in that they represent, in the case of billings an excess of cost, cash payments our customers have made which really work sort of like a deferred revenue concept. So, as we've worked that down, we've already been paid the cash...","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Sure.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","...to be a use of cash as we execute those projects. We also have a couple other moving pieces here that I referenced in the call. Inventory was up just a little bit in Q2, which was unusual given the decline in revenues. And that's related to the fact that as we've slowed delivery of these big offshore rigs, we can't slow our supply chain down to the degree that we would like. We are slowing it, so we've continued to take inventory in associated with those projects. We've got customer slow (47:48) picking up of equipment along the way. And so those two things contributed to inventory rising slightly.","The third may not be completely obvious, but for the last couple of quarters, we've referenced in-sourcing into our own machine shops and fabrication facilities. And if you think about that, that actually uses working capital because you're buying raw materials for your machine shops to process, and you're also sort of paying your employees in real time as opposed to outsourcing this to a vendor that may be buying raw materials and a vendor that gets paid in kind of a normal payable cycle.","So, a lot of moving pieces in our working capital. We do know it'll come down. And I think it was predictable that the turn in working capital would be delayed a quarter or two. So, we think directionally, it's going to be coming down and become a source of cash, but I'm going to pull it short of quantifying it for you.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Good morning.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Kurt.","Loren Singletary - Vice President-Investor & Industry Relations","Morning.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I was curious, you bought back a chunk of stock here in the quarter, kind of in the 10% I guess was what you stated since you implemented the program; average price, $50. Now, stock price is $40. At what point do you guys kind of maybe think about sitting tight for a little while and maybe gearing it more toward M&A?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Last quarter, you remember, Kurt, we said we were going to dial back the rate of share repurchases in view of M&A opportunities and we'll be watching it closely through the quarter now too, but working at that more reduced rate. I think we have about a little over $300 million left on our authorization to go.","But what we're doing is balancing the opportunities we see on the M&A landscape and other opportunities to deploy capital against what we think is a terrific company trading below book value in an extraordinary buying opportunity. So, that's sort of a judgment call, but that's the calculus we'll continue to be going through.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great, appreciate that. And then maybe a follow-up on Rig Systems, the guidance range for some decline, a couple hundred basis points or so plus of decline in margins and, again, you're in that mode of excellent execution and delivery on the margin front in Rig Systems, kind of like you were in the prior cycle period. So, what's the thought on the opportunity for your execution to actually deliver better-than-expected margins going forward?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. You probably remember 2009, 2010, where \u2013 I hope they're not listening, but our Rig Systems guys are really good at under-promising and over-delivering. You saw it in this quarter, right, in the second quarter. So, just terrific execution by that team. And so, yeah, we're guiding to sort of more normal operating leverage for the third quarter, but they're very good at finding ways to reduce cost and improve efficiency. So, frankly, I wouldn't be surprised if we do a little better than that if history is a guide. But for the time being, we'll stick with our sort of official guidance of margins down.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","It's all good. All right. Thanks, Clay. Appreciate it.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet.","Loren Singletary - Vice President-Investor & Industry Relations","Thanks Kurt.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo.","Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Loren Singletary - Vice President-Investor & Industry Relations","Morning, Jud.","Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Question on aftermarket. Clay, I think you indicated you believe that your aftermarket business stabilizes in the second half of the year and can potentially grow in 2016. Is that based on an expectation that the offshore rig count stabilizes? Can that still play out if the offshore rig count continues to trend down well into 2016?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It gets more challenging with the rig count coming down, but really the basis for it, Jud, is the fact that the installed base of NOV equipment is rising. The new rigs that are still being built, I think there's, outside of Brazil, more than 50 floaters coming into the marketplace. The new rigs have a much higher content of high technology NOV equipment that should be more aftermarket consumptive and a better opportunity for us as compared to the old rigs that are more likely to be laid down and scrapped. So, the mix of rigs is the main basis for our optimistic outlook for rig aftermarket in the future. It's not purely a rig count-driven phenomenon.","Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for that. And then my second question is just thinking about your revenue out of backlog and it's a little bit early, but looking into next year \u2013 I mean, this year, you'll be pulling less revenue out because of customer delays from Petrobras and some of your other customers. Looking into next year, some of those delays, I'm assuming, could continue as operators or contractors push the rig deliveries out, but you'll also have more, I guess, shorter cycle business maybe flowing through. Do you think your revenue out of backlog increases from that low 50% range, or is it more reasonable to keep it in the low 50%s or does it start to tick up with more shorter cycle businesses? How should we think that through?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think you laid out the factors there pretty well. It's all very fluid right now, so I'm hesitant to get too many quarters out in terms of providing guidance around that. But you're right. The component work that should come back after opportunities to cannibalize begin to diminish for contractors, both land and offshore, as well as maybe a little more demand on the land side. Depending on how that all plays out, I think that's going to drive the revenue out of backlog and the size of our backlog.","Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet.","Loren Singletary - Vice President-Investor & Industry Relations","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JPMorgan.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Loren Singletary - Vice President-Investor & Industry Relations","Hi, Sean.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So, we've heard quite a bit throughout the earnings season thus far from other parts of offshore talking about greater willingness on the part of E&Ps to reexamine how they're planning offshore projects. You touched on this in your opening remarks, but I guess, can you give us a better sense of how much of a delta have you seen in terms of receptivity from FPSO customers in terms of cost-savings solutions? It seems like maybe it'll take a bit of time before orders come through, but are we seeing a real step change given the commodity price?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And I would say it's a real step change in attitude. But they're still a ways from signing purchase orders and sanctioning these projects. So, you go back a couple years ago in a $100-a-barrel world. There were problems with returns, I think, on some of the deepwater developments. But, frankly, I think less openness or less willingness on the part of our customers to consider sort of more radical or more revolutionary sort of approaches to changing how those projects are executed.","The silver lining of a $50-a-barrel world has been we're now welcomed into those conversations with those customers. We're seeing our volume of engineering work, of feed-study type work around these projects within our FPSO group rising. And that's good, but we're not yet to the point where our oil company customers are necessarily pulling the trigger and sanctioning these projects and moving forward.","But the good news is it all starts with kind of a reengineering, retooling, rescoping of these projects. You've heard of lots of examples in the E&P world that you referenced of oil companies taking out 20%, 25% out of their development costs by kind of resetting how they're going to execute these projects. I can only think that's probably helped in a lower-day-rate environment for rigs and a pretty hungry shipyard universe that can fabricate big steel structures for not much above cost these days. So that, I think will all help the economics of the deepwater.","But suffice it to say, huge reserves discovered in the deepwater, a lot of smart people at the oil companies now with motivation to find new and better ways to develop those fields. And I think NOV is really well-positioned to help them through. And we're very pleased at the progress that we have in conversations with a few of those oil companies here through the last few quarters.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. Yeah, it all makes sense. Just to shift gears to go back to M&A for a second, has the pending Hallibaker merger and the pending divestments changed the strategy towards M&A at all? Does the outcome there delay any other potential deals as folks wait to see what happens?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It's obviously a large merger. It spans a number of different subsectors in oilfield services. And so there's implications for specific spaces within the industry, specific marketplaces, specific geographies. And so, we're watching very closely how that comes together. And so, I would tell you strategically, certainly it's shaded our thinking and what we always try to do is think out three or four moves into the chess game.","So, what are the perhaps non-obvious implications of the Halliburton-Baker merger. So, yeah, it's \u2013 the short answer is yes, it's certainly shaded our strategic thinking. And we're \u2013 but they're both customers, we wish them well and we'll see what happens.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Fair enough. All right. Thanks, Clay.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet.","Loren Singletary - Vice President-Investor & Industry Relations","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's question-and-answer portion of the conference.

With me today is Clay Williams, President, CEO and Chairman of National Oilwell Varco, and Jeremy Thigpen, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin this discussion of National Oilwell Varco's financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2014, please note that some of the statements we make during this call may contain forecasts, projections and estimates, including but not limited to comments about our outlook for the Company's business.

Now, let me turn the call over to Clay.","Clay Williams","Thank you, Loren, and welcome everyone to our third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. This morning, we're pleased to announce that National Oilwell Varco earned $1.62 per fully diluted share in its third quarter ended September 30, 2014. Earnings from continuing operations improved 15% sequentially and 17% year-over-year on higher revenues and a lower tax rate. Consolidated continuing revenues were $5.6 billion, up 6% sequentially and up 17% year-over-year.","Operating profit, excluding $1 million in transaction costs, was $989 million, or 17.7% of sales. Operating leverage was 13% sequentially and 24% year-over-year. EBITDA excluding transaction costs was $1.2 billion, or 21.6% of sales. Operating non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share, which excludes $0.14 per share in intangible amortization and transaction charges, were $1.76 per share, up 9% sequentially and up 28% year-over-year. Our company delivered solid performance for its third quarter 2014. Thanks to once again, outstanding execution by our hardworking employees, NOV set new records for operating profit, EBITDA and earnings per share during the third quarter on solid revenue gains from our continuing operations.","North America helped a lot. Consolidated revenues from North America improved 12% sequentially. Our third quarter saw very strong bookings from coiled tubing units and other pressure pumping and well stimulation equipment within our Completion & Production Solutions segment. Rising North American rig counts and efficiency gains are leading to higher well counts, each with more frac stages, and these drive steady and growing consumption of frac equipment and consumables. This has depleted much of the inventory of well intervention equipment, and our customers are back to replacing worn-out equipment within their fleets, as well as investing in expansion opportunities. Bidding activity from domestic pressure pumpers remains very brisk.","The third quarter saw strong North American demand for modern AC land rigs within our Rig Systems segment. Rising well counts per rig and footage per rig offers strong testament to the power and capability of these rigs, and rising land rig orders signal, we believe, increased driller conviction around the need to offer new modern AC rigs to satisfy market demand in unconventional shales.","The capital investment in just one of these rigs is significant. And we believe that most of the 300 drilling contractors throughout the U.S. will struggle to make this technology and capital leap. This means that the retooling of the U.S. land rig fleet to AC technology will probably continue to be led by larger well-capitalized drilling contractors, and can ultimately serve to consolidate the U.S. land contract drilling industry into a smaller group of larger, well-capitalized participants.","We see strong interest among domestic drilling contractors and more land rig build programs, as opposed to individual rig orders. With some buying complete rigs and series from us, and others assembling their own supply chains, including NOV-supplied kit, to build rigs on their own in series. We think both signify their need to systematically evolve their fleets to modern technology in an orderly fashion.","As managers this makes sense to us, to systematically train rig crews, to systematically train mechanics and technicians, to systematically build and market and spud these new rigs with standardized rig designs and layouts as they steadily upgrade their fleet in an orderly process-based way. We also continue to see strong AC land rig demand for Middle Eastern markets and for certain Latin American markets through the third quarter, signaling the steady adoption of modern AC rig technology in these areas as well. Energy reforms in Argentina and Mexico, coupled with high interest in modern rig technology, make for a solid outlook for these markets in 2015.","Our Wellbore Technologies segment posted a new record level of drill pipe orders during the third quarter to support these new land rigs and new offshore rigs, as well as to replace drill pipe being consumed by ever more efficient rig fleets, drilling more footage more quickly, in more horizontal applications, all of which shorten the functional life of drill pipe.","We benefited from North American demand for down hole tools, as recent drilling activity increases had dented our customers inventory of drilling motors, bits and other bottom hole assembly components, driving record down hole tool results for NOV. Broadly speaking, the rate of drill pipe and down hole tool consumption rises linearly with footage drilled. So rig efficiency is a positive factor in demand for these.","Despite record orders for drill pipe though, revenues for drill pipe actually declined due to unplanned maintenance shutting down one of our major production lines. We expect drill pipe revenues to rebound in the fourth quarter, as this line is now back up and running. During our third quarter, our Wellbore Technologies segment also saw drilling fluids and waste management services benefit from rising North American activity, which continues to migrate to higher levels of technology to manage drill cuttings at the rig site.","Our Completion & Production Solutions segment posted solid revenue gains both sequentially and year over year, led by sharply rising demand for well intervention equipment. As noted earlier, pressure pumping customers are back to buying, following a two year cyclical downturn. Offshore orders for floating production equipment and flexible pipe were down significantly in the third quarter, as we expected, offsetting the pressure pumping order gains and leading to an overall book to bill for the group of 91%. We are pursuing several larger deepwater floating production projects, and expect the fourth quarter order levels to improve, even though the market for deepwater production equipment overall remains a little choppy.","As we enter the final couple of months of 2014 and begin to develop our budgets for 2015, we see lots of opportunities ahead. Very strong backlogs for offshore rig equipment, rising demand for land rigs, steady growth in rig aftermarket results and growing demand for pressure pumping equipment. However, we also see lots of challenges. Oil prices dropped $20 since the beginning of the third quarter. We have not yet heard of any rigs being laid down due to lower oil prices, nor have we heard from any of our E&P customers about their plans to curtail drilling, but it\u2019s far too early for this to be the final word on2015 activity, and we will continue to monitor activity closely. Historically, the impact from lower oil prices doesn\u2019t show up in reduced activity until three months or four months or more have passed, as operators drill out the rig contracts and programs and budgets. We\u2019re cautious right now, because it is difficult for us to envision $20 lower oil prices not taking at least a modest toll on activity.","Perhaps this just means that rig counts won\u2019t increase as much as we expected before, but we would not be surprised to see North American rig counts begin to fall modestly in 2015, given how much oil prices have moved down. We believe major North American shales exhibit breakevens below the $80 level, some substantially below the $80 per barrel level. And these breakevens continue to move down gradually, but nevertheless, $80 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate probably begins to approach inflection points for a lot of field developments, and lower oil prices certainly reduce wellhead cash flows for all producers.","We believe some will find themselves underwater. We believe established drilling programs within the major shales can weather these lower oil prices, because their economics have been steadily improving due to drilling and completions efficiencies. But also because the learning curve effect should make them stickier, and the operator should hesitate to shut down a rig that has been operating for a while, because its finely tuned efficiencies learned during the first several wells, so critical to capital returns, could be lost. So if 2015 sees lower oil prices, we would expect the activity downturn to be moderated, and to hit the older rigs drilling vertical wells in the more marginal shale plays the hardest. And in the meantime, our strong backlogs and our diverse product and service offering have us as busy as we can be across almost all of our businesses, with at least several more months of the same.","As we move into 2016 and beyond, we\u2019re very optimistic. Shale technologies are one of the key drivers for National Oil well Varco that we\u2019ve highlighted many times before. And in fact, much of the recent weakness in oil price has been attributed to growing North American shale oil production, and even a speculated Saudi attempt to win back market share from unconventional shales in the U.S. which all speak to the power of this exciting technology.","The recent developments highlight; number one, shales work, and number two, shales will likely continue to grow overseas. And let me add number three, shales require a lot of NOV kit to develop, which is consumed at a high rate. And number four, we anticipate that, when shale drilling slows from time to time, shale production will decline rapidly, making commodity price dips driven by shale supply relatively short lived, in our view, as shale supply rebalances more quickly than other conventional production.","And when oil prices bounce back, North America has an enormous inventory of attractive shale plays to drill which offer excellent returns to oil companies, returns which will continue to improve with drilling and completion efficiencies. And we believe that oil price recovery will be particularly strong if it coincides with a global economic recovery driving more oil demand.","Turning to the offshore, rig demand faces headwinds in 2015 too. And we expect that orders for new builds will continue to slow, offset somewhat by rising demand for land rigs. After a decade of building new offshore rigs and record levels of orders in 2013, new supply is coming in with high transparency, day rates have moved down and the appetite for offshore new builds has declined. Importantly, we expect it will not evaporate entirely. We see concrete demand for special purpose 20,000 PSI rigs, for Arctic rigs, for harsh environment jack-ups for national oil companies, and for midwater floater rig replacements. We will continue to win offshore new build orders in 2015, but the pace will be down. Helping the supply demand picture will be rising rig retirements some of which have been announced in just the past few days along with repurposing of older jack-ups to things like well servicing activities. ","The downturn in offshore day rates, specifically deepwater, coincides with a period of some IOC retrenchment and focus on capital discipline. We believe the international oil companies or IOCs are attempting to shift some incremental capital towards onshore unconventional shales and are proceeding more slowly and cautiously on deepwater opportunities, rethinking projects to improve capital returns. Ultimately though, we expect IOCs to resume deepwater investment with more vigor as they begin to feel pressure to replace declining production and reserves. The strengths of the IOCs fit the deepwater exceptionally well, engineering capability to handle technically challenging developments and finance and risk management capability to handle large expensive projects from the Gulf of Mexico to far-flung corners of the globe. Countries with extensive deepwater frontiers need their help, meaning IOCs are more likely to find cooperative host governments and lots of available unexplored acreage. ","Finally, the reserves that they will encounter are the long tail variety with comparatively shallow decline curves, the kinds that IOCs like. We believe the lower deepwater rig day rates we've seen lately will reduce the cost of deepwater development and enhance the capital returns for the IOCs. Their challenge has been the size and the complexity of developments, but they will continue to innovate and improve around project execution, leading to deepwater recovery at some point maybe 2016 or 2017 in our view. In the meantime, we will continue to hone better supply chain ideas for deepwater floating development projects that use NOV's considerable shipyard expertise and project management skills to improve their capital returns around this important resource.","So on the whole, we're cautious about oil price impact on 2015, but we're very enthusiastic for 2016 and beyond. And if oil prices stay down entering 2015, we believe, one the strength of our backlogs, and two the diversity of our product offering will enable NOV to thrive during a market downturn which we will spend positioning our business to create more long-term value. Specifically, we expect to continue to invest in production technologies required to produce the 150 plus discoveries made in the deepwater over the past seven years according to ODS-Petrodata. To invest in new technologies that have opened up unconventional shales and deepwater provinces and to invest in operational excellence to, one continue superb execution of our extraordinary backlog of orders on the books today and two support our ever growing installed base of equipment with industry leading global aftermarket support.","Our operational excellence initiatives helped a lot during the third quarter. Supply chain optimization, de-bottlenecking, and capacity enhancements through the past several quarters enabled NOV to deliver sequentially higher volumes of products and equipment in the third quarter. I am pleased to report that NOV set new records on the deliveries of top drives, subsea BOP stacks, and composite pipe during the third quarter. And we expect to set new records again next quarter. The actions our team have taken serve to enhance NOV's reputation as a reliable partner to customers whose needs change quickly. This flexibility is an important element of our strategy, when the oil field heats up our customers want equipment urgently and will suddenly crowd through the door to join production queues that will double and triple virtually overnight.","The capability of a manufacturer to deliver kit quickly, with a high level of reliability and a low risk of being late becomes a critical dimension on which to compete. That's why we have positioned NOV to one be more vertically integrated than most of our competitors, so that we can control more of our own destiny and be more responsive to the quickly changing demands of the marketplace, and two maintain carefully managed build-for-stock programs of selected higher volume products to respond to upturns. We're more vertically integrated than most, but we're not a 100% self sufficient, so we still rely on vendor partners in our supply chain. But NOV nevertheless tends to have more internal capacity and squeeze more out of our capacity than our competitors, thanks to our many NOV manufacturing experts. ","As I noted earlier, in the third quarter we saw demand for coiled tubing, drill pipe, and land rigs move up sharply. While demand for offshore drilling equipment declined. Even though most all products, we provide are related to oil and gas demand for our products don't necessarily move in tandem, because our products aren't necessarily on the same cycle. The third quarter illustrated that. Participating in multiple product lines with different cyclical characteristics enables us to redirect our manufacturing resources to where they're most needed. Our NC machine tools can cut different kinds of NOV parts, and our weld shops can fabricate different kinds of NOV products.","As demand for one product falls, the diversity of our product portfolio frequently enables us to redeploy manufacturing assets and personnels to areas of rising demand. This is a competitive advantage of being a large scale manufacturer. A second competitive advantage of our market leadership is our capability to build, to plan, to enable us to shorten lead times and command favorable pricing for certain products our customers are in a hurry to get. As market leader, we provide products with higher day-to-day demand, which reduces our risk in investment. We find we are able to consistently carve out higher margins from product sales out of inventory on hand as compared to items built to a purchase order.","We also benefit from manufacturing efficiencies arising from longer production runs of certain items. I note this characteristic of our business this morning because once again we are seeing cross-currents in the markets we serve and different products on different cyclical trajectories. It's because of this balance that we are both confident and excited about NOV's future prospects, and it is because of this confidence that we announced during the third quarter an authorization to buy back $3 billion of our stock.","NOV is a special and unique enterprise, with market-leading positions across almost everything we do. We're pleased to be in a financial position to be able to return capital to our shareholders through share buybacks, as well as paying an attractive dividend, while still being able to invest in growth opportunities.","With that, let me turn it over to Jeremy, who will tell you more about our third quarter.","Jeremy Thigpen","Thanks, Clay. Since Clay already thoroughly covered the consolidated results, I'll just dive straight into our segment operating performance. The Rig Systems segment generated record quarterly revenues of 2.7 billion in the third quarter, that's up 12% sequentially, driven by continued increase in land-related sales, which improved 9% sequentially, and greater progress on offshore projects, which improved 13% sequentially. Compared to the third quarter of 2013, Rig Systems revenues were up 29%, that's due to heightened demand for high-spec land rigs and equipment and our recent capacity additions, which have enabled us to convert 34% more revenue out of backlog over the prior year.","In total for the third quarter, offshore new build projects accounted for 1.6 billion in revenue, with land rigs and other capital equipment, both land and offshore, accounting for the balance of approximately 1.1 billion. Said another way, for the quarter, offshore new build revenue totaled roughly 28% of NOV's consolidated revenue.","Operating profit for the segment was 533 million and operating margins were right at 20%, which represented 110-basis point decline from the previous quarter, but 100-basis point improvement over the prior year. Sequentially, the 110-basis point decline was driven by higher installation and commissioning costs, as we expedited and completed five jack-ups and seven drill ships in the quarter.","During the quarter, we also struggled with some lower margin projects, including three highly customize done-off land rigs that were ordered last year that presented some unexpected cost challenges, as well as a higher percentage of Brazil-related work. EBITDA for the segment was 554 million, or 20.8% of sales. As we move into the fourth quarter, we believe that Rig Systems revenues could remain relatively flat, as recent bookings of land rigs and land-related equipment ship out and convert into revenue, and as we continue to execute against our offshore new build backlog. And as stated on previous calls, we expect that operating margins will continue to remain in that 20% to 21% range for the quarter.","Now let's transition to the capital equipment orders for our Rig Systems segment for the third quarter of 2014 and our resulting backlog. In the quarter, we recognized 2.4 billion of revenue out of backlog and captured 1.3 billion in new orders, which resulted in a 0.6 times book-to-bill, and still very healthy quarter-ending backlog of 14.3 billion.","In the quarter, we secured nine drilling equipment packages for jack-ups, as well as some discrete offshore components including cranes, jacking systems, and spare BOP stacks. We also continue to see very strong demand for complete land rigs, land rig equipment packages, and discrete components that are going into new land rigs and\/or serving as upgrades to existing land rigs.","Overall, of the 1.3 billion in new Rig Systems orders, 26% was driven by new build offshore construction while sales of land rigs, land rig components, and replacement and upgrade components to support existing offshore rigs accounted for the balance of the new bookings. Of the total 14.3 billion in quarter-ending backlog, approximately 90% is offshore and 90% is destined for international markets.","Looking into the fourth quarter of 2014, we believe that orders for new floaters will once again be limited and that opportunities for jack-ups could be halved. Still, demand for complete land rigs, land equipment packages, and individual land components should remain strong in the U.S., Latin America and the Middle East.","The Rig Aftermarket segment posted revenues of 837 million in the third quarter of 2014, that's up 7% sequentially and up almost 18% over the third quarter of 2013, as our large and growing installed base of equipment, combined with the investments that we've made in additional personnel, in training, in our global infrastructure, and in inventory, have resulted in mid-teens percentage growth for the past few years.","Operating profit for the segment was 229 million, or 27.4% of revenue, that's down 20 basis points sequentially and down 100 basis points from the prior year, and that's really due to slightly unfavorable mix, with a lower percentage of high margin spare parts sales and a higher percentage of slightly lower margin repair work. EBITDA for the segment was 236 million, or 28.2% of revenue. As we move into the fourth quarter, we feel that Aftermarket revenues could continue to improve in the mid single-digit percentage range. However, given historical trends and a large pipeline of somewhat lower margin repair work that will likely be executed in the fourth quarter, we could experience a slight decline in operating margin.","The Wellbore Technologies segment posted revenues of 1.5 billion, up 2% sequentially and up 14% compared to the third quarter of 2013. As previously stated, the Wellbore Technologies business is driven by activity. More rigs drilling more wells and more footage, require more of our rig instrumentation and monitoring, more solids control equipment, more fluids, more drill pipe, more inspection and coating of that drill pipe, more down hole drilling tools, and more drill bits.","So the seasonal rebound in Canada, combined with a strong U.S. market, led to another quarter of strong demand for this segment. On this 1.5 billion in revenue, the Wellbore Technologies segment generated 278 million in operating profit, or 18.9% of revenues, which represented a 30 basis point improvement over the second quarter of 2014, or 39% flow-through or leverage. On a year-over-year basis, operating margins improved 300 basis points or 41% flow-through or leverage on the 14% increase in revenue. And EBITDA for the segment was 390 million, or 26.5% of revenue.","Looking into the fourth quarter of 2014, we believe that Wellbore Technologies segment revenues could be flat to slightly up, as a strengthening Canadian market could be at least partially offset by reduction in billing day due to the holidays. And as a direct result of those holidays, we believe that margins could decline slightly as we experience some seasonal under absorption in some of our manufacturing and service facilities.","The Completion & Production Solutions segment generated revenues of 1.2 billion, up 6% sequentially and up 9% from the third quarter of 2013. On a sequential basis, the revenue growth was driven primarily by strong deliveries of well intervention and stimulation equipment, including coiled tubing units, coiled tubing, pressure pumping equipment, well service pumps, fluid and expendables and flow line. We also enjoyed record shipments of fiberglass pipe.","On a year over year basis, the growth was driven by improved demand for well intervention and stimulation equipment, fiberglass pipe, and continued growth in both our floating production and subsea businesses. Operating profit for the segment was 184 million, or 15.4% of revenues, which was up 140 basis points from the second quarter of 2014 and down 70 basis points from the third quarter of 2013.","As mentioned on the last call, changes in product mix can have a fairly substantial impact on the margins of this segment. Generally speaking, margins for completions related equipment, such as coiled tubing units, coiled tubing, pressure pumpers, frac sanders, fluid end expendables, and flow line, are accretive to segment margins, whereas margins for production related equipment, such as tanks and vessels and mooring systems and flexibles, while improving are currently dilutive to segment margins. Third quarter EBITDA for the segment was 242 million or 20.3% of sales. ","For the fourth quarter, we believe that revenues for our Completion & Production Solutions segment could improve in a low to mid single digit percentage range, as we continue to see increasing demand for our well intervention and stimulation equipment. And for the fourth quarter, much like our Wellbore Technologies segment, we believe that margins could drift slightly lower, as the holidays could lead to under absorption in our manufacturing facilities.","Now let's transition to the capital equipment orders for our Completion & Production Solutions segment for the third quarter of 2014. During the quarter, the segment secured 609 million in new orders, which were primarily driven by increasing demand for our well intervention and stimulation equipment, to support a strengthening pressure pumping market, as well as growing demand for our fiberglass pipe. The 609 million of bookings was more than offset by 667 million in shipments out of backlog, resulting in a 0.9 times book to bill and a healthy quarter ending backlog of 2.1 billion for the segment.","As we move into the fourth quarter, we believe that new orders for coiled tubing units and pressure pumping equipment should continue to be strong, and that orders for production related equipment could improve, resulting in a book to bill for the Completion & Production Solutions segment that could approach if not exceed, one to one. So if you look at it overall, we believe that the segment operating results for the fourth quarter could look fairly similar to, if not slightly better than the segment operating results for the third quarter. However, there were some anomalies in some of our below the line items in the third quarter that will obviously need to be considered.","So with that, let\u2019s turn to some of our remaining elements of National Oilwell Varco\u2019s consolidated third quarter 2014 income statement. Gross margin declined 40 basis points sequentially, but increased 100 basis points year over year to 27.3%. SG&A increased 24 million sequentially and 73 million year over year. However, as a percentage of revenue, it actually declined slightly to 9.6%. Other items were immaterial, at 1 million in the quarter. Interest expense decreased 1 million sequentially to 26 million. Interest income also decreased 1 million to 4 million. Equity income in our Voest-Alpine JV declined 14 million or 61% sequentially as the plant was shut down for two weeks for its annually scheduled maintenance. We would expect this to rebound in the fourth quarter and return to more historical levels.","Other income for the quarter was 9 million, versus an expense of 21 million in the second quarter. During the quarter, we benefited from favorable movements in exchange rates and we also booked a gain on the sale of the industrial aggregates business in Hawaii in the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we believe that this too will return to historical levels and be a net expense.","The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 28.8%, which was 300 basis points lower than the 31.8% rate that we posted in the second quarter of 2014, as we recognized a much higher percentage of foreign sourced income in the quarter, primarily attributable to the progress we made on offshore rig construction projects. Additionally, we benefited from a deduction in the U.S. for manufacturing activities. As we move into the fourth quarter, we believe that our effective tax rate could return to a more normalized range of plus or minus 31%.","If you now quickly turn to the first supplemental schedule, you\u2019ll see that eliminations were 569 million for the quarter, up from 475 million in the second quarter of 2014. As stated on the last call these eliminations arise from intersegment sales, such as Rig Systems selling spare parts to Rig After market and Wellbore Technologies selling solids control equipment for new drilling equipment packages to Rig Systems. And Rig Systems selling cranes for offshore production installation to Completion & Production Solutions. While our reorganization better aligned our various businesses, we still conduct substantial transaction between segments. Unallocated expenses and eliminations were 235 million in the third quarter, up 35 million sequentially on the higher intersegment revenues.","And finally, if you turn to the last supplemental schedule, you\u2019ll see that depreciation and amortization were $198 million, up $8 million from the second quarter; and EBITDA, excluding transaction charges, was a record $1.2 billion, or 21.2% of sales.","Finally, turning to the balance sheet. Our September 30, 2014 balance sheet employed working capital, excluding cash and debt of 5.5 billion, up over 300 million sequentially, but down 800 million from 2013 year end. Looking more closely at working capital, accounts receivable only increased 55 million or 1% sequentially, despite the $332 million sequential increase in revenue. Inventory was up 266 million or 5% sequentially, primarily driven by our Rig Systems segment as it continues to execute against a near record backlog. Also win it because of our drill pipe business which had several large shipments push into the fourth quarter. And due to the sequential decline of bookings for offshore new builds cost incurred on major projects significantly outpaced milestone invoicing which resulted in a $415 million sequential decline in customer financing. These various uses of cash were partially offset by increases in payables and accrued liabilities. ","Capital spending for the third quarter was $168 million due to several significant ongoing operational expansion efforts as well as continued investments in the rental fleets of our Wellbore Technologies segment to support strong global demand. This resulted in free cash flow as defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures of $351 million for the quarter. In the quarter, we received the cash for the sale of the aggregates business in Hawaii which more than offset the $79 million that we invested in three acquisitions during the third quarter. ","And finally, we made dividend payments of 198 million representing $0.46 per share. As a result, we ended the third quarter of 2014 with a cash balance of $4.1 billion and a net cash position of almost $1 billion. On the $4.1 billion in cash most is still overseas, but we are pursuing mechanisms within our current structure that will permit us to return more to the U.S. in the coming months. Now let me turn it back to Clay.","Clay Williams","Thanks Jeremy. With that Christine, I think we're ready to open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow up question (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Jim Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","I thought that was a very cogent and rational presentation, Clay. You talk about investing in production technologies for deepwater, invest in shale technologies for the U.S. Everybody wants to invest in technologies these days. Where do you find the technologies? Are these going to be in small Canadian companies with technology that you can globalize, or are these going to be in big companies that are pieces of other companies? Where is this technology going to come from?","Clay Williams","Well, it's all the above, plus we have a lot of smart people here working at NOV that...","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","I've met one of them, he's a smart guy.","Clay Williams","We're very fortunate, we put together a collection of products and technologies across NOV that I'm not sure the industry has really ever seen in its history, and so one of the real values that we find from that is getting people from different parts of our organization talking about bringing together their collective experience and capabilities to think of new ways to improve drilling performance and so there's a lot of exciting things going on with things like drilling automation for instance, that use IntelliServ wired drill pipe, down hole tools that we manufacture to make measurements at the bottom of the hole then transmit micro-second level data to the rig to actually control the machinery. And so, that's something that we have been investing in and are very-very excited about. And so yeah, we're fortunate to have a terrific group of engineers and scientists here at NOV, that every day are thinking of new and better ways to improve drilling safety and efficiency and reduce the environmental impact and just a lot going on.","And then in addition to that, as you know we've been very transactional. So, we have bought a lot of Canadian companies and a lot of Norwegian companies and a lot of companies from Singapore and elsewhere and find that we can really super-charge the market acceptance of those technologies as we introduce them to the very extensive global footprint that NOV offers. So, we're not so proud to pass technologies because they're not invented here and so we really try to avail ourselves of all those technologies.","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","Okay, I appreciate that and FPSOs, if I could -- not really a follow up, but a second question. FPSO orders, we have seen a slowdown in Latin America and marginal fields get pushed to the right, one of the complaints that we hear is that your turret systems are the smaller types and most of these FPSOs being put out are larger types. And the question has been, what parts of an FPSO can truly be standardized? Can you just spend a minute or two talking about that perception in the market?","Clay Williams","You bet, specifically on the turrets that we provide, the turrets and the swivel stacks. Even within the APL business that we acquired a few years ago in Norway, we've been standardizing dimensions, we've been standardizing a lot of the turrets that we're delivering and what we find is, it's a little lumpy, but we have seen fairly steady demand for both new turrets and swivel stacks as well as aftermarket support of the installed base of APL swivel stacks and turrets that are out there.","And with regards to the technology that we offer, I believe we're the only provider that can offer disconnectable turret mooring system and that's actually have one of those at work with the Petrobras FPSO at work in the Gulf of Mexico, the Cascade FPSO, the first one to move into the Gulf of Mexico. The capability to disconnect the turret from the vessel and move the vessel out of harm's way has effectively opened up that market. There's other benefits from that technology as well, if you think about putting a vessel out in service in the ocean for 10 years or 15 years, if you're not disconnectable, the capability of the owner of that vessel to bring it back to dry dock from time to time to inspect it, to repair it is limited. And so we think this disconnect-able turret capability makes good sense for a lot of FPSOs out there, and we're pretty excited about that. More broadly speaking, our plan with our investment in turret mooring systems and in the FPSO space is to bring a lot of NOV's considerable shipyard experience, our project management capability that has really proven itself with the building of drilling rigs and shipyards, which today happens with very low risk, very, very predictable results, and very favorable results, for all parties involved. We think that we can bring amore -- I don't like the word standardize -- but a more configurable approach to the supply chain for FPSOs and do some good there, and very pleased to report, although there's not a lot of spending or POs being placed right now, we've had some great conversations with both NOCs and IOCs around that idea.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Crandell from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Jim Crandell - Cowen","First question is about Brazil. First of all, I think you've had a new facility that came on, how is that performing? And then secondly on Brazil, could you talk a little bit to -- you won, my recollection is, over 20rig equipment packages to be built at Brazilian yards. Can you talk about how those are coming, and what is the risk that a significant portion of those may never be built?","Jeremy Thigpen","Hey Jim, this is Jeremy. Thanks for the question. The flexible plant in Brazil, I think, is the plant that you're referring to. We are up in running, we are experiencing some challenges, some with the machinery and some with just consistent power supply. We are addressing both now. We hope to get that really fully operational as we move through the beginning and middle part of 2015. So we are producing, we are generating revenue, but it's not nearly where we wanted it to be at this stage. But we're working through some of the Brazilian-related problems associated with establishing a new manufacturing footprint, so that's proceeding. And on the Brazil-related floaters, we booked 22 of the 29 total awarded, and we're making good progress on those. In fact, I think we're probably going about as we expected.","Clay Williams","Yeah, we're working four different shipyards. I think each of the four's working on two vessels right now. We're going to have the very first vessel delivered about a year from now. So next year, early next year, we'll be going into installation and commissioning activities in Brazil for the first time. And then in first half of 2016, I think you'll see the other three shipyards deliver their first vessels, and that's kind of the leading edge of that. We also have other facilities we're investing in Brazil, in addition to the flexible plant. So I think Q1 next year, we'll have our riser manufacturing facility opening up and to start building riser for those rigs. So that whole program's moving along pretty much as expected. It is a little bit late, but candidly, Ithink that probably everybody expected that going into it, but I'd say so far, so good. And from an NOV perspective, quarter-by-quarter, and once again in the third quarter, we're seeing revenue contribution from Brazil continue to grow.","Jim Crandell - Cowen","That's great to hear, Clay. And just as a follow-up, could you talk to your Russian business, you have a new facility in Russia. How that facility is performing, and how your business overall is affected by the sanctions?","Clay Williams","Yeah. I would say, with regards to the sanctions, we're very-very careful to make sure that we're complying with those, and we have been impacted somewhat, but much that we ship into Russia doesn't go into the prohibited activities, which are Arctic drilling, shale drilling, that sort of thing. And so we've been able to secure export licenses to cover up those shipments.","The facility that you're referring to is a new facility that we are still building. And we've continued on with that. Our business in Russia is, even with the sanction, still is fairly firm. And so, we've elected to continue to move forward with that plant. It'll probably be completed summer of next year, let's say. And we willed finitely have work for it to do that will comply with the sanctions, both EU and U.S.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Tillery from Tudor Pickering Holt. Please go ahead.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor Pickering Holt","Could you just talk about how you guys see the Rig Aftermarket business as we see more of the older assets idle? Obviously, there's more new builds in the fleet as well. Just what the net of that is, and how that looks over the next 6 months to 12 months, from where you stand today?","Jeremy Thigpen","Yeah. We think the Rig Aftermarket will continue on its trajectory of that low- to mid-teens percentage growth year-on-year. The newer technology actually requires more aftermarket support, because there's more robotics, there's more electronics, all of that requires a little more TLC. So, the more rigs that we introduce to the market, and we're putting a lot in the market this year, and a lot in the market next year and the following year. All of those rigs are going to require -- they're more aftermarket-intensive than some of the older rigs. Certainly we would like to have both, but we recognize that some of these older rigs are going to be stacked and maybe chopped up over time, but still, we think the opportunities for the new rigs are going to be fantastic.","Clay Williams","And even within the category of new rigs, as we look out over the next couple years, as we've referenced before, we'd see the five-year SPSes coming on strong. And so, we think that will also continue to provide a good foundation for growth for that business.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor Pickering Holt","My second question, just on the SPS opportunity. Just help us understand how that flows through. You guys have given a revenue range historically that you guy\u2019s seen. But how much of that\u2019s going to hit the Aftermarket segment versus the New Rig segment? How should we think about that?","Clay Williams","Well, it\u2019ll, you raise a great point, Jeff. It\u2019ll be spread between Rig Aftermarket and Rig Systems, and both segments will benefit from that. The reason for that is, as you know, rigs come into the shipyard every five years for class certifications, which are required by most of the major customers and operators and required in a lot of areas around the world, not every place not and not every customer. But I think most contractors really perform this and will continue to do so. So these rigs come in they go off day rate, they spend a week or two or five or 15 weeks in a shipyard. And that\u2019s a great opportunity for those drilling contractors to inspect their drilling equipment as the hull is also being inspected. And so we work closely on those projects with those customers. And so the range of revenue can be quite variable, and I would say on the low end, it\u2019s probably a $5 million to $10 million per rig exercise, but can in some cases exceed, 80 million or 100 million, if it\u2019s a major upgrade or replacement of drilling packages which we do see. And so, it\u2019s kind of everything within that. We have, in fact, in the third quarter, we saw a higher level of budgetary quotes for engineering work around rig upgrades and SPSes, and we look at the demographics over the next few years, we see a lot of rigs that are going to have to come in. And so, that's the basis for our outlook in that business.","But the split between the segments comes from the fact that Rig Aftermarket really focuses on the technicians, the repair work, the smaller spare parts, to go in and fix things, whereas Rig Systems sells complete units. So, if we replace a part on a draw works, it\u2019ll show up in Rig Aftermarket. If we replace the entire draw works or we upgrade the draw works, then that\u2019ll show up in Rig Systems.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company","Back to, I guess, Brazil. What is the dollar amount in backlog that we have today? And it sounds like you guys are working on eight floaters currently, 14 remaining. What\u2019s the roadmap for processing those 14 remaining floaters?","Jeremy Thigpen","Hey Bill. It\u2019s about 3.7 billion in remaining backlog out of Brazil, and it will obviously flow out at a much slower pace than we typically see from our Korean shipyards.","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company","Yes.","Jeremy Thigpen","To the point where we expect the tail to be pretty long on this. So, the revenue conversion out of backlog as we move into 2015 and beyond will be a little slower than you've seen here recently.","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company","Okay. And then with regard to, you\u2019re working on eight floaters today, when do we start working on the next slug?","Clay Williams","","Well, they all kind of feather in as rigs ship out. So the first rig that ships out in late 2015 by then, in that same yard, we\u2019ll be working on a second rig. So it\u2019s, if you imagine it in an aggregated basis, it\u2019s a very broad sort of bell curve of revenue for NOV. That make sense?","Operator","","Our next question comes from Marshall Adkins from Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Marshall Adkins - Raymond James","Morning, guys. I love hearing Wicklund channel his inner Herbert with those big words, that was very good.","Clay Williams","Two at once, nice.","Marshall Adkins - Raymond James","So Rig Systems, obviously margins have bounced down a little bit here, and you gave some explanation. I think I heard the installation costs were a little higher, Brazil, from specialized land rigs. Is, you\u2019ve been seeing a pretty nice ramp in margins in that area. Should we expect that to level off now for the next year, in that 21% range?","Jeremy Thigpen","Yes, I think that\u2019s fair. We have a lot of, it\u2019s a big business, lot of moving parts, and that\u2019s why we always provide the range. I think you could see some slight margin improvement next year, but I think it\u2019s going to be in that 20%, 21% range for the next few quarters.","Clay Williams","Yes, the challenge we had there in Q3 kind of illustrates it. The building of the individual components, we have a lot of control over. So for the top drives, the rackers, the draw works that go into these rigs are made in our plants. We know our costs, we know pretty precisely. The very last thing that you do on a package is that you actually install that equipment on the rig in the shipyard, and then you tune it and program it to make all these components work together to actually perform drilling operations. That\u2019s where the uncertainty is in cost, and that\u2019s where we face some cost headwinds during Q3 that were a little unexpected. Part of the reason for that, we\u2019ve talked about this before, the very rapid pace that these rigs are being built at, the fact that we\u2019ve shaved more than a year off the building of a drill ship has put a lot of pressure on the shipyards, a lot of these rigs are running late once we get, once NOV shows up to do the I&C work. And so, we\u2019re dealing with sometimes rig floors that aren\u2019t yet completely built, they don\u2019t have power to them yet. We\u2019re trying to work around shipyards that are trying to complete their construction activities. And so, that was the basis for a few cost -- negative cost surprises in Q3 in I&C space. We're seeing the same -- and some of that came from our Chinese shipyards, that we're building some of these jack-ups in, that we haven't worked in before contributed to it. So, as we look into 2015, the number of offshore rigs that we're going to be doing installation and commissioning work on goes up and given that that's where kind of our uncertainty is, I think that's probably going to limit our ability to increase margins.","Jeremy Thigpen","It not only goes up, we have a much higher percentage of Chinese related work in the new Chinese shipyards which we expect to be a little bit challenging, when it gets to installation and commissioning.","Marshall Adkins - Raymond James ","Perfect, and a follow up, I want to make sure I heard this right. It sounded like you said 26% of your new orders were offshore, but 90% of your backlog was offshore, so help explain that, reconcile that, and I guess if that was correct, does that mean the backlog over the next year moves more onshore?","Jeremy Thigpen","Yes, so one slight correction to your statement. 26% offshore new build construction, so going into a new offshore rig package. We did have some offshore components that were not part of that 26%, that were for upgrades or replacement, so just that one point of clarification, otherwise you were spot on. But yes, in terms of why you see the 90:10 split, it's just it's a much larger piece of offshore that converts over a longer period of time, whereas land related components can come in and out in a pretty short of period of time. But yes, as we move into next year, you will see that land percentage increase as a percentage of the total.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Curran from FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Tom Curran - FBR Capital Markets","So, continuing with that line of questioning. On the onshore side, whenever we see one of the big four U.S. land drillers announce an incremental new build award. When it comes to the total construction cost for that rig, what should we assume is your total accessible market, whether it's Helmerich & Payne or Nabors, Patterson?","Clay Williams","It varies between zero and 100%. Well there's never zero, we probably sell something on every one of those rigs, but let's a low percentage to a 100%. And so the major North American drilling contractors all have some level of rig repair capability, rig up capability, rig yards with, welders with, sandblast capability, with paying capability and so one of the trends that we have been targeting in the land rig space is to persuade them to let NOV build complete rig packages as oppose to some of the major land drilling contractors across North America, really want to utilize their own infrastructure to build rigs. And so it's kind of a mixed bag out there in terms of who buys solely firm NOV complete land rig packages versus who puts together the kind of their own design with their own components. Importantly in even those ones that do put together their own rigs, they use their own personnel to put together the rigs like I said we're selling components to all of them and pleased to participate in those but we build rigs for living and we think we can have value to add in terms of adding -- building complete rigs for those operators. ","And so we're talking to them about taking over more of your manufacturing activities and bringing it to NOV where they can benefit from our scale, from our consistent rig designs and layouts and we can help bring standardization across their fleets. And we also add to that com this is kind of a North American phenomenon when we talk about international markets like the Middle-East which has been very strong, Latin America which has been very strong, they're the [indiscernible] for most of our customers is to buy complete rig packages from us. So there is kind of a difference between the North American market and the international markets that we serve.","Jeremy Thigpen","Just one other point on the North American market and the big four some of them have an out build program that exceed their ability to provide those rigs internally with their own capacity and so when Clay mentioned we're going to try to persuade them to allow us to build the entire rig we're starting to get some traction in that area.","Clay Williams","Yes some are doing both.","Jeremy Thigpen","Yes.","Clay Williams","Some are building rigs on their own but also outsourcing complete rig packages.","Tom Curran - FBR Capital Markets","Thanks and so on the North American front, are there any specific drillers that you've therefore announced alliance or frame agreements with or where you're -- the percentage that you're winning of their new builds is clearly moving up and then on the international side, could you just refresh us on the average revenue value per land rig order and which markets look the strongest heading into 2015.","Clay Williams","","Well first, we don't typically talk about any specific customer account or make announcements like that. We're here to serve all the customers out there, and try to remain valued suppliers to all of them and work closely with them. And like I said, we're pleased to participate in just about everybody's build program at some level. Internationally, I think we touched on these, but the Middle East has seen strong demand for rigs and they can vary from a kind of a fairly standard Ideal Rig for us which is our -- which is a 1,500 horsepower offering which would be in the low $20 million range and can go up very quickly from there due to modifications required for high ambient temperatures encountered in the Middle East, along with extra power generation capabilities, the drill pipe that they order, whether they order walking rigs versus skid able rigs versus other configurations. And so that's the low end of the range, but it can go on up to 40 million, 50 million, 60 million or more for some very-very highly capable rigs that we sell into some of the international markets. So it's quite variable outside North America, whereas in North America, I think the 1,500 horsepower rig, our Ideal Rig, others have various other names that they use for theirs, is the workhorse rig that we see most commonly.","Tom Curran - FBR Capital Markets","And then, last one from me. On the Rig Aftermarket front, when it comes to the six and seven gen rigs out there that are dual BOP stack capable, but have yet to actually order the backup BOP, what's your current outlook for the run rate we should see on a quarterly basis for those orders?","Clay Williams","It\u2019s hard to quantify that on a run rate, other than to say, and I think Jeremy mentioned this in his comments earlier, that we saw pretty good demand for fleet spares for discrete pieces of equipment to support the offshore fleet. And for us, that's pretty typical. So fleet spares going into dual BOP rigs, or even a spare BOP to support multiple rigs that only have a single BOP, sometimes our customers will want to have as tack on the beach ready to go in case something happens with one of theirs. For us, that's ordinary course of business and tends to exist separate and apart from the new build appetite. And so, we would -- given the downturn in new builds, we'd expect that business to remain relatively healthy going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Kurt Hallead from RBC. Please go ahead.","Kurt Hallead - RBC","How about that, last but not least. How you guys doing? All right. I love Marshall's sense of humor, that's great, love it. It's all good. Hey, I'm going to ask a slightly different question related to one of the comments you made earlier, Clay, in the context of -- you talked about how shale-related production volumes would come down once you see some reduced level of activity. Just wondering if you can maybe put that into a context as it relates to natural gas because, yes, in some basins, we've seen a reduction in natural gas, but in aggregate, we haven't. So, what do you think is different about the oil dynamic vis-\u00e0-vis the gas dynamic?","Clay Williams","Well, the associated gas, Kurt. So, natural gas drilling plummeted a couple years ago when gas prices fell off the cliff, so drilling slowed down to almost nothing. The difference is, is that oil drilling and oil production have picked up, and I think there's a lot of associated gas with that, that comes with that oil. And so, I think that's probably a key difference here.","Kurt Hallead - RBC","Okay. And then a follow-up question with respect to the use of cash dynamic, and you guys announced a share repurchase program. When you go through the process, you get a lot of cash international, you got the share repurchase program, which ought to be financed with cash I think you create here in the U.S. someway, somehow. Can you just walk us through that dynamic again, because my understanding was, essentially all the free cash flow you generate in the U.S. was going toward CapEx and dividends?","Jeremy Thigpen","It is largely curtained, if you read the press release, I'm sure you did, on our announced buyback, we said we would fund it with U.S. cash, cash that we were able to repatriate from foreign jurisdictions. And we wouldn't be opposed to potentially, from time-to-time, financing the transactions as well. So, we've taken an all-of-the-above approach.","Clay Williams","Yes. We find -- we do find we're able to bring back cash from overseas from time-to-time.","Jeremy Thigpen","Yes, in a tax-efficient manner.","Kurt Hallead - RBC","And then just lastly, given the drop in oil prices that we've seen, has it been a long enough duration, or a sharp enough drop, to motivate some sellers? And how do you view the M&A opportunity set right now?","Clay Williams","Not unless they've got a really distressed balance sheet themselves. I don't think anyone's panicking right now. Everybody knows this is a cyclical business, everybody knows commodity prices are going to move down from time-to-time. So I would not expect sellers to really change their outlook yet. Six months from now, if rig count does move down more sharply, let's say, than we expect, then maybe we get sellers that are a little more motivated. But it takes a while for this to sort of settle into people's psyches.","Jeremy Thigpen","Having said that, we've got a pretty full pipeline of opportunities, and I've described most of them -- all of them -- as more bolt-on acquisitions that are based mostly overseas. So, really good opportunities that we're working and have been working for a couple of months. And as you know, these all have a life of their own and can sometimes last months if not years, but got some really good opportunities out there.","Kurt Hallead - RBC","Okay. And then Clay, on the deepwater commentary you guys had earlier, do you expect the -- sounds like you expect an improvement in 2016 and 2017. So you're really thinking, at that juncture, you'll see a reacceleration in deepwater rig orders? So I guess -- you\u2019re essential saying this, this cycle downturn is going to look a lot like what happened from 2002 to 2004. Is that fair?","Clay Williams","At this point, yes. We think there\u2019s a growing backlog of discoveries that need development. We think the deepwater demand for rigs to do development drilling is going to continue to mount. We think the IOCs will eventually come under pressure to replace reserves and production. We think to just take a stab at it, we think 2018-2019 demand for deepwater drilling starts to look pretty, pretty good. If you want a rig to go to work in 2018, you need to get a order in late 2015. So we\u2019re looking at where we think supply demand may come in balance, and supply may fall short of demand, and backing up three years and saying, that\u2019s maybe where we start to see some of the more forward looking contractors step up and place orders.","Jeremy Thigpen","Now, let me add too, I said this clearly on the comments. We\u2019re going to continue to win rigs in 2015.We\u2019ve got very serious conversations underway. So it\u2019s not going to zero in 2015. It\u2019s just going to be down from where it\u2019s been.","Operator","Thank you. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Clay Williams for closing remarks.","Clay Williams","Thank you, Christine, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. We look forward to reporting our year end and fourth quarter results in about three months. So, have a great day. Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"15831":["National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NYSE:NOV) Q1 2019 Earnings Conference Call April 26, 2019 11:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Loren Singletary - Chief Investor and Investor and Industry Relations Officer","Clay Williams - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Jose Bayardo - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","Byron Pope - Tudor Pickering Holt","Bill Herbert - Simmons","Kurt Hallead - RBC","Sean Meakim - JP Morgan","Chase Mulvehill - Bank of America","James West - Evercore ISI","Operator","Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the National Oilwell Varco First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Loren Singletary, Chief Investor and Industry Relations Officer. Sir, you may begin.","Loren Singletary","Thank you, and welcome everyone to National Oilwell Varco's First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Clay Williams, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jose Bayardo, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of today's comments are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. They involve risk and uncertainty and actual results may differ materially. No one should assume that these forward-looking statements remain valid later in the quarter or later in the year. For a more detailed discussion of our major risk factors affecting our business, please refer to our latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Our comments also include non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation to the nearest corresponding GAAP measures are in our earnings release available on our website. On a U.S. GAAP basis for the first quarter of 2019, NOV reported revenues of $1.94 billion and a net loss of $77 million, or $0.20 per share.","Our use of the term EBITDA throughout this morning's call corresponds with the term adjusted EBITDA as defined in our earnings release. Later on in the call, we will host a question-and-answer session. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow up to permit more participation.","Now, let me turn the call over to Clay.","Clay Williams","Thank you, Loren. In the first quarter 2019, NOV generated $1.94 billion in revenue, a decrease of 19% sequentially and an increase of 8% year-on-year. EBITDA was $140 million, down a $139 million sequentially, representing 30% decremental leverage as EBITDA fell by half.","Late last year we witnessed one of the sharpest and fastest declines in oil price on record as WTI fell to $45 per barrel along with rising demands from investors that oil companies exhibit more capital discipline and austerity. Oil companies responded by signaling their plans to trim CapEx and reduce activity as we entered 2019.","NOV's largest customers, the oilfield service companies that execute well construction plans for these oil companies, in trying to divine what the new year would hold, all seemed to decide that discretion is the better part of valor, and they threw the brakes on their spending for the tools that they buy from NOV.","Oilfield service companies are skilled at slashing spending during market slowdowns and our phones went quiet in December and January. Our poor first quarter financial results reflect a sharp air pocket that arose from this latest round of capital austerity following that oil price dip.","Broadly speaking, the factors that we cited on our last call underpinning our revenue guide down to be in the low teens ended up hitting with more ferocity than we expected leading revenues down 19% sequentially instead. While the outlook remains uncertain, WTI rebounding into the $60 range and Brent into the $70 range has helped improve our outlook, particularly in the offshore and international markets.","Our Investor Day analysis showed just how physically asset intensive oilfield operations are and the amount of equipment that gets consumed for every barrel developed. That physical linkage between equipment and oil means that while oilfield service companies can cut spending and cannibalize idled equipment and make do in the short run, eventually they need to repair and replace their capital equipment stock and must start spending again.","After a very quiet start to the year, we saw orders begin to flow in again in late February and March to support activity. Book to bills' in excess of one for Completion & Production Solutions which booked half its orders in March, Rig Technologies and drill pipes provided much more constructive backdrop for the remainder of the year, and we expect our second quarter results to be significantly improved.","Nevertheless, the impact of capital austerity on the speed and nature of a more robust oilfield recovery that we have been hoping for remains unknown and out of our control. Therefore, we are renewing our focus on controlling what we can, our costs. NOV underwent significant downsizing between 2015 and 2017, which took out $3 billion in annual costs and helped the organization generate over $2 billion in free cash flow over the same period. However, given the current market and outlook, the Company's earnings are insufficient and good stewardship dictates that we undertake additional cost reductions.","For context, our businesses are highly decentralized, purposefully and strategically organized in a way that promotes a degree of autonomy for the teams that run them who are closest to the coal face and best equipped to make the day-to-day operating decisions to maximize their performance.","We have terrific entrepreneurial leaders who we trust to manage these businesses within a collaborative network. Following our significant downsizing, our next opportunity to reduce costs will come from a reexamination of the degree of centralization of certain support functions within our organization, some of which we expect to move more toward a shared services model to drive further efficiency.","This is a heavy lift. It will take a few quarters to accomplish, but it is necessary to drive further profitability. While we are formulating our plans and refining savings estimates currently, we see a preliminary path to capture $120 million a year in savings and would not be surprised for our final plans to meaningfully exceed this.","Before Jose takes you through our first quarter results, I'd like to share with you some of the trends we see developing, starting in the North American pressure pumping market. In response to the uncertain outlook, our pressure pumping customers stopped ordering and scaled back maintenance at the end of 2018 leading to a 58% sequential decline in U.S. pressure pumping sales.","Similarly, wireline and coiled tubing operators also cut spending but the sequential decline was less severe for these, and North American coiled tubing units that customers deferred delivery have begun to move out the door in April. Despite slow demand, we are finding interest in new products that we are introducing. Plus, we see some demand for replacement blenders, mixers and other frac support equipment.","International markets in contrast are strengthening as demand for higher capacity coiled tubing, wireline and pressure pumping units rises, which helped our book to bill exceed 140% in the first quarter, albeit on lower sequential volume.","Secondly, slowing drilling activity in North America and overcapacity is driving price down on certain downhole tools, surface equipment, and rig site services. Pricing is under pressure, down mid-single digits on our downhole agitator tools and shale shakers. On the other hand, we have been successful in getting price increases on shaker screens, bits and downhole drilling motors, the latter of which are up 21% year-on-year. We've also been able to get modest price increases in inspection services in certain regions.","Third, drill pipe demand is shifting from land to offshore. Despite land customer inventory levels within our drill pipe yard at 10 year lows, North American drillers pushed deliveries of drill pipe into the second quarter or later. This drove a sharp sequential falloff in revenue for our Grant Prideco business, which accounted for more than half of the total top line sequential decline for the Wellbore Technologies segment. This is not sustainable. Land drillers are demonstrating strict capital discipline, but they are consuming drill pipe daily and they won't be able to drill when they run out.","While we're seeing land drill pipe demand slow, international and offshore markets are moving the other way coming back to the table after years of subsisting off excess drill pipe from their stack fleets. This quarter offshore sales increased 15% to push its mix to 39% of the total. And with three-fourths of our sales prospects now coming from offshore drillers who need to put drill pipe on rigs to reactivate them, that number is set to rise. The good news for NOV is that offshore drillers employ larger, more sophisticated drill pipes which drives higher margins.","Fourth, the recent capital austerity and decline in the active U.S. land rig count is driving a temporary halt in land rig upgrade programs. NOV has been at the nexus of the wave of rig upgrades and continues to lift the capabilities of the active U.S. land rig fleet to be in line with those commanding the highest day rate, the most modern super-spec rigs. Having picked the low-hanging fruit over the past few years, however, drillers are being cautious about spending up to half of the cost of a new rig to upgrade an older DC rig to high-spec AC given sliding drilling activity and flat-to-slightly declining rig day rates. Nevertheless, NOV's offering into rig upgrades, including NOVOS operating systems, low-cost drawworks, top-drive upgrades, and other enhancements leave us well-positioned for when rig upgrades resume.","Number five, interestingly the pace of rig special surveys and reactivations for offshore rigs is heading in the other direction. The active project pipeline we are working on has increased 30% over the past few quarters, and today we are working on more than 30 offshore rig projects, 20 of which are reactivations of stacked rigs, helping these rig owners make their assets operationally ready to bid on the rising number of rig tenders offshore.","This is good news for Grant Prideco, as I mentioned earlier. Having offshore drilling contractors increasingly demand our low cost of ownership Delta Premium connection is a strong signal that our market adoption is growing sustainably. Aftermarket revenues made up 54% of Rig Technologies segments revenues, but exhibited typical first quarter seasonal declines despite more offshore projects. Contractors tend to deplete budgets and wrap up their repair jobs at the end of the year and then slow activity in the first quarter until budgets are fully reset. The first quarter of 2019 saw the highest quarter of spares bookings in almost four years and a rising offshore mix signaling continued recovery of our offshore rig business as customers replenish dwindling inventories, which were cannibalized from stacked rigs during the downturn.","Number six, water handling and disposal is an emerging bottleneck in the Permian Basin and produced saltwater and steel don't get along well. As the industry continues to build out the infrastructure to support the most prolific unconventional basin on the planet, operators in West Texas are calling on larger diameter, spooled, composite pipe, and high-pressure, jointed fiberglass pipes some of which -- some with diameters greater than 20 inches to handle produced water without corroding.","As the largest supplier of composite pipe to the industry, this is an area that NOV is very well positioned in to capitalize on. Within our TK fiberglass line downhole tubulars' business, we're seeing a shift from two-eighths and three-eighths into a seven-eighths inch downhole tubing to 4.5 inch tubing to handle higher volumes of fluids. NOV is also a leading provider of production chokes, reciprocating pumps, multi-phase progressing cavity pumps, and pipeline closures into this infrastructure build out.","Seven, North American operators are keenly focused on completions and new technology and value are upsetting the old order of things. As completion costs have risen to exceed two-thirds of an unconventional well AFE, the potential to reduce development costs by applying newer, more clever completion tools has increased proportionately. Nimble independents are open to trying new tools and technologies that can offer meaningful impact on their development costs and risks.","In this vein, operators are partnering with NOV to cut costs. For instance, this quarter we ran our Setter Composite Frac Plug for a major Permian operator, and we demonstrated the quickest drill and wash times and all plugs were tagged on depth. Our customer immediately awarded us a large portion of their frac plug business as a result. We're also seeing customers around the globe test drive our liner hangers, sliding sleeves, Burst Port subs, and other clever completion jewelry unique to NOV.","Number eight, following a slow first quarter start. The eastern hemisphere may be shaping up for incremental growth as the year unfolds. For starters, the increase in coiled tubing demand in international markets is helping offset North American declines and is signaling the adoption of technology -- technologies upon which the North American shale revolution was founded in new basins. Pressure pumping equipment, wireline units, and completion tools are seeing increased adoption in Argentina and the Middle East.","We held a ribbon-cutting ceremony for our new fiberglass composite pipe facility in Dammam, Saudi Arabia, in early April, and we also secured a substantial $50 million order there. We anticipate that composite pipe and corrosion-resistant technologies coming out of this state-of-the-art facility will proliferate into additional markets across the region. We're continuing to see certain international land rig tenders intending to replace aging fleets in places like Argentina, which now has several of our high-end AC drilling rigs posting records. Other large rig tenders in India and the Middle East also continue to creep forward, while contractors employing higher tech rigs in foreign markets are drawing circles around incumbents who built their rig fleets with the cheapest iron.","Number nine, our Subsea Production business remained challenged in the first quarter. While things are looking up, it continues to be a slow grind. Flexible pipe revenue fell precipitously in the first quarter, partially due to the pull forward of deliveries at the end of the year. Encouragingly, though, first quarter orders were higher than they've been in a year, and a customer and project mix is point to more greenfield projects.","We also expect second quarter orders from subsea projects to be strong, and we're encouraged by the improving outlook for LNG projects globally. NOV is a leading provider of gas treatment and hydrate inhibition technology, for example, offering monoethylene glycol reclamation units that can handle a ton of salt an hour and can cost over $100 million on a large project. We're a leading provider of offloading and loading equipment for LNG along with the technologies that support the drilling and completion of gas wells to supply these projects.","So, overall, while the first quarter was very disappointing and our outlook remains less certain than we'd like, we see emerging pockets of demand and signs of recovery that provide a more constructive backdrop for the potential recovery later in the year. Nevertheless, the first quarter is also a reminder that we can only control what we can control and that a renewed focus on costs is warranted, all while we continue to position the Company to take advantage of the opportunities that present the greatest returns.","To our dedicated employees, thank you for all that you do to continually improve our organization and our industry. You're tough and resourceful, and our team and our shareholders are counting on you to help drive better results. Thank you for all that you do.","With that, I'll turn it over to Jose.","Jose Bayardo","Thank you, Clay. Before jumping into the results of our operations, I'd like to cover a couple items related to our balance sheet. Effective January 1st, 2019, we adopted the new U.S. GAAP lease accounting standard resulting in a $590 million addition to our assets and equal amount to our liabilities.","In the first quarter of 2019, working capital increased $162 million, primarily due to $145 million build in our inventory. Finished goods that we expected to ship and translate into revenue during the quarter did not make it out the door due to customer deferrals, and we took receipt of raw materials in anticipation of future orders. Declines in AR were largely offset by declines in current liabilities. While we are not pleased with the magnitude of the increase in working capital, we are confident that in Q2 we will resume progress toward realizing our goal of working capital as a percentage of annualized revenue run rate below 35% by year--end.","Turning to results of our operations. Our Wellbore Technologies segment generated $807 million in revenue during the first quarter of 2019, a decrease of $77 million, or 9% sequentially. Lower volumes and pricing pressure in North America for certain products drove decremental EBITDA margins of 49% resulting in a $38 million decrease in EBITDA to $117 million, or 14.5% of sales. The segment's short cycle, activity-driven product offerings performed as anticipated during the quarter, but the capital equipment components within this segment, namely our drill pipe business, suffered the same customer-driven equipment deferrals and slow-to-develop order book that impacted our other segments.","Customers deferred first quarter deliveries of new drill pipe into the second quarter due to the sharp fall in oil prices during Q4 and the corresponding reductions in U.S. land drilling activity. The result was a much sharper-than-anticipated falloff in revenue snapping Grant Prideco's streak of three straight quarters with double-digit percent revenue increases.","Improving commodity prices, a less-than-feared pullback in drilling activity, and drill pipe inventory levels that remain at historic lows brought back orders from North American customers in late Q1 albeit at a slower pace than in the last few quarters. Any momentum lost in the North American market was more than offset by a meaningful pickup in orders for international and offshore markets.","Despite breaking a revenue growth streak, we achieved our fifth straight quarter with bookings in excess of a $100 million and realized our highest quarterly bookings since 2014. While we're still quite far from achieving the average order intake we saw during the prior peak, we're seeing more indications of a sustainable recovery in demand for our premium drill pipe.","Wellbore Technologies' other activity driven and less capital equipment oriented businesses performed in line with our expectations and their revenue in the U.S. outperforms the falloff in domestic drilling activity. Our ReedHycalog business unit realized a 4% sequential decrease in revenue. The customary sluggish start to the year in international markets was partially offset by a 7% sequential increase in our U.S. drill bit business.","Improved pricing and continued market share gains in West Texas drove the increase in revenue and early wins from our cost reduction and efficiency improvement initiative resulted in meaningful incremental margins in U.S. operations. In addition to reducing the cost of our support functions, each of our business units is also working to improve operational efficiencies. ReedHycalog has identified opportunities to achieve $22 million in annual margin improvement by the end of 2019 through initiatives to reduce product costs, repair and maintenance cycle times, and supply chain inefficiencies.","While ReedHycalog's Downhole Measurement and Steerable Technologies product lines had sequential revenue declines, both businesses expanded their geographical reach into new markets around the world. Customers deployed our Tolteq MWD iSeries tools for the first time in Mexico and Turkey and the Middle East and we secured our first long-term rental contract to deploy VectorEXAKT Rotary Steerable tools in the MENA region.","In our Downhole business unit revenue decreased 6% sequentially. Strong Q4 sales of fishing and drilling tools into international markets did not repeat and lower levels of U.S. drilling activity offset continued market share gains and pricing improvement in our U.S. drilling motor business. We've been able to command better pricing for our motors due to the superior performance and reliability resulting from technical innovation and manufacturing quality.","Our Downhole business unit is also executing on initiatives to improve operational efficiencies. The business unit has recently optimized its global realigning infrastructure, shutting down a plant in Belgium and relocating assets to remaining hubs in Dubai and Nisku, Canada where we are focused on reducing manufacturing costs through product design and process improvement. The unit is also working to optimize field infrastructure by closing two service facilities in Canada and redeploying tools and equipment to the U.S. and other markets.","In our WellSite Services business unit, revenue decreased 9% sequentially, back to levels realized in Q3 of 2018. Strong sales of screens and capital equipment near year-end did not repeat and job counts for U.S. solids control operation decreased in line with drilling activity levels. Margins in our U.S. solids control business improved due to better pricing on shaker screens and better management of labor costs.","Lastly, our Tuboscope business unit posted a 2% sequential increase in revenue. An increase in eastern hemisphere OCTG pipe inspections and contributions from two small acquisitions were mostly offset by declines in our coating operations resulting from the sharp reduction in activity from Grant Prideco. In the second quarter of 2019, we expect a meaningful recovery in our drill pipe business and improved demand from the eastern hemisphere to more than offset lower average drilling activity levels in the U.S. As a result, we expect revenue for our Wellbore Technologies segment to improve 3% to 5% with incremental margins in the 30% range.","Our Completion & Production Solutions segment generated $581 million in revenue during the first quarter of 2019, a sequential decrease of $207 million or 26%. Revenue was below expectations primarily due to greater-than-anticipated restraint by North American oilfield service customers and a steeper-than-expected decline in our offshore businesses with new orders not booked in time to generate expected revenue.","All business units reported double-digit sequential revenue declines, except for XL Systems, which is executing on all-time high backlog achieved last quarter. A sharp falloff in revenue and a less favorable mix of business led to 41% decremental EBITDA margins and a $84 million sequential decrease in EBITDA to $28 million, the lowest level seen through the downturn. After a very slow start to the year, orders improved sharply in the last month of the quarter and totaled $470 million, equal to our bookings in Q4. Total segment backlog at quarter end was $1.41 billion, an increase of $147 million from the fourth quarter.","Our Intervention and Stimulation Equipment business unit saw revenue fall by 25% sequentially. We anticipated a sharp decline due to a depleted backlog for pressure pumping equipment and softening demand for wireline units, but customers stepped on the brakes harder than expected and also deferred deliveries of coiled tubing and other equipment.","As Clay described, customers began returning to place new orders during March and the business unit finished the quarter with its highest quarter ending backlog since the second quarter of 2015. Despite the temporarily deferred deliveries in North America during Q1, demand for coiled tubing remains robust and we booked sales of 22 additional units with notable increases coming from international markets where customers are emerging from the downturn cognizant of the contributions modern equipment and technology made to the economics of production in North America over the last decade. In Q1, our ISE business generated roughly 50% of its revenue from international markets, and we anticipate this percentage will increase over the coming quarters as the composition of our backlog looks very different today compared to the last two years.","Our Fiber Glass Systems business unit also posted a sharp sequential decrease in revenue as order intake deteriorated in Q4 and remained depressed through the first two months of the year. Orders rebounded sharply at quarter end after international customers finalized 2019 budget decisions and West Texas midstream infrastructure companies reemerge with strong orders as commodity prices improved and they reaffirmed the basin's enormous need for produced water infrastructure. March orders accounted for approximately 60% of bookings and resulted in the business unit achieving its highest ever quarter ending backlog.","In our Process and Flow Technologies business unit, revenue fell sharply after the completion of major offshore wellstream processing projects in Q4. Additionally, large shipments of pump packages to the eastern hemisphere did not repeat and the North American market was sluggish. While Canada and the Mid-Continent remained challenged, we are seeing renewed interest in the Permian, Bakken, and U.S. Rockies for our reciprocating pumps, chokes and closures. International markets also came back to life as the quarter progressed with demand for production pump packages picking up in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Africa. Notably, roughly half of the business unit's bookings came through our wellstream processing operation via two monoethylene glycol reclamation and regeneration units destined for Asia, which helped to replenish depleted backlog in this operation. Clay touched on the dynamics associated with the offshore market components of our CAP segment.","Our Subsea Production Systems business unit, Floating Production Systems business unit, and the wellstream processing portion of Process and Flow Technologies each experienced sequential revenue declines of between roughly 40% and 50%. While improved bookings in Q1 give us confidence in the short-term movements and emerging signs of additional greenfield projects give us optimism longer term, our offshore backlog remains uncomfortably low. A high level of tendering activity continues, but there is no guarantee that projects will not push to the right as has frequently occurred over the last several years.","Looking at the second quarter, we expect revenue in our Completion & Production Solutions segment to improve roughly 15% with incremental margins in the upper 20% range. Our Rig Technologies segment generated $603 million in revenue, a sequential decrease of $201 million or 25%. A higher margin mix of business with a higher proportion of revenue from sales of aftermarket parts and services, as well as cost controls limited decremental margins to 23%, resulting in a $46 million decrease in EBITDA to $56 million, or 9.3% of sales.","The wind down of certain offshore projects and customer accelerated deliveries near year-end impacted Q1 results as expected. However, slower-than-anticipated progress on remaining projects and a loss of customer urgency for land rig upgrades resulted in a sharper-than-anticipated decline in revenue. Our aftermarket business realized a 4% sequential decline in revenue primarily due to the seasonal falloff in service and repair work that Clay described. Our aftermarket business realized an 18% increase in revenue year-over-year driven in large part by increased spending from offshore drilling contractors as they replenished their spare part inventories from unsustainably low levels.","Rig Technologies segment orders totaled $271 million, a sequential increase of $152 million or a 128%. Headlining the order book was a drilling equipment package for the BP and Azeri Central East platform in the Caspian Sea offshore Azerbaijan. In the recent past, we've stated that we did not see many near-term offshore newbuild opportunities outside of a few niche applications. We've worked closely with BP and their ACE project partners over the past two years, and we're excited to work with them on this unique platform that is expected to achieve first production in 2023 and produce up to 300 million barrels over its lifetime.","We anticipate our aftermarket operations will continue to realize gradual improvements but expect continued volatility in the capital equipment portion of our Rig Technologies segment as we continue to operate near cyclical lows, limiting visibility into our mid-to-longer term outlook. However, for the second quarter, we expect improved aftermarket revenue and better progress on offshore projects to be partially offset by lower land capital equipment sales resulting in a 5% to 10% increase in revenue with incremental EBITDA margins in the upper 20% range.","While we had a challenging start to the year across all three segments, we built momentum through the quarter and grew our backlog positioning us well for improved financial results in the second quarter. Longer term growing signs of a broader recovery give us optimism for better days ahead, and we know our talented people and the product offering they've developed have us well positioned to capitalize on opportunities that emerge. But we are also firmly committed to delivering improved financial results at current industry activity levels.","With that, we'll open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Byron Pope with Tudor Pickering Holt. Your line is open.","Byron Pope","And congratulations on managing through what's a tough environment. Clay, you touched on this as it relates to Rig Technologies, but I think it's underappreciated the extent to which NOV provides a lot of aftermarket and consumables products. And just given it feels like U.S. land rig count is in the process of stabilizing in the next couple of months and international's trending in the right direction. Could you just frame for us for Wellbore Technologies and CAPS a way to think about either aftermarket or consumables system to help us -- help us think about your baseline level of demand?","Clay Williams","You bet, you bet. Yes, the Completion & Production Solutions group also provides a lot of capital equipment as well, and each of those business as units does provide a lot of aftermarket support to -- support an installed base out there. So, for instance, our Process and Flow Technologies group within CAPS, a big portion of their business is the ongoing support of a large installed base of progressing cavity pumps and reciprocating pumps and production chokes and things like that. And that's true kind of throughout the business units there within CAPS.","And then in Wellbore Technologies, we do sell some capital equipment. Our WellSite Services group is a leader in the provision of solids control equipment, for instance. And we provide aftermarket support of shale shakers and centrifuges and other process equipment that's in the field. But the nature of those tends to be a little more consumable. So the shale shakers will go through a shale shaker screen every -- or have to be completely rescreened across the deck every week or so. So that's really nice ongoing sort of support for that equipment. So really it varies across all three segments, but all three segments have aftermarket and consumable elements to their businesses that our customers demand.","Byron Pope","Okay, appreciate that. And then just one quick additional one. If I think about the international side of the business for Wellbore Technologies, could you just frame for us at a high level, which geo markets you think drive the international top line growth for Wellbore Technologies based on the opportunity set that you see today?","Clay Williams","Yes, the strongest geo market that we've seen through the downturn has been the Middle East and the North Africa region. And we've been investing in that area and I think the growth prospects there are really bright. We had a lot of strong sales in Wellbore Technologies in the fourth quarter. Some of the -- for instance, some of the big tenders and things like that tend to come in big packages, and we had a couple of those go out the door in the first quarter that led to part of the falloff that you saw there in Wellbore Technologies in the first quarter.","But the good news for us is that we won some important tenders in North Africa and the Middle East in the first quarter that will contribute to future quarter results. We're pretty -- we're pretty optimistic about the future for that area. But I'll tell you, as you know, Wellbore Technologies is present every major oilfield basin around the globe, and our fortunes are tied to those individual areas kind of their outlook for activity and so forth. And so customers around the world rely on NOV technology and Wellbore Technologies to support their operations.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Herbert with Simmons. Your line is open.","Bill Herbert","Clay and Jose, I think I heard you correctly saying that your frac related sales in Q4 were down close to 60% quarter-on-quarter. Was that correct?","Clay Williams","Yes, in the U.S. -- pressure pumping sales in the U.S. down 58%.","Bill Herbert","Okay. Could you break that down between OEM versus consumables and spare parts and repair maintenance.","Clay Williams","I don't have the breakout here in front of me, but I will tell you that all of those U.S. pressure pumpers are pretty good at stopping spending of everything. So it was both OEM capital equipment and aftermarket that felt the brunt of the round of capital austerity that we've all been hearing so much about.","Bill Herbert","So, notwithstanding the unrelenting service intensity of the business, that is the frac business, consumables and repair and maintenance slow down. And I'm just curious as to what their inventory is with regard to being able to sustain a cessation in consumption based upon the service intensity.","Jose Bayardo","Bill, I'll first chime in and say that, Yes, it was across the board a slowdown, but the new capital equipment piece was certainly a higher percentage than what happens related to the ongoing consumable portion of the business. But really what you're raising is a really good point related to how sustainable is their ability to sort of postpone the inevitable, which is really taking care of a large equipment fleet that gets used day-in and day-out out in the field and -- our service customers can certainly slam on the brakes and screech just about everything to a halt for a period of time, but to some extent, you're delaying the inevitable, right.","You continue to take care of the equipment. If North America oil and gas operators want to continue to see efficiency improvements in operations day to day, whether that's fewer days to drill, more stage count each and every day, customers have to take care of their equipment. I don't want to imply to you that our customers are not taking care of their equipment and setting themselves up for issues, but what I am implying is that you can delay things for a limited period of time before that catches up to you.","Okay. And then, Clay, the last one for me. I am a little bit confused by the performance of the offshore related piece and CAPS in Q1, and moreover, the persuasively constructive broad-based narrative that's unfolding during Q1 earnings season about a blossoming in offshore spending. How can you reconcile those two?","Clay Williams","Let me -- let me clarify that. We -- if you go back a couple of quarters, the middle part of 2018, we were saying kind of based upon our near-term order book, we were expecting our offshore businesses within CAPS to bottom probably in Q4.","Bill Herbert","Okay.","Clay Williams","When we got to Q4, if you recall, we said, well, we didn't bottom because we pulled deliveries out of Q1 and made those deliveries before year end. So we sort of depleted the cupboard rolling into the new year. And so the Q1 results that you see now of offshore products within the Completion & Production Solutions group reflect that.","Yes, we're well aware of the sort of blossoming narrative out there, the rising level of optimism in the offshore around operators moving forward with FIDs and offshore field developments, and we're very excited about that. But it'll take a little time for that to show up in our P&L. We are already seeing the green-shoots of that in the order book in Q1. It just didn't show up as revenue.","Bill Herbert","Okay.","Clay Williams","But, Yes, we agree with kind of what I think is growing conventional wisdom out there that the offshore is finally starting to come back, and we're also seeing that clearly in our Rig Technologies area where we're now working on 20 rigs, for instance, that are -- that were stacked that are being reactivated to tender on this growing body of work. So I hope -- I hope nothing that we've presented is out of line with that improvement in offshore that we see, but that's kind of where we are right now.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Kurt Hallead with RBC. Your line is open.","Kurt Hallead","Thanks, as always, guys, for all the good info and insights on what's going on in the marketplace and how you're trying to kind of manage through it. I know clearly it's not an easy dynamic. So, Clay, in that context, right, as you kind of go through the process of kind of controlling what you can control and kind of looking at kind of an internal focused dynamic, I just wonder if you could provide some additional insights along the lines of is it facility kind of rationalization, product line rationalization, just some additional insights as to kind of how you might see it evolve as year goes on.","Clay Williams","You bet. I appreciate -- I appreciate the question, Kurt. Yes, I would say two areas of focus. The first and perhaps the most impactful is going to be around the administrative support functions that support our business units. And as you're aware, and probably many listeners are aware, we've long had a very decentralized model where we've sought to very clearly place responsibility and authority in the hands of our business unit and product line leaders and give them a lot of autonomy over how they manage their product lines and their business units globally in exchange for the accountability to earn return on the capital that they manage on behalf of our shareholders.","And I think that's the best way to drive the best performance out of those business units and product lines. And what that is entailed has been an awful lot of functions that go into supporting a business. When we think about different ways to sort of organize ourselves, and I want to be completely clear on this, I think maintaining that decentralization, that sort of entrepreneurial spirit among our business unit leaders is critical. But the various functions that support those businesses, some are more strategic than others.","And so we sort of prioritize those areas like sales, manufacturing, operations, engineering and support of those product lines I think is critical remain in the hands of our business unit leaders that we rely on to drive returns out of those businesses. But other administrative functions perhaps there's a better way. And so this next round of cost savings is likely to involve a reexamination of those support functions. How centralized are we? Can we use more shared service models around the globe to support these businesses? And we expect that to drive some level of cost savings. So that's kind of the -- that's kind of a first area.","The second area is within the business units themselves, numbers are still not at the margin levels that they need to be at and they've renewed their focus on reducing their costs and efficiencies. I think Jose touched on a couple specific business units in Wellbore Technologies and elsewhere that are really looking hard at how they manufacture, where they manufacture that sort of thing. So that's going on down kind of more in the business units, and we also expect that to be fruitful. So it's really both of those things.","With respect to facilities closures, we -- through the downturn, we've closed over 400 facilities. We closed 14 facilities in the fourth quarter. We closed 12 in the first quarter. We have -- I expect we'll have some follow-on facilities closures as well, but I think those kind of first two areas, the administrative functions and how we're organized and then the actual cost of goods sold, cost structures in our business units are kind of the main two areas that we're looking at.","Kurt Hallead","That's great. Thanks for that, Clay. And maybe if I can have one additional follow up on that. Seen in the context of your guidance you provided for the second quarter, the highest growth rate coming in Completion & Production Systems. I heard your commentary about the dynamics at play with the U.S. service companies, frac service companies kind of squeezing on CapEx and everything else. So on the very, very near term basis, when you're looking at 15% growth rate, what is the primary or what are the few primary drivers of that rebound that you expect to see in the second quarter?","Clay Williams","Well, the short answer is the 1.4 times book to bill gives us more confidence. It did -- a lot of that -- more than half of that came in -- or about half of that came in March. And so we have a fair amount of confidence around the second quarter guidance. And so that's the answer for that.","Kurt Hallead","Any specific kind of product areas? Was it the fiber glass that's driving it? Is it the coiled tubing that's driving that? Just maybe some additional insights on it.","Clay Williams","Really, Kurt, it's almost equal across the board. So Q1 was a little bit of a perfect storm, right. We had a lot of the offshore businesses still reaching for bottom and then we had this huge wave of capital austerity hit the North American service company marketplace before international markets had really set their budgets and gotten prepared to get back to work. So, as it relates to Q2, we see all three of those legs of the stool sort of picking back up and contributing to that top line growth.","I think a lot of operators across the oilfield, when oil was trading down so hard late November and into December just sort of put the brakes on all buying, and then -- in lockstep, and then January, February it remained pretty muted. As oil prices have recovered, I think that's led to more purchase orders from lots of different corners of the globe coming in just generally.","The only real exception to that, or at least the one that I can think of right now might be North American land drillers which they actually continued to slow through February and March and into April. But most of the other parts of the oilfield it felt like people are kind of getting back to work.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Sean Meakim with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.","Sean Meakim","So, Clay, maybe to start out, I was thinking about the relatively shorter cycle businesses, so Wellbore and CAPS, the decrementals in the first quarter were more severe than the incrementals that you're guiding, and you're guiding toward what seems like the low end of what you've been targeting this cycle as far as incrementals. It'd be great just to get a little more insight, what are you learning about this cycle in terms of how the operating leverage is working for those businesses as we -- you already did, say, 4 to 6 quarters ago. It'd be great to get little more insight into how you're thinking about that.","Clay Williams","Well, Wellbore here in -- the high decrementals around the 9% sequential decline, 49% decremental, first we guided to I think 40% or low-40% range. So it was a little higher than we guided to. Half of the top line decline came out of the drill pipe business which historically has been a high leverage business, number one. Number two, we are under more pricing pressure in Wellbore Technologies and certain product lines, particularly downhole tools, that took a toll. And I would add to that, I think some of our solids control products were under more pricing pressure as well. We had a project wrap up in South America that took a toll on decrementals.","We also have a phenomenon, and this isn't news to us, but when you do have a slowdown in activity, rental tools that have been out in the field working and generating revenue, they come back to the shop. And we spend a little money taking those apart and seeing what's damaged and replacing things and fixing them and getting tuned up to go back out again. So your expenses actually go up. So that little corner of our business has always had sort of high incrementals and decrementals.","In terms of what I have learned, I've learned that when you have to face rising steel cost because of steel tariffs, it's tough to claw that back in pricing and gets doubly tough when oil declines to $45 a barrel in Q4. And so I think we're passing through some choppiness, some cost challenges, things like that, that we're having to deal with. But, look, our entire team has spent our entire career in oilfield services. I don't think there's anything new here we hadn't seen before.","The other thing too, Sean, I would say our Completion & Production Solutions business, there are consumables and aftermarket embedded in that, but I think that's still mostly capital equipment kind of business and as we've characterized in the past, more of an offshore products business.","Jose Bayardo","And Sean, other thing I'd add related to the -- related to CAP segment and the decrementals that you saw there is obviously really as it relates to both those segments, volumes fell harder than anticipated and that obviously contributed to generating a higher decremental. But within the CAP segment, as I just previously mentioned, we had a little bit of a perfect storm and Q4 was obviously a good quarter across the board. We had a pull forward and sort of an extension of what we expected related to a bottoming of the offshore components of the business that were somewhat to some extent relying on some offshore bookings that were booked at a better portion of the cycle.","And so it's kind of good news, bad news. Bad news is the decrementals that you saw this quarter. The good news from our standpoint is that from this point forward, most of the businesses should be moving in a similar direction, and we should -- and we're a lot more confident about the ability to predictably generate incrementals that are more in the upper 20s to lower to mid-30s for that segment.","Up to this point in time, we've had -- since the bottom of the down cycle, we've had North American-centric businesses improving on the bottom -- off the bottom, while the offshore was still bottoming out at pretty high decrementals. So we're finally at the point to where we think everything has found a bottom, and we should have most businesses aligned in the same direction.","Sean Meakim","Got it. I think both of those comments were insightful. I appreciate that. Similar I suppose, preannouncements aren't common in your history, which I guess is probably in contrast to many of your customers in our coverage. So as this -- as you've made a concerted effort to move toward a shorter cycle portfolio, you're going -- you're trying to skate to where the puck's going. Does this make the overall business harder to forecast? Or how do you think about how that facet of your job has been changing this cycle as the portfolio has shifted?","Clay Williams","Well, first, as you know, we have a very diverse portfolio both across products and consumables and aftermarket and spare parts and sectors of the industry we provide; and secondly, geographically around the globe. But what I'd -- what I'd say is, it's rare to have a 19% sequential decline in revenue. And I think Jose made this point earlier, the just evaporation of orders from North American pressure pumpers, as well as the bottoming of offshore backlog for us in the same quarter was kind of the double whammy in terms of the big picture here.","But as you're well aware, NOV is the leading provider of capital equipment and aftermarket support in most of the individual oilfield service verticals that do most of the well construction activity globally. So oilfield activities are highly cyclical business. It's never been easy to forecast, but this was a particularly sharp decline coming after the quarter in which we saw a particularly sharp decline in crude prices, in fact one of the steepest declines on record I think. So I think those two things are really linked together, and hopefully we'll see more stability going forward.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Chase Mulvehill","Hey. So I guess question on the cost savings, in your guidance, are you able -- in 2Q, are you going to see a benefit from cost savings or is that kind of more in the back half of the year in 2020?","Clay Williams","It's going to take three or four quarters. As we mentioned it's a more of structural sort of thing and a heavier lift. And so I think realistically this is going to take three or four quarters to unfold. We do expect to start to see a little bit of that in Q2, and I think that's baked in Jose's guidance. But it's going to take a little while to unfold.","Chase Mulvehill","Can you talk a little bit about the cost savings, which segments -- it sounds like it's kind of turning to a little bit more outsourcing on the supply chain. Just a little bit more color would be helpful.","Clay Williams","Not really outsourcing on the supply chain, but again more -- what I'd say is more administrative support of our various business units and product lines globally. So we operate through 14 business units in 66 countries, and there's a lot of sort of overhead that goes along with that. And as volumes -- we're making good progress on the recovery. We had 10 quarters since the beginning of 2016 where we saw rising revenues, rising profitability, moving toward recovery. For us, this quarter was a signal that, hey, that maybe a little further out than we would like, and we really need to roll up our sleeves and get back to taking a hard look at the administrative support of our business units.","In terms of outsourcing or supply chain, again, I think there will be some changes there, but by and large, I view that as a strategic function that we'll continue to have a lot of oversight from our operations, but along with other manufacturing, engineering, that's more strategic functions that I mentioned earlier. But we do think this is a right thing to do for the Company at this point in time and it's complicated. It's a heavy lift. It's painful, but necessary.","Chase Mulvehill","Helpful color. Last one. Just on the aftermarket in the Rig Tech segment, could you maybe just talk to the 2019 outlook and what kind of growth you expect? I think you said it was 54% of revenues. If we look at that kind of on a year-over-year basis just maybe kind of guide us to kind of how you're thinking about that from a growth perspective?","Clay Williams","Yes. I think -- I don't know this precisely. I think it was up high-single digits or maybe low-double digits year-on-year, although it was down sequentially, which it always is seasonally. A lot of our customers in the fourth quarter wrap up equipment repair, refurbishment activities and then they kind of restart in Q1 with new budgets. So we also saw in the first quarter which is very encouraging the highest level of spare parts bookings that we've seen since I think early 2015, and it had a little more of an offshore flavor to it and it was I think tied to this phenomenon that I described earlier about more offshore rigs going back to work and replenishing stocks of spare parts.","So if the narrative that we think we're seeing out there of more offshore projects being FID'd, more offshore drilling under way, more rigs readying themselves to bid into that continues, I think we're going to continue to see more growth in aftermarket demand to support those activities by our customers. And again, with largest installed base in offshore rig equipment out there, I think it's really well positioned and we're enhancing the value that we add into those activities utilizing these digital products that we've been working on.","So, we're -- a lot of these rigs that we've built over the past few years are instrumented for condition-based monitoring, and we're actually discovering as we're going through rig reactivation activities with our customers, the ability to have experts around the world monitor what's going on, on the rig as systems are restarted that's a big plus. And so again, we've been steadily quietly investing in our aftermarket capability. And I think as the industry gets back to work offshore and there's more drilling, we'll certainly be a beneficiary of that.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","James West","So Clay and Jose, if we think about North America is not going away, it's going to churn equipment. We know there's a lot of structural equipment in quick cycle business, international better, offshore better. Can you remind us roughly of the buckets of kind of revenue or earnings that are generated by those three because I think there's some disinformation out there that you're only supplying frac spreads into the U.S. market?","Clay Williams","Yes. Let's disabuse everyone of that notion.","James West","Right.","Clay Williams","Yes. Let's disabuse everyone of that notion. We sell well intervention and stimulation equipment globally. So, Yes, in the first quarter our mix was 66% land and 34% offshore, and in our first quarter revenues was 45% North America and 55% international on a consolidated basis. Is that what you're ...","James West","Okay. That's exactly what I'm looking for, Yes.","Clay Williams","Yes.","James West","Okay. That's exactly what I'm looking for, Yes. Yes, I think that's a good point to hammer home because the estimates have probably dropped too far, especially if 1Q was a perfect storm as Jose alluded to. I think secondarily, maybe it's a broader topic and it's been asked a couple different ways so far, but I get the decentralization. We do live in a different world now for spending on equipment and capital disciplined type world, but we're going to need equipment. Do you need to do -- outside of the cost savings, you talked about some facility closures here and there? Does there need to be a bigger strategic review of your global operations?","Clay Williams","In terms of a strategic review, what I would tell you is that we're always going through our portfolio of businesses. We've had a divestiture last year. We're in the process of looking, and I think we're close to divesting other smaller businesses.","James, you've heard us talk before when it comes to acquiring businesses needs to be a better owner and that's kind of something that we look for. How can NOV bring more value to that enterprise and be a better owner of it? Likewise, the businesses that we do own that are not earning good returns on the capital we have invested in them, I think we have an obligation to divest those businesses. And so we do periodically kind of look at their performance and have made some divestitures, and I would expect that we would -- that we would continue to.","But in terms of our overarching, NOV as the leading provider of capital equipment to oilfield services, I like where we're at. We went through a detailed review of the strategic and competitive advantage implications of that positioning in the oilfield. And I think the differentiated model that we operate here at NOV is unique and it's compelling. I think it's incredibly hard to replicate by others. And although -- and I would add too, we also highlighted that it's perhaps a little more volatile than others in the oilfield because of the nature of what we do. I think we saw a little bit of that in the first quarter, but in the long run I think this is a great way to earn a good return on our shareholders' capital.","James West","That's great to hear. Okay. Thanks, Clay. Just so you know, on our metrics, our proprietary metrics, you rank the best of the entire oilfield service group on shareholder alignment.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our Q&A session for today. I would like to turn the call back to Clay Williams for his final remarks.","A - Clay Williams","Thank you, Carmen, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We look forward to updating you on our actual second quarter results on our call in July. Have a great day.","Operator","And with that, ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program.

Now, let me turn the call over to Clay.","Clay Williams","Thank you, Loren, and welcome everyone to National Oilwell Varco\u2019s fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. This morning, we announced that the company earned $1.39 per fully diluted share in its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2014. Excluding transaction in asset impairment charges, earnings were record $1.69 per fully diluted share, increased 4% sequentially and 13% year-over-year.","Fourth quarter revenues were $5.7 billion, up 2% sequentially and up 8% year-over-year. Fourth quarter EBITDA excluding other items was $1.2 billion or 21.3% of sales. EBITDA on this basis improved 1% sequentially and 8% year-over-year. For the full year 2014, GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were $5.82. Excluding other items in impairment charges, earnings were a record $6.07 per fully diluted share, up 12% from the prior year.","EBITDA for the year excluding other items in impairment charges was record $4.6 billion, up 14% from the prior year on the same basis. Looking forward, we obviously face some significant challenges in the markets that we serve and we will be discussing these through the next hour. But first, I want to take a moment and reflect on the company\u2019s accomplishments in 2014 and say thanks to the world\u2019s best oilfield services team.","NOV completed the spinout of our distribution services business to our shareholders as now Inc. in May, which led us to reorganize our remaining business along four new reporting segments and promote several executives and into new leadership positions. Our new segment architecture is around customer access which opened up new strategic possibilities for us. So our leadership teams spent the summer developing long-term strategies for each business. We presented these at our first Investor Day in November, where we also laid out ambitious five year goals. 2014 also saw us announce a large increase in our dividend, lifting our payout ratio to within a range of 30% as well as the authorization of $3 billion stock buyback. Given the pace of change here through 2014, it would have been easy that has been distracted. I think the pace of change here makes NOVs 2014 record results doubly impressive. We had several business units post record annual and record quarterly results in 2014.","I would like to express my gratitude to every one of our 60,000 employees and continue to execute exceptionally well on behalf of our customers, despite all these changes deliver great financial results for our shareholders. Thank you. As we look forward, we face a tough market with oil prices down more than 50% our customers are quickly cutting spending and a downturn we face will be severe in 2015 and possibly beyond. Drilling activity is falling sharply in our visibilities limited. The industry point itself in this downturn, we believe because rapidly growing North American oil supply coupled with slowing demand in the OECD, slowing demand growth in China and other emerging economies and a strong U.S. dollar our contributed to our supply demand in balance for oil like last year.","With regards to slow oil demand in Europe and emerging economies significantly lower energy cost rate meaningful wide spread economic stimulus, as economies in Europe and Asia eventually strengthen low oil prices in rising economic activity will spur oil demand growth from these regions. Secondly, we do not believe the global excess production capacity is excessive by historical standards. We do not face the kind of structural global overhang the industry faced in 1986 when Saudi Arabian production have been prepare down to that 4 million barrels of oil per day as fair global oil capacity exceeded 15% of demand. We believe this downturn will be more like 2002 or 2009. Both prior instances recovery came within about two years.","Third, we believe the recent swing source of incremental global oil supply is coming from North American shales. The production type curve from these basins exhibit extraordinarily steep decline rates, which is well documented across thousands of wells in multiple share basins. New share reservoirs exhibit perhaps the highest natural decline rates for many major source of oil and the industries modern history. We see North American shale drilling slowing dramatically and quickly seen the rate of new shale wells coming online will decline and 4 million barrels of oil per day from U.S. shales within begin to decline will decline steeply. We believe this could lead to modest oil price recoveries early is late 2015, however we expect shale production to continue to grow to the first half of 2015 before begins to fall as remaining inventory of Wellbore is completed in brought online, which means recovery once it arise maybe a slower drive higher despite the steep decline curve behavior shale oil.","So in summary of significant oil demand component to be in balance driven by macroeconomic conditions, lower oil cost contributing to eventual economic recovery, a major source of supply from extraordinarily high decline curve reservoirs and a sharp drilling reduction response from the oil industry a pretty good set of ingredients with which to bake an oil price recovery scenario. Nevertheless, we acknowledge many factors to keep oil prices down for longer deteriorating global economic conditions continued strengthening of U.S. dollar for the returned market of oil concerned sideline countries are a few that come to mind. However, given the speed at which we see drilling activities slowing, it is very difficult to for us to imagine that we were not see a significant oil supply response relatively soon. We don\u2019t believe the world can sustainably grow its oil supply with prices below $80 \u2013 $75 of barrel and with prices below $60 oil production will begin to contract, since oil supply growth will eventually the required some point of few substance reason oil prices most eventually cycle backed up about $75 over the long run.","Given our short-term lack of visibility into the timing of the recovery, our approach to 2015 will be to focus on what we can control. We plan to manage NOV to the market quarter-to-quarter and few of near term orders and activity while we steadily reduced cost as utilization levels permit, while also continuing to advance the long-term strategic goals we outline that our Investor Day.","We will manage to the realities of the markets we serve, but we plan to emerge from the cyclical downturn a better company achieving new higher levels of operational excellence. The record fourth quarter results that we just announced reflect very little of the impending downturn, in fact many of our operations spent the fourth quarter, working three shifts, 24x7 to meet our delivery obligations.","Through 2014, we shipped record levels of top drives, [indiscernible] fiberglass pipe, jacking systems and numerous other products. In January, we did begin to see the drop in activity affecting our operations in a more widespread way, most acutely in Wellbore Technologies, but really all segment seeing some impact. In view the challenges ahead, we are beginning to bring working from our suppliers to keep our own facilities better loaded. So for instance right now, 52% of our machining requirements within Rig Systems in aftermarket are outsourced as work declines we will be repositioning some of that work into our own facilities.","We\u2019re examining opportunities to consolidate facilities were possible and we are working with our suppliers to improve efficiencies and cost as our customers process for cost savings for their supply chains. I have tremendous confidence in the NOV team\u2019s ability to manage through the downturn and reduced costs. Although, we had new leadership and new positions throughout our new organization, I\u2019ll stress that these measures are not new to NOV nor are they new to the industry or to cyclical downturns. I might count this will be the sixth cyclical downturn we have faced through our carriers.","Unfortunately despite our cost reduction measures, we will nevertheless expect to see steep decrementals through 2015 as pricing pressure and low absorption on lower volumes will pressure margins. Orders for all our products had slowed sharply. Offshore land drilling completion and production, customers are delaying purchases of both capital and consumables wherever possible seeking to conserve cash in the phase of market uncertainty. We soon expect to see our customers behind to cannibalize existing equipment for capital components.","For instance, full of top drives often idle rig within their fleet rather than placed a new order for a new one with NOV. In order to keep another contracted rig in need for the top drive working. Our customers will rate the spares inventory from their idle rigs to support those that are contracted and contributing and continuing to work rather than place (indiscernible) with us. They will redirect drill pipe, bids, jars, shakers and other kit rather than placed new orders with us.","History teaches us to expect this behavior to continue for at least the next couple of quarters meaning orders will continue to be slow and our book-to-bill and Rig Systems well below one. However, this behavior is not sustainable over the long-term. Drilling consumes rigs much like driving consumes your automobile. The rate of consumption of capital equipment and consumables is declining with drilling activity with customer spending always seems to overreact through cyclical downturns by living off their inventory and postponing maintenance and upgrades wherever they can.","That only worked for so long. Maintenance and upgrades can be deferred, but cannot be postponed indefinitely for drilling rigs, so demand will return. In the past, this behavior has fuel demand surges for the kit NOV provides. Our markets changed quickly in both directions. Also we see drilling contractors continuing to upgrade their rigs to meet contractual requirements or simply differentiate the rigs and rise to offer the most efficient drilling rigs. There remains interest if only academic for the time being and what the next big thing is for drilling, configurable drill force, closed-loop automated drilling systems, automated pipe tailing and stand transfer of vehicles for land rigs, retrievable subsea BOP pods, low cost midwater floater designs concepts which NOV continues to advance in accordance with our 10 year goals.","Offshore, we are seeing customers defer some of their SPS survey work, although our total volume of SPS was continues to rise. As we\u2019ve described in the past, offshore rigs are required to undergo shipyard surveys and obtain OEM certificates of compliance and activity called a special periodic survey or SPS. To maintain their class designations and be qualified to drill in those markets. In an $80 oil world, contractors will proceed with the SPS on an uncontracted rig to ensure it is qualified for any potential contract which may rise which would require a pressing spud date.","In a $50 oil world, contractors are incrementally less willing to invest in the SPS for an uncontracted rig. If you are more willing to forego the possibility of missing a quick spud date contract, as an aside on note that when the recovery comes to the offshore drilling market shipyard capacity to execute SPS has may become a very scarce resource, and the $50 oil-well contractors become much more circumspect about all investments in older rigs. We expect to see even more rig retirements, both land and offshore both announced and unannounced in addition to those that we\u2019ve seen already. This phenomenon has been witnessed in every category of drilling rigs passing through periodic cyclical downturns and incrementally contributes to better supply demand balance for the fleets.","Rig Systems post the new orders of $470 million, or a book-to-bill just 21% reflecting to customer mindset I just discussed. This resulted in a Rig Systems backlog the $12.5 billion to start 2015. This is high backlog for NOV by historical standards 16% higher than we carried into the 2009 downturn coincidence. We expected to partly but not fully litigate the effect of lower orders to 2015 on day-to-day operations in Rig Systems. We perceive revenue had a backlog remaining strong through the first quarter 2015 north of $2 billion, but beginning to decline modestly in the second quarter more steeply in the third and fourth quarters of 2015. Our 2015 orders will be slow we do continue to see modest demand for certain markets, but 20,000 psi deepwater, Middle-Eastern land markets, Mexico and Argentina.","Order for Completion & Production Solutions did better for the fourth quarter posting a book-to-bill of 60% on $469 million in orders, which resulted in a backlog of $1.8 billion to start 2015. On the production side we continue to advance discussions around some large FPSO projects in spite of the low oil prices. In fact, the downturn in the troubled offshore project execution performance by the majors in NOCs has opened the door to new ideas amongst our large E&P customers. This growing interests around doing this differently in deepwater developments to drive lower cost, reflecting lots of invitations from majors to discuss our modular approach to vessels construction to bring modern supply chain management techniques to bear to produce better results.","Necessity is the mother of invention in this market is wide open to new approaches. Our new approach is to offer tightly integrated package of NOV kit, to minimize the interface conflicts brought about by the fragmented supply chain approach currently used to build these vessels. We see to recycle designs in avoid reinventing the wheel for each new vessel, which inevitably leads to unplanned manufacturing cost and delays. NOV as a tremendous track record of success and brining this modular package approach to the construction of offshore drilling rigs through the last decade. Our extensive experience in working closely with shipyards to execute, install and commission these complex construction projects, uniquely positions NOV to help the industry pioneer our better way.","Although the large integrated package FPSO order for NOV is still a way to way, we\u2019ve made great progress in securing customer buy into our new approach on two specific FPSO projects, which we ultimately expected turn into firm orders, perhaps, as early as late 2015. For both Rig Systems in Completion & Production Solution segments, we are glad to be able to carry strong backlogs into this downturn. Except for minor exceptions the firm contracts governing our backlog projects do not permit cancellation for convenience. In 2009, we saw about 4% of our backlog if operate not really from cancellations, but rather from customer payment defaults. We expect the vast majority of our current backlog to be executed in accordance with the agreed terms, like we experienced six years ago.","In certain instances, we are considering customer request for delivery delays which can help us better manage cost in our currently stretch supply chain. We generally we expect to continue to all time execution of our backlog to continue. Our 2009, stress test provides good empirical evidence this outlook. Our 22 Brazil Atlas Project floating rigs constitute about $3.5 billion of our backlog. We are head on progress payments on each of these projects, meaning we are collective more and we had invested in the inventory delivered on these as plan as we continue to fabricate components. We will begin installations and commissioning operation soon in our commencing rise our manufacturing in Brazil currently.","Generally progress has been steady but a little slower than originally plan which is not surprised, while we have had some payment delays with some of our Brazilian shipyard customers will building out there new shipyard facilities we are confident and a successful completion of these rigs, due to the financing package provided to Sete the shipyards customers. By the Brazilian development bank and consortium of banks, a few weeks ago to fund the next 18 months of construction. Additionally the shipyards of agent partners, who are in some instances providing additional capital to complete the construction of their facilities. The country of Brazil is all in on this and the rigs will be completed successfully. Like I said earlier, NOV will emerge from this downturn a stronger and better company. We are continuing to advance new technologies like closed loop automated drilling, which is significantly improved drilling performance through several pilot programs.","Other innovations like our WaterWolf oil recovery system for produced waters, thermal cutting absorption technologies, tundra max mud coolers, automated pipe handling equipment for land rigs and retrievable parts for subsea BOPs will continue to make the oilfield safer and more productive. We have a strong balance sheet to help weather this downturn. We are seeking to invest opportunistically through this downturn.","We continue to pursue our singles and doubles acquisition strategy, which improves our capabilities and global reach in our technology portfolio. We have seven letters of intent in place and probably triple that in potential prospects. We also began investing in a share repurchase program during the fourth quarter. Today, we have repurchased over 11.6 million shares of NOV for $779 million, which is a 2.7% reduction in our share count. Thus far, we\u2019ve been able to accomplish this using cash on our balance sheet, which we\u2019ve been able to repatriate from overseas locations.","A $2.2 billion remaining on our current authorization, we plan to continue to repurchase NOV shares through the downturn including if necessary using modest levels of debt from time-to-time to bridge to the next opportunity to repatriate cash from overseas. Importantly, we acknowledged at our recent Investor Day that this is a cyclical business and once or twice every decade, oil has a commodity tests it\u2019s microeconomic variable cash cost floor of the marginal barrel. Incenting our long-term strategy, we intentionally look through the cyclical downturn for entrepreneurially focused on actionable opportunities that we see ahead.","My sixth cyclical downturn has not dissuaded me from the basic pieces we outlined in November in line with ExxonMobil\u2019s outlook 2014 study that the world\u2019s population will grow from $7 billion to $9 billion by the year 2040, economic growth will continue, standards of living will rise, oil and gas production will grow from a combination of shales and deepwater to fueled the world\u2019s appetite for energy and a better life.","Specifically, the Exxon stake holds for 25% growth in oil and 65% growth in gas through the next 25 years. In the near-term, the E&P industry will sharpen its focus on improving economic efficiency and marginal cost for production of oil from all sources of oil has always done and as the leading provider of innovation and technology and industrial capability to this critical entrepreneurial industry, National Oilwell Varco will play a key role and making that happen and emerged better position for the inevitable upturn.","With that, let me turn it over to Jeremy to take you through our fourth quarter and outlook. Jeremy?","Jeremy Thigpen","Thanks, Clay. Since Clay already covered the consolidated results, I\u2019ll just dive straight into our segment operating performance for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014. And then attempt to provide little color on the outlook for 2015. The Rig Systems segment generated quarterly revenues of $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter, down 4% from a record third quarter as revenue added backlog on offshore projects was not quite a strong sequentially. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, Rig Systems revenues were up 7%, due to heightened demand for high-spec land rigs and equipment and our recent capacity additions, which have enabled us to convert more revenue out of backlog over the prior year.","Operating profit for the segment was $511 million and operating margins were 20%, which were flat with the previous quarter despite the 4% sequential decline in revenue and up 90 basis points from the prior year. Fourth quarter EBITDA for the segment was $534 million or 20.9% of sales. For the full year of 2014, Rig Systems posted record revenues of $9.8 billion, up 16.5% over 2013 and produced operating profit of almost $2 billion or 20.3% of sales, which resulted in year-over-year flow through or leverage of 27%.","Now let\u2019s transition to the capital equipment orders for our Rig Systems segment for the fourth quarter of 2014 and our resulting backlog. In the quarter, we recognized $2.3 billion of revenue out of backlog and captured $470 million in new orders resulting in a quarter-ending backlog of $12.5 billion.","In the quarter, we secured three each drilling equipment packages for jack-ups, five each land rigs and it\u2019s mattering of offshore line components. Of the total $12.5 billion in quarter ending backlog, approximately 91% is offshore and 91% adjusting for international markets. The rig asset market segment posted record revenues of $850 million in the fourth quarter 2014, up 2% sequentially and a 12% over the fourth quarter of 2013, as a large in growing installed base of equipment, combined with the investments that we have made in additional personnel, training, global infrastructure and inventory have resulted in solid growth.","Operating profit for the segment was $245 million or 28.8% of revenue, that\u2019s up 140 basis points sequentially and a 300 basis points from the year or more favorable mix, with the higher percentage of high margin service board and then unseasonably lower percentage of lower margin retail work. For the quarter EBITDA for the segment was $252 million, or 29.6% of revenue. For the full year 2014, Rig Aftermarket posted the record revenues of $3.2 billion, or 19.7% over 2013 and produced operating profit of $882 million, or 27.4% of sales, which represented 29% leverage on the incremental revenue. The Wellbore Technologies segment posted record revenues of $1.5 billion, up 4% sequentially and at 11.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2013.","In the quarter several businesses including our drilling invention formally down hole, our Grant Prideco drill pipe, our IntelliServ wired pipe and our well site services businesses delivered record or near record results for customer revenue, which explains both the sequential and year-over-year increases. Operating profit for the segment was $276 million or 18.1% of sales down 80 basis points sequentially, but up 20 basis points over the prior year. Despite sequential decline in margin was expected, as the holidays invariably lead to under absorption and our manufacturing and service facilities. For the quarter, EBITDA for the segment was $387 million, or 25.3% of sales. For the full year 2014, Wellbore Technologies posted record revenues of $5.7 billion, up 12% over 2013, a produced operating profit of $1 billion or 18.3% of sales, which represented 31% leverage on the incremental revenues.","The Completion & Production Solution segment generated revenues of $1.3 billion, up 11% sequentially in up 15% from the fourth quarter of 2013. On a sequential basis, the revenue growth was driven by strong deliveries of intervention and stimulation equipment, which were up 24% and floating production equipment which is up 29%. As lower solid sales in fiberglass systems and subsea production equipment, on a year-over-year basis most businesses within the segment delivered low to mid-teens percentage growth with the exception of our intervention and stimulation equipment business, which posted a 40% gain over the fourth quarter of 2015. Operating profit for the segment was $215 million or 16.2% of revenues, which was up 80 basis points from the third quarter of 2014, and 30 basis points from the third quarter up to \u2013 up from the fourth quarter of 2013.","Fourth quarter EBITDA for the segment was $273 million, or 20.6% of sales. For the full year 2014, the Completion & Production Solution segment posted record revenues of $4.6 billion, up 7.8% over 2013 and produced operating profit of $700 million, or 15.1% of sales. Knowledge transition to the capital equipment orders for our Completion & Production Solution segment. During the quarter, the segment secured $469 million in new orders, which more than offset by record shipments of $776 million out of backlog, resulting in a quarter-ending backlog of $1.8 billion, sequentially orders for production related equipment increase slightly. However, this increase was more than offset by 45% reduction in orders for intervention and stimulation equipment into the North American land market.","Overall is another solid quarter, the market end of a transformative and record breaking year for NOV. So I would say \u2013 I would like to thank each and every member of NOV family for the commitment or focused and hard work in the fourth quarter and throughout 2014. As we move into 2015, is clear with the sharp decline in oil prices will negatively impact our business, while we have some visibility into the first quarter of 2015, our forecast for the balance of the year, it seems to be changing by the day. For the first quarter, we believe the Rig Systems revenues could decline in the high single-digit percentage range and that margins could road on lower margins. Our higher percentage of Brazil related revenue and additional expenses associated with customer requested scheduling changes, with some customers requesting that we slightly delay projects in others actually asking at expedite deliveries.","And from an order perspective, we believe that pace and composition of orders could look somewhat similar to the pace and composition of orders that we received in the fourth quarter of 2014. However, continued market uncertainty could lead to indefinite delays on some of these expected orders, which could result even lower booking sequentially. For Rig Aftermarket business as we move into the first quarter 2015, we believe that revenues could actually decline slightly for two reasons; number one, our customers clearly started feeling back in the fourth quarter as evidenced by the noticeable reduction in bookings for spare parts and [indiscernible] expendables and two, we are facing significant and raising pricing pressure from our customers, which could leave and probably will lead to some pricing concessions and negatively impact our top-line and our margins.","For Wellbore Technology segment, it\u2019s important to remember that the segment is driven by drilling activity, more rigs drilling more wells and more footage produced more opportunity for the various businesses within Wellbore Technologies. Unfortunately given the precipitous declines in oil prices and the active rig count, our customers are dramatically cutting spending while simultaneously demanding significant discounts.","As such for the first quarter, we believe that Wellbore Technologies segment revenues could decline in the mid-teens percentage range with decrementals in the 50% to 60% range. And finally for our completion and production solution segment, we believe that first quarter 2015 revenues to decline by as much as 25% with decrementals in the mid 30% range as we expect short declines in our higher margin, invention and stimulation equipment business had orders for coiled tubing units and pressure pumping equipment and consumables have virtually disappeared.","Predicting the full year 2015 is impossible in this environment. Still I\u2019ll make a few comments about each segment that are over helpful. At our Analyst Day in November, NOV was $75 of barrels. We included the chart that essentially forecasted a 10% year-over-year revenue decline in our Rig System segment. And in the Q&A session, we specifically stated that despite this 10% decline in revenue, Rig Systems margins could hope barely steady at that 20% range. Unfortunately after watching oil prices plummet below $50 a barrel, our underlying assumption have changed.","In November, we expected about $7 billion to $7.5 billion of our third quarter ending backlog to flow out as revenue in 2015 and we expect the demand for land rigs and for discrete components for both land and offshore to remained strong in the fourth quarter of 2014 and well in the 2015, but is evidenced by the $470 million in fourth quarter 2015 bookings and the recent announcements from our land and offshore drilling customers, the previously expected book in turn revenue in 2015 is now clearly in question.","Additionally as you might expect, we\u2019ve received request some customers to delay specific projects and shipments on select projects, which could ultimately push some revenue out of 2015 and into 2016 and since we may not received the higher margin book in turn orders that we expected and since we may have to juggle manufacturing delivery and installation and commissioning schedules, all of which could add cost. We believe that margins would take down slightly on the additional revenue reduction.","For our rig aftermarket segment, we do not willing to know what to expect on the top-line, however, we know that rig counts are falling in the customers are uncertain about their future prospects and customers are uncertain about their future prospects, they often curtailed spending consume existing inventories, cannibalize underutilized assets and indefinitely postponed upgrades, so when you couple that customer behavior with pricing concessions, we do not expect to see the same mid-teens percentage year-over-year growth that we have come to enjoy in previous years and we believe that margins could grow slightly from 2014 levels.","Because it\u2019s based on drilling activity and because we do not know how quickly or how far the rig count will ultimately fall, forecasting the full year for Wellbore Technology segment is equally challenging. If one wanted to use the 2008 to 2009 timeframe is a proxy for 2014 to 2015, one could predict revenues to fall between 20% and 25% would seek 50% to 60% decremental margins. As a point of reference, Wellbore Technology segment revenues for the full year 2009 excluding non-recurring items were 9.8%.","Obviously a phase with the top-line decline similar to 2008 to 2009, we will make every effort to maximize profitability and improve upon the margins that we posted in 2009. However, it\u2019s important to remember that this segment is already facing substantial pricing pressure and carries a heavy D&A load including manufacturing and service facility infrastructure, sizable rental fleets, and intangibles associated with prior acquisitions that worked together a challenged profitability in the severe downturn.","And finally, our completion and production solutions segment is perhaps the most difficult to forecast due to the fact that supplies both long lead time capital equipment and short cycle consumables to support a very volatile completions market and sometimes frustratingly slow to materialize offshore production market. As we move throughout 2015, we believe that demand for pressure pumping and coiled tubing units will most likely be very soft in the U.S. with pockets of opportunity internationally and we think the demand for floating and subsea production equipment will continue to be lumpy.","But since we are entering the year with a reasonably healthy backlog, we would expect revenues to slightly outperform the decline in the overall market and depending on the suddenness and magnitude of that top-line decline. We believe the decremental leverage for the segment could be between 40% and 50%.","So, 2015 could certainly prove to be challenging, but as Clay stated and as we clearly demonstrated in the past, we remained confident in the ability of this organization to adopt and not just survived, but thrive in a cyclical downturn. So with that let\u2019s turn to some of the remaining elements of National-Oilwell Varco\u2019s consolidated fourth quarter 2014 income statement. Gross margin declined 20 basis points sequentially, but increased 60 basis points year-over-year to 27.1%. For the full year 2014, gross margin also improved 60 basis points to 27.1%. ","SG&A decreased $7 million sequentially but increased $46 million year-over-year, as a percent of revenue. SG&A declined 40 basis points sequentially and increased 10 basis points year-over-year to 9.2%. For the full year 2014, SG&A increased $214 million or 11.7%, but as a percentage of sales SG&A actually declined slightly to 9.5%. Other items which includes the impairment of some indefinite large trade names within our Wellbore Technologies segment as well as loss associated with the sale of a non-core industrial business that was acquired in the Robbins & Myers transaction were $163 million in the quarter.","For the year, other items were $214 million versus $53 million in 2013. Interest expense was flat sequentially at $26 million and interest income increased $1 million to $5 million. As compared to 2013, interest expense decreased $6 million and interest income increased $6 million. Equity income in our Voest-Alpine JV increased $7 million sequentially to $16 million, as the plant was once again fully operational following its annual maintenance in the third quarter. ","Compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, equity income was flat and compared to the full year 2013 equity income declined $5 million to $58 million. For the first quarter and full year 2015, we believe that equity income will fall as demand for drill pipe and therefore green tube will moderate. Other expense for the quarter was $20 million, which represents a $29.9 million delta sequentially but it is more consistent with historical trends.","For the full year, other expense was $32 million versus $30 million in 2013. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 28.1% which was 70 basis points lower than the 28.8% rate that we posted in the third quarter of 2014 and 200 to 300 basis points lower than historical trends and our expectations. Excluding discrete items in the quarter, the company\u2019s effective tax rate would have been close to 30%, therefore as we move into 2015, we believe that 30% to 31% continues to be a realistic estimate of NOV\u2019s effective tax rate. ","If you now quickly turn to the first supplemental schedule, you\u2019ll see that eliminations were $556 million for the quarter, down slightly from $569 million in the third quarter of 2014. Unallocated expenses and eliminations were $229 million for the quarter, down $6 million sequentially on a lower volume of intersegment revenues.","As compared to the full year 2013, eliminations increased 38.6% on higher volumes and unallocated expenses and eliminations increased 31.7%. And finally, if you turn to the last supplemental schedule, you will see that the depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $199 million, up $1 million from the third quarter and $4 million from the previous year. ","For the full depreciation and amortization expense was $778 million, up 5.4% from 2013. EBITDA for the fourth quarter excluding other items was $1.2 billion or 23.3% of sales, for the full year 2014, EBITDA was a record $4.6 billion, up 13.9% from 2013. Turning to the balance sheet, our December 31, 2014 balance sheet employed working capital excluding cash and debt of $5.4 billion, down a $125 million or 2.3% sequentially.","Looking more closely at working capital, accounts receivable decreased $66 million or 1.5% sequentially. Despite the $122 million sequential increase in revenue, inventory declined $183 million, or 3.3% sequentially, as reductions in Rig Systems, Wellbore Technologies and Completion & Production Solutions were partially offset by inventory growth in Rig Aftermarket. ","Also leading to a sequential reduction working capital, accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased a $138 million. Unfortunately, due to the sequential decline in bookings for offshore new builds, cost incurred on major projects significantly outpaced milestone invoicing, which resulted in a $297 million sequential decline in customer financing. For the quarter, the company generated $736 million in cash flow from operations, capital spending for the fourth quarter was $231 million, up almost 38% sequentially due to better than expected progress on several significant ongoing construction projects.","In the quarter, we also invested $110 million in three acquisitions, we made divided payments of $196 million and we spent $779 million repurchase shares. As a result, we ended the fourth quarter of 2014 with a cash balance of $3.5 billion, down $555 million sequentially, but up $100 million from the prior year and we ended the year in a net cash position of $370 million. We were able to make the previously mentioned investments without assuming any incremental debt.","Of the $3.5 billion in cash, almost 16% of the balance was in the U.S. at December 31, 2014. As we move into 2015, we will continue to invest in our 10 year strategies. However, we will do so at a more measured phase than previously envisaged. As a result, we will expect to reduce year-over-year capital spending by 15%.","Now, let me turn it back to Clay.","Clay Williams","Thank you, Jeremy. With that, Loraine, I think we\u2019re ready to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jim Crandell of Cowen. Please go ahead.","Jim Crandell","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Clay Williams","Hi, Jim.","Jeremy Thigpen","Hi, Jim.","Jim Crandell","Clay, you just touched on M&A and you described you and your efforts is mainly continuation of the singles and double strategy which NOV has done very well at over the past 15 years, but you\u2019ve also done very well at the home run strategy and you have a great record of that the last 15 years in order to execute sort of the home run strategy, I think you degree you need to be coactive. What was kind of place in the company\u2019s strategy thus coactively looking for larger acquisitions have at the current time?","Clay Williams","Well, thanks for your time and comments, Jim, we absolutely are continuing to look for larger transactions. Those take much typically take much longer to cultivate and so we have had conversations with a few larger potential counterparties out there. What we generally find is in a declining market, it\u2019s hard to get the [indiscernible] and most of those transactions are better accomplished and you get more agreement between the counterparties is market serve and increasing. So I think until we began start to see a little bit of recovery and a little bit stronger outlook, it\u2019s going to be hard to get bids to come together. But we \u2013 as you know we are always out there looking for opportunities to deploy capital into good return opportunities and recognized at those conversations are long-term investments and so we do have a couple going on now, but nothing \u2013 really nothing to report, we \u2013 I don\u2019t think there is any sort of transaction out there is eminent.","Jim Crandell","Okay. And then my follow-up guide is could you paid on your major businesses in North America and talk about the magnitude of pricing weakness and such things like Tuboscope and Grant Prideco and mission and some of the other important domestic businesses.","Clay Williams","Yeah, I\u2019ll say that our customers are being very aggressive and seems to have the same form letter that they are sending to everyone within the people receive a letter and demanding very high discounts, double digit percentage discounts. We are responding to those by sitting around the table with those customers by product line, nothing that across the board, by product line and discussing ways that we can work together to mutually drive cost out of the system. And so I think buying large every business is handling it individually by customer.","Jeremy Thigpen","Yeah, trying to make lemonade out of lemons were also trying to turn those conversations more towards a volume based rebates, so that we get more volume out of the concessions that we are making things like ideas like that or what we are trying to push forward.","Jim Crandell","Okay, good job guys. Thank you.","Clay Williams","Thank you, Jim.","Jeremy Thigpen","Thank you, Jim.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jud Bailey from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Judson Bailey","Thanks, good morning.","Clay Williams","Good morning.","Judson Bailey","Question on you just kind of think about your revenue out of backlog for this year and trending our margins that Rig Systems understanding your customers and giving you or bombarding with other requests like you said delaying or accelerating. Did you give an exact number on what you think revenue out of backlog could be and then on top of that how quickly can you adjust your cost structure as you at the delayed projects help us think about and you bring your production in-house, how quickly can you preserve margin at Rig Systems?","Clay Williams","Yeah, Jeff, it\u2019s on the \u2013 in the prepared remarks I talked about at the end of Q3 and as we got to our Analyst Day, we actually thought that is about $7 billion to $7.5 billion would flow out of our current backlog and that was the backlog at the end of Q3. We then assume that we get the book in turn in Q4 and throughout 2015 that will take that number up. Given the pace of orders, we think it\u2019s probably going to be close to that $7 billion range in terms of revenue flow, not a backlog this year, based on what we see today. Now we could receive some orders here in the next few months that we can turn into revenue before the end of the year, but right now it\u2019s looking pretty soft. So I think somewhere in that $7 billion range is probably reasonable.","And with regards to the margin, we\u2019re probably a little beyond our optimal kind of efficiency in terms of margin production in the backlog meaning we have more work and we were relying on graveyard shifts and a lot of overtime and kind of third and fourth and five tier suppliers. I think there is some benefit actually as volume start to back off just a little bit, in terms of reducing some overtime of reverting to our hot most productive shifts, reverting to our most productive sub suppliers and so that will help in the margin front, on the margin front, but I would \u2013 and I would add to that too our own suppliers we\u2019re in discussions with about reducing the prices that they charge us. We\u2019re hesitant though to wrap margin improvement around that scenario because no doubt we\u2019re going to continue to see price pressure and in case challenges that are coming out of the current slow market.","Judson Bailey","Okay. And my follow-up is kind of a bigger picture question, when you think about the decline in oil today and people like to reference 2009, but as we stand today, deep water rig rates are coming down much more quickly in general that the backlog for the offshore drillers is much less than that timeframe and there is a probably legitimate discussion that offshore rig grades could go close to catch breakeven. How do you think about Rig Systems and orders over the next two to three years if that happens, and how do you think shipyards will react to the price standpoint. Last time they reduced price, which helped but will it really help if rig rates are at such a depressed level that doesn\u2019t even \u2013 even bother to reduce price, because no one is going to work out anyway. ","Clay Williams","Yeah, I don\u2019t think lower cost or price of rigs delivered is going to catalyze much demand right now and as I said in the opening remarks, our plan is to manage to the market realities kind of quarter-by-quarter. We have a great backlog which will burn off over the next several quarters as we find ourselves to say this time next year, without a resumption in orders in the offshore world, we expect two things to happen, one is our installation and commissioning efforts around the rigs that are being build will continue to strong through 2015 and will end at 2016. As it starts to wind down a little down though, we have good opportunities to hit it and refocus, the technical capabilities of that group and infrastructure that supports that group towards SBS\u2019s which we do see rising in spite of the market challenges, we see opportunities to pivot and refocus that group towards more onshore aftermarket support, I think there is a great potential out there for NOV to build on its franchise in the land side and provide better aftermarket support to those customers, likewise on manufacturing we expect to pivot and refocus in the aftermarket opportunity around that. ","And then secondly that will help a lot, but secondly we\u2019re going to be sizing to what the market dictates. As I also mentioned in my opening comments, we\u2019re outsourcing more than half of our machining work and rig for instance, and so we have a lot of sort of flexible or flexible supply chain that supports our efforts that we can diminish and then thirdly, we\u2019ve got two other big segments that has different cyclical behaviors and so recovery and rig counts in 2016, we do a lot very rapidly with demand by Wellbore Technologies for machining capabilities, for assembly likewise Completion & Production solutions is on a little different cyclical trajectory. So we have \u2013 by having three different segments throughout different cyclical behaviors it gives us an opportunity to refocus resources into places that may need them.","Judson Bailey","Alright, great, I\u2019ll turn it back in appreciate the commentary.","Clay Williams","Yeah, thanks Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Marshall Adkins from Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Marshall Adkins","Hi guys, thank you for all detail, subsector is very helpful. Clay, I want to ask you a bigger picture question, you touched a little bit on it, so far. Typically in downturn you guys went -- in that your strong cash flows and you pursue this M&A strategy. Now it looks like you have the start buybacks going on as well as possibly which you didn\u2019t have before. What make through, how you prioritize and you mentioned M&A is going to become a slow to develop given the bit spread, but how you think about in terms of timing on spinning the excess cash over the next couple of years.","Clay Williams","Well, I think Marshall we came in to this downturn with $4.1 billion of cash on our balance sheet at the beginning of Q4, a lot of credit capacity and expectation that as business loads, we will have cash come out of working capital and half of our balance sheet plus $14.3 billion backlog translates to a pretty significant margin embedded in that backlog, which will turn to cash over the next year or too. So we kind of enter this downturn with a lot of resources and I think what that means is we have the capability to really do all the above and so we have very intentionally stepped up our focus on M&A mostly around the smaller company opportunities because frankly there are more doable in this kind of market downturn.","I think it\u2019s challenging for public company to enter into an agreement so and so if it\u2019s not distressed when the stock prices way below at 52 week high and so makes it difficult to do a larger transaction in this kind of environment. It\u2019s not the sale like I mentioned earlier to Jim, it\u2019s not to say that we\u2019re not continuing conversations and serving landscape out there. But in terms of how we prioritize, I think we can do all the above and do so in a way that it doesn\u2019t sacrifice future flexibility and do so in a way that keeps some cover drive for those opportunities as they rise, so that\u2019s kind of the through process that we\u2019re going through.","Specifically with regard to the share buyback, I mean this is the company we know best, we can buying shares with no purchase premium and we can size those transactions to whatever size we feel comfortable with which is why at our Analyst Day we sort of linked the application of capital through in the share buyback program to the repatriation of cash from overseas.","Marshall Adkins","Okay, just one quick unrelated follow-up, we\u2019re going to see a lot of rig retirements both on land and offshore stacking whether we want to call it. I presume that hurts your aftermarket business, but help me to understand kind of how that close through for all as you retire rigs, I presume that\u2019s a lot less aftermarket stuff, but I\u2019m not sure about that.","Clay Williams","No, that\u2019s exactly correct. The older rigs are less \u2013 far less aftermarket intensive in the net rigs and so that the newer rigs that are coming out of the shipyard now that have come out of the shipyard in the last few years have much higher levels of electronic controls, many, many, many more miles of wiring and cabling and more precision machines components that help them work more efficiently and what we know is it that kind of equipment \u2013 that style of equipment is going to be much more aftermarket intensive than the old rigs are being laid down, so the old rigs, yeah, we\u2019ve got some level of participation really in all rigs. So the old rigs, there is a little bit aftermarket to goes away, but it\u2019s a good trade for us and all things considered with much, much prefer a new rig in terms of its aftermarket potential.","Marshall Adkins","Perfect, thanks guys.","Clay Williams","Thank you, Marshal.","Jeremy Thigpen","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Tillery from Tudor Pickering Holt. Please go ahead.","Jeff Tillery","Hi, good morning.","Clay Williams","Hi, Jeff.","Jeff Tillery","For the rig aftermarket business, could you just provide some qualitative color around the mix at in terms of onshore versus offshore and then the deepwater component, I mean, I think about that the level of business for you guys just tracking kind of working deepwater rig count and trying to think of different ways to forecast the business over the next year.","Clay Williams","Sure, Jeff, obviously [indiscernible] little bit depending on the quarter, but buy in large is about an 80-20 split offshore land.","Jeremy Thigpen","Yeah and which gives us the belief that there is more to do in the land and think longer term there is opportunities to kind of grow that business to focus on the land fleet. The other kind of interesting observation about our aftermarket business is that as our customers are become a lot more focused on their expenditures they are probably going to be more open to repairing old drilling equipment rather than replacing with new drilling equipment. So we think there will be life of instances where rather than selling for instance a new set of draw-works out of Rig Systems that will actually have our rig aftermarket business now fixing an older set of draw-works and getting them back up and running. And so that may actually help the aftermarket business a little later in the year.","Jeff Tillery","Thank you. And then for the Wellbore Technology segment, if I think about the composition of the business today versus 2009, walk us through kind of the puts and takes that would make either the \u201909 comparison valid or something that drive either better or worse decremental performance relative to the \u201909 cycle.","Jeremy Thigpen","Yeah, I think obviously all of the businesses are larger now, but in terms of kind of the percentage of total revenue they are probably fairly similar to the way they were in \u201809. I think the comparison is probably fair, it won\u2019t be exactly that, that will be \u2013 it will be reasonably close I would think, it could be at the market maturity as quickly as it did and as steeply as it did from \u201808 to \u201809 and \u201814 to \u201815.","Clay Williams","Yes, generally there are all very high operating leverage businesses and so it will see \u2013 we\u2019ll feel that as they come back down. Not sure pricing ever got up to the levels we had in \u201808. And of course some of the other oil field service companies referencing that which their point too is limiting, essentially limiting the decrementals, I am probably hesitant to forecast that previous downturns, points of pretty high decrementals in Wellbore Technologies businesses, and we are probably likely to see the same thing in 2015.","Jeremy Thigpen","Just one thing that could be encouraging Jeff is if you think back to \u201808 or \u201909, you\u2019ve had a number of years of steady increases. Here we went through kind of a destocking late \u201812 and throughout \u201813, I am not sure that we actually \u2013 that our customers actually built inventory levels in \u201814 to a degree they did in 2008, so that would suggest hopefully that as the market starts to rebound that demand comes back to us more quickly than it did, just because I don\u2019t think we have the same inventory overhang as we did back in \u201808.","Clay Williams","And our 2012 as well.","Jeff Tillery","It\u2019s very helpful color. Did pricing rode more than 10% in \u201909, I\u2019m trying to think on balance, I still remember 5% to 10% that\u2019s stuck in my head for pricing reductions.","Clay Williams","I actually believe those are probably north of 10% for lot of business\u2026","Jeff Tillery","Okay, thank you.","Clay Williams","Yeah, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question will come from Robin Shoemaker from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Robin Shoemaker","Yeah, thanks a lot. I was wondering if you could update us on the portion of the $12.5 billion of Rig Systems backlog that relates to Brazil and how has this ongoing internal investigation in Petrobras that\u2019s clearly slowed down drilling, how has it affected the pace of rig construction or shipyard construction, the things that you referred to?","Clay Williams","Yeah, thanks Robin. Actually, thankfully for us, it really hasn\u2019t created a big impact on our programs, if you remember back a few years ago, when Petrobras settled this up, they set up a separate financing arm called SESA in Brazil, that is actually the customer and it went out in secured it\u2019s equity partner investors and secured it\u2019s bank financings and kind of and so it sort of moving along separately without virtually \u2013 there is virtually no capital support from Petrobras into those projects to construct the rigs. Where the support comes is in the contracts to operate those rigs once they are delivered and that\u2019s still a couple years out, but based upon SESA placing orders to construct these rigs with their partners, shipyards jumped in the foray and concluding a couple of new shipyards that were constructed for this program and so those have been proceeding long relatively smoothly, that\u2019s not to say without some delays and some issues and some challenges that we fully expected but by and large those projects are moving ahead, we expect the first rig to be delivered I think you Q3 or Q4 this year and the first of 22 rigs that were signed up to deliver and the specific challenges that group of projects in shipyards that faced have been more around cost over runs on the constructions of the shipyards -- that led to a few payment delays for us, working through that and the good news here within the past few weeks, a couple of financing packages have been made available to SESA, I mentioned in my opening comments the development Bank of Brazil, I think the Central Bank is involved, Banco do Brasil and then some of the Asian partners to some of the shipyards are also financing the completion of the construction of those yards. ","So net-net we\u2019re in pretty decent shape, I think important for NOV shareholders is that we are ahead, we received more payments than we had delivered equipment into these projects, and so very important to us that we maintain that position from a risk management. So we are in pretty good shape on this Robin.","Robin Shoemaker","Okay, and on the pricing discussions that you are having with customers and where they are coming to you, just wanted to clarify that that \u2013 does any of that pertain to existing backlog and rig systems or Completion & Production Solutions is or is it entirely on new orders.","Clay Williams","Entirely on new orders and really mostly around kind of the short cycle consumable type item\u2026","Robin Shoemaker","Sure. Okay.","Clay Williams","Alright.","Jeremy Thigpen","Yeah, to the extent that we\u2019re entertaining any changes in the backlog at all it\u2019s usually around just delivery dates like I said we push things just a little bit we can actually save money.","Robin Shoemaker","Right and a reference to my early question, did you want to give a portion of your Rig Systems backlog that pertains to Brazil or\u2026?","Jeremy Thigpen","Yes, $3.5 billion.","Robin Shoemaker","Okay, great.","Jeremy Thigpen","Out of the $12.5 billion is still Atlas projects 22 floating rates.","Robin Shoemaker","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mr. A - Clay Williams for closing remarks.","Clay Williams","Thank you, Loraine and thanks to all of you for joining us and we look forward to meeting with you in April as we update you on the first quarter.","Operator","Thank you.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Loren Singletary, Vice President of Investor and Industry Relations. Mr. Singletary you may begin.","Loren Singletary","Thank you, Don, and welcome everyone to the National Oilwell Varco first quarter 2013 earnings conference call, with me today is Pete Miller, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of National Oilwell Varco, Clay Williams, President and Chief Operating Officer and Jeremy Thigpen, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Later on this call, we will answer your questions which we ask you to limit to two, in order to permit more participation.","Now, I will turn the call over to Pete for his opening comments.","Merrill A. Miller Jr.","Thank you, Loren. Earlier today National Oilwell Varco announced first quarter 2013 earnings of $1.17 per share on revenues $5.31 billion. Included in this there is a pre-tax charge of $73 million per transaction expenses and the Venezuela Boulevard devaluation. Excluding these charges, earnings were $533 million or $1.29 per fully diluted share.","Operating profits for the quarter was $816 million, or 15.4% of sales. Additionally, we announced new capital equipment orders of $3.04 billion, bringing our backlog to a record of $12.9 billion, signifying the industry\u2019s continued preference for National-Oilwell Varco products. The total exceeds our record backlog in Q3 2008 by over $1 billion. I would like to thank all of our customers for their continued confidence in National-Oilwell Varco and to all of our 63,000 employees worldwide for their excellent efforts to meet our customers\u2019 expectations. I would also like to welcome all of the former Robbins & Myers employees to the National-Oilwell Varco family.","Now, I will turn the call over to Clay and Jeremy to expand on our results. Clay?","Clay C. Williams","Thank you, Pete. National-Oilwell Varco faced a challenging quarter in the first quarter. They came in a little softer than we expected. Despite a choppy market in North America, broadly speaking, we remain bullish on demand for offshore rigs, for floating production systems, and for products and services we sell into international land markets including fledgling unconventional shale developments. We had a traffic quarter for new orders for our Rig Technology segment and expect more in the second quarter. However, we\u2019re very cautious about North America and continue to see headwinds here as pricing and volumes remain under pressure, as demand for pressure pumping and drilling equipment remains weak and operators defer expenditures for consumables.","Rig Technology capital equipment orders totaled $3 billion, our second highest quarterly total ever. We received orders for 17 drilling equipment packages for jack-up rigs and 8 drilling equipment packages for floating rigs including 3 for Brazil in the first quarter. We also had a significant increase in orders for FPSO equipment. Our outlook for the second quarter orders remains very strong as well as we expect even more FPSO orders, plus another great quarter for jack-ups. There also remain a half dozen floating rigs for Brazil that we have not yet booked as we away down payments for these. And we see rising interest in land rigs for international markets as new modern rig design are steadily gaining expectance overseas.","Through the first quarter, our very capable teams continue to manage their businesses for the long haul, while keeping an eye on our cost structures and view of near-term softness, it\u2019s an usual time. We have some operations facing declining backlog and P&L pressures brought on by low volumes other safety opposite problem we are overflowing with work and losing efficiency due to congestion and expansion.","Our leaders are doing the heavy listing require to reallocate resources, expand capacity in certain areas, right size others and integrate many new acquisitions making good progress on a solid foundation for future NOV earnings growth and by solid foundation for future earnings growth, I specifically mean we are investing in a combination of CapEx and acquisition capital to further distance ourselves from our competition. Fundamentally, we believe that leading market positions and technology the largest most economically efficient capacity within a particular sector and a deep organizational commitment to the highest levels of service to our customers is a winning formula. That is the vision they and we pursue daily.","Since the beginning of 2009, we had generated $6.9 billion in cash from operations, and raised $3.4 billion in debt financing totaling $10.3 billion in capital generated were raised. We have paid $1.1 billion or 11% to our shareholders in dividends, invested $1.7 billion or 17% internally in capital expenditures and invested $7.4 billion or 72% in acquisitions.","The largest of our acquisition since 2009 is Robbins & Myers which finally closed in the first quarter, it\u2019s strengthened our position in a number of key technologies progressing cavity pumps, flow line, artificial lift and downhole drilling motors just a name of few. This acquisition makes NOV the largest provider of worldwide of enabling required for the drilling and completion of horizontal wells and has a very busy four year period as far as closed 51 acquisitions. We are excited about this aggregate addition of new businesses to NOV including the talented teams that have joined our own.","We\u2019ve expanded our substantial offering into the growing floating production systems world strengthened our market leading oil fuel distribution franchise added leading franchises in the supply technology into unconventional shale developments and strengthened our offering into new technology such as composite Tubulars. Mostly businesses that we are in before is just that now we are bigger and stronger and more capable.","In the near-term however we continue to face market headwinds, all three segments saw sales fall from the fourth quarter as U.S. rig counts drifted down another 3% sequentially and Canadian spending on consumables and production equipment decline even in the face of seasonal increases in rig activity.","North America weighed most heavily on NOVs activity driven businesses, petroleum services and supplies and distribution and transmission with 57% and 83% of sales mix coming from North America respectively.","Sales were down in a low single-digit range for both at high detrimental due to the combination of price discounting and lower volumes which diminish margins. The Rig Technology segment was not immune from North America either as sales of drilling, wire line and stimulation equipment into North America remain low and left our infrastructure of these products come from under absorbed.","Broadly speaking demand across North America is soft and price pressures for products and services continues to intensify. Gradually slowing North American rig counts and scattered reports of falling land rig day rates have some good spending, even high growth regions like the Permian and Eagle Ford are becoming more competitive as labor and assets from competitors slowly migrate into these regions.","However overseas, the picture is much better, demand is up and we are expanding in places like Abu Dhabi, Oman, Dubai, South Africa, Russia, Angola, Brazil and Mexico. Continued deepwater development, application of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracture stimulation to conventional prospects and unconventional shale technologies will provide the basis for future growth overseas and NOV is exceptionally well positioned to capitalize on these opportunities. Our Rig Technologies segment is working through an extraordinarily busy delivery schedule now with offshore rigs, tight the faster hull construction schedules and shipyards and much higher BOP demand Post Macondo. Think replacement BOPs for old stacks that could not be recertified, second BOPs rigs and fleets spare BOP demand, all up sharply since 2010.","To handle the volumes, we have added a fifth and a sixth and now a seventh subsea stack rig up pad in the past couple of years, along with many new machine tools to our primary pressure control product plan. The expansion caused us to have to rearrange what we make where as we poured concrete as to temporarily increase outsourcing, which has been disruptive but necessary to meet the needs of our customers. To put it in perspective, we will nearly double output from our Houston BOP manufacturing plant in 2013. Shipments are expected to be up 83% year-on-year.","This expansion and tight delivery scheduling affected the first quarter in two ways. First, higher over time freight and expediting cost drove unfavorable manufacturing variances for a couple of major components that are included in most rig projects. A cost role across these along with drawworks, mud pumps, late in the first quarter together with higher expediting and INC costs, resulted in a net $32 million and aggregate cost being pushed through our rig construction projects. All of this was booked in the first quarter pursuant to our percentage-of-completion accounting on projects.","Second, discrete start-up costs around this expansion along with start-up cost associated with a huge new flexible pipe plant in Brazil, the expansion of our Bammel road aftermarket facility, top drive manufacturing facility, and other build-outs added and estimated $10 million in start-up cost this quarter, related to the hiring and training of new workforces and operational disruptions. These will continue for a couple of more quarters, but excluding these as well as the effects of the adverse cost role margins for Rig Technology would have been in the mid 22% range, consistent with the fourth quarter of last year.","I know that no better equipment manufacturing team in the world than our professionals who managed this business. They\u2019re always working diligently to reduce costs. For instance, we have concrete steps underway that will reduce BOP costs including design changes for ease of manufacturing and new transportation logistics to cut cost. Elsewhere we are moving other products to lower cost manufacturing geographies in Asia and Latin America.","Finally, Rig Technology first quarter margins were also affected by double digit sequential declines in aftermarket spares and services, following a very busy Q4 last year. We see this as a temporary pause and a strong long-term growth trajectory. In fact, year-over-year aftermarket spares and services for the group increased 11% benefiting from the growing installed base in the NOV rig equipment particularly in the offshore and recent expansion of our aftermarket infrastructure through build outs and acquisitions.","With that let me turn it over to Jeremy.","Jeremy D. Thigpen","Thanks, Clay. National Oilwell Varco generated earnings of $1.17 for fully diluted share in its first quarter of 2013 on $5.3 billion in revenues. Excluding $73 million in pre-tax transaction and devaluation charges, first quarter 2013 earnings were $1.29 per fully diluted share has down 20% or $0.20 per share or 13% from the fourth quarter of 2012 and down $0.15 per share or 10% from the first quarter of 2012. Sales of $5.3 billion declined 7% sequentially that grew 23% year-over-year, despite the fact that the average U.S. rig count declined by almost 12% from Q1 2012 and the worldwide rig count dropped over 5% during that same period.","Excluding transaction charges from all periods, operating profit for the quarter was $816 million down 14% sequentially and down 7% from the first quarter of last year. Operating margins on this basis were 15.4% for the first quarter of 2013 compared to 16.8% for the first quarter of 2012 and 20.5% for the first quarter of last year.","Although the rig count in the U.S. continued to decline and margins for the quarter were somewhat longer than we had initially hoped we\u2019re proud of the work that was done in the first quarter of 2013 and we remain extremely excited about the future prospects for the company.","Turning to our segment operating results. The Rig Technology Group generated revenues of $2.6 billion in the first quarter down 9% sequentially, but up 16% compared to the first quarter of 2012. Operating profit for the segment was $557 million and operating margins were 21.2%, down a 120 basis points from the prior quarter and 320 basis points from the first quarter of 2012.","As you will remember from the Q4 conference call, we indicated that we expected Rig Tech revenues to decline in the 10% range following flush year end shipments and very little demand for pressure pumping and coiled tubing equipment in the U.S, as expected revenues from backlog were down 10% sequentially, and revenues from our pressure pumping and coiled tubing equipment businesses were 46% and 41% respectively. As well service firms continue to utilize existing assets and we\u2019re reluctant to send equipment in for repairs.","Aftermarket revenues also decreased by 12% sequentially with higher revenues from training and installation and commissioning and relative flat spare part sales being more than offset by declines in repair and service revenues which posted exceptionally strong fourth quarter results.","Overall non-backlog revenues declined 6% sequentially. Still we were pleased to receive a partial quarter\u2019s contribution from the Robbins & Myers acquisition, which added $11 million of incremental revenues to Rig Tech, and we were excited to see some material improvement out of our FPSO business which proved revenues 22% sequentially. You\u2019ll also remember from the Q4 conference call that we stated that margins would be challenged to move meaningfully from the 22.4% that we posted in the fourth quarter of 2012, because of three issues. First a relatively soft North American land environment which curtailed capital spending for new well stimulation equipment, which by the way represented 16% of total Rig Tech revenues in Q4 and produces margins that are accretive to overall Rig Tech margins.","Second a growing percentage of FPSO related revenue which generates margins that are currently diluted to overall Rig Tech margins. And third incremental expenses associated with longer term strategic growth initiatives and capacity expansion. Well, issues one and two, which I will describe as product mix, impacted us about as expected, with revenues from well intervention stimulation equipment is declining overall 39% sequentially. And FPSO related revenues increasing 22% over that same period.","This shift in mix is a current drag on Rig Tech margins. But we believe it to be a transient issue. Demand for complete frac spread and coil tubing and it will return in the U.S. And we remain convinced that other countries around the world will ultimately require our technology to access and benefit from their own shale reserves. We also believe that FPSO margins will increase with both volume and our continued migration from a project to a product focus. It\u2019s important to note that the incremental flow through on the 22% sequential increase in this group was 56%.","So while we are not where we want to be at, we feel confident that we are heading in the right direction. Issue three, which I\u2019ll describe as capacity expansion had a greater impact on us than we anticipated. As Clay mentioned, we knew that we would incur some additional expense associated with the start of the new facilities. However, $10 million was a bit higher than we expected. And it\u2019s now clear that we did not fully appreciate the incremental costs tied to the expansion of some of our existing facilities, especially our Houston BOP manufacturing plant, which along with increases in a couple of other major components and higher expediting in I&C cost resulted in the $32 million increase in cost in Q1.","So much like product mix we also believe this to be a transient issue. As many of our expansion projects will be completed this year, enabling us to replace start up cost with efficiency gains. However until those projects are completed we are sticking with our previous guidance for Rig Tech margins to remain in the 22% to 23% range for most of this year.","Now let\u2019s transition to our backlog. As evidenced by the $3 billion in new orders, demand for our technology remains very strong. For the quarter we booked 8 drillships and 17 jackups. We also had a solid quarter of FPSO related orders. And while the overall sentiment for new land rig and pressure pumping and coil tubing equipment in the U.S. seems somewhat muted, we are encouraged by the fact that we still manage to sell several complete land rigs in to the U.S. market as well as some of the fair pieces of equipment to upgrade our customer\u2019s existing fleet.","We also managed to increase our new order booking for well stimulation equipment by 10% sequentially. All of these new orders were partly offset by revenues out of backlog of almost $2 billion and led to a record quarter ending backlog of $12.9 billion, up 9% sequentially and up 25% year-over-year.","Of the total backlog approximately 92% of this is offshore and 92% of this is destined for international markets. We expect for almost $2 billion of revenue to flow at a backlog in the second quarter of 2013 and an additional $3.7 to flow at over Q3 and Q4. Looking into the second quarter of 2013, we expect our orders for new drilling equipment packages for both drillships and jackups to remain strong. We also anticipated strong bookings quarter for our FPSO equipment and we continue to see strong demand for new land rigs in Latin America and in the Middle East that could materialized into order in the quarter.","As of now we are planning for Rig Technology revenues to increase in the low single-digit percentage range. As continued declines in our pressure pumping and coil tubing equipment businesses will more than offset by a full quarter contribution from Robbins & Myers and continued growth in our offshore and aftermarket businesses.","Speaking of aftermarket, its important to remember that the first floaters constructed this cycle are turning five years old this year, which means that they will be returning to the shipyards for their five years surveys. While in the shipyards drillers will use this time to perform major maintenance and upgrade activities and NOV will be there to help.","In fact we\u2019re uniquely positioned to support our customers during this time as we\u2019ve been actively deploying capital into facilities and inventory and investing heavily in our service technicians, to make sure that we can meet the needs of our customers as their rigs come in for their surveys. We\u2019ve also been working on front end to understand our customers various requirements, such that we make the equipment and the personal available as needed by our customers and compress as much as possible the time that their vessels are in the yards.","We will also see aftermarket gains associated with the recent acquisition of Robbins & Myers, which brought us a larger installed base of land BOPs as well as the service infrastructure to repair test and certified existing equipment, need us to say we\u2019re excited about the aftermarket prospects. The petroleum services and supplied segment posted revenues of $1.7 billion which is down 4% sequentially and essentially flat year-over-year.","Operating profit declined 12% sequentially to $311 million and operating margins were 18.3% down a 180 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2012 and down 450 basis points from the first quarter of last year, compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, the $69 million revenue decline carried 64% decremental operating leverage.","As we mention on the Q4 call because we were entering the year with diminished backlogs and U.S. customer base that seemed reluctant to release orders we expected PS&S segment sales to decline in the low-to-mid single-digit percentage range. And for operating margins to tick down into the high teens. We also said that were hopeful that the U.S. rig count will remain relatively flat through most of Q1 and actually start to improve as entered Q2 and at the winner drilling season in Canada which got us to a late start would last a little longer than normal. Unfortunately, the average U.S. rig count declined an additional 3% sequentially and in Canada spring breakup came earlier than anticipated.","As a result revenues from PS&S excluding the $15 million contribution from Robbins & Myers in the first quarter actually declined by almost 7% sequentially with every business with a notable exception of fiberglass pipe, which benefited from a full quarters contribution from the Fiberspar acquisition experiencing a decline.","While the lack of activity in the U.S. and Canada were somewhat discouraging the group continues to benefit from our recent investments in the international arena. Over the past few years, we have built new and\/or added two existing manufacturing capacity across all of our PS&S businesses. With new downhole manufacturing capacity in Brazil, the UAE, and Singapore NOV Grant Prideco drill pipe manufacturing and Tuboscope inspection and coating facilities in both Mexico and the UAE and new fiberglass pipe manufacturing facilities in Oman and Brazil just a name of few. These investments have enabled us to move products, service and people closer to our customers and the final point of consumption and are enabling us to capture a larger share of key markets.","As we enter the second quarter of 2013, we expect PS&S segment sales to be relatively flat, as the negative impact of spring break up in Canada should be offset by a full quarter of contribution from Robbins & Myers and continued growth international markets. And although we cut cost including reductions in force and facility consolidations and a number of businesses in Q1 we are currently forecasting margins for the segment to tick down a bit more as mounting pricing pressures on several products under absorption in a number of our facilities and incremental expenses associated with both rightsizing our existing businesses and integrating recently acquired companies will all put pressure on our margins in the near-term.","Still we are excited about the future prospects for this segment. Our international business remain strong, our U.S. customer seem to be more optimistic and candidly even if the U.S. rig count remains in the 1,750 range for the foreseeable future our customers will ultimately consume their inventories and begin placing more orders for more of our products and services and when they do its important to remember that the flow through on that incremental revenue in this segment is usually north of 35%.","The Distribution & Transmission segment posted revenues of $1.2 billion down 3% sequentially that up 118% as compared to Q1 of last year. Do largely to the acquisitions of Wilson and CE Franklin in mid 2012. Operating profit declined 17% sequentially to 65 million but improved 51% as compared to Q1 of 2012 and operating margins declined to 5.3% which represented a 90 basis point drop from Q4, 2012.","On the Q4, call we indicated that revenues within the D&T segment should move up in the low single-digit percentage range as slightly lower margins. However even with the $49 million contribution from Robbins & Myers in the quarter, the 3% sequential decline in the U.S. rig count coupled with a shortened winner drilling season, let to the shortfall against expectation, its important to remember that 83% of this segments revenues have generated in the U.S. and Canada.","Looking into the second quarter of 2013 we expect Distribution & Transmission group revenues to be relatively flat as a negative impact of spring break up in Canada should be offset by a full quarter of contributions from Robbins & Myers. And we are currently forecasting flat to down margins as we battle pricing pressure and incur incremental costs associated with right sizing existing businesses and integrating recently acquired companies.","On the topic of integration the group has done an exceptional job of combining NOVs legacy distribution group with both Wilson and CE Franklin. At this point we believe that we\u2019ve captured most of the low hanging fruit we have reorganized the team consolidated over 20 facilities in the U.S. and Canada aligned pricing with key customer accounts leveraged spending with key suppliers and rolled out field level incentive plan to reward margin enhancement. We are not down to the heavy lifting which includes implementing a common ERP platform across the business and consolidating our Houston area facilities into a single building.","The group intends to begin the ERP implementation in Q4 and as planned and relocate it to the New Houston facility in Q3. Once completed both of these initials will result in margin expansion for the segment, so as we review the first quarter for all of NOV, I think it would be fair to say that we were disappointed that the U.S. market experience get another drop, that the winner of drilling in Canada were shorter than hoped and that the cost on some of our products resulted in rebase lining of projects that negative impacted our Rig Tech margins to the tune of 122 basis points.","However we feel really good about our overall Q1 performance our market position and our industry leading margins and we remain as bullish as ever on the growth prospects for each of our three operating segments. In Rig Tech, we continue to see strong demand for on-shore, offshore drilling equipment packages, but floaters and jackups, we were encouraged by the solid sequential growth with high flow through in our offshore floating production equipment business, despite the challenging market we continue to see U.S. land drillers upgrading their respective fleets and we are starting to see far more interest for new land rigs in the Middle East and Latin America.","We know that orders for complete (inaudible) will ultimately return and we will be even better position than before due to our 2012 acquisition of Interflow. And perhaps most importantly, we know that our aftermarket business will continue to grow as we deliver more and more rigs to the marketplace. In PS&S once our U.S. based customers worked through their inventories we believe that our recent acquisitions of companies like Robbins & Myers, Fiberspar coupled with our expansion of capacity and international will lead to very nice growth with tremendous flow through.","And in D&T we are excited about the margin enhancement that will result from the integration initiatives that are currently underway within our NOV Wilson Distribution Group and our mono-artificial [ph] lift in industrial pump group.","Turning to National Oilwell Varco\u2019s consolidated first quarter 2013 income statement. Gross margin declined 50 basis points sequentially due to all of the reasons that I already discussed. SG&A increased $15 million sequentially, due to the full quarter effect of the four acquisitions that we closed in the fourth quarter of last year, plus the partial quarter of Robbins & Myers. Overall, SG&A, as a percentage of sales, was 8.9% in Q1, as compared to 8% in Q4 and 9.1% in Q1 of last year.","Transaction cost primarily related to the Robbins & Myers acquisition and Venezuela currency devaluation charges combined for $73 million in pretax cost. Interest expense rose $7 million to $28 million, reflecting a full quarter of interest expense on the $3 billion in bonds that were issued in mid-November of last year. Equity income in our Voestalpine JV was $19 million, this was up $4 million sequentially due to improved product mix and an end of year credit from our billet supplier. We expect our income from the JV to decline in Q2 as demand for drill pipe and therefore the green tube in the U.S. is limited.","Other expense decreased $15 million from Q4 to $13 million, due to lower FX expense and lower bank charges. And the effective tax rate for the first quarter was 30.9%, which was lower than our historical and expected rate of 32%, due to a higher mix of overseas income at lower rates and higher U.S. manufacturing deductions. Unallocated expenses and eliminations on our supplemental segment schedule was $117 million in the first quarter, down $10 million sequentially. Depreciation and amortization was a $174 million, up $8 million from the fourth quarter and EBITDA excluding transaction charges was $1 billion marking the sixth consecutive quarter that the company generated over $1 billion in EBITDA. For the quarter, EBITDA was 18.9% of sales.","National-Oilwell Varco\u2019s March 31, 2013 balance sheet employed working capital excluding cash and debt of $6.9 billion, up $204 million from the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of Robbins & Myers, working capital was essentially neutral.","Total customer financing on projects in the form of pre-payments and billings in excess of costs, less cost in excess of billings, was $283 million, down $286 million from December 31st, as cost incurred on major projects continue to outpace milestone invoicing.","Current and long-term debt, net of cash was $1.9 billion at the end of the quarter, with $4.3 billion in debt offset by $2.4 billion in cash, of which only 10% resides in the U.S. Cash flow from operations was $506 million for the quarter. During the quarter, we acquired Robbins & Myers for $2.5 billion, which we funded using $1.1 billion of cash on hand and $1.4 billion of revolver debt borrowings, $185 million of which we repaid between the February 20th acquisition date and the end of the quarter owing to our strong cash flow from operations. We also spent $168 million in CapEx as we continue to invest substantially in major expansion efforts several of which we expect to be fully operational later this year. Cash tax payments were $171 million in the quarter and dividend payments totaled $56 million.","Now, let me turn it back to Pete.","Merrill A. Miller Jr.","","Thanks, Jeremy. I think that Clay and Jeremy have really kind of covered everything very, very well and I\u2019d just like to make a few brief comments before we open it up for questions. But spend a little bit of time in the last quarter traveling overseas and trying to get a sense of things that I think are pretty important. And I think some things that you need to keep an eye on for the folks on this call. Number one, I think is China. And I think as you take a look at the shipyards there, they\u2019re becoming much more active, especially in the jackup arena. I think you\u2019ll see some floaters and semis down there and we\u2019re positioned very uniquely to be able to take advantage of that. While there has been some press recently about the slow moving on the China shales, I also believe one of the reasons for that is because of the lack of infrastructure and so I might just remind you we manufacture infrastructure.","And so I think that that in China we\u2019re actually going to see some pretty good things happening with the shales. I think Latin America, looks very positive I believe by the end of the year, you\u2019re going to see PEMEX pick up and I think that has positive implications for all the services companies or manufacturers. And of course as Jeremy and Clay pointed, Brazil continues to be a very attractive arena for us. We\u2019re the leader down there in the Drillship awards, but more importantly than that we\u2019re also supporting everything else that\u2019s happening down there through all of our drill operations. So I think Brazil will continue to be a linchpin of what we\u2019re doing.","And then finally in Russia, this is a that earlier this quarter and I really think the Russians are just really almost begging for the technology that we have to be able to provide to them. We\u2019re investing there I think over the next four, five years you\u2019re going to see a complete transformation of the rig fleet and lot of the equipment that are working in Russia and again I think we\u2019re very uniquely positioned to be able to take advantage of that. So I think if you really keep your on eye on Russia, China and Latin America, I think those are going to be very important things.","And then finally, I\u2019d like to talk just for a moment about the fact that, lot of the domestic E&P people are getting a lot more free cash flow simply because of the price of the natural gas today. Okay, I don\u2019t think that that means they\u2019re going to necessarily drill for natural gas, but what I do believe it means as I\u2019ll continue to invest in especially in the oily and liquid shales.","So and again everything that we have to offer positions ourselves for that. You\u2019ve heard us to talk a little bit about some of the weaknesses in the frac spread, but you have to also remember those frac spreads will beat the crap of out of each other everyday that they\u2019re out there working and eventually that then become something that\u2019s going to produce more and more revenues for us.","So that\u2019s really just kind of a quick overview of the things that I am seeing out there. I might also add that week for Monday is the start of OTC. As usual that will be is going to have a nice presence there with a lot of the new products that we have and I would invite anybody that\u2019s on this call please stop by our booth and or go to our equipment shale on Holmes Road where our Tuboscope facility is and get an opportunity to see a lot of the exciting things that NOV is doing. So, at this point Don, I\u2019d like to turn it over to any questions that our customers might or listeners might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Marshall Adkins from Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Marshall Adkins \u2013 Raymond James","Good morning guys, great overview as usual and Pete you might answer this first question I have a little bit in your summary there, but the biggest push back I get from investors on your story is the perception, the backlog this great backlog growth we\u2019re seeing here right now, hits the wall next year and sometimes in 2014 we got good visibility obviously this year with the rigs that have been order, but in 2014 that falls off and then you are not going to be able to replace that. So, how do you respond to those investors that the growth rate in 2015 and 2016 goes away?","Merrill A. Miller Jr.","Great question Marshall, I might tell you the quote that I think of is Mark Twain and it was \u201cThe reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated\u201d and if I could kind of go into how many times up and told that the backlog is dead, let\u2019s go back to OA, if you are going to lose half of your backlog three quarters of your backlog and we lost about 3% when the financial crisis occurred. And we\u2019ve been told numerous times about the fact that well people just not going to keep ordering, the fact of the matter is, we feel very good about the prospects as we look into the future.","I could talk that I\u2019ll blew in the face and people are going to believe what they want to believe on that, but take look at the jackup market, how many times, if you are about the depth of the jackup market and this quarter, we just had a [plotter up] of jackups order. And we continued to see a very active area in that arena, and you also have to understand that lot of these shipyards in places like Korea, China and Singapore, the shipyards are in fact the driver of their economic growth and they are going to do everything they can to try keep those shipyards filled with things. And I think you are going to continue to see, very attractive prices that are drawn after for a lot of the deepwater drillers and if you take a look, the number of deepwater rigs out there, well it seems big on historical basis, it\u2019s real a fraction of probably how many rigs are really need to be able to explore the deepwater basins all over the world.","And so, we again, couple back there with the fact that we are expanding in the FPSO arena and when you take a look at what has to happen with FPSOs I mean the approved solution for production on all these deepwater wells being drilled today is going to be FPSO arena and we positioned ourselves to be able take great advantage of that and we\u2019ll continue to look at ways to find a different companies and also acquire things, so that we can expand that even further. So, we feel very comfortable that we are going to continue to have a solid backlog this going to lead to such a growth for NOV.","Marshall Adkins","","Excellent, that helps. One quick, somewhat (inaudible) a follow-up and really more clarification, is sound, the margins obviously in Rig Tech a little less than some of us thought, I think you detailed why pretty well, but it sounds as if you expect to rebound once we get pass these abnormal hot shot or transportation expenses and that the one time start up cost fade over the next couple quarters did it here that right?","Merrill A. Miller Jr.","","That\u2019s exactly correct Marshall. We have $32 million in net project expenses that hit this quarter and then $10 million and sort of start-up costs around the globe and the start up cost will linger for while but the $32 million cost roll was all half of this quarter. So we\u2019re confident we\u2019re going to end up in the 22%, 23% range going forward.","Marshall Adkins \u2013 Raymond James","Thanks guys.","Merrill A. Miller Jr.","Thanks Marshall","Robert Blanchard","Thanks Marshall","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Crandell from Dahlman. Please go ahead.","James Crandell \u2013 Dahlman Rose & Co.","Good morning guys.","Merrill A. Miller Jr.","Good morning, Jim.","Robert Blanchard","Good morning Jim","James Crandell \u2013 Dahlman Rose & Co.","First question concerns deepwater, I guess how many deepwater rigs did you book in the first quarter? And I assume by your comments that you booked the first three out of the nine in Brazil and there is another six to come. And also could you comment on China Pete. I know you had I guess three deepwater rigs in the fourth quarter on come out of the Chinese yards. Have there been anymore? And I guess over the course of this year, how many Chinese yards you think could become engaged in deepwater rig construction?","Merrill A. Miller Jr.","You\u2019re correct, Jim. We booked a total of eight floaters, three of the floaters were for Brazil. And as I said in my comments, we\u2019re hopeful that last six there will also flowing once we get down payments on those rigs. So that situation in Brazil the other five were elsewhere around the globe and we\u2019re centered in the traditional shipyards. With regards to the Chinese yards, they\u2019ve been very active on the jackup front and gaining share there on the jackup awards floaters they\u2019re interested in, but that\u2019s a little slower in developing.","James Crandell \u2013 Dahlman Rose & Co.","Okay. Pete I know you spent, as you said, you spent some time in Russia. My understanding and tell me if I am wrong here is that Russian companies have to retire the sub-basin that in Russia after 25 years and will operators do this or do you think a number of them that you are speaking with aren\u2019t interested in upgrading their rigs but there will be new equipment hence your new facility over there?","Merrill A. Miller Jr.","Jim, actually yeah, they do need to, they need to redo their rigs after 25 years and I think that there is a tremendous interest level on getting new equipment and better technology. I think the Russians now that the effectively they\u2019ve got 1980s [heritage] rigs and the difference between a 80s heritage rig and the line rig today day is [night day]. And so we\u2019re confident that they are going to upgrade those rigs and I think that\u2019s going to be a multi-year expansion that\u2019s really going to play well into our hands.","I mean I just find every place we go, we like to have a lot of local content for a lot of reasons, but one of the main reasons is because your transportation charges are lower dramatically trying to get the rig to the end user, but we\u2019ll have our new facility up and running by next year and that facility we\u2019ll be building both rigs and lot of our other equipment, but the Russians really have a demand for that technology and we\u2019re very bullish on what we\u2019re going to see over there in the next couple of years. And I think they are going to have to retire a lot of those rigs not only by because of the law, but also because of just the need for better drilling efficiencies.","James Crandell \u2013 Dahlman Rose & Co.","Pete, but one quick last final question, is that I know you\u2019ve been bullish on the outlook for FPSO orders and I know you\u2019re not getting package orders and that\u2019s coming in the way of individual products, but could you characterize the magnitude of the pickup that you are seeing in the last one or two quarters and then take us through maybe this calendar year into 2014 and in terms of the projected magnitude of the pickup?","Merrill A. Miller Jr.","Yeah, Jim, this quarter we had products, major sales or for Turret warning system, and (inaudible) products into four projects there, which is a very big pick up as we talked about on previous quarters. Orders have been pretty slow there in that business, despite a lot of feed study activity, a lot of conversations with customers throughout last year, and even come back into 2011. And so we are very pleased to see a sharp pick up in orders. ","And then in Q2, we expect even more, and so the trajectory is finally moving in the right direction, the way we \u2013 we\u2019re confident it would, so very, very pleased to see that pick up. But that again I\u2019ll add to \u2013 that\u2019s an addition to the flexible pipe sales composite pipe, Hose Reel Systems, Dryser Pull Systems, other components that we sell in FPSOs broadly.","So generally, I think we\u2019re seeing that whole market start to pick up as we have expected, and I\u2019m pleased to see the direction that it\u2019s going. ","James Crandell \u2013 Dahlman Rose & Co.","Okay, good. Thank you. ","Clay C. Williams","Thanks, Jim.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robin Shoemaker from Citi. Please go ahead. ","Robin Shoemaker \u2013 Citigroup","Thanks. And I wanted to pursue that FPSO a little more. You\u2019ve told us before, I think what you think your maximum dollar value of sales is per FPSO, and could you remind us of that. And are you seeing any opportunities where you might get that \u2013 you know total value? ","Clay C. Williams","Yeah on the high end, first FPSO has been in broad range of sizes and capabilities, and as you know Robin. And so, you\u2019re not \u2013 there is a lot of variability in the design of FPSOs. And actually more broadly let\u2019s us say FS users, I think it\u2019s technically aren\u2019t FPSOs, and we also sell lots of equipment into as well. But on the high end, I would say probably a $150 million per very large FPSO is a sort of a reasonable number and technically speaking for \u2013 I think it\u2019s possible for us to go beyond that, perhaps well beyond that depending on the capabilities of the FPSO but what\u2019s probably more useful sort of an average number might be in the $80 million to $100 million kind of size range for us.","Robin Shoemaker \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. My other question had to do with these faster hull construction times and how you\u2019ve had to speed up the process and incurred a lot of over time and expediting and all the things you mentioned there. It seems like in the past, the shorter the delivery time, the higher the price and higher the margin, just in terms of what you could charge for prompt delivery versus longer delivery. And it just seems like now the hurry up kind of process isn\u2019t giving you the pricing leverage? Or am I misunderstanding that?","Merrill A. Miller Jr.","No, that\u2019s partly true. I would say that for certain components for quick delivery, we clearly do get a premium, but the broad level of activity out there, the portfolio of projects that we have today are being built a year or more faster than they were in 2007, 2008 and have been awarded or bid let\u2019s say more at our customers\u2019 leisure, if you will. Back in 2007, 2008 there was a much higher level of urgency injected into the system. I think principally because the slots available in the shipyards were in short supply and once the customer secured a slot at a shipyard, even though the gestation period of the rig took much longer, they ended the signup pretty quickly with us on a DEP. This time around, the shipyards had a lot more capacity to not as much urgency around the availability of slots, and all of the slots are being bid at much faster construction schedule, but short of time it takes the build a rig.","So we\u2019ve shrunk the number of months from probably 42 months, 45 months for a sophisticated drillship down to sub-30, this time around and once \u2013 but the process leading up to signing of contract for that 30 month drillship is a little more relaxed, and it gives, it means that there\u2019s a much more sort of competitive fight for the work going into that rig.","Robin Shoemaker \u2013 Citigroup","Yeah. So it sounds like, this dynamic really isn\u2019t going to change in any near term future, in other words the availability of shipyard slots that you mentioned China getting into the business. So it\u2019s going to continue to be kind of\u2026 ","Jeremy Thigpen","","Yeah, what\u2019s happened Robin is that, as the whole construction schedule has shortened, it\u2019s pressed our plants and our factories to move components out much more quickly. ","And so it\u2019s that \u2013 that concept is little bit divorced from the process around bidding work and competing with our competitors to supply drilling equipment packages. But I would also add that as our backlog has filled up, and there\u2019s lots of rigs out there, in particular in buying components that are in a little shorter supply, we are certainly pressing for some  - few price increases here and there to cover these exploration costs that we\u2019re seeing\u2026 ","Robin Shoemaker \u2013 Citigroup","Right. Okay, thank you.","Jeremy Thigpen","Thanks, Robin.","Clay C. Williams","Thanks, Robin.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Kurt Hallead \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Great, thanks. Good morning.","Merrill A. Miller Jr.","Good morning.","Jeremy D. Thigpen","Good morning, Kurt.","Kurt Hallead \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","I want to try to get a sense on here is kind of recapping the general average for the FPSO per unit. Can you give us a rough update on floaters and jack-ups? Are we still around 200 million to 220 million for floaters and still in that kind of 50 million to 70 million range for jack-ups does that change at all?","Jeremy D. Thigpen","No, Kurt, that\u2019s pretty accurate. I mean on some of the floaters depending on the complexity if you got a complete dual activity depending if you want one or two [stacks] things like that you could be as much as 250. I think on the jack-ups it did really is around a $50 million comp. We get the max on the floaters more so that many times on the jack up, but we really picked up on the jack-ups as well simply because of our jacking systems. We\u2019re putting a lot more jacking systems out there.","So, I think that that $200 and $250 and the $50 number are still pretty accurate and then I will also remind you that as we take a look at land rigs and especially places like the Middle-East and some of the more complex land rigs and those will be up into the $30 million and $35 million and we\u2019ve been very successful when that arena improves and we think that arena will do well over the last part of the year.","Kurt Hallead \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. In that context, we\u2019ve heard recently the (inaudible) rig count starting to expected to increase the rig count from I think we\u2019re counting something around the 140 today to something around 200 by the end of 2014. First, can you collaborate that and secondly if (inaudible) is looking for say another 60 range, are they all going to be new in your viewpoint and where else do you see kind of a similar size kind of increase coming from. I know you mentioned Russia that sounded like a five year process. If you give some color that would be great.","Jeremy D. Thigpen","I think Kurt we agree that the Saudi\u2019s are going to pick up and I think it will be combination of existing rigs that will be moving in and also new rigs and we are uniquely positioned because we can actually we manufacture our land rigs in Dubai, in Jebel Ali Free Zone there. And so we are able to respond much more quickly that\u2019s been one of the reasons we done that because of the Saudi\u2019s want to rig and we have to make it any place, any other part of the world to be in China or even in the U.S. you know you have to add 60 to 90 days just for transportation charges whereas that we can do it in Dubai which is what we do once we are done, it moves cross broader near in the Saudi Arabia in three days.","And so we think that\u2019s going to be a very attractive market over the next year or so I think Russia is a more long-term market but I think its probably also a more sustainable market. And its one I think that\u2019s going keep on giving for period of time. I think Latin America on land rigs is going to be a little bit more exciting then the people realize I think PEMEX for sure is going to be doing some things towards the end of the year, I think that will be both on and offshore I think you are seeing some things in Columbia and even the [Venice] make noise that maybe something could happen there but \u2013 but we are prior little bit more bullish on Latin America right now then have been and I think that something its probably in the second half of the year phenomenon as well.","Kurt Hallead \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thanks Pete and if I can just one more here just on the FPSO as indicated obviously initially that\u2019s going to be margin diluted to historical rig tech average margins and as you get more volume that will improve. So what\u2019s the crossover point in terms of volumes and how close do you think the FPSO margins can get to historical Rig Tech averages.","Merrill A. Miller Jr.","It\u2019s a mix a little bit we have product within that offering that are accretive to the mix overall, but others are diluted, right now the \u2013 the sum of the business is still dilutive, but we\u2019re still at least a few quarters away from having that \u2013 this would be accretive to FPSOs, and I would add, I mean it would take us much larger volume through that business to turn that corner, so that\u2019s still ways off, but again very excited about the prospects out there. Pete mentioned this is sort of a go-to solution for producing out of the deepwater, and we have a great offering of equipment and technologies into that trend. So over the long haul very, very excited about what lay ahead.","Kurt Hallead \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","That\u2019s great. I appreciate your color. Thanks.","Jeremy Thigpen","","Okay, Kurt thank you.","Clay C. Williams","Thank you","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Bill Sanchez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","William D. Sanchez \u2013 Howard Weil Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Jeremy Thigpen","","Hey, Bill","Clay C. Williams","Good morning","William D. Sanchez \u2013 Howard Weil Inc.","Jeremy, if I \u2013 I perhaps missed it in the prepared comments, but I think you gave as far as the revenue recognition backlog Rig Tech, $2 billion in 2Q, and I think you said $3.7 million in the back half of the year, I miss the \u201814 expectation. Do you have that number?","Jeremy Thigpen","","Let me check, I didn\u2019t say that on the call. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s\u2026 ","","William D. Sanchez \u2013 Howard Weil Inc.","Or else simply you can do offline, but I know Clay, you\u2019ve typically given it in the past.","Clay C. Williams","We\u2019re actually (inaudible) in a minute, aren\u2019t we Bill? I\u2019ll have it.","","William D. Sanchez \u2013 Howard Weil Inc.","Yeah. We are\u2026","Clay C. Williams","$2.3 billion.","William D. Sanchez \u2013 Howard Weil Inc.","$2.3 billion do, I\u2019m sorry that\u2019s the 2014 total?","Clay C. Williams","No, no. I\u2019ll get back\u2026","William D. Sanchez \u2013 Howard Weil Inc.","Okay.","Clay C. Williams","","I got it right here. It is $4.9 billion.","William D. Sanchez \u2013 Howard Weil Inc.","","$4.9 billion. Okay, great. Thank you for that. And then I guess, just one thing, just so I can just understand in terms of the margin progression here on the Rig Tech, Clay, it\u2019s like from your comment, I think it was confirmed in the early Q&A that margins in Rig Tech in the next couple of quarters going to be relatively flat, I believe with 1Q level, but yet, I think Jeremy you\u2026","Jeremy D. Thigpen","No, no, sorry Bill, flat with Q4.","William D. Sanchez \u2013 Howard Weil Inc.","Flat with Q4, okay.","Jeremy D. Thigpen","It\u2019s a 20% to 23% range.","William D. Sanchez \u2013 Howard Weil Inc.","Okay, right. Okay, and that in the [ducktails] and because I was, it seems like if because of the 22% to 23% range certainly on average for the year, you have to see a step-up in 2Q so that makes sense. If not, you are going to have to have a pretty significant increase in 4Q margins, so. Okay, so 4Q 2012 is 2Q, is basically good proxy for 2Q 2013 in Rig Tech?","Jeremy D. Thigpen","Yeah.","William D. Sanchez \u2013 Howard Weil Inc.","Okay. And one question just on PSS, is it too early to say given the mix of the product lines, yeah, I know there is a backlog component to that business that perhaps your lag rig count recover here to some extent, but this 2Q likely represent the trough from the margin expectation?","Jeremy D. Thigpen","At this point time we think so, I mean, it\u2019s, we\u2019re certainly get positive comments from our customers, the service companies and the drilling contractors and typically we lag their positive comments by about a quarter. So, our expectation is that the rig activity does start to pickup at some point this quarter, even if it\u2019s not a lot that our customers are start working to their inventories and start placing orders for our consumable products again in services.","William D. Sanchez \u2013 Howard Weil Inc.","Okay, great. I appreciate your time. Thank you.","","Jeremy D. Thigpen","Thank you.","Merrill A. Miller Jr.","Bill, thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

Later on this call, we will answer your questions, which we ask you to limit to two in order to permit more participation.","Now, let me turn this call over to Clay.","Clay Williams","Thank you, Loren. This morning we announced the National Oilwell Varco earned a $1.42 per fully diluted share from continuing operations and $1.44 per share attributable to the company for all operations in the second quarter ended June 30, 2014.","Consolidated revenues from continuing operations were $5.3 billion, up 7% sequentially and up 12% year-over-year. Operating profit from continuing operations, excluding transaction costs was $945 million or 18% of sales. EBITDA from continuing operations, excluding non-recurring items was $1,141 billion or 21.7% of sales.","The second quarter included $31 million pretax or $0.05 per share after-tax in transaction related charges mostly due to the spinout of our distribution NOW business, which we completed during the second quarter, adding this back our earnings were $1.47 per fully diluted share from continuing operations.","Continuing earnings excluding non-recurring items of the $1.47 are consistent with what we have reported in the past and on this basis for all periods, second quarter earnings were up 14% sequentially and up 19% from the second quarter last year. We've seen any changes at National Oilwell Varco this quarter, including our spinout of our distribution NOW business.","This morning we will be detailing our results along new business segments with new disclosures following our reorganization during the second quarter. Among these is our reporting of certain amortization expenses of purchased intangible assets. These were $91 million pre-tax or $0.14 per share after-tax for the second quarter of 2014.","Excluding these and excluding discontinued operations and non-recurring items, second quarter 2014 operating non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were $1.61, up 13% sequentially and up 16% year-over-year on the same basis for all quarters.","We offer this supplemental non-GAAP disclosure to win more transparency to our cash flow generating capability per share and Jeremy, will speak to this more in a few moments.","Overall, on either basis of presentation, we are pleased with double-digit earnings growth for our shareholders for the second quarter, which reflects skillful execution of projects and backlog, and improving market conditions across North America and other parts of the world.","In particular, we are seeing the major North American shale plays growing, domestic E&P wellhead cash flows are rising with increasing production and strong commodity prices, and producers are choosing to plow back more their cash into new shale drilling.","Our activity gains were partly offset by seasonal breakup in Canada, our outlook for Canada is strengthening for the second half. Activity is leading to rising demand for frac equipment, coiled tubing units and for newbuild land rigs required to maximize shale drilling efficiency, adding to continued strong land rig demand overseas, particularly in Latin America and Middle East.","Offshore demand held up well for the second quarter, but as we discussed last quarter, we expect the second half of 2014 to be more challenging. We see the market for new floating rig softening for at least the next few quarters due to lower dayrates pressured by new and contracted capacity coming into the market.","Nevertheless, we still see some floater demand through this period for special capabilities required for the Arctic, for high-pressure 20,000 PSI prospects, for the North Sea midwater market and for well intervention and construction activity.","And with very few floater scheduled to be delivered in 2017, we could see opportunistic investors whether traditional drilling contractors or entrepreneurs decide to place orders at some point in 2015.","So with respect to rig systems capital orders, we expect a decline for newbuild floaters but some level of demand for this special floating rigs continuing. We see steady demand for jackups at least for the second half of 2014 and we see a pronounced increase in demand for land rigs for the next several quarters. The land rigs and jackups will not fully offset falling floater demand.","Importantly, analysis of NOV's financial results and rig building through the past decade demonstrates that earnings and cash flow can and do remain strong for cyclical order down terms.","Over the next several quarters, we expect the following factors to underpin solid revenue and earnings performance within our rig systems segment. One, our record backlog with approximately 180 offshore newbuilds underway today; two, equipment demand associated with five-year special periodic surveys of offshore rigs, which we see tripling between now and 2017; three, general equipment upgrade demand around offshore rig for float capacity and BOP's; and four, writing backlog for land rigs and land equipment. We expect these to buffer rig system segment revenues from the volatility in deepwater newbuild orders.","Offshore rig newbuild projects, floaters and jackups accounted for approximately $1.4 billion or 27% of NOV's consolidated second quarter revenues, all within the rig system segment. That segment also generated almost $1 billion from the sale of land rig newbuilds and replacement and upgrade components for both land and offshore drilling rigs.","Again, our backlog should help sustain results for the former for the next several quarters, while rising demand should strengthen the latter for the next several quarter. During the second quarter the rig system segment one orders totaling $2.3 billion, up 8% from the first quarter and its book-to-bill was 110% lifting backlog to a record level of $15.4 billion for the segment. Backlog for rig systems is up 2% since year end 2013 and up 41% since year end 2012.","Offshore newbuild orders included five floaters and two jackups during the second. Our new rig aftermarket segment is closely related to the rig system segment operationally and served to support the growing installed base of NOV drilling equipment operating in the field.","The segment grew 5% sequentially and 17% year-over-year in the second, consistent with its annual growth results for the past several years. It is high margin and highly strategic to our offering in the drilling equipment space. That's why we continue to invest heavily in facilities and skilled personnel to ensure that NOV continues to the high level of aftermarket support our customers expect. It provides clear differentiation to premium NOV drilling technology and we foresee bright future as our installed base of rigs continues to expand.","Our new wellbore technology segment provides critical products and services designed to improve drilling performance, drillbits, drill pipe, including IntelliServ wire drill pipe, tubular inspection and coating, drilling motors and reamers, solids control, waste management, drilling fluids, drilling optimization and instrumentation services provided by the group all served to improve efficiency, safety and environmental impact of drilling operations.","Although, this segment is levered to drilling activity, it posted 13% sequential growth, despite the second quarter global rig count decline arising from the Canadian breakup. Year-over-year wellbore technology segment second quarter sales were up 18%.","Finally, our new Completion & Production Solutions segment provides equipment to complete and produce wells along with some sales into certain industrial markets. This group engineers and manufactures equipment into hydraulic fracture stimulation operations, wireline and coiled tubing technologies, composite piping solutions and critical technologies such as turret mooring systems and flexible pipe to support deepwater field developments. The group posted 12% sequential revenue growth and 7% year-over-year growth.","Orders for the Completion & Production Solutions segment were extraordinarily strong, $1.1 billion for the second quarter, more than double first quarter orders and representing a book-to-bill of 186%, growth was across the Board.","Floating production system components and subsea flexible pipe won some very large second quarter orders. We don't expect to repeat in the third quarter, with strong second quarter frac and stimulation equipment demand appears to be continuing to build as we enter the third quarter.","Second quarter ending backlog for Completion & Production Solutions was a record $2.1 billion, up 31% from year end 2013 and up 60% from year end 2012. Jeremy, will provide more color on markets and operations in just a moment.","As I mentioned earlier, NOV second quarter marked a successful spinout of distribution NOW, which as of the 1st of June as a standalone independent company trading under the symbol, DNOW on the New York Stock Exchange.","Market reception to this exciting new company has been outstanding, owing to denounce leadership and growth plans, and we're pleased that the move has unlocked significant value for our shareholders.","I\u2019d like to thank the employees of both companies for your hard work to help make this happen. Our second quarter results included two months of our distribution services business as a discontinued operation. Concurrent with the spinout, we reorganize our business into the full porting segments, I detailed earlier, organized around customers.","In June, we released pro forma historical financial results going back five years by quarter on this new segment framework to enable you to update your models and trend the data to better assess how we are performing.","We are also disclosing depreciation and amortization expenses by segment to enable investors to compare our EBITDA margins to our peers. I'm pleased to congratulate the new operating heads of our segments on their new responsibilities.","Joe Rovig is leading our Rig Systems and Rig Aftermarket segments; Mike Matta is heading our new Wellbore Technology Segment; and Kirk Shelton is leading the Completion & Production Solutions segment.","I'm grateful for the extraordinary team that we have in place and I want to thank all of our hard working employees and business leaders for continuing to support the critical needs of our customers through our busy second quarter.","Each new segment is presently engaged in a strategic review of its businesses against the backdrop of the four major trends we see providing opportunity to our organization over the next several years.","Namely, one, the buildout of the deepwater rig fleet; two, the buildout of infrastructure to support the development of deepwater oil and gas fields; three, the retooling of the worldwide jackup fleet; and finally, four, the continued growth and proliferation of unconventional shale technologies worldwide.","We explained many time before how we see theses shaping the global energy equation and NOV's fortunes for decades to come. Our strategic goal is to develop it to determine how we will deploy resources to enhance NOV's competitive advantage and financial returns within these trends. As we answer these questions this summer, we will be quantifying specific personnel, facilities and capital needs to execute our strategic plans to grow organically and to enhance our business through selective acquisitions.","On the topic of acquisitions, we have closed five small transactions so far this year for about $110 million in aggregate, less than six times trailing EBITDA and less than five times current EBITDA run rate. We are pursuing a number of conversations around smaller transactions now generally focused on finding excellent buys that fit our strategy, strengthen our franchises and offer strong returns on capital employee.","This takes tremendous diligence. Even though we're almost are strategic buyer, meaning that we have access to efficiencies and cost savings that financial buyers usually don't. We are nevertheless frequently outbid. Rather than chase expensive deals ever higher, we will sought through many potential targets to focus on rifle shot singles, doubles with disciplined returns demanded of the acquisitions we execute.","NOV will also continue to focus on organic growth, research and development, better technologies, products, tight management around costs, investments and more efficient production and operational excellence, expansion investments into new regions and aftermarket support, all of which will translate into more organic growth. Disciplined investment in both acquisition opportunities and organic growth opportunities will enhance our future financial performance.","Turning to our balance sheet and record of cash generation, we are also exploring other ways to enhance shareholder value by optimizing our balance sheet and capital structure. Like multi -- like any multinationals, we had challenges around repatriating cash from overseas. We're exploring ways to either put this excess capital to work or return it to shareholders.","We announced a 77% increase in our regular dividend during the second quarter and believe that as we reassess our organic growth, capital needs through our strategic planning process, we can then turn to look at ways to return more capital to our shareholders. NOV has a strong record of cash generation and reasonable expectations of strong future cash generation mean that we should have capacity to return more capital to shareholders in the future.","Finally, we look forward to sharing our detailed strategic plans with investors in November.","With that, let me turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer to give you more color on the second quarter operating results. Jeremy?","Jeremy Thigpen","Thanks Clay. Before we begin our discussion of the quarterly operating results, let me take a quick moment to explain the change that we have made to the calculation of our adjusted EPS. From this point forward, our adjusted EPS metric will exclude the impact of the amortization of purchased intangible assets as well as discontinued operation and nonrecurring items as we always have.","Going forward, we will be referring to these adjusted earnings per share results as operating non-GAAP earnings per share. Here is why we\u2019re doing it. Since the amortization expense of purchased intangible assets is a non-cash period expense, we believe that the supplemental adjustment will help investors to more clearly understand how NOV's earnings per share relate to our periodic cash flow per share.","Purchased intangible assets arise from the allocation of the purchase price of acquisition in excess of the fair market value of working capital and fixed assets of acquired businesses. Amortization of these differ from depreciation, another non-cash periodic charge and that depreciation expense reflects consumption of hard assets which must eventually be replaced used to produce periodic results, where as amortization of purchased intangibles reflects the initial startup cost of acquisition capital.","Obviously, we will continue to report GAAP earnings and continue to provide a reconciliation between GAAP and our new operating non-GAAP earnings metric which you can see on the last page of our second quarter 2014 earnings release. We intend this to be a supplemental disclosure, not a replacement for GAAP earnings per share but rather to provide the investing public additional insight into the periodic cash results of our operations on a per share basis.","Now let\u2019s discuss the quarterly results. Since Clay already thoroughly covered the consolidated results, I would just like to offer one comment before transitioning into the results of our new segments. Given the additional time and energy associated with the spin-off of our distribution business and the reorganization of our remaining businesses, delivering the quarter with 7% growth and 35% flow-through on a sequential basis and 12% growth and 30% flow-thorough on a year-over-year basis is quite an accomplishment.","So I would just like to say thank you to each member of the NOV family for your unwavering commitment, your focus and your hard work throughout this past quarter. Your efforts and contributions are noticed and appreciated. So thank you very much.","Now let\u2019s turn to the operating results of our newly formed segments. The Rig Systems segment generated revenues of $2.4 billion in the second quarter, up 5% sequentially, driven largely by significant increase in land related sales, which before elimination accounted for approximately 22% of segment revenues. That\u2019s up 18% -- from 18% in the first quarter of 2014 and up from 15% in the second quarter of 2013.","Compared to the second quarter of 2013, Rig Systems revenues were up 14% as one heightened demand for new high spec land rigs primarily in the U.S., Latin America and the Middle East resulted in incremental year-over-year sales in complete rigs as well as critical components, such as top drives, BOPs and pipe-handling equipment and two, recent capacity additions have enabled us to convert 14% more revenue out of our backlog for both land and offshore projects.","Operating profit for the segment was $501 million and operating margins were 21.1%, which represented 110 basis point improvement over the previous quarter, a 220 basis point improvement over the prior year. EBITDA for the segment was $523 million or 22% of sales. As we move into the third quarter, we believe that Rig Systems revenue should remain relatively flat and that our operating margins could remain in the 20% to 21% range.","As we look at Rig Systems margins for the balance of the year and then throughout 2015, we see a number of puts and takes which could result in some modest margin expansion as we move through next year. On the plus side, the price increases that we push through in 2013 have resulted in improving margin in our Rig Systems backlog.","Additionally, in time we believe that we will start to recognize some efficiency gains from the new capacity that we added last year. However some of the benefits associated with price increases and operational efficiencies will be offset by growing percentage of Brazil and China related work, which we expect to be challenging.","Naturally, we will continue to aggressively pursue opportunities to improve our already industry-leading equipment margin. But we believe that margins for the Rig Systems segment in the second half of 2014 will look very similar to the margins that we delivered in the first half of the year.","Now let\u2019s transition to the capital equipment orders for our Rig Systems segment. As Clay already stated for the quarter, we booked four drillships, one semi and two jackups as well as some other packages and discrete components, including lifting and handling equipment, jacking system, spare BOP stacks and another equipment upgrades. In addition to the strong orders offshore, we continue to see heightened demand for complete new land rigs as well as land equipment packages and components for the U.S., Latin America, and Middle East markets.","Of the $2.3 billion in new Rig Systems orders, 59% were driven by new build construction for jackups, semis and drillships while sales of land rigs, land rig components and replacement upgrade components to support existing offshore rigs accounted for the 41% balance from bookings. This $2.3 billion of new orders in the quarter was mostly offset by revenues out of backlog of $2.1 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.1 times and another record quarter ending backlog of $15.4 billion for the segment. Of this total backlog, approximately 93% is offshore and 94% is destined for international markets.","Looking into the third quarter of 2014, we believe that orders for new floaters will be limited. However, we could see solid orders for jackups as a number of opportunities slipped from the second quarter. We also believe that demand should remain strong for individual offshore components as well as complete land rigs, land equipment packages and individual land components.","Overall, we expect a healthy quarter for orders. However, as we stated on the previous conference call, for the Rig Systems segment, we do not at this time expect to achieve a one-to-one book-to-bill on the third quarter.","The rig aftermarket segment posted revenues of $785 million in the second quarter of 2014, up 5% sequentially and up 17% over the second quarter of 2013 as our large and growing install base of equipment combined with the investment that we've made in additional personnel, training, global warehousing and service infrastructure and inventory have resulted in midteens percentage growth for the past few years.","Operating profit for the segment was $217 million or 27.6% of revenues, up 210 basis point sequentially but down 60 basis points from the prior year due to slightly unfavorable mix. EBITDA for this segment was $224 million or 28.5% of revenue.","As we move into the third quarter, we feel that aftermarket revenues could continue to improve in the low single-digit percentage range, maintaining that midteens percentage year-over-year growth trajectory. And we believe that operating margin should continue to hold fairly steady in the third quarter and for the foreseeable future.","However, I would like to take this opportunity to communicate that this business due to product mix and the timing of service work and repairs have a tendency to be somewhat lumpy. On an annual basis, I feel comfortable providing an outlook of midteens percent growth in fairly steady margins. However, there will undoubtedly be some swings from quarter to quarter. So please be prepared for some slight quarterly choppiness in this segment.","Despite these quarterly fluctuations, we are very excited about the exceptional growth profile and profitability of this segment of our business. And we look forward to providing additional insight into this business in the coming quarters. The Wellbore Technologies segment posted revenues of $1.4 billion, up 13% sequentially and up 18% for the second quarter of last -- second quarter of last year.","As previously stated, the Wellbore Technologies business is driven by activity more rigs, drilling more wells and more footage require more solid control equipment, more fluid, more drill pipe, the inspection and coding of that drill pipe, more downhole drilling tools, more drillbits and more rig monitoring and drilling optimization services.","As such, despite the seasonal decline in Canada, the continued strengthening of the U.S. market coupled with the fact that our customers have clearly worked through the excess inventory that they carried into the first half of 2013 has led to outsized growth for this segment. On this $1.4 billion in revenue, the Wellbore Technologies segment generated $269 million in operating profit, or 18.6% of revenues, which represented 110 basis point improvement over the first quarter of 2014 or 27% flow-through to leverage on the 13% increase in revenue.","On a year-over-year basis, operating margin improved 260 basis point or 33% flow-through to leverage on the 18% increase in revenue. EBITDA for this segment was 26.1%. As you\u2019ve undoubtedly noticed this particular segment carries a fairly heavy load of depreciation and amortization expenses.","Because one the businesses in this segment have made significant investments in roofline and machinery to manufacture and service equipment and tools globally; two, three of these businesses have invested heavily in the respective rental fleet of downhole drilling tools, instrumentation tools and solid control equipment, which account for a sizable percentage of their respective revenue streams.","And three, we\u2019ve made significant investments in game changing acquisition in the segment including but not limited to Grand Prideco drill pipe, ReedHycalog drillbits, Robbins & Myers drilling motors and Andergauge downhole technologies, all of which improved and expanded our product and service offerings to our customers and further strengthened our competitive position.","Looking into the third quarter of 2014, we believe that Wellbore Technologies segment revenues could improve in the low to mid single-digit percentage range. If Canada comes out of breakup, the U.S. market continues to modestly improve and our other key markets in aggregate remain relatively steady. And while our actual results will always depend upon product, customer and geographic mix, we believe on average that this segment should generate plus or minus 30% flow-through on each dollar of additional revenue.","The completion of production solutions segment generated revenues of $1.1 billion, up 12% sequentially and up 7% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the revenue growth was driven primarily by strong delivery quarter out of our subsea businesses and improving market for well intervention and stimulation equipment including coil tubing units, coil tubing, pressure pumping equipment, well service pumps, fluid and expendables and flow line.","On a year-over-year basis, substantial growth in both our floating production and subsea businesses which were up 82% and 45%, respectively, more than offset the year-over-year decline in sales for our stimulation equipment.","Operating profit for the segment was $158 million, or 14% of revenues, which was relatively flat with the first quarter of 2014 and down 140 basis points from the second quarter of 2013.","As you probably surmised, the year-over-year decline was almost entirely attributable to product mix, with a lower percentage of higher margin stimulation equipment revenues and a higher percentage of lower margin floating production and subsea revenues.","Of note, we\u2019re also continuing to incur high startup costs for our flexible plant in Brazil, resulting in low leverage on higher sequential flexible pipe sales. But on that topic, we're pleased to report that we\u2019re nearing the finish line on the state-of-the-art facility and hope to see improvements as we ended the year.","Second quarter EBITDA for the segment was 18.7%, while the delta between operating margins and EBITDA margins is not as pronounced as it is within the Wellbore Technologies segment. The Completion & Production Solutions segment also carries a fairly heavy D&A load related to investments in roofline and machinery, as well as in fairly recent transformational acquisitions, such as APL, NKT, Interflow and the pumps frac wellheads and frac manifolds from Robbins & Myers.","For the third quarter, we believe that revenues for our Completion & Production Solutions segment could improve in the mid-to-high single-digit percentage range, as we continue to see increasing demand for our well intervention and stimulation equipment, as well as improved revenues for floating production and subsea businesses.","And for the quarter, depending on the overall mix, we could see a slight uptick in operating margins, as we benefit from increasing demand for our well stimulation equipment and associated consumables.","Now let's transition to the capital equipment orders for our Completion & Production Solutions segment. During the quarter, the segment had very strong bookings of $1.1 billion, which was partially offset by almost $600 million of shipments out of backlog, resulting in a 1.8 times book-to-bill and a quarter ending record backlog of $2.1 billion for the segment. Of the $1.1 billion in new orders, approximately 70% of the total was driven by production related equipment and 30% from our well intervention and stimulation equipment businesses.","As we move into the third quarter, we believe the new orders for production equipment will slow substantially owing to timing of projects, but the new orders for coiled tubing units and pressure pumping equipment should strengthen resulting in a book-to-bill for the Completion & Production Solutions segment that could approach if not exceed 1-to-1.","While on the topic of backlog and book-to-bill, it\u2019s important to note that only 53% of the segment\u2019s second quarter revenue came out of backlog, as the remaining portion of this business is selling quick turn spare parts and consumables to support and\/or enhance the equipment that we sell from this segment.","Now that we\u2019ve walked through the new segments, let's turn to the remaining elements of National Oilwell Varco's consolidated second quarter 2014 income statement. Gross margin improved to 130 basis points sequentially and 150 basis points year-over-year to 27.7%. SG&A increased $38 million sequentially and $54 million year-over-year. However, as a percentage of revenue, it has remained relatively flat at 9.7%.","Nonrecurring items primarily related to the spin-off of the distribution business totaled $32 million in the quarter. Interest expense increased $1 million sequentially to $27 million and interest income increased $1 million to $5 million. Equity income in our Voest-Alpine JV was strong at $23 million, as the JV experienced across the board increases in sales of green tube, OCTG and line pipe. But as it\u2019s typically the case, we do expect a significant decline in equity income in the third quarter, as the plant will be shut down for two weeks for routine maintenance.","Other expense for the quarter was $21 million versus zero in the first quarter. As you may remember in the first quarter we benefited from favorable movements in currencies and we also recognized a gain on the sale of fixed assets. By contrast, in the second quarter we incurred losses related to foreign exchange, slight losses on the sale of fixed assets as well as higher bank fees.","The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 31.8%, which was higher than the 30.4% rate that we posted in the first quarter of 2014, as we recognized a much higher percentage of U.S. generated income in the quarter. Given our belief that the U.S. will continue to be a source of growth in the third quarter, we expect an effective tax rate of 32% to 33% to the balance of the year.","And finally, if you turn to the last supplemental schedule, you'll see that depreciation and amortization was $190 million, down $1 million from the first quarter. And EBITDA, excluding transaction charges, was $1.1 billion, or 21.1% of sales.","Turning to the balance sheet, I would like to start by highlight a few key points in the quarter. Number one, we continue to see the results of our focus on working capital. Number two, we continue to strategically deploy capital into our business through acquisitions that complement our existing businesses and through infrastructure investments to improve efficiencies to shorten lead times, improve customer service and enhance competitive advantage. And three, we provided our shareholders with a much larger dividend.","Our June 30, 2014 balance sheet employed working capital, excluding cash, of $5.2 billion, down $1.2 billion sequentially. Accounts receivable decreased $883 million, or 17% sequentially, with the reduction being driven by a combination of the DNOW spinoff and strong collections by NOV businesses where accounts receivable from continuing operations were down $130 million despite a $366 million sequential increase in revenue.","We also continue to realize improvements in customer financing where milestone invoicing on major projects outpaced cost incurred by $50 million. Inventory decreased $461 million, or 8%, with an $844 million reduction associated with the distribution spin being partly offset by $383 million build in our continuing operations to execute a record backlog and to support heightening demand for our products in the U.S. market.","Capital spending in the quarter was $175 million due to several significant ongoing operational expansion efforts. Dividend payments were $198 million, representing an $87 million sequential increase. The remaining uses of cash included tax payments of $572 million, cash interest payments of $45 million, acquisitions of $100 million and $253 million in cash with distribution NOW.","As a result, the company generated free cash flow as defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures from continuing operations of $610 million, which was a 69% increase sequentially. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.9 billion and a net cash position of $737 million. Of the $3.9 billion in cash, only 7% of the balance was in the U.S. at June 30.","Now let me turn it back to Clay.","Clay Williams","Thank you, Jeremy. So to sum it up this morning, we're pleased to report strong double-digit earnings growth both sequential and year-over-year for our second quarter, record backlogs for both Rig Systems and Completion & Production Solutions with both posting book-to-bills north of 1 in the quarter, a 77% increase in our regular dividend during the quarter, completion of a $3.5 billion spinout to our shareholders of an exciting new public company, a whole bunch of new granular disclosure, and our path forward to develop and communicate our strategic plan.","So with that, Shannon, I think we\u2019re ready to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Jeff Tillery from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","Hi, good morning, guys.","Clay Williams","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","As you think about the M&A program, just could you give us color around kind of businesses that require things are interesting, kind of where you see the best opportunities?","Clay Williams","Yeah, Jeff, generally as I noted in my opening comments, we have a lot of conversations underway. They are generally with smaller companies. And I think I mentioned, we have closed five transactions year-to-date that I think are indicative of kind of what that population looks like. I will continue to -- I would say the flavor of this is continued investment in our aftermarket support of the growing installed base of rig equipment. And so a couple of these have to do with that strategic thrust. We have a lot going on in our tubular services world and have seen great organic growth and acquisition growth in our capability to repair tubular around the globe and we will continue to invest in that.","But kind of the overarching theme here is generally I think we\u2019re seeing smaller transactions and believe that those offer a better purchase economics. The bigger these deals become the more attention they attract. And when that happens, generally the price goes up, the multiples go up and our returns go down. So we\u2019re looking forward. I would really like to put more focus on those smaller transactions and benefit from the higher economics that they can bring to our operation.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","Great. And the second question I have is just around rig systems. Obviously with kind of the segment recasting, some of the benchmarks we\u2019ve had historically have moved. But as you think about kind of the medium to longer-term margin goals, is that still in kind of the low-to mid 20s, is that how you think about it a normalized margin for the Rig Systems segment?","Jeremy Thigpen","I think low-20s is probably more accurate for normalized margins. As you remember part of our margin enhancement story was around growth in certain product lines that were accretive to overall rig -- the old rig tech margins. Those have now moved into the Aftermarket segment and of course the Completion & Production Solutions segment. So I think low 20s normalized margins is probably appropriate.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","Thank you very much.","Clay Williams","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","Good morning, guys.","Clay Williams","Good morning, Jim.","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","You mentioned challenges going forward in Brazil and China. And I know the flex pipe plant in Brazil is little behind the schedule and getting flowing operational. Can you talk to us little bit about Brazil? What to expect? What\u2019s going on? What should we see over the next 12 months or so in Brazil?","Clay Williams","The other good news is so far so good in Brazil, Jim. We\u2019re working on about a half dozen rigs currently. The first should be delivered in September of next year. And so we\u2019re getting well into this build out of -- for NOV 21 deepwater floaters for that market. All of our customers are pressing ahead. And so I would say so far so good. To put in perspective, it\u2019s building in terms of its contribution quarter by quarter. So in the second quarter, we did about $180 million in revenue within rig systems associated with that effort. And the challenges that we were referring to stem from a couple of things, one is that we won that work if you recall back in the 2009-2010 time period when pricing was under pressure. So the margins are good, but they're not great. And so the intrinsic margins in the work is a little lower than the rest of our backlog.","Number two, it\u2019s Brazil. We\u2019ve been in networking Brazil for 30-plus years, a very challenging from a regulatory standpoint, from local content requirement standpoint, from a tax standpoint, from a foreign currency standpoint. So we\u2019re just being a realistic about the incremental margins that will continue to flow from Brazil as we get deeper and deeper into the program, but again operationally so far so good.","And to round up the picture, we're very excited about the about expansion that we\u2019ve had underway in Brazil to support both that new construction as well as all of the rigs that we have at work in Brazil, supporting those on an ongoing basis from an aftermarket standpoint. So these are sort of dual purpose facilities. And I think middle of next year we\u2019re going to open our riser manufacturing plant. We\u2019ve got t other expansion initiatives going on around Brazil and so it will continue to be a very, very important market for us.","On China, the other part of the comment, we\u2019ve seen a lot of our offshore rig building work shift into Chinese shipyards predominantly with jack-ups, although there is a few semi\u2019s coming together in Chinese yards as well. And what we know from experience and to be clear, we work closely with Chinese shipyards a quite a bit in the past. But we know from experience is sometimes those projects can be a little more challenging, but we\u2019re not losing a lot of sleep over the China, China shift is just again being realistic. We know that sometimes it's a little more challenging in those yards vis-\u00e0-vis the yards in Korea or the yards in Singapore.","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","Okay. Not sound bad for Brazil considering everybody else\u2019s issues there. My follow-up if I could in completion production. Coiled tubing, you mentioned coiled tubing a couple of times, demand for coiled tubing is picking up. That has been one segment that has lagged from an operating point of view in the U.S. Is your pickup in demand in coiled tubing primarily international? Are we seeing demand pickup in the U.S. as well?","Clay Williams","Most of the incremental is U.S. and North America really, a lot of demand for components going into the larger diameter coiled tubing, so a lot of the incremental coiled tubing demand is around 2-inch. 2-3\/8 inch, 2-5\/8 inch diameters and so real trailers and the injector heads going into modify and upgrade actually over coiled tubing units is a trend we've seen lightly, but generally a lot of orders on the upswing and a lot more optimism about that market.","The international market has remained steadier. It didn\u2019t fall off the same way North America did. And so we\u2019re seeing some resume demand overseas as well, but it never plummeted the way North America did back in 2012 and 2013.","Jeremy Thigpen","","Yeah. And in early \u201913 we saw slight drop in demand internationally and some of the U.S. based customers were shipping excess equipment overseas to fulfill needs, but in the back half of \u201913, we started to see more orders for new coiled tubing units going into the international markets and it has been pretty steady.","Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse","That\u2019s encouraging across the broad. Okay. Thank you very much, gentlemen.","Clay Williams","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets","Good morning.","Clay Williams","Hi, Kurt.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets","Again, I just wanted to follow up, you talked about the prospects looking at varying dynamics to return additional cash to shareholders and one of the, I guess, bottlenecks in that process have been the fact that you have only 37% of your existing cash in the U.S. So in that context, I just wondered if could provide us with maybe some insights on how you maybe able to accomplish some of those goals in terms of returning more cash to shareholders? And how serious the consideration doing the levered recap might be?","Clay Williams","The first, it\u2019s 7% of our cash in the U. S., but you say 37%?","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets","Yeah. I\u2019m sorry. I must have misheard what you said on the call. Thanks for clarifying that.","Clay Williams","Only 7%, so we are essentially dividending out our U.S. cash flow. So it\u2019s already pushing the envelope in the U.S. And so yes, internally we are looking at different ways to get cash back in the U.S. in the tax efficient manner. It is challenging, but we\u2019re certainly doing that. To next question?","Jeremy Thigpen","","Yeah. So, $3.5 billion plus in cash overseas, some of the things we\u2019re looking at presently are ways to repatriate that and to improve the ability to repatriate U.S. cash generated overseas, which would give us more flexibility around either share buyback or upping the dividend with that cash we have on our balance sheet. And we\u2019re alternatively looking for really good, solid acquisitions overseas or probably a combination of both and this is what we\u2019re looking at, Kurt.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets","So it\u2019s a levered recap, not necessarily the forefront of your thoughts.","Clay Williams","Not in the near-term and probably I think I detailed the fact that our new segments, the new segment leaders are going through a deep dive on strategic reviews, the strategic plans of their businesses this summer. And so first thing first is to get the strategic. We\u2019re not expecting major departures, but let\u2019s get settled on the strategic plans going forward and the capital needs around those. And then I think that will then lead us into a conversation later this year around the new opportunities to return capital to shareholders.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, great. Thanks. And then my follow-up question is just on the Rig Systems second half outlook on the order book. We can make our own guesses and assumptions as we have in the past, you provided some general directional guidance of being -- having book-to-bill being under 1. There is a big range of that. So are we talking about an absolute plummet in orders in the back half of the year or more of a -- I\u2019d say more of a gradual decline?","Clay Williams","Yeah. Kurt, over the last two quarters, we provided a little more granularity into our order intake and really broken out what was from new build construction for jack-ups and floaters versus everything else. I wouldn\u2019t call everything else a baseline because that fluctuates each quarter as well, but it will give you some indication as to what we think each orders could look like in that space. And then we also provided some guidance that we think jack-ups could continue to be strong in Q3 and fairly steady in Q4. So probably back into a number that way.","Jeremy Thigpen","Yeah. We\u2019re not going to zero. Let me clear on that. So, I mean, there is a lot of things cooking out there. Land rigs demand is ascending and it's a small piece now, but it's growing and growing quickly. And as Jeremy mentioned, we had a lot of jackups to push from Q2 to Q3 and so that outlook for the back half of year for jackups at least is pretty good.","And then I would add too, I touched on a number of specific floating rig opportunities that are continuing to work out there around 20,000 PSI capabilities, around Arctic capabilities and so even in the floater space it's not going to zero. So we can't, I'm not sure we can be a lot more quantitative than that but direction that's where the three main groups are going.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets","All right. I think that helps to clarify. And if I may just sneak one more point -- pointing on your guidance relating to the wellbore technology group, you had a significant increase in revenue sequentially, you have indicated a 13% even with the breakup in Canada and now suggesting a more moderate sequential increase into the third quarter even with the Canadian rebound? Just trying to help, you can try to help connect the dots there because it appears to us that rig activity, well activities on the rise in U.S. you got a rebound in Canada. So just not quite sure why the sequential increase would be say more than half or what it was in the second quarter?","Clay Williams","Yeah. I think there is a possibility for that, Kurt. But really what we've seen in this segment historically and really think a back to our PS&S businesses. When activity starts to pick up and customers work to their inventory, they start -- they kind of start to buy in bulk and add some inventory, so they are not compromise if activity continues to grow. So we think there was a little bit of that going on in the second quarter and don\u2019t know if that will continue in the third or they just kind of go to replenishing inventories if they consume at that point in time.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. That\u2019s great. That was great color. Perfect. Thank you, guys.","Jeremy Thigpen","Thanks, Kurt.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Sanchez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil","Thanks. Good morning.","Clay Williams","Hi. Good morning.","Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil","Clay or Jeremy, I was hoping perhaps maybe you can give us an outlook on two things. One, I know this is second quarter and now you discussed the expectation of book-to-bill and rig systems going below 1. Just curious if you had any thoughts on the duration of how long you might see book-to-bill stay below that target. I guess my first question is my follow-up? I got to believe the revenue capacity or the revenue efficiency continues to increase, I know Jeremy, you able to give us an expectation on aftermarket growth year-over-year? Is there any thought as we look \u201814 and maybe even next year, what type of topline growth we could perhaps expect out of rig systems?","Clay Williams","","Well, the first question, Bill, with regards to the duration of this downturn. We\u2019re not sure, we believe, it's not a one quarter dip. We get at least a few quarters and it could extend beyond that overall.","Long-term our outlook is still very, very bright. There\u2019s an awful lot of development drilling and expiration drilling that still needs to go on in deepwater basins require floating rigs. So we think the fundamental demand is there. But a lot of capacity flowing into the market last year, this year, next year is giving rise to this.","I mentioned some of the special purpose rigs that we\u2019re looking at, another kind of interesting set of conversations. We\u2019ve got a couple of folks looking at 2017, 2018 not seeing any floater delivery scheduled outside of Brazil and thinking of maybe opportunities to introduce to go ahead and sign-up for newbuilds to try to hit that point in the market when very few new rigs are coming in and so there\u2019s a lot of conversations that are underway.","So, our expectation is we\u2019re headed for a cyclical soft patch here. I\u2019m not sure have a lot of insight to offer around how long that might last. With regards to what your, I am sorry, your second question was topline growth for which segments?","Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil","The rig system around the capacity.","Clay Williams","","Yeah. The -- that we have a lot of visibility into a $15.4 billion of firm orders and you kind of do the math, that means we\u2019ve got a couple of years of work ahead of us with rising prospect for land rigs and so far continued demand for jackups as well for at least the next couple quarters. And so, not prepared at this point to give you a number year-to-year \u201914, \u201915, what that might look like, but certainly orders will not be the gating item.","As you correctly point out, we've been adding a lot of capacity throughout our infrastructure to deal with record backlog, a lot of challenges in the supply chain to deal with these record backlogs and so a lot of continued capacity coming online to handle this work to connect the dots there, though, if the downturn in floater demand does stay down a while, we\u2019re not overly concerned because we foresee a big pickup in special periodic surveys, particularly as we move into 2017. I think this is something I reference to my comments as well.","Every five years, all floating rigs need to come back to the shipyard for whole inspections and for drilling equipment to be inspected and the recertified and get new certificates of compliance. And when we look at the demographics of the birth years of the growing offshore fleet, what we see is, they\u2019re all starting to stack up 2017 and 2018. And so, there is going to be a lot of work for us to do even if it's not necessarily building as many new deepwater floaters as have in past.","Jeremy Thigpen","","And specifically to your question, Bill, in terms of revenue conversion out of backlog, we had the big capacity, the major capacity additions in 2012 and early 2013. We\u2019re not getting comfortable with those additions. And if you look, we've been running at between $2 billion and $2.2 billion in revenue out of backlog for the last couple of few quarters and I think that's probably a reasonable proxy for the future.","Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil","Yeah. That\u2019s helpful, Jeremy. Just to quantify that, I appreciate it. If I could ask just one more, with regard to the amortization of intangible assets, as we look through the press release, I just try to basically identify that back to specific segment or segments, Jeremy. Is that concentrated in one particular area, we try to reconcile what maybe the\u2026","Jeremy Thigpen","It really show that but if you look at the difference between EBIT margins, EBITDA margins, you can see that disconnect really and it\u2019s really Wellbore Technologies primarily but also in Completion & Production Solutions.","Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil","Okay.","Clay Williams","And little bit in rig\u2026","Jeremy Thigpen","In rig, but not as pronounces as it is in those two segments.","Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil","But as we look at the restated numbers, I mean, if apple like, at least the first quarter comparison, that\u2019s an apples-to-apples comparison as we think about the 2Q?","Clay Williams","Correct.","Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil","Okay, great.","Clay Williams","By the way, on that topic, we\u2019re going to continue to break out. It will be running about $0.14 a share. I think we get 10 quarters going back historically on our tear sheet. You can see its $0.13%, $0.14, $0.15 every quarter. So it\u2019s a pretty level load and we will be disclosing that separately from our non-recurring transaction charges.","Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil","Great. I appreciate the time. I\u2019ll turn it back ","Clay Williams","Thanks.","Operator","Our final question comes from Waqar Syed from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs","Thank you for taking my question. In terms of the five-year surveys, we\u2019ve seen some offshore drillers defer or even cancel this five-year surveys innovating for better visibility in markets. Are you seeing that in your discussions with the offshore drillers and how does that factor into your guidance on aftermarket business for the coming years?","Clay Williams","Waqar, I think they maybe able defer that but they need do it before they go back to work because it\u2019s a statutory, I think regulatory requirements. It\u2019s been required for decades and it\u2019s the practice across the industry that every five years these come in.","We've been in the industry dialog around how to make that more efficient. Because right now, we\u2019ve been on a run rate of about 40 rigs a year going into shipyards and as I mentioned earlier, see that going up to 130 in 2017, that\u2019s just based on NOV delivered kit. And we\u2019re going to have to do some thing different to accommodate that. That's a tremendous amount of work.","And so, we're exploring with the industry ideas to make that more efficient. We\u2019ve also reorganized internally to bring some of our project management expertise within Rig Systems to bear on these projects. The planning for these is critical. As you can imagine, taking your rig off day rate, putting in a shipyard to accommodate this periodic survey has a high opportunity cost because it\u2019s off day rate.","So, our customer want to get as much done as they can while that rig is in the shipyard. And that can be made much more efficient and minimize opportunity cost if a lot of very tight planning goes into that project well in advance and as long as we can get out to the rigs and survey the equipment. And so, our plan is to try to work with the industry to build better way that\u2019s more efficient and enables them to get the rigs through with -- and minimize the opportunity costs associated with that requirement.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs","So, just to understand in your forecast are you assuming any major regular time of order rates or you feel that every single rig that\u2019s due for five-year surveys gets that done?","Clay Williams","Well, I mean if rigs are not on contract at the time, I suppose they may be able to defer. I don\u2019t know that for sure but nevertheless there\u2019s a lot of new iron out there required by the Coast Guard to come in. So I think that\u2019s a fairly save bet on our perspective.","Jeremy Thigpen","The other thing to point out to is that we\u2019re in conversations with these customers a year in advance of their [FDA] (ph) surveys .So, we know if and when they are coming in and what kind of aggregates they are going to require. This part of that challenge and kind of streamlining this process that Clay was talking about. So, we know what\u2019s coming in.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Great. Now just one last on the Chinese shipyard regarding jackups. Are you -- there is also a view that's being floated around by the offshore drillers saying that many of the rigs that are being built, the jackups are being built in Chinese shipyards may not actually get built. Are you hitting any cancellations there, any concern at the part of the shipyards that the rigs may not get built?","Clay Williams","No the -- I think what you\u2019re referring to the Chinese -- generally we\u2019re offering very attractive terms, for instance, 10% down 90% at delivery. So China is financing the build out of these rigs and whether or not the customer shows up and makes the final payment or not. We\u2019ve got very, very strong contracts with our customers there. And so we\u2019re not concerned about this.","We went through a massive downturn economically in 2009 and had a very small, I think 2%, 3%, 4% of our backlog where customers defaulted in the projects one away. So I think we demonstrated before our contracts are pretty solid and our expectation is that our customers in China are going to see those projects through and that\u2019s -- many of these too. Although they are not necessarily contracted now. You\u2019ve got to Pemex talking about picking up a dozen rigs next year and other 20 or 30 few years after that. Lot of interest out of the Far East, India. So there is a lot of jackup interest out there and in the final thing is if you look at the demographics of the jackup rig is what you're seeing here is retooling, rejuvenating that fleet in earnest and that\u2019s the fundamental driver for demand for these rigs.","Jeremy Thigpen","Yeah. And to be clear, we\u2019re not offering that financing to our shipyard. Customers\u2026.","Clay Williams","That\u2019s right.","Jeremy Thigpen","And in fact, we\u2019re getting paid as we go.","Clay Williams","Right.","Jeremy Thigpen","We stay cash positive, cash neutral at worst on these projects.","Clay Williams","Yes. Thank you, Jeremy and it\u2019s an important point.","Waqar Syed-Goldman Sachs","All right. Well, thank you, very much. Thanks guys ","Clay Williams","Thank you ","Jeremy Thigpen","Thank you Waqar.","Clay Williams","Well, that wraps up our call. We appreciate everyone joining us and look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Thanks very much ","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Loren Singletary, Vice President of Investor and Industry Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Loren Singletary - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Thank you, Esther, and welcome everyone to the National Oilwell Varco third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With me today is Clay Williams, President, CEO and Chairman of National Oilwell Varco, and Jose Bayardo, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin this discussion of National Oilwell Varco's financial results for its third quarter ended on September 30, 2016, please note that some of the statements we make during this call may contain forecasts, projections and estimates, including, but not limited to, comments about our outlook for the company's business.","These are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws based on limited information as of today, which is subject to change.

We also use the other non-GAAP measures as described in the press release.","Later, on this call, we will answer your questions, which we ask you to limit to two in order to permit more participation.","Now, let me turn the call over to Clay.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Thank you, Loren. During the third quarter, National Oilwell Varco began to see some improved demand in certain of our businesses, mostly in North America where the rig count grew 28% sequentially. For the first time since the downturn began, we posted top line growth in our wellbore technologies and completion and production solutions segments.","We also saw our cost reductions began to outpace the steep declines in revenues we've seen through the past seven quarters, as three of our four segments posted higher margins due to aggressive cost reductions.","Since the downturn began in late 2014, our revenues have declined 71% reflecting the severe stress, the oil and gas industry has been under. Our customers have slashed spending to the lowest levels possible and the oil and gas industry has delayed or canceled future projects totaling over 7 million barrels of oil per day. 2015 saw the lowest level of new reserve discoveries globally since 1947; only about 10% of the average annual discovery volumes through the past 50 years according to Wood Mackenzie and in 2016, the U.S. is forecast to see the lowest number of wells drilled since 1933.","The 2.2 million barrel per day decline in non-OPEC production since 2014 has been fully offset by rising OPEC production which achieved record levels this summer along with Russian production which achieved record levels in September. Overall, we believe OPEC to be producing at near maximum levels with little remaining excess capacity cushion which has delayed the inevitable rebalancing of the world oil markets.","Nevertheless, time is on our side as OPEC faces rising challenges to grow production further and as dwindling oil field expenditures accelerate production declines through the rest of the world. Faced with extraordinary revenue declines and significant price discounting in all areas of our business, we've aggressively reduced costs and improved efficiency, enabling NOV to manage EBITDA decremental leverage to only 28% since the end of 2014.","We're on track to obtain $3.1 billion in annual structural contractor and workforce cost reductions by year-end. Thanks to the hard work of the experienced, capable management team that Jos\u00e9, Lauren and I are honored to serve with. This downturn has been extraordinarily painful on them and our entire organization. They have worked hard to insource wherever possible and to keep our plants loaded to maximize absorption, but we have nevertheless been forced to reduce our workforce 43% from peak levels and have closed or are closing 286 facilities globally.","For the seventh quarter in a row, we have made significant reductions our costs to match available demand while also continuing to invest in emerging opportunities we see such as the pending acquisition of Fjords Processing from Akastor that we highlighted in our press release last night.","Fjords Processing is a global leader in providing processing technology systems and services to the upstream oil and gas industry. Fjords technology solutions include sulfate removal, oil and produced water treatment and hydrate inhibition that efficiently address critical needs for both onshore and offshore operators. The acquisition provides complementary technology for our Completions & Production Solutions Segment. We expect that our combined operations will leverage the collective organizations' global infrastructure to reduce costs and achieve broader channels to market for the valves, pumps, and composite tubulars that NOV already produces. Additionally, we believe the capabilities obtained through the transaction will be leveraged by other business units and will benefit certain initiatives that are ongoing within NOV. We're excited about the capabilities that Fjords processing, the capabilities that it brings to our platform and we are eager to welcome the talented employees of Fjords to NOV when the transaction closes which we expect to occur before year-end.","As we highlighted on prior calls NOV's strategy is centered on the most promising areas for future production. North American shale technologies, international markets like the Middle East and Russia and deepwater improvements. We've used this downturn thus far to position the company for the inevitable upturn closing four small acquisitions in the third quarter bring our total to nine year-to-date.","We foresee significant opportunities in the upturn: precise geosteering, directional drilling to produce longer horizontal laterals, closed-loop drilling automation and optimization, completion tools, hydraulic fracture stimulation techniques, new subsea production technologies and condition-based equipment monitoring will be the big winners in the next upcycle. NOV is at the forefront in each area and our R&D investments and acquisitions are tightly focused on these promising trends.","At this point, I'll ask Jose to review our financial results with you.","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Thank you, Clay and good morning everyone. For the third quarter of 2016 National Oilwell Varco reported a net loss of $1.36 billion or $3.62 per fully diluted share on a U.S. GAAP basis. Excluding other items totaling $1.09 billion net loss for the quarter was $128 million or $0.34 per share. Total company revenues for the third quarter of 2016 were $1.65 billion down 5% from the second quarter of 2016 and down 50% from the third quarter of 2015.","EBITDA was $68 million, an improvement of $43 million from the second quarter as our efforts to reduce costs and optimize our operations outpaced the decline in revenues. Our Completion & Production Solutions segment generated revenues of $543 million during the third quarter of 2016, up $5 million sequentially and down $255 million compared to the third quarter of 2015.","Revenues increased on incremental sales coiled tubing and completion related equipment partially offset by fewer sales of primarily offshore oriented production equipment including offshore conductor pipe connectors and flexible pipe.","EBITDA for the segment was $43 million or 7.9% of sales, a decrease of $14 million from the previous quarter and an $82 million decline from the prior year. The decrease in sequential EBITDA was primarily attributable to changes in revenue mix and certain inventory and receivable charges.","In the third quarter, we recognized $319 million in revenue from backlog, down $14 million from the second quarter of 2016. New orders were $184 million, down $85 million or 32% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill equal to 58% and a quarter ending backlog of $812 million.","Our Wellbore Technologies segment generated $526 million in revenue during the third quarter, up 3% sequentially from $511 million and down 37% from the third quarter of 2015. As mentioned in our press release, we are very encouraged by the performance of our short-cycle businesses within the segment as they posted sequential revenue growth of approximately 15% within the North American marketplace.","EBITDA for the segment was $26 million, an increase of $25 million from the previous quarter and down $100 million from the prior year. The strong sequential improvement in EBITDA was a result of achieving targeted cost reductions and our successful implementation of numerous process and efficiency improvements -- improvement initiatives across the segment.","Our Rig Aftermarket segment generated $322 million of revenue during the third quarter of 2016, down 12% from $364 million in the second quarter of 2016 and down 44% from the $570 million in the third quarter of 2015. Third quarter 2016 EBITDA for the segment was $81 million, up $8 million or 11% sequentially. EBITDA margins increased 510 basis points to 25.2% of sales.","Spare parts sales, service and repairs all experienced revenue declines during the third quarter; however, sales of spare parts declined more modestly than service and repairs from Q2 to Q3. The more favorable mix along with our cost reduction efforts drove the increase in EBITDA on lower revenue. Our Rig Systems segment generated revenues of $470 million during the third quarter of 2016, down 17% sequentially from $564 million and down 69% from the $1.5 billion posted in the third quarter of 2015. The revenue decline was in line with expectations as we continue to work through our backlog and bring projects to completion.","Third quarter EBITDA for the Rig Systems segment was $50 million, an increase of $1 million from the second quarter of 2016. EBITDA margins increased 190 basis points to 10.6% of sales.","As we described in a fair amount of detail last quarter, we've been extremely focused on standardizing processes, optimizing structures and eliminating redundancies in our global operations. These structural changes reduced our costs and improved our efficiencies during the quarter, enabling us to slightly increase EBITDA on a 17% decrease in revenue.","During the quarter we recognized $363 million in revenue from backlog, down 18% from the $441 million in the prior quarter as the segment continued to work down its backlog and slow the pace of delivery in the face of low order volumes and project delays.","New orders improved by $119 million sequentially or 180% to $185 million in the third quarter. Book-to-bill was 51%, marking the highest level achieved since the third quarter of 2014.","Included in the quarter's bookings were two land rigs. One of which is a highly specialized, harsh environment, extended reach rig destined for Alaska's North Slope. The two rig sales represent the first orders for new rigs since this time last year.","Other bookings during the quarter included several top drives, pedestal cranes for FPSOs, and pressure control equipment. Quarter ending backlog was $2.76 billion. We're encouraged by the two rig orders and are optimistic regarding near-term growth opportunities in land markets.","In North America, smaller contractors are looking to add more modern rigs to their fleet, and while most larger contractors don't expect a need for new land build orders until the second half of 2017, they're expressing strong interest in improving the pressure and torque capabilities of their existing AC rig fleets through upgraded 7,500-PSI mud systems, new top-drives and iron roughnecks.","Customers in international land markets are also expressing interest in equipment upgrades as well as new build programs, particularly in the Middle East, Russia, and Latin America.","While the outlook for land markets around the world appears promising, in recognition of further deterioration in outlook for the offshore new build market, we took a $972 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge associated with our offshore rig systems business unit during the third quarter of 2016. The diminished outlook is based on the accelerating restructuring process in the offshore market which is reflected in early contract terminations by operators and in the stacking and scrapping of rigs by drilling contractors.","Looking at a few select items in the P&L, interest and other financial costs decreased $5 million, primarily due to the reduction in commercial paper balances as well as certain charges that occurred in the second quarter that were not expected to repeat.","Our effective tax rate, excluding other items was 16.7%. As a reminder in the current environment relatively small changes in discrete items or the split between domestic and international results can have a disproportionate impact on our tax rates. In the fourth quarter, we expect the tax rate to be approximately 30%.","Turning to the balance sheet. During the quarter, as I previously mentioned we paid off our full commercial paper balance of $110 million, leaving us with $4.5 billion of availability in our facility. At September 30, 2016, our cash balance was $1.5 billion, total debt was $3.2 billion, and our debt to capitalization ratio was 17.8%.","In summary, I think this quarter's financial results reflect the tremendous job the team at NOV has done to resize the business, cut costs, and optimize our operations. While certain elements of our business are showing signs of improvement, organization remains focused on fine-tuning our operations, developing, delivering valuable solutions for customers, and preparing to capitalize on our market recovery.","With that I'll turn the call back over to Clay.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Thank you, Jose. I'll offer some additional color and guidance for each of our segments beginning with our Completion and Production Solutions segment, which as Jose mentioned saw its book to bill fall to 58%. This was due to sharply lower orders for conductor pipe connections and subsea flexible pipe. This was partly offset by higher demand for fiberglass pipe, which was up 39% sequentially, and completion equipment which was up 47% sequentially.","International demand picked up nicely for fracture stimulation equipment and wireline units but North American demand generally remains very low, outside of some budgetary equipment quotes and some rising demand for aftermarket spares for well stimulation equipment. We noted in the press release, our record 2-5\/8 inch coiled tubing string manufactured in the third quarter and we're seeing increasing interest in larger diameter coiled tubing units and strings that can traverse longer laterals in North America.","We also believe that international markets are keenly focused on hydraulic fracture techniques pioneered in North America, so the stage is set for more widespread application of these enabling technologies overseas in 2017.","Within our fiberglass pipe unit we saw rising demand for flowlines in North America offsetting lower marine offshore pipe demand in Asia. Our fiberglass flowlines offer corrosion proof solutions for well tie-backs, and the rising level of drilling activity in West Texas as well as continued large sales into Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the Middle East lifted this group's backlog 14% sequentially.","The new completion tools business we acquired in July is off to a great start, with wins in Canada and Russia where we secured a pilot project for our Bulldog annulus Frac system to run this quarter. And we believe our cemented sliding sleeve technology and burst port system offer a superior solution for multi-stage horizontal wells. We are also advancing new ideas in completion technology that we look forward to sharing with you on future calls.","Revenues for process and flow technologies improved slightly during the third quarter, with further improvements expected in Q4, as we benefit from higher demand for artificial lift products, process equipment and production chokes. As I mentioned earlier Fjords Processing will contribute meaningfully to this business in 2017. Our offshore products within Completion & Production Solutions continue to face challenging market prospects due to the very low level of offshore projects globally a situation that we believe may improve in the second half of 2017.","While Brazil demand for subsea flexible pipe has remained comparatively strong through the downturn, orders for Brazil dipped sharply during the third quarter. Elsewhere around the globe, our flexible subsea pipe business has seen several quarters of very low demand, driving intense pricing pressures and reducing average margins within our flexible pipe backlog. Nevertheless, we continue to win smaller tie-back jobs and we expect Brazil orders to rebound this quarter, leading to modest sequential revenue gains.","We're also continuing to engineer unique floating production unit topside modules within our cooperative agreement with GE, including our unique small field Honeybee and Minibee FPSO designs which we will complete by early 2017. During the quarter we had a customer engage us in a paid study to apply these to their field development plan in the Barents Sea.","So overall we see some green shoots emerging for many of our products, but others continuing to slide, a theme that we see across other segments as well. Looking into the fourth quarter we expect Completion & Production Solutions segment to improve in the mid-single digit percentage range at solid incrementals, due to additional cost reductions.","Wellbore Technologies benefited from shorter cycle products and services in the third quarter which comprised about 80% of this segments revenue, with drill pipe sales making up most of the balance. Rig reactivations in North America drove higher demand for our shorter cycle businesses like downhole drilling tools, including new bits and new drilling motors that we've introduced through the downturn as more than 90% of the US fleet is drilling directionally and horizontally today.","Our Wellsite Services solids control business posted excellent sequential growth and margin improvements too on rising demand in West Texas, where we are beginning to claw back certain pricing concessions by charging more for items like freight and mobilization. While there are about 10 months of oil country tubular goods inventory on the ground in the US, half of this is for the offshore. So our pipe mill and processor customers got busier in the third quarter working on casing sizes that fit shale drilling, driving better results for our Tuboscope pipe inspection services.","Drillpipe margins improved significantly in the third quarter, owing to a near record mix of premium large diameter pipe. However, backlogs remain very low for this business and we expect Q4 to face significant headwinds on a poor mix and much lower volumes.","2017 looks better for drillpipe, as we start to see higher demand for 5.5-inch premium drillpipe to drill longer, larger diameter laterals. We will be enhancing our market-leading drillpipe technology with the launch of our new delta premium connection technology in the fourth quarter, which offers much faster make-up times, higher torques, much reduced risk of thread galling, improving drilling efficiencies, and reducing total cost of ownership for our customers. And our new track ID product attaches RFID chips to the pipe, enabling contractors to automatically tally pipe on trips and track pipe in inventory, including the specific history of each joint of drillpipe.","We're also seeing higher demand for our IntelliServ wired drillpipe owing to growing success in using its high-speed data link to downhole instruments to improve drilling efficiency and wellbore placement. While these advancements paint a bright future for drillpipe demand given near-term mix and volume pressures in drillpipe we remain cautious on our outlook for Q4. While demand is growing in North America and we continue to see rising interest in our closed-loop drilling automation services, the segment is also seeing increasing price pressure in many of its traditional businesses in international markets.","For the fourth quarter, we expect Wellbore Technologies revenues to decline slightly. And we expect EBITDA to remain roughly flat. As continued cost reductions are offset by international pricing pressures and lower drillpipe sales and margins.","Rig Aftermarket posted a 12% sequential decline in revenues in the third quarter, but saw improved EBITDA up by about $8 million. Parts, service, and repair all declined in the quarter partly due to evaporation of SPS work on offshore vessels. The cost reductions and rig reactivations in West Texas as well as a higher mix of spare parts helped offset the impact of lower revenues.","The group performed its first top drive rebuilds and our new facility in Russia during the third quarter. It is also aggressively pursuing condition-based monitoring opportunities. Our predictive failure monitoring system for subsea BOP stacks has notified our customers of potential regulator valve wear on 11 separate occasions, which enabled them to avoid unplanned lost time in drilling operations.","We are now working on similar pilot products for top drives and mud pump failures and we believe there's a tremendous market for condition-based predictive monitoring of equipment across the industry. Again, NOV is leading the way in bringing practical big data driven enhancements to the operations to our customers.","Nevertheless, the bulk of Rig Aftermarket's business is spare parts sales and service into our considerable installed base of equipment offshore.","Given the financial stress the offshore drilling industry is enduring, rig aftermarket will continue to face near-term headwinds. We expect the fourth quarter to see mid-single digit revenue declines for the rig aftermarket segment and margins to compress a few 100 basis points, owing to mix between spare parts sales and repair services.","Our Rig Systems segment posted significantly higher sequential orders, owing to two land rigs booked in the quarter. But demand nevertheless remains very weak, with book-to-bill of only 51%.","Orders for equipment for the land market significantly outpaced offshore equipment demand in the quarter, reducing our offshore mix within our backlog to 81%. Revenue fell 17% sequentially, but the segment managed to hold EBITDA flat at $50 million, or 10.6% of sales, due primarily to lower execution costs on offshore rig construction in Asia and cost reductions elsewhere around the world.","Major offshore new build rig construction project revenue totaled about $200 million in the quarter; about 12% of our consolidated revenue. And overall demand for offshore equipment remains very low, despite a few conversations about potential new platform rigs.","Offshore drilling contractors continue to only order replacement equipment for unplanned outages or worn-out equipment they can't otherwise cannibalize from stacked rigs or access elsewhere. Our outlook for demand for land rigs is much brighter, as we have several inquiries for new land rigs for North America and numerous tenders being let for rigs in international markets. For customers who have shrewdly observed that the upgraded rig fleet in North America had much to do with the shale revolution of the prior peak.","We believe 2017 will see meaningful resumption in demand for land equipment. As Jose mentioned, we are quoting upgrade packages for 7,500 psi mud systems, higher torque and new NOVOS control systems required to drill longer laterals. In fact, top-drive sales in the land market picked up in the quarter due to the need for higher torque to execute longer laterals.","The financial stress offshore will continue to weigh heavily on the results for this segment. We expect the fourth-quarter revenues to decline in the mid-single digit percentage range, but margins to fall a few 100 basis points, as we face a mix shift to lower margin land opportunities, lower priced and lower margin offshore orders in our backlog, and increasingly challenging absorption loads.","So to summarize, at or near the bottom of an extraordinary down cycle, we see lots of cross-currents. After two years of brutal declines, growth in North America land and Middle East have been a welcome relief, and we are optimistic about activity in Russia.","On the other hand, our offshore customers remain very challenged and many international markets continue to slow, exacerbating pricing pressure. Nonetheless, NOV's diverse portfolio of critical technologies and strong liquidity make it well-positioned to benefit from a recovery in all corners of the oilfield.","Before we open the call to Q&A, let me take a moment to thank our many hard-working employees of our organization. You have done a tremendous job fighting the fight, navigating exceptionally tough times and positioning the company for a recovery. Thank you.","Esther, let's open up the call for questions from our audience.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much and congrats where there's some good execution in a tough market.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Thank you, Ole.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I think also the debate will be around rig technology over the next, say, several quarters as you implement or see the full effect of your very substantial cost reductions and in-sourcing on one hand. But on the other hand, I presume there is still a lot at near-term that just can't be done, given that you have a substantial backlog that still needs to ship before I presume you can truly optimize your production infrastructure. So could you talk a little bit about sort of these two crosscurrents and how you expect them to play out over the next couple of quarters? As well as how much of the manufacturing infrastructure that's typically used for offshore that can get filled with components for onshore activity?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","That's a great question, Ole. I know you're aware of this, but other listeners may not be: the same infrastructure makes top drives, iron roughnecks, pumps, all manner of equipment for both land and offshore. What we've been doing is, since demand has been down in both areas, we've continued to shrink our capacity and reduce our infrastructure, scaling down in view of the market demand.","But simultaneously, we are seeing a shift in our mix away from offshore, which really dominated our order book for the last decade plus, to land in 2017, 2018. And as we mention in our remarks, I think cause for some optimism there. Conversations are beginning. Tenders for land equipment are starting to be let. And it's very early days, but that's certainly a good and welcome relief. And that showed up in our orders in the third quarter, which grew off of some pretty low levels of orders in the preceding quarter.","So what we're facing is a shift towards the land business for kind of the next up-cycle. Right now, it's very, very cost-competitive. We're having to get very aggressive. And so the margin impact is certainly not positive early on in the cycle. But as this blossoms and as we get back into full recovery, we're much more optimistic.","So right now, the business is executing kind of a shift in that direction. What I would in particular highlight to you, though, we have a terrific management team that runs our rig business. They've been responding aggressively and in real-time to the lower levels of demand. In the third quarter, our business was down 82% from where we were two years ago.","So considering that the business posted double-digit EBITDA margins on 18% of the revenue we saw two years ago is an amazing accomplishment. What I, I'd like to offer more quantitative guidance around margins and rig, but, frankly, at this point in the cycle and given kind of the shift is underway; we're not able to really quantify the margins. But I do have an abundance of confidence in the ability of our team to continue reduce costs in the face of a more challenging market.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. So, maybe with that in mind, I can maybe ask a margin question in a different way. A number of your competitors and some of the other big service providers were talking about 800 rigs to 1,000 rigs in North America being the new 2,000 rigs. That's kind of the activity level that they expect will take out the old highs in terms of their onshore-centric revenues and profits. How do you think about that? You have a very large position in North America shale. What rig count do you think of as the rig count that will take out the old revenue and margin levels?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Well, the rig count is going to depend on a lot of things: the outlook, commodity prices, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So, not really prepared to jump out there with a number on the rig count. I think the important trend that underlies all of this is that the shale revolution really prompted the U.S. to be the major source of incremental growth for oil between 2011 and 2014 globally. And that was really enabled by better rig technology.","You've got the vast majority of oil produced in other regions around the globe. We have a lot of customers overseas looking at the impact of better rig technology in the U.S. And so as I look to sort of the next upturn, I think overseas markets are going to begin to adopt these AC rigs, higher-tier rigs. We're getting a lot of inbound interest on that.","What's interesting about NOV is we are really prepared to sort of offer the next generation of rigs. We have had great success using wire drillpipe, closed-loop automated drilling to let software machine-learning technologies drive those rigs to even higher levels of efficiency. And that's what has sparked a lot of interest and a lot of intrigue amongst our customer base, not just in North America, but elsewhere around the world.","So I think a lot of opportunity there. I think a lot of opportunity even upgrading the 800 AC rigs or 900 AC rigs across the North American market to be more pad-capable. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, 7,500 psi mud systems, higher torque packages. That's anywhere from $1 million to $4 million sort of opportunity for NOV per rig. So, a meaningful opportunity to upgrade.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks. I'll hand it back.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Curran with FBR Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Tom P. Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Good morning, guys.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Hi, Tom.","Tom P. Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Clay, curious, following-up on one of Ole's questions. You know, I know a lot of rig systems infrastructure can be allocated to either offshore or onshore projects. But if you were to take your total PP&E heading into this down cycle and then look at it exiting this quarter, what percentage of it roughly would you say is solely dedicated to onshore?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","You know, if you think about what we have, we have fabrication operations, we have machining operations. They can \u2013 I would say virtually all of it can be directed one place or the other. I mean, we \u2013 the only exceptions to that would probably be some key site facilities adjacent to a couple of our customers in Asia.","But I would say largely just about everything we do can be redirected to land versus offshore. And, for that matter, machine shops can be repurposed to make completion tools, and downhole tools and other things as well. So, there's a lot of that underway, Tom. But a lot of the PP&E, I would characterize it this way, a lot of the PP&E that we have across our system is multipurpose and can be used to manufacture really whatever the oil field needs.","Tom P. Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. And then as you have continued to make onshore infrastructure-oriented investments, could you share some color on the location and nature of that spending? As we've moved through the down cycle, where might we not appreciate the enhancements you have made that are onshore-directed?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Good question. And what I would tell you is a lot of focus on investment opportunities in Saudi Arabia, where we've opened new facilities and have plans to continue to do so in Russia. Both of those regions have more focus on local content. And that's, have been two areas where we've invested.","Generally, though, if you look at our CapEx, it was about $60 million this quarter. It's been working its way down. So the investments that we are making there are small and targeted to get a little more local content. But, we're lately we've been all about reducing capacity, not adding capacity.","Tom P. Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Sure. Understood that that's been the overall consolidated trend. Then following up on Russia then. Both you and Jose highlighted positive trends there in your opening remarks. I'm curious, now that the Kostroma plant has been up and running for a while, what impact have you noticed that's had? And what role would you expect Russia to play over the course of this next up-cycle? Do you expect it to become a meaningfully larger percentage of your international revenues?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Well, yeah, it's an important market. I think it's a great market opportunity. It's a market that I think would benefit from some of the technologies that we've highlighted on the call. We cut the ribbon on our Kostroma plant I was there in, I think, May or June to actually kick that off. And since then, as I mentioned, we have rebuilt a couple top drives. I think we've done some solids control manufacturing. We are building a rig there for a customer. We are making downhole tools there.","So, yes, we're off to a good start. And Russia is moving more towards local content requirements for oilfield service companies. And, so it's an important market for us in a place that we expect more growth from.","Tom P. Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. Thanks, Clay. I'll get back in the queue.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","You bet. Thank you Tom.","Operator",". Our next question comes from line of Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks good morning. Question, I think for Jose. Jose, on the last-quarter call you highlighted about $40 million of cost cuts you expected to achieve over the subsequent quarters and outlined by segment what you expected to achieve in the third quarter. Could you maybe update us, how much -- how successful were you in achieving those cost cuts you outlined on the last call? And kind of where are you in achieving that $400 million run rate in annual cost savings?","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Sure, Jud. Thanks for the question. Look, as it relates to the $400 million in annualized cost savings that we talked about last quarter, with the performance that we had in Q3 it's apparent that we exceeded our expectations in terms of how much of that $400 million that we would realize in Q3.","It's not a perfect science for getting to the number, but we estimate that we captured about $240 million to $250 million of that $400 million in annualized cost savings during the third quarter.","So the team has done a tremendous job of not only cutting costs from the system, but as we have highlighted several times really using that opportunity to streamline the operations and make things more efficient translating into further margin improvement. So more to come on that front unfortunately because those actions are painful. But the team is doing a tremendous job.","Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for that. I guess expectations on achieving the incremental $150 million or so, is that something you can wrap up in the fourth quarter or does that stretch into the first quarter of 2017?","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yes, I think when we talked about it last quarter; our expectations were that it would take several quarters to play out. A number of the actions that we take are in jurisdictions where it just takes time to get those costs out of the system.","Once you -- once you take the action, the time between taking the action and actually getting the costs out takes a considerable amount of time. So it's a -- we still have a few more quarters to go on that front.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Jud, I think in the \u2013 I also think in the prepared remarks I mentioned 286 facilities that we've closed or are closing. The number of facilities that we're closing now is starting to flatten out a bit. But the size and impact of those closures that we've announced are getting more meaningful.","So it gets tougher quarter by quarter. But, again, I just can't say enough good things about the resolve that our management teams that run these businesses have around making sure that they are continuing to adjust costs in view of a very tough marketplace.","Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, great. And my follow-up, if I may, is I want to just follow up on Wellbore. Clay, I think you mentioned that revenue would be perhaps down slightly in the fourth quarter. I was a little surprised given the growth you saw in the North America business in the third quarter. Could you maybe give a little more color perhaps on why we wouldn't see growth given the U.S. seems to be continuing to grow and international is stabilizing? Maybe a little comment on that.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Well, we expect U.S. to grow. What I would tell you, though, is we are continuing to suffer from international headwinds in certain markets. So international will partly offset U.S. growth. But the big move sequentially is going to be drillpipe sales and then the coating of drillpipe within our Tuboscope unit. They had a great quarter Q3, as I mentioned. Excellent mix of premium pipe. But we expect Q4 -- we're entering Q4 with kind of a depleted backlog for drillpipe. And, so that's going to offset top-line growth.","However, I also highlighted in the opening comments a lot of cause for optimism around 2017 in terms of new technologies, larger pipe that we see demand for, wire drillpipe that we see demand for, the enhancement of drillpipe with RFID chips. There's just a lot of technology going on in that space. So, but that's still at least a few quarters out.","Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, great. I'll turn it back. Thank you.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Marshall Adkins with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Clay, thanks for all the detail. I know we have spent a lot of time talking about the cost-cutting. You guys done a phenomenal job there. But given my fairly bullish outlook on the industry and oil and whatnot over the next few years, I'm actually more worried about your ability to respond in an upturn. And I know this probably doesn't come up a whole lot given the last two years, but help me understand how you guys will be able to respond in an upturn. Particularly, you've had a lot of inventory drawdowns, I would presume, in the wellbore arena. If we see a big surge in demand there, if we run out of frac trucks, what's our ability for you and the industry as a whole to respond to the up-cycle?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Well, first and foremost, we are really, really looking forward to solving those problems, and so, looking forward to that happy day of being faced with those challenges. I've said it many times before, and I'll repeat it, the two skill sets you have to master in oilfield services are rapid aggressive cost reductions when the market dictates and then rapid profitable growth when the market dictates. So this is a very highly cyclical business. It swings widely. And I've seen our team do it before, responding to the upturns. And so, again, I have an abundance of confidence in the talented management team that I get to work with here in terms of responding to that day.","With regards to your inventory comment, what I would tell you is that, frankly, our inventory is \u2013 we still have too much. And so we have ample inventory, I think to respond to our customers' needs. And so that's not really the issue.","What the upturn will look like, the scarcest resource in every upturn pretty quickly becomes people. And so, but I think we have a great team here at NOV. It's been very tough to reduce the size of our workforce. But, we're getting down to kind of our core team and looking forward to responding to the upturn.","I would add to, though, that responding to an upturn is not unique to NOV. Our customers face that as well. So a lot of our products and strategies really are around trying to bring technology to help them navigate the challenges as well.","So, closed-loop drilling, for instance, that I mentioned a moment ago we believe will help drilling contractors when they are called upon to put a much larger portion of their fleets back to work drilling. That sort of technology can drive a lot of efficiency and learning curve effects that would otherwise take much longer to accomplish.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And margins in an upturn? Early in the up-cycle, I assume they're going to be kind of wobbly because you're still, U.S. is battling international, U.S. rising is battling, international still falling near-term. But are you going to be able to push pricing and push margins like we normally see in an up-cycle? And how do you see that playing out?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yeah. Early on, I mean, we're discounting everywhere a lot of pricing pressure, trying to keep volumes to load our plants. Prior upturns, if prior upturns are our guide, that begins to change. And as demand kind of starts to accelerate, in this industry it can really rocket quickly. We've been -- begin to use pricing to sort of manage demand versus available capacity. And so pricing leverage can be pretty stout in the industry.","I would add to that, that psychologically when you have a workforce and an organization that's gone through a significant downsizing like we have, there's a hesitancy to add people. And so we all naturally try to do more with less on the upturn. And so that drives -- there's just a high level of efficiency that gets put into the organization through a downturn. So when you get the upturn, you really benefit from that. So, again, really looking forward to that and -- but very, very confident we'll be able to navigate our way upwards.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","One last quick one. How the hell do you move around 150,000 pound 2-5\/8 coiled tubing string?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","The biggest coiled tubing trailer you ever saw.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I don't think Ford makes a 75-ton pickup, so I was just curious about that.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","If they did, you would own one.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks, guys.","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Bye.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC. Your line is now open.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Good morning.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Good morning.","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Hi, Kurt.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I'm also looking forward to that day when we can start talking about some really good things. So, in the -- Clay, in the context -- of your experience in this business and some of the changes that are going on, I'm just, wanted to get a sense from you when you look out at the Rig Systems business, you look out at the potential for the land rig -- rig orders and the equipment orders and so on. Do you think that we can continue to see an order uptake in Rig Systems? Or is it a viewpoint of yours that we may just kind of bounce around between where we were in the second quarter and where we are in the third quarter?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yes, I would say the latter in the near-term, Kurt. The -- you know, we had a pretty good -- we had a better quarter for orders in the third quarter in a couple rigs that we highlighted. We do expect to sell a rig or two in Q4, but not quite as large. What's more encouraging to me are the tenders and the interest that we see overseas.","So I'm just back from the Middle East, and had a number of conversations there, a lot more happening just in the past few weeks. We had tenders going on in Latin America -- elsewhere around the globe. So the conversations are starting. But I would caution everybody, those international tenders tend to move slowly. So this is still probably at least a few quarters away. But the good news is that there's a lot of talk, there's a lot of interest in drilling capability and technologies. I think NOV is the kind of the go-to source in terms of the latest, greatest next-generation rig.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Right. And then, you spent a lot of time referencing a lot of new technologies, I guess, and services and products that you guys are introducing throughout the course of the downturn. Can you give us some perspective on what you think these new businesses or technologies and products could mean in terms of percent of revenue on a go-forward basis? Like, when you think about new technologies or developments, is it 10% of potential revenue, 20% of potential revenue? How could we think about the impact from this?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Well, I'm not really prepared to give a number per se, other than to once again kind of highlight our view of the future. We think the next upturn is going to see a lot more application of shale technologies elsewhere around the globe.","And when you think about what are shale technologies, it starts with a Tier 1 land rig, high-torque capability, high-torque top drive, higher level of automation and mechanization around pipe handling. It includes premium drillpipe that's able to handle higher torques and to drill out laterals that extend 10,000 feet, 15,000 feet or more.","It includes PDC bits, downhole drilling motors, rotary steer holds we've invested in. MWD to geo-steer those wells into the best parts of the shale, to drill smooth wellbores where you don't have later production ponding problems and areas of the wellbore that hold up solids.","It includes sliding sleeve completion technologies that we think will grow in application in the next upturn. Hydraulic fracture stimulation technologies, coiled tubing for plug-and-perf. Flow iron mixtures, blenders \u2013 okay, we make all of that and we're market leader across all that.","So I think we're very well-positioned for an upturn that has a lot more sort of shale technology to it. And we've \u2013 our M&A strategy and our internal development of new products and technologies that you ask about really are all targeting sort of that view of the world. And that's in addition to the FPSO in offshore steps that we've taken, because we also see significant improvements in that arena.","So we're continuing to enhance our portfolio to develop better technology, recognizing that our customers need, need these technologies to improve their marginal cost-per-barrel standing. And, look forward to helping them do that. In terms of condensing that down to a percent of revenues, not prepared to do that right now. But we're continuing to, we're focused on deploying capital into the areas that we see the highest potential growth put in.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. I really appreciate your thoughts on that. Thanks.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","You bet. Thank you, Kurt.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Waqar Syed with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. My question relates to the offshore rig market and aftermarket business. Do you expect aftermarket business as it relates to the offshore kind of bottom out in line with rig activity, floater rig activity? Or you think that it will bottom out ahead of that, or there will be a lag with activity?","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Hey, Waqar, it's Jose. I'll take this one. But, obviously, it's very challenging environment to really predict and forecast exactly what's going to happen with the aftermarket business. A couple factors make that challenging. With the continuation of cancellations of contracts by operators and rigs being stacked or scrapped, that's continuing to challenge our market opportunity on that front.","Additionally, while we believe that drill contractors have really taken their spare parts inventories down to levels which are really beyond their comfort zones, we continue to be very surprised by how resilient they are and how effective they are in terms of being able to cut back their need for expenditures.","So I think for us to really be able to call bottom, the process of rebalancing the market, particularly as it relates to just stopping the decline in the overall offshore rig count, needs to come to an end. But hopefully we are not too, too terribly far away from that. And obviously our rate of decline in that business has been slowing. So, good long-term outlook; but here near-term, still a little cautious.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, you talk about predictive maintenance and monitoring. Are you seeing any interest from your offshore customers in adding a sensors to their existing fleet of BOPs?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yes, yes, we are. And as I mentioned, we are monitoring subsea BOPs right now and have on 11 different occasions been -- we've notified our customers that we've seen a signal that indicates they are within two weeks probably of a regulator valve failure. And so we are achieving real operational success. We are able to avoid real unplanned lost time in those operations and so that's certainly garnering some interest.","And then, as I also mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are now developing top drive and mud pump failure mode predictive models as well.","So we think this has a bright future. You know, the Internet of Things has come in the oilfield, and so far I think NOV is in the lead.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Now, what kind of revenue opportunity is that incremental when you're selling, or is that in the sensors? Is there any meaningful opportunity for revenue? Or is it more the service model that's the opportunity? Or how should we be thinking about that from a revenue perspective?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","It's both because it requires sensors to be installed on the equipment as well as ongoing sort of maintenance -- or, sorry, ongoing monitoring services that we offer. So what I would tell you is that right now, it's still -- this is a product we just introduced in the second quarter, and we've got new pilot products that really aren't even commercial yet being introduced. So it's not a big deal mover just yet, but we are very optimistic about the, one, the impact to NOV in the future. But also the impact on improving our customers' operations; we really think we can help them improve their rig efficiency using this technology.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Thank you.","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Thank you, Waqar.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Stephen Gengaro with Loop Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Stephen D. Gengaro - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Hi, Stephen.","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Good morning.","Stephen D. Gengaro - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Two quick ones. One, on the following the charges, can you give us some sense for D&A going forward? But also maybe talk about within Rig Systems, how do you think -- do you think margins can stay around 4Q levels next year or do you think you continue to see a little degradation on volumes?","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Hey, Stephen, I'll jump in on the -- related to the DD&A question that you asked initially, I think Clay can take the margin question on Rig. As it relates to the charges that we took, the vast, vast majority, $972 million of that was non-cash, goodwill impairment charge. That did not really include anything in the way of intangibles. So it really shouldn't have any sort of an impact to our DD&A expense. So I anticipate that would stay relatively flat here for the next several quarters.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","And Stephen, I think the second part of your question was around Rig Systems margins into 2017, and as much as I would like to guide to double-digit EBITDA margins in 2017, I don't think that's realistic. And the reason for that is we've been benefiting from high-margin, offshore rig construction projects that were won in kind of a different era, and carried a very large backlog of that into this current downturn.","And what we've been seeing is a continued mix shift that I described earlier towards land equipment that's being priced in a very aggressive way to win that work. So there's sort of an overall margin shift underway. And, again, our team is fighting hard to reduce costs to get as high a margin as we can given that mix shift backdrop. But, realistically, I think we're probably going to see margins -- we guided down a bit for Q4, and I think that's probably closer to what we expect to see in 2017 across Rig Systems.","Stephen D. Gengaro - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you. And, then maybe one follow-up on the acquisition. Can you elaborate a little bit on the impact you see as we go forward from the acquisition?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yes, the Fjords acquisition, as we mentioned, fits well within our Completion & Production Solutions Group and our process flow technology business unit within that. But very excited about it. They are about 50% land, 50% offshore fluid processing modules; a lot of specific technologies around sulfur removal units, around glycol units for gas, electrostatic coalescers.","That's very additive to a number of technologies that we have, and really provide a new channel to market for valves and pumps and composite pipes and other things that we already make here at NOV. So it's a great synergy. What's interesting about Fjords too is that it's predominantly an Eastern Hemisphere business.","And so we really think NOV can help open up new geographic markets to that business. So, very excited about it. Looking forward to getting it closed in Q4. And, again, further sort of cements NOV's pivot towards things other than rig building. So, here's another investment in production-related technologies that we think have a very bright future.","Stephen D. Gengaro - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Minervino with SIG. Your line is now open.","Charles Minervino - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi good morning.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Hi, Chuck.","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Good morning.","Charles Minervino - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","I just wanted to follow up on that question related to Fjords. I don't know if you can give us quantitatively at all kind of what kind of impact that can have on your 4Q numbers or annually what kind of financials they bring to the table there. And then also, does your 4Q guidance for that Completion & Production segment include that coming in or is that added in as it closes?","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Hey, Chuck, it's Jose. I guess, response to that last question, as Clay mentioned in his prepared remarks, we're anticipating the transaction will close right about at year-end. So, guidance does not include any impact from that transaction. But we are very much looking forward to, as you mentioned, welcoming the team from Fjords Processing into the NOV family in early 2017.","As it relates to specific numbers on -- related to that operation, those numbers are available in Akastor's public finance filings. But basically if you look at it at a trailing 12 month basis, they did about $255 million in revenue. And you can look up some of the other details if you'd like, or we can follow up after the call.","Charles Minervino - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay, thanks. And then just on the Completion & Production Solutions segment, the order levels there. I know that your orders there will likely kind of lag some of the rig count recovery. Do you think that 3Q was the bottom there for orders? And do you expect to start seeing that turn higher here going forward?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","You know it's hard to say, what happened in Q3 was a downturn mostly in offshore-related products coming out of Completion & Production Solutions. And that business is broad brush strokes. It's about 44% offshore, 45% offshore revenue-related. But the backlog is much higher mix of offshore products, because the offshore products tend to remain in backlog much longer than quicker-turned land things.","So, the backlog and the order rate really is much more, frankly, offshore-focused than the revenue stream for Completion & Production Solutions, if that makes sense? And while we do expect that to pick up, offshore demand to pick up in Q4 based on some specific things, we do view the offshore market as continuing to face some pretty challenging levels of demand as we enter 2017. So it's very difficult to say at this point.","Charles Minervino - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thanks a lot.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is now open.","David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks. So Clay, this acquisition that you guys put on the processing side, so is this kind of one of the final pieces of that FPSO kit that you put together between you and GE? Are there more of these that you still need to fill in? That's kind of my first question on that subject.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","You know, that's a really, really good question, David. What I would tell you is this fits our FPSO strategy really well, but, frankly, that's not why we did the deal. We have already a very good portfolio of production technologies related to processing -- progressing cavity pumps, some artificial lift products, some separation equipment, some things that we sort of have been building out along the way. And while a portion of Fjords' business is related to FPSO, it's really driven by just kind of your bread-and-butter processing skids for land, processing skids for offshore, fixed platforms, that sort of thing. So, yes, that was sort of an adder, the fact that it does support our FPSO strategy. But that really wasn't the driver for it, honestly.","David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So it's a little bit more mid-streamy in that business, that revenue mix?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Well, no, it's upstream but it's -- oil and gas and water are processed in all parts of the oilfield...","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yeah.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","...around the globe. And in fact, arguably there's more processing demand in many mature basins where you have higher water cuts, you get solids production challenges. Gas, glycol units for gas, those sorts of things. So this is much more broad-based than FPSOs. The nice thing about it is, it could can stand on its own without a lot of FPSO incremental revenue for it. And anything we when win for FPSOs, this will be additive to.","David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. So sticking on that subject, you had highlighted one of the studies you're doing there with GE on the FPSO business. We've heard from a couple others that there is an expectation that as many as 10 big projects that people are looking out at. You could start to see maybe three big projects, five big projects go the second half of next year.","How are you thinking about that? Are you guys involved in those discussions there? When do you think realistically you could see your first FPSO order or kind of major feed studies along those lines?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Well, what I highlighted in my remarks were around our small FPSO, the Minibee, Honeybee concept. And we got a paid feed study won in Q3 \u2013 actually a pre-feed study, more accurately to look at the application of that technology into some specific opportunities.","The other conversations, yes, NOV sells lots of important kits into FPSOs, big and small, so, flexible pipe. We've added to our offering of subsea components with the Kongsberg acquisition, which brought a lot of connectors \u2013 subsea connectors. And that's in addition to our Seabox water processing technology that we acquired last year. So we do a lot in this space, Torque mooring systems, FPSOs and the like. So we're out there doing our best.","However, like I said earlier, the deepwater faces some challenging return hurdles at $50 crude. And so we're very hopeful that these projects do move forward in 2017, but we remain \u2013 I'm going to remain cautious in my outlook.","David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's great. Thanks, Clay.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","You bet. Thank you, David.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our Q&A session for today.","Clay C.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Loren Singletary, Chief Investor & Industry Relations Officer. Sir, you may begin.","Loren Singletary - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Thank you, Crystal, and welcome, everyone to National Oilwell Varco's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With me today are Clay Williams, President, CEO and Chairman of NOV; and Jose Bayardo, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin the discussion of NOV's financial results for the first quarter of 2017, please note that some of the statements we make during this call may contain forecast, projections, and estimates, including but not limited to comments about our outlook for the company's business. These are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws based on limited information as of today, which is subject to change.

No one should assume that these forward-looking statements remain valid later in the quarter or later in the year.","I refer you to the latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q NOV filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a more detailed discussion of the major risk factors affecting our business. Further information regarding these as well as supplemental financial and operation information may be found within our press release and on our website at www.nov.com or in our filings with the SEC.","On a U.S. GAAP basis, for the first quarter of 2017, NOV reported revenues of $1.74 billion and a net loss (02:06) of $122 million or $0.32 a share. Please be aware that our use of the term EBITDA throughout the call this morning will correspond with the term adjusted EBITDA as defined in our press release. We also use other non-GAAP measures as described in our press release.","Later on this call, we will answer your questions, which we ask you to limit to two in order to permit more participation.","Now let me turn the call over to Clay.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Thank you, Loren.","We're pleased to report this morning that for the first quarter of 2017, National Oilwell Varco posted sequential revenue growth for the second quarter in a row, and posted sequential EBITDA growth for the third quarter in a row. The company is benefiting from two-and-a-half years of intense cost reduction as it capitalizes on the full-fledged recovery underway in North America.","Throughout the downturn, we have been consistent in our focus on: one, managing what we can, namely costs; while, two, pivoting towards technologies like horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracture stimulation, which we see benefiting disproportionately in the next upturn. Solid results in both areas enabled us to once again outrun declines in offshore markets and rig building during the first quarter to post sequential revenue improvement overall.","As global oil supply and demand rebalance and oilfield activity grinds higher, NOV is building escape velocity from the black hole the oil industry has been in since late 2014. Oil demand has grown nearly every single year since the first commercial well was drilled in Pennsylvania in 1859, making the oil industry, in my view, the ultimate growth industry for the past 158 years.","It's fueled an unprecedented improvement in global standards of living, as people figure out that plastics and transportation fuel makes their lives a whole, whole lot better. During each of the many down cycles this industry has endured, those of us engaged in the industry are forced to learn once again just how Darwinian this business can be, and we are forced to learn once again of the necessity of drastic reductions in our expense base.","Later during the subsequent up-cycles, the world is forced to learn once again that double-digit reductions in global E&P CapEx result in diminished supply and the world is forced to learn once again how important petroleum is to the world's economy and standard of living. That big lesson is coming.","Last year's E&P CapEx spending was just 50% of 2014 levels. Forward supply will become a challenge. The U.S. will continue to play a larger role in the supply of oil. This year it has returned to production growth, plus we've seen lots of overseas barrels stored in tankers offloaded into the U.S. market recently, two factors that led to a reported U.S. inventory increase which in our view contributed to oil prices dipping back below $50.","Nevertheless, depleting production through the other 80-plus-million barrels a day of supply and another year of growing demand, the industry's 159th, will inevitably lead to tightening. In the meantime, our North American customers are demonstrating that their economics work even at current oil prices in many North American basins by putting rigs back to work at an astonishing rate.","On average, they added 275 land rigs in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, more than three rigs per day. At year-end, NOV was generating a third of its revenue from North America. In the first quarter, that number was 37%.","Offshore, we do not see empirical evidence of economics working for E&Ps yet at current oil prices. Major project FIDs remain scarce and we're still yet to see significant tieback demand for subsea flexible pipe, and the count of offshore rigs under contract declined 3% or 15 rigs during the first quarter. As a result, NOV's offshore-related revenues declined about 9% from the fourth quarter to the first quarter of 2017, and our overall consolidated mix of offshore revenue decreased to 43%, as land revenue grew 14% sequentially and land mix increased to 57%. Major offshore rig building comprised less than 10% of our consolidated revenue mix in the first quarter.","As we grind past the cyclical bottom, we continue to see crosscurrents within our businesses, some rising, some still falling. However, what is very, very encouraging to us is that for the second quarter in a row we see more and more corners of our business recovering. To keep pace with demand, during the first quarter, we added a second shift to manufacture our IntelliServ wired drill pipe, as demand for NOV drilling automation utilizing wired drill pipe rises. We added a second shift to service and reline the downhole drilling motors NOV provides to the industry to drill long horizontal wells.","Our NOV Rolligon pressure pumping manufacturing service and repair facility has a Now Hiring sign in front of it. We're supporting these major pressure pumpers' repair needs as their demand is exceeding their internal capacity.","Sales of centrifugal pumps, valves, seats, rods, flow line and fluid-ends was the highest that we've seen since the fourth quarter of 2014. And last month, we booked another order for another 75,000-horsepower hydraulic frac spread, our second major frac spread order in the quarter.","After a couple of very, very rough years, we're seeing scarcity return to certain sectors of the oilfield, sectors where NOV plays an important supply role. Strategically, we have positioned NOV within the sectors we see as most likely to face scarcity as the upcycle emerges, including horizontal drilling that is growing rapidly in unconventional basins today.","In fact, our Wellbore Technologies segment is the leading independent provider of critical tools used to drill horizontally and to geosteer wellbores to the most productive few feet within a shale reservoir, the sweet spot.","91% of U.S. rigs today are drilling directionally or horizontally compared to just 47% of active rigs a decade ago. The sharp growth didn't surprise us. Horizontal drilling opens up much more reservoir rock to the wellbore than vertical drilling which reduces the capital cost per barrel of oil to develop and makes each well far more profitable.","Therefore, we embarked on a strategy to become the go-to provider of tools that enable horizontal drilling in anticipation of growth. Through successive investment in acquisitions and technology, NOV steadily improved its position in the supply of drilling motors, jars, friction reduction tools, PDC bits, and more recently, rotary steerables and MWD to become a comprehensive supplier of critical horizontal drilling technologies.","Today, these comprise a little more than one-third of Wellbore Technologies' revenue mix. Importantly, we do not provide directional drilling services, only the tools that service providers need to deliver precisely-placed low tortuosity wellbores, thereby avoiding potential competitive conflicts with our directional drilling customers.","During the first quarter of 2017, Wellbore Technologies shipped nearly 13,000 downhole tools to our North American customers, a 32% sequential increase. We both lease and sell these tools, depending on the needs of our customers and we continually invest in technology to improve the life and performance of our sophisticated drilling tools.","Last quarter, NOV introduced our new Vector Series 50 bearing pack which, when coupled with our ERT power section, delivers a very short bit-to-bend length, a robust design with greater operational life and less aggressive rotation and tighter curve sections.","Last month, this new drilling motor configuration helped a very happy customer drill their fastest vertical section yet and another boosted rates of penetration nearly 20%. This strong performance is enabling us to command significant premium over our conventional drilling motors, and we're adding additional tools to help keep up with demand.","Long horizontal drilling presents new and increasing challenges with the torque and drag on the drill string. The driller relies on the weight of the drill string to press the bit into the formation. But when pipe bends around a 90 degree curve and then extends out horizontally a mile or two to the bit, the transfer of its weight to the bit becomes very uneven, and resistance to rotating the drill string can severely limit the drilling process.","So several years ago, NOV introduced a patented tool to combat this challenge by creating an axial oscillation that reduces friction, torque and drag and enables the smooth transfer of drill string weight to the bit. The Agitator is now used on most horizontal wells today. And during the first quarter, we introduced a new and improved tool, the Agitator HE, that provides even greater friction reduction to enable our customers to drill even longer laterals faster and more efficiently.","Initial tool runs indicate 38% faster rotating ROP and 74% faster sliding ROP. NOV's ReedHycalog bits have a long and proud history of technology advancements in the industry. In fact, every major bit manufacturer licenses our patented cutter leaching process for their own PDC bits.","After introducing new technologies to combat thermal abrasion of cutters and introducing our new Tektonic bit last year, we'll be introducing our newest line of 2, 3 and 4D cutters Ion (10:48) this quarter, which offer superior thermal and impact resistance to drive greater durability and performance.","NOV's competitive advantages within these critical tools are compelling. Cost of failure to our customers is high. Premature failure of a downhole tool results in an unplanned round-trip of the BHA, a very expensive headache. NOV's reputation as market leader's built on our extensive experience and demonstrated performance. We benefit from manufacturing scale, from purchasing scale and from sustained investment and leading-edge robotics and manufacturing technologies that provide us a cost advantage.","Drilling motors are comprised of a steel rotor encased in an elastomer stator, through which hot and abrasive drilling mud is pumped. We leverage our considerable expertise in elastomer technology over a large revenue base. Elastomer stators wear out over time, and the motor must be relined with new elastomer.","NOV's reline shops around the world perform this critical aftermarket service for our customers who own their own drilling motor fleets. Internationally, our reline plants benefit from first-mover advantage in several key markets that may not be sufficiently large to support a second competitor.","Our customers want to get their drilling motors relined and back into service as soon as possible. And having a reline shop nearby, avoiding lengthy and expensive customs transits to export and then reimport motors to be relined gives NOV a sustainable competitive advantage in this marketplace that grows in lockstep with horizontal drilling.","Within our Completion & Production Solutions segment, NOV provides a wide variety of fluid process equipment. Nature doesn't provide a clean barrel of oil ready for the pipeline. Production engineers must pitch in to do that to separate water, oil, gas and sand from the wellhead and then to treat each for its intended destination; production, disposal or reinjection.","Associated gas, oil water emulsions, frac fluids flowback, condensate, natural gas dehydration and hot salt-saturated corrosive formation water are just a few of the many challenges production engineers have to navigate to deliver a barrel of oil or an mcf of gas of specific quality to a pipeline system.","It's been estimated that the U.S. petroleum industry produces 7 barrels of water for every 1 barrel of oil. This industry separates a lot of chaff from wheat every day. Production challenges can change or appear quickly.","When a well declines and begins to produce water, called water breakthrough, the operator must respond with new water separation capabilities at or near the wellhead. Shale wells typically flowback frac fluids at very high rates with very high levels of solids in initial production, which declines quickly with falling water production.","As the world supply of oil shifts, as it has done with the advent of North American shale production, new regions and new types of production bring new production challenges, which require new investment and new production treatment capabilities.","It is against this market backdrop of shifting production that NOV began to invest in Process and Flow Technologies a few years ago to help our customers more efficiently produce the clean barrel of oil ready for the pipeline.","Our strategy is built on the strength of NOV's market-leading discrete components, like reciprocating pumps, production chokes, fluid separators and Moineau progressing cavity pumps, which we've been making for 85 years and which, by the way, leverage the elastomer know-how that I described earlier when I was talking about downhole motors.","In each of these areas, NOV benefited from market leadership, extensive experience, intellectual property and brand recognition. I'll add that many of these products are also sold into industrial markets which further enhances our scale advantages.","Since 2014, we've been combining these into comprehensive processing solutions for our customers and with the addition of Fjords Processing, which we acquired in late 2016, our portfolio now spans every major processing need from free-water knockouts to vapor recovery and combustion to heater treaters, to gas dehydration, to sand separation to 2, 3 and 4 phase separators.","For instance, NOV's patented sand separation technology, the Tore Trap, removes solids down to 10 microns, reducing expensive filtration costs, tank cleanups and pump wear and tear.","Our patented WaterWolf technology recovers oil and solids from produced water in a single stage without expensive filters and chemicals. We've combined these together with pumping solutions to offer a turnkey saltwater disposal system that can recover an additional 20 barrels of oil from every 10,000 barrels of saltwater, oil that was previously reinjected and lost with conventional systems.","In short, our strategy provides a simple, comprehensive solution to our customers' saltwater disposal needs that avoids complex vendor-to-vendor interface risk, while boosting oil recovery and revenue.","Our Fjords acquisition in late fourth quarter enhanced this offering with its market-leading glycol regeneration technology used to prevent hydrate formation in gas lines and its unique Electrostatic Coalescer oil water separation technology, which removes water droplets out of emulsion and reduces the need for expensive chemicals.","Through selective acquisitions, like Fjords and others, NOV has now put together the number two global provider of petroleum processing equipment and technology, unique in our capability to design and fabricate production skids in-house, end to end, that fit our customers' footprint and weight constraints and that utilize market-leading pumps and components which are also engineered and manufactured in-house through 14 NOV plants around the world.","During the first quarter, this business comprised about one-fourth of Completion & Production Solutions segment revenue. In addition to oil and gas, it sells to midstream and industrial customers and also closely supports NOV's floating production business and Fiber Glass Pipe business.","Within the group, nearly one-third of its revenues are aftermarket related, which also brings OEM competitive advantage and high switching costs. So despite the challenges of the past two years, our business leaders have continued to quietly build and position our businesses for the inevitable upturn.","The business groups I described are just two of many examples of high impact, high return businesses within the NOV portfolio. I'm optimistic about our fortunes here at NOV precisely because of the leaders and teams that comprise these businesses and the many others across NOV just like them.","There's no better organization in oilfield services than NOV, and I'm grateful to each and every one of our employees. And like you, I'm looking forward to better days ahead.","With that, let me turn it over to Jose.","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Thank you, Clay. To recap our first quarter results, NOV consolidated revenues were $1.74 billion, an increase of 3% from the fourth quarter of 2016. Rapidly growing activity levels in the U.S. and Canada led to an 18% increase in revenue within North America, which was partially offset by a 4% revenue decline in international markets.","EBITDA increased $3 million to $105 million or 6% of sales. The company generated 41% sequential incremental EBITDA margins, excluding the impact of gains from order deletions, which occurred in the fourth quarter. Operating loss, excluding other items, was $70 million, a $2 million improvement over the fourth quarter of 2016.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, accounts receivable and inventory reductions of $105 million and $71 million, respectively, were mostly offset by similar declines in current liabilities. So working capital, excluding cash and debt, decreased only slightly.","Quarterly cash flow from operations totaled $111 million, and CapEx was limited to $42 million, providing us with $69 million in free cash flow during the first quarter. At March 31, we had a cash balance of $1.5 billion, $3.2 billion in total debt and a debt to capitalization ratio of 18.7%.","For the first quarter of 2017, our Rig Systems segment generated $393 million in revenue, down $33 million or 8% from the fourth quarter of 2016. The continued fall-off in revenue from offshore-related projects was partially offset by an $18 million sequential increase from our land rig business.","EBITDA was $33 million, a decrease of $24 million from the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of the order deletions from the Q4 results, the segment posted EBITDA decremental margins of approximately 24%, demonstrating the effectiveness of our ongoing efforts to remove costs and improve efficiencies.","During the quarter, we booked $118 million in orders, an increase of $3 million from last quarter, and we shipped $285 million from backlog for a book-to-bill of 41% and an ending backlog of $2.3 billion.","Last quarter, we mentioned that we anticipate that the land business would underpin much of the Rig Systems' future growth. Our recent bookings continue to support that view. 50% of the segment's Q1 bookings were from land-related orders, up from 43% in Q4 of 2016.","Included in our land order book were orders for 30 high-spec well servicing rigs for the U.S. market. Several TDS-11SA Top Drives and the Stand Transfer Vehicle, which automates the most difficult and dangerous pipe-handling requirements and eliminates the need for a derrickman on top of the derrick.","We also booked 16 orders for our NOVOS rig operating systems, the centerpiece of our automation offering. The system automates common repetitive drilling activities to deliver consistent, repeatable performance and allows the driller to focus on process execution and safety.","Our recent orders highlight rising interest in NOV automation as the industry seeks to push technical limits enabled by automated processes, controlled by heuristic algorithms that leverage real-time broadband data \u2013 downhole data transmission to further optimize drilling operations.","Customer conversations around newbuild land rig opportunities in the U.S. and international markets continue to progress. We see near-term opportunities with smaller independent contractors to add more modern rigs to their fleets, but anticipate most larger rig contractors and international players will invest in upgrades to their existing fleet's pressure, torque and automation capabilities rather than buying new until dayrates creep a bit higher, possibly by late 2017 or 2018.","We're also actively engaged with certain offshore contractor customers looking to upgrade equipment and add automation capabilities to their rig fleets to position themselves favorably for future contracts.","For the second quarter, we expect Rig Systems segment revenues to decline another 5% to 10% with revenue out of backlog falling to approximately $260 million. We anticipate decremental margins to be in the mid-20% to 30% range.","For the first quarter, Rig Aftermarket generated $321 million in revenue, down 5% sequentially and $71 million in EBITDA, down $9 million sequentially. Seasonal declines in service and repair work were in line with expectations, as was the sequential increase in spare part revenues, the first we have seen since the third quarter of 2014.","Bookings for spare parts increased for the second quarter in a row, supported by rising levels of rig activity and reactivations in West Texas and Oklahoma. Bookings for land spares were 45% above the recent cyclical low and are now approaching 50% of our total spare part bookings.","NOV is arguably the largest original equipment manufacturer for land rigs globally. So as the market shifts more to land, we are well positioned to service, repair and supply spare parts to that equipment.","Additionally, as land rigs become increasingly sophisticated and add NOV's new control systems, automation capabilities and condition-based monitoring systems, we are best suited to maintain and support them.","The offshore market also continues to present growth opportunities for Rig Aftermarket. We have now seen three successive quarters of modest improvements in offshore-related bookings, with Q1 10% above our cyclical low. We attribute the increases to our customers' uncomfortably low inventory levels and their need to ensure rigs are in optimal condition for future contracts.","We're seeing a steady improvement in near-term market conditions for land and offshore and in the mid to long-term fundamentals for the land market. As a result, we're increasingly confident that our Rig Aftermarket segment bottomed in Q1, and we expect to see steady improvement over the foreseeable future. In Q2, we expect Rig Aftermarket revenues to increase slightly with strong incrementals.","For the first quarter, our Wellbore Technologies segment generated $555 million in revenue, a 5% increase from the fourth quarter. The segment achieved 75% EBITDA flow-through, resulting in $38 million of EBITDA, an $18 million increase over Q4.","Multiple business units within the Wellbore segment grew North American revenues in excess of the 36% increase in U.S. and Canadian rig count, which speaks to the strength in demand for the technologies and services we offer.","Our Drilling & Intervention business unit saw a 38% increase in North American revenues, driven by demand for its innovative and industry-leading technologies like the downhole drilling motor Clay mentioned earlier.","When we deliver technology to our customers that enables them to drill gun-barrel straight wellbores faster and more cost-effectively, we can command premium prices, grow market share, and ultimately yield higher revenue and margins.","Our Dynamic Drilling Solutions business also delivered sequential quarter growth in North America that meaningfully exceeded the rig count \u2013 the growth in rig count. Rapidly accelerating adoption of our drilling automation and optimization solutions and strong growth in our MWD and in well-site gas analyzer products, supplemented strong activity led growth from our core drilling and measurement offerings.","Further highlighting the rapid adoption of our drilling automation and optimization businesses is the performance of IntelliServ, which manufactures wired drill pipe used for real-time broadband data transmission. The business unit achieved its best quarter ever. And to keep pace with rising demand, we have added a second shift at our manufacturing facility, as Clay mentioned.","Lastly, while our Grant Prideco drill pipe business, as expected, posted another meaningful sequential decline, bookings increased sharply, giving us some confidence that even this later-cycle business has now reached bottom.","The business unit posted a 138% book-to-bill as demand for our new Delta connection has been robust, 5.5 inch drill pipe is becoming increasingly popular and excess North American drill pipe inventories are being consumed by the rapid increase in drilling activity.","For the second quarter, we expect Wellbore Technologies to realize another 5% to 7% top line growth, as the impact of the recovery in North America will be partially offset by headwinds in the offshore market, by international markets which are trying to regain their footing and by the impact of Canadian spring breakup. We expect revenue growth to drive strong incrementals through the remainder of 2017, as we improve the utilization of our manufacturing facilities and claw back more pricing.","For the first quarter, Completion & Production Solutions generated $648 million in revenue, an increase of 8% from the fourth quarter of 2016. EBITDA increased $8 million to $77 million or 11.9% of sales. Persistent crosscurrents between the land and offshore businesses caused meaningful changes in segment's product mix, limiting EBITDA flow-through to 17%.","Our Intervention and Stimulation Equipment business unit revenues increased 25% on the back of demand for aftermarket service and repair work to support reactivations, pressure pumping and coiled tubing equipment, as well as the partial delivery of a large frac equipment order we booked early in the quarter. The business unit achieved a book-to-bill in excess of 140%. And as Clay mentioned, its sales of pressure pumping consumables are approaching levels last seen in Q4 of 2014.","Customers rely on NOV's aftermarket parts and components because of our attention to detail and our focus on the items that ultimately increase reliability and value. Small things like the quality of valves make a huge difference. The technology in our Blue Thunder (27:01) valve seats leverage the same elastomer know-how that resides among our material scientists that Clay referenced to provide unprecedented wear characteristics.","Our valves outlast most of our competitors' by at least two times based on both pounds of sand and number of stages pumped. We have many examples of how our proprietary innovations improve the performance of our existing products and our ongoing R&D efforts continue to drive improvements in our offerings.","We highlighted the introduction of our condition-based motoring systems for our Intervention and Stimulation Equipment in our press release. Another upcoming differentiated innovation is our next-generation fluid end, which is now in field trials.","We believe our new design will achieve a 26% increase in flow area around suction and discharge valves, reducing cavitation and fluid-end washouts and will achieve 40% reduction in bore intersection stress for improved durability.","We also believe the new design will improve ease of maintenance significantly. Our discharge flange design allows easy access for impact and torque wrenches and incorporates a two-piece valve retainer that gives line of sight confirmation for proper alignment, a feature not currently available with other grooveless fluid ends. All these details can add up to a meaningful decrease in our customers' total cost of ownership.","In our Fiber Glass Systems business unit, we saw a fall-off in revenue as the fourth quarter's high levels of demand for fiberglass pipe equipment from E&P customers looking to exhaust their budgeted spend for the year did not carry into the first quarter.","Customers seemed to wait until late in the quarter for new budget approvals and we suspect the slight pullback in commodity prices created some additional hesitation. Notwithstanding these concerns, the business ended the quarter with very strong bookings in excess of 140% book-to-bill, driven by orders for West Texas, South Texas and the Middle East. Even though pricing remains somewhat challenged and input costs are increasing, our improvement in bookings are translating into increased volumes, and we are now beginning to reactivate additional product lines.","Our Process and Flow Technologies Group also experienced a slight pullback in its base business, primarily due to a decrease in offshore projects. But this was more than offset by a full quarter of contribution from the Fjords transaction completed in late Q4 of 2016.","Our offshore-oriented business units remain challenged, as E&P customers continue to direct capital towards shorter cycle projects instead of longer-cycle offshore opportunities, presenting near-term challenges for our floating production and subsea businesses. Yet even in this environment, we're able to capture some attractive opportunities.","During the first quarter, we booked significant orders from two large integrated oil companies for large diameter conductor casing to be used in projects offshore West Africa. Our local presence in the market positioned us well to secure this business.","In the second quarter, we anticipate continued growth in demand for completions related to capital equipment, consumables and aftermarket service and repair, as well as an increase in our production-related businesses serving onshore projects.","Yet, we expect this to be mostly offset by the segment's offshore-oriented businesses as they continue to suffer from deteriorating backlogs, increasingly competitive pricing and a lack of final investment decisions on major projects. As a result, we anticipate CAPS' (30:15) second quarter revenues to pick up slightly with low incrementals.","To wrap things up, NOV has posted sequential revenue growth for two quarters in a row and a sequential EBITDA growth for three quarters in a row. We now believe three out of our four operating segments have crossed the abyss of this downturn. While offshore markets will remain challenged and international markets will likely remain fairly stagnant near term, a full-fledged recovery is underway in North America. The oilfield is a capital-intensive industry. And the excess capacity and the valuable technologies that we supply is being absorbed at a rapid pace. As Clay said, scarcity is returning to the oilfield.","After two and a half years of intense cost reductions, continued focus on efficiency improvements, and purposeful investments in products and technologies, we believe we'll benefit disproportionately through this next cycle. The dedicated employees of NOV have this organization extremely well positioned to capitalize on a recovering market.","With that, we'll open up the line to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. And thanks for going through the numbers and the story here in great detail as always. I wonder, first of all, Clay, very impressed the way the cost reductions that you've driven through the organization and in the process of pivoting it more towards short cycle activity. Could you talk a little bit about where you stand now in terms of right-sizing the organization within the offshore exposure?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Thank you, Ole. Yeah, we're continuing to focus on costs. And as we described in our prepared comments, lots of crosscurrents with businesses going up and down, and generally more constructive on our outlook for land, which means that within the offshore, we're continuing to trim costs and focus on improving our efficiency.","So if you recall, nine months ago, we talked to a $400 million reduction in structural costs, which was on top of the $2-plus-billion we had achieved at that time. With regards to updating you on the progress against that, we are no well in excess of $400 million a year in structural cost savings, but we're not done yet. So we're continuing to reduce costs, which we've closed 297 facilities. And we have another 54 there in process of closing and continue to adjust.","So, still making progress. Looking forward to the day when I can report to all of you and to all of our employees that we're done. But frankly, we're not there yet. So \u2013 but really, it's a necessity. Been a severe downturn, our business mix is shifting more towards land, as we described, and very excited this quarter, like last quarter, to see more and more growth in those areas of our business. So that's really what has us excited and enthusiastic about the future.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","It's a meaningful for pivot here. But again, just one more question on the aftermarket, very impressive margins there. When it comes to offshore aftermarket, a lot of these rigs that you delivered in the last cycle and are coming up to being 10 years old, and I would imagine that there have been quite a lot of technology that's been developed.","You highlighted that you're seeing certain investments for people putting new features to their rigs to keep them competitive. Could you talk a little bit more to that, and whether you see the aftermarket business now stabilizing?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yeah. A couple of things. With regards to sort of near-term opportunities in the offshore, we're seeing more offshore rig operators come to us for enhancements of those rigs to make them more competitive in a crowded marketplace.","They're coming to us for replacement components or upgrade components at the request of their customers. So oil companies recognize it's more of a buyers' market. And they're putting pressure on drilling contractors to add more pressure control capability, add more pipe-racking capabilities, Crown Mounted Compensators, things like that, in exchange we're extending contracts, for instance, so there's a few examples of that.","With regards to NOV's offering into the space, we're focused on ways to help our customers do that. So new fingerboard technologies that we're investigating now. About five or six years ago, we began installing many more sensors into top drives, drawworks, mud pumps that we've sold over the years, which has created a foundation for us to push new big data predictive analytic products that we're bringing to the marketplace in addition to the Rigsentry BOP predictive analytics model that we discussed last quarter. So, lots of opportunities there.","On the aftermarket side, as Jose mentioned, very pleased to see now the second quarter of growing spare parts booking and a 13% sequential increase in spare parts revenues, and just feel like our customers both offshore and land really are running out of spare parts and coming to us to supply those.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Well, impressive margins. Thank you very much. I'll hand it back.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Thanks, Ole.","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Marshall Adkins from Raymond James. Your line is open.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Good morning.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yeah, thanks for the detail. So just to stay on that theme for a minute, I assume all the closings and write-offs continue to be in the offshore side and kind of the \u2013 correlated to that is, on Rig Systems, when do we finally flush through all the waters and the stuff on Rig Systems on offshore where that bottoms, at least from the offshore perspective? I know land's getting better, but offshore, when does that finally wash out?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Well, on the first question, I would say that we're cutting cost and reducing expenses and becoming more efficient across the entire organization. And many of our products and services are sold into both offshore and land. And so decisions we're making around rationalizing capacity are driven by the \u2013 partly driven by the outlook for offshore. But a lot of our businesses and plants really serve both markets.","With regards to when, I think you're kind of asking when does Rig Systems bottom. We're continuing to work through \u2013 we carried a very big backlog of offshore rig building into the downturn. And we're continuing to work that down as there have been no new \u2013 basically no new orders for newbuilds in some time. I think that segment will bottom when land really starts to come back to replace that continual \u2013 that slide. And so and our outlook for land is growing more and more constructive kind of quarter-by-quarter.","So when we look out into the future, we talked last quarter about a lot of rig tenders going on in the Middle East, and we're still pursuing those. They're not moving particularly quickly, but they are moving. We've seen some other corners of the globe express interest in land rigs. We're seeing rising dayrates in North America. Dayrates are about 15% off bottom is what we hear from our customers, in the high teens or low $20,000 a day range. And so as dayrates begin to move up, we do think land drilling contractors are going to come to us for more new rigs, for more equipment and that can help sort of offset the decline in the offshore market. So really the short answer is it's a bit of a race between land and offshore in terms of when Rig Systems turns the corner and starts \u2013 resumes growth.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Right. That sounds like we're on track fairly soon. So one more quick one here, the eliminations side was a lot lower than it's been trending. Is that a mix issue or is that part of the cost reduction things that's been going on? What happened with the eliminations and kind of help us with where to pin that going forward?","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Hey, Marshall, this is Jose. It's a combination of both of those factors. So essentially, as we're \u2013 we're going forward \u2013 a higher percentage of our revenues overall are third-party revenues rather than eliminations. Also, as Clay was touching on earlier, costs are continuing to come out of the equation. The organization's doing a great job of managing that and so that's also contributing to what you're seeing in that elimination line.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Makes sense. All right. Great job, guys. Thanks.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Thanks.","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brad Handler from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Good morning.","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Hi, Brad.","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","Could you \u2013 I guess, let's talk about sort of the sources of some of the new orders. They're very interesting. How many customers if you \u2013 or order of magnitude are ordering the well-servicing rigs?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","We've had interest from a couple \u2013 we had \u2013 we have one customer in particular who placed a very large order in Q1, Brad.","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Okay. And maybe the same question...","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","There is certainly a growing interest related to high-spec well servicing rigs that are sort of pushing the limits in terms of extended lateral completions.","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yeah. Yeah, we get others looking at the...","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","There are a number of well-servicing companies that are eyeing opportunities to expand that portion of their business.","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Well, it makes sense. We're certainly seeing process of upgrading through cycles here. That makes sense. Okay. Maybe a similar question about NOVOS and IntelliServ. You obviously have one public contract driller that's doing a lot of advertising on your behalf, if you will. But could you talk about the numbers roughly of customers that are engaging in NOVOS and ordering your system?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yeah. We're bidding about 75 rigs currently with NOVOS upgrades, both land and offshore. We've got \u2013 and just a little background, Brad, you're aware of this, but other listeners may not be, NOVOS offers sort of open architecture. So we have a software developer kit that will provide anyone that would like to write an app to help optimize the performance of a rig. So oil companies are interested in optimizing the performance or using an app to define a safety envelope, for instance, that the rig \u2013 that they require the rig to operate within. Service companies can write apps to perform their particular operation on a rig. If they want to come and cement to a casing for instance, they can write an app to help optimize that and offer that. And that's sort of a \u2013 so it's sort of a workspace operating system for rigs. We've got six third-party entities including one major oil companies that have written apps to work on NOVOS.","We've got another 16 or 18 that have secured software developer kits from us and are working on apps. So, a lot of excitement around this. This is sort of a new thing for our industry, and in particular, really proud of the open architecture feature of this. We really, rather than restrict this to NOV apps, we're really kind of opening it up to all the imagination and innovation that this industry has in abundance and letting others write apps to kind of optimize and improve the industry. So I think a lot of excitement, a lot of buzz. And the other point I would bring up around NOVOS is that it also works hand-in-hand with our closed-loop automated drilling and optimization services. So, wired drill pipe with NOVOS with downhole measurement, drilling mechanics is a very, very powerful way to improve drilling operations that we're also seeing a lot of interest in.","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","It's great to hear. And again, that same public driller seems to be taking advantage of all the above.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yes.","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","So we'll obviously get to see \u2013 we'll see demonstrations of that. Maybe a different sort of follow-up question for me. Maybe, Jose, can you tally up kind of the U.S. land revenue picture across divisions and talk to what sort of sequential revenue improvement was (43:31)?","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Obviously, across the board, we saw the percentage of land revenue increased from 52% to 57% across the company. We saw North American revenue grow from 33% to 37%. And so really across the board, in all of our businesses, we are seeing a higher percentage of our revenue ultimately come from the land, predominantly North America land. And I actually \u2013 was the question related to North America land or were you talking about just in general (44:15)...","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","No, that's \u2013 North America's fine. And I guess what I was trying to drive to in a sense was the math around how your revenues are faring relative to the rig count. Certainly, appreciating why it wouldn't match necessarily, but trying to also get a sense of \u2013 and then, you can just share your perspective on whether you would expect it to sort of mirror rig count and mirror activity at some point sort of once you retool once spare parts are underway. I'm just \u2013 perspective on when and if it starts to mirror U.S. activity more broadly.","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Sure, sure. And I guess, the one to really focus on is our Wellbore Technologies. That has been a very good proxy for really global rig count growth over the past couple of years. We've seen our North American \u2013 a number of our North American businesses, I touched on my prepared remarks, here this last quarter exceed the growth in North America and our respective North American land businesses due to market share gains and additional things along those lines.","The challenge that we've had within that segment is our drill pipe business, which is a much later cycle-type opportunity. But as I also touched on, we're growing more and more confident that that business has finally seen a bottom. So I think that gives us a great deal of confidence that we'll see better responsiveness to that overall segment, more in line with North American-related activity. So very excited about where things are headed with the Wellbore Technologies segment.","CAPS (45:51), as you know, is much more of a mixed set of businesses for both land and offshore, also the preponderance of those businesses are capital equipment-related businesses. And last quarter, we talked about that we were somewhat surprised by how quickly we're seeing demand for capital equipment come back into the marketplace as the existing equipment base is absorbed in the North American marketplace. So that too is obviously benefiting at an increasing pace related to what's happening in North America. But as we have also talked about, particularly related to our floating production and our subsea businesses, we do have those crosscurrents with the offshore businesses.","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","Appreciate the crosscurrents, and I'll turn it back, but just another \u2013 do you expect \u2013 given what you're seeing in both capital equipment but then sort of spare parts drivers in North American land, do you expect that to be able sort of over the next couple quarters from a revenue perspective to keep up with activity if there's some lag? And as we think about the rig count, is that help us calibrate, or if I want to do the hydraulic fracturing, kind of activity count, does that help us calibrate you think your own revenue streams in CAPS (47:07)?","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yeah, I think that's a fair question. And look, to-date, we have obviously been lagging as that capacity has been getting absorbed. We talked about the growth in our ISE business and I also think that the little pullback that we saw in the commodity price here recently has caused a little bit of hesitation for certain orders that we probably would have pulled across the finish line here during the first quarter. But if anything, what that do is just delaying the inevitable and will cause a sharper inflection when it does take place. So I think as you're aware, what typically happens is most of our customers realize that they have a need for that additional capacity all at the same time. And that tends to happen all at once and creates a very nice backdrop for our businesses.","Bradley Philip Handler - Jefferies LLC","Right. All right. Helpful color. Thank you, guys. Turn it back.","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Thanks, Brad.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sean Meakim from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, morning.","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Good morning.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Hi, Sean.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So just to follow up on some of those discussions, I was curious to hear a little more specifically I guess on the outlook for newbuild land rig orders. We're hearing some of the tenders in the Middle East maybe slipping a little bit, but there's also a lot of them out there. And I'd imagine that newbuilds are going to be a good part of that. And then also just to hear maybe some progress on customer discussions in terms of NOVOS implementation in some of these international markets.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yeah. On the land rig newbuild outlook, we are continuing to pursue those tenders in the Middle East. And there's been I think some \u2013 there's been a lot of public discussion about those. And just so you're aware, lots of the NOCs in the Gulf States and in The Kingdom are discussing putting more land rigs to work. It'll be a combination of existing rigs and newbuilds. And those various tenders are moving at different rates, but it's a meaningful number of rigs.","And then in the quarter, we did see demand blossoming in a couple of other regions. In our conversations with North American drilling contractors, I do think new rig building is still a ways out. But the good news for all of them and us is that dayrates are continuing to march up and we're currently selling into that trend in terms of upgrading the torque and pressure capabilities of rigs. So adding a third mud pump, adding a fourth genset, adding hightop torque drives, top drives to those rigs.","But I think once dayrates get up into the mid-$20,000 range a day, I think that's really where you see meaningful demand for new rigs across the North American market. And as Jose just said just a moment ago, past cycles are a guide. They all seem to phone us at once seeking to put those rigs to work. So we are constructive on that outlook. It's not next quarter or the quarter after, but I do think we're getting closer to the day and we're seeing a lot more land rig building out there.","On NOVOS, we have had lots of discussions with operators overseas. We had one of the major oil companies specify NOVOS on some of their offshore drilling projects upcoming in the first quarter. We had another specify NOVOS for an international \u2013 another international project that they are tendering that's onshore. And so I think awareness of NOVOS is growing. And it's a terrific system and very, very pleased to see it now being introduced in the field and making a difference.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's very helpful. Thank you for that, Clay. And then just -maybe thinking about the usual topic on M&A, we've seen the industry move towards vertical integration, or at least you're seeing some of the collapsing of the different verticals that we've seen historically. Just how does that influence your thinking? Does it influence your thinking around the appeal of services, capabilities outside of the current scope of what you offer?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","We get great franchises selling lots of sophisticated equipment to land drillers, offshore drillers, directional drillers, workover companies, wireline companies, pressure pumping companies and coiled tubing companies. I think integrating vertically to now compete with those customer groups just strikes me as a bad idea. And I think we would lose a lot of credibility and trust with our customers. So we really don't have plans to do that.","In full candor, we've looked at it. I mean, it's a \u2013 I think we have a financial obligation to evaluate different strategies like that, but I just can't get there. I think we're better served by continuing to focus on providing great technology to enable those groups of customers to compete. That's what they have come to rely upon us for, and that's what we've been doing through the past few years. And so we have been very busy on the M&A front. We had one closing in Q1. We've had one more closing in Q2. We have three more closing expected in Q2 \u2013 and maybe a fourth closing expected in Q2, and then a number of smaller companies under letters of intent.","And so it's kind of a \u2013 it's more of a strategy of enhancing what we have in the marketplace. And again, pivoting into those sectors we see as higher growth and more interesting sectors where we can carve out meaningful competitive advantage.","And part of the prepared comments around our downhole tool offering and then around our processing equipment offerings were to really illustrate kind of what we were doing, the combination of internal investment and technology along with acquisitions to enhance and grow those business franchises and to do a better job serving our customers and to earn an above-average rate of return.","And what that has guided us towards is very selected it \u2013 very selected, very sort of rifle-shot targeted acquisitions focused more on products, technologies, specific capabilities and the like. And I'd say, so far so good. I'm actually very, very excited about our progress and what we're doing there.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Makes sense to me. Thanks, Clay.","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","You bet.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Gruber from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning, gentlemen.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Hi, Scott.","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Good morning, Scott.","Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Jose, we often get asked by investors how to think about where your inventories head and your ability to draw-down the excess inventories built up during the historic downturns. With the U.S. market now in full recovery mode and the offshore markets bottoming out, how should we think about that trajectory in your days of inventory? Do you have a year-end target that you'd be able to offer even if it's a range, how should we think about it?","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yeah, so clearly we had another draw-down on our inventory this quarter about $71 million. We still have, in our view, an overly large level of working capital across the company. The way we tend to look at working capital is as a percentage of our annualized revenue run rate. And today, as we sit here, we're at about 56% of annualized run rate, slowly ticking down. But our historical norm is more in the sort of the 33% to 40% type range and that is our long-term target. Certainly, not saying we're going to get there by the end of this year, it's probably more of a late 2018 type phenomenon, but we fully do expect to get back there.","Specifically as it relates to inventory, I do expect to see that drawdown be a little bit more pronounced here over the next couple of quarters. We've now had a couple of quarters of decent bookings for some of the capital equipment which just was not moving at all over the last, call it, year and a half. And so once some of those orders start shipping, we should see some better improvement on the inventory front. But certainly, all of our working capital levers are something that we're highly motivated to improve during the course of the year.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yeah. I think one of our challenges here has been the liquidity challenges of our customers. It's been frustrating to us internally trying to liquidate the working capital. But it really speaks to just how the stress that the whole industry has been under trying to turn all that to cash.","Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Well, it sounds like you're going to start really turning the corner, which is good to hear. And, Clay, a follow-up on Wellbore Technologies. It has a lot of moving parts in terms of the mix, more onshore, but also a good rate of penetration on new higher end technologies. You've also taken cost out of the business. So we kind of think about the long-term outlook for Wellbore Technologies, if global activity continues to improve but the pace of U.S. activity moderates a bit from here, how should we think about what a long-term normal margin is for the Wellbore Tech segment? Is 25% still achievable longer term?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yeah, EBITDA margins, absolutely. There are some rental tool businesses in there within Wellbore Technologies. Part of our downhole tools business I described earlier is rental, and then we have a terrific waste management, solids control franchise that also does a lot of rental. And those businesses are very capable of generating EBITDA margins well in excess of that. So, yeah, I think once we kind of get back to normal, look to margins to go up. And we're still taking costs out of that segment as well. So our outlook with rising rig count, with costs coming out of that business is \u2013 is over the long haul is very strong.","Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. Good to hear. Thank you.","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","You bet.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question will come from Byron Pope from Tudor. Your line is open.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Morning.","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Morning, Byron.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Guys, I've got a couple of quick questions, which stems from the fact that I just don't write very fast. Bit for Rig Systems, it seemed as though this was the first quarter since really 2014 where the book and turn revenues were up sequentially. And just thinking about the guidance for Q2 in terms of the revenue from backlog, I think I heard $260 million. And for the overall revenue guidance, down sequentially. Just seemed as though that book and turn revenue might be flattish to maybe slightly down in Q2. So I guess, the way I was thinking about that book and turn business with land drillers starting \u2013 or continuing to upgrade rig, I would have thought that the top line progression would continue to progress there. So I was just wondering if maybe, Jose, if you could speak to the sequential dynamics for Rig Systems.","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yeah. Byron, I'm not 100% sure I heard you right as it relates to Rig Aftermarket. But just to make sure we're on the same page, we actually guided...","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Rig Systems.","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","I understand, but you referred to Rig Aftermarket which plays into the answer. So Rig Aftermarket, we actually guided up a little bit from Q1 to Q2. And I think you're asking a very good question because the preponderance of that book and turn revenue within Rig Systems, it really relates to the inter-company revenue that is between \u2013 mostly between Rig Systems and Rig Aftermarket. So as Rig Aftermarket improves, you should see that percentage or that number actually increase over time.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay, okay. That's helpful. And then with regard to Wellbore Technologies, I think you spoke to continued strong incremental margins there as we think about Q2, but the incrementals were so fantastic in Q1. And could you help us frame in ballpark terms how you're thinking about incremental margins for Wellbore Technologies in Q2?","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yeah. I think it's really similar incrementals as to what we saw in Q1.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Clay Williams for any closing remarks.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","I appreciate everyone joining us this morning. We look forward to updating you on our second quarter results in July.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program.

[Operator Instructions]","Now I will turn the call over to Pete for his opening comments.","Merrill A. Miller","Thanks, Loren, and good morning, everybody. Earlier today, we announced fourth quarter 2011 net income of $574 million or $1.35 per fully diluted share on revenues of $4.26 billion. These earnings are 8% and better than the third quarter of 2011 and 29% better than the fourth quarter of 2010. Earnings for the entire year of 2011 totaled $2 billion or $4.70 per fully diluted share on revenues of $14.66 billion. These results are 20% better than 2010.","Additionally, we announced new capital equipment orders in the quarter of $1.7 billion, bringing the total new orders in the year to $10.8 billion, which eclipses our old record of $7.3 billion set in 2008. We are very excited about these results and optimistic about the ordering atmosphere for 2012. I want to thank all of the employees around the world at National Oilwell Varco for their tremendous work in achieving these stellar results for our shareholder. I will expand further on our operations in a moment, but we'll now turn it over to Clay to provide some color on our results.","Clay C. Williams","Thank you, Pete. National Oilwell Varco posted excellent results in the fourth quarter, earning $574 million or $1.35 per fully diluted share on $4.3 billion in revenue. Operating profit was $848 million for the fourth quarter, up $76 million from the third quarter and up $224 million from the fourth quarter of last year on a GAAP basis. ","Excluding transaction charges from all periods, fourth quarter operating profit was $860 million, up 11% from the third quarter and up 38% from the fourth quarter last year. Operating margins on this basis were 20.2% in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to 20.8% in the third quarter and 19.7% in the fourth quarter of last year. ","Sequential operating leverage or flow-through was 16% on the 14% increase in sales. This is a little lower than we typically see for 2 reasons: First, we had nearly a full quarter's contribution from our Ameron acquisition, which closed October 5, and was responsible for about 25% of our consolidated sequential revenue growth. These businesses came in at a little lower margin as expected, but our integration initiatives to improve efficiency are fully mobilized and we are pleased with the progress so far. Four months into the Ameron combination, we're very excited about what we see and in particular about the composite pipe powerhouse we are building.","Second, most of the rest of the sequential sales growth, 67%, came from our Rig Technology segment, at slightly lower sequential margins, consistent with the gradual mix shift we've described in the past. Outstanding execution, once again, by this team, they\u2019re boosted revenue out of backlog a remarkable 26% sequentially, up $368 million over the third quarter.","Overall, the fourth quarter marked a strong finish to a strong year for NOV. 2011 saw National Oilwell Varco generate record net income of $1,994,000,000 on record revenues of $14.7 billion. Compared to the full year results for 2010 and excluding transaction charges from both years, revenues improved 21% at 21% operating leverage year-over-year. Cash flow from operations was a very solid $2.1 billion and the company reinvested $1.5 billion in our business, 1\/3 in organic growth opportunities and 2\/3 in acquisition growth opportunities. Another $0.5 billion went to scheduled debt repayments and dividends to our shareholders.","For 5 straight years in every single quarter, NOV has generated at least $500 million in operating profit and margins of at least 19%, a pretty good streak. And lest we forget, these 5 past years included the downfalls of Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, a $700 billion TARP bailout bill, a 70% collapse in commodity prices, a historic downgrade of U.S. debt ratings and the worst credit market meltdown in a generation. Nevertheless, NOV performed like a honey badger, illustrating the company's uniquely durable portfolio of oilfield equipment and services. ","As we've discussed in the past, we expect 3 big trends to continue to shape NOV's fortunes in the coming years: One, deepwater development; two, retooling old land and jack up drilling rig fleets; and three, shale developments.","First, sometime in the mid-1990s, deepwater technologies blossomed. Seismic advances illuminated deepwater structures, motion compensation systems permitted floating rigs to keep drillbits on bottom and drill these structures efficiently despite heaving seas and floating production vessels hooked to subsea systems provided a way to economically produce the discoveries that followed. ","Science and entrepreneurial innovation in rapid succession opened up the rest of the planet, specifically the 2\/3 of the globe covered by more than 500 feet of water to oil and gas development, which was inaccessible by our industry through its first century. The capability to drill and produce reliably in this environment, coupled with $100 oil, led predictably to rising demand for deepwater rigs. The late 1990s saw a handful of floating rigs built inefficiently, almost all late and way over budget. But a second larger wave, beginning in 2005, witnessed vastly improved execution and definitively signaled the industry's intention to make the 21st century, the deepwater century. ","NOV has played a key role in this evolution by driving consistency of design, implementing more responsive cellular manufacturing techniques and training hundreds of highly skilled service technicians in our 4 technical colleges to commission these vessels. We have delivered 62 floating rig packages since 2005, with only one delay due to issues with our equipment, an outstanding record that is a testament to the high level of professionalism demonstrated daily by our Rig Technology team. ","The thing about deepwater drilling is that it begets more deepwater drilling. The initial armada that moved out into deeper waters made discoveries that require follow-on development drilling to produce. The success has whetted appetites for more exploration. That's why paradoxically, the deepwater rig market is tightening and day rates are moving up in spite of a slew of new rig deliveries over the past several years, and that's why we are confident that there will be more to come.","We believe drillers closely consider \u00bd dozen or so major factors when they launch offshore new build projects. Day rate environment, currently good and getting better and somewhat a derivative of oil price. Availability of financing, currently stable. Cost of the rig, which is stable and reasonable. Balance sheet capacity, which will vary by customer. Operational bandwidth to crew and manage a new rig, which also will vary by customer and risk of delays in building, which is currently low and approaching 0, at least with NOV rig packages.","We believe most of these factors, save operational bandwidth, are to the positive today. Day rates are rising. Credit is available, to the extent operational bandwidth gives some drillers pause, stems from their voracious appetite for many new rigs that they ordered in 2011. ","Drilling equipment package pricing is up 6% to 8% year-over-year but has stabilized recently, while hull costs are actually down 1% or 2% in the last few months, as the Asian shipyards continue to try to replenish the declining commercial vessel backlogs. Stability has taken some of the urgency out of decisions to exercise options. And recent option activity has been a mixed bag. Some had been exercised, we have extended some for cash or modest uplifts in pricing, while other option holders have elected to let theirs expired out of the money. Options activity notwithstanding, we believe 2012 finds us in an environment still highly conducive to building deepwater rigs, which underpins our positive outlook.","A little further down the road, we see rising demand for production systems to monetize deepwater discoveries. We think the most interesting of these are floating production storage and offloading systems or FPSOs, which are clever substitute for a pipeline. Our APL turret mooring products position us well to sell into future FPSO construction. However, orders were slow in coming in 2011. Nevertheless, we are scoping and quoting record levels of projects. And given that there had been 180-plus deepwater discoveries announced around the world over the past several years, our long-term view for demand here is very bright.","Onto retooling. The average jack-up was born in 1982. That's really old for a rig. The average land rig around the globe was born during the Carter administration. Kellies, master bushings, rock bits, 30-degree deviated drilling, rotary phones, IBM Selectric typewriters and 8-track tapes were the leading-edge technologies then. Today, these rigs are old, tired, rusty and inefficient. They are being replaced. ","In November, our ReedHycalog unit, in conjunction with World Oil magazine, published our annual rig census, where we count rigs across many markets as we've done since the early 1950s. This year's version was headlined, again, paradoxically: North American rig fleet shrinks as activity climbs. It's true despite high rig counts across North America, despite high and modestly rising day rates, despite the highest level of land rig building for North America in a generation, the number of rigs available to drill is dropping. The death rate is exceeding the birthrate. Machines like rigs have finite lives, both physically and technologically. And this generation of jack-up and land rigs that has served us well, that we have relied upon to fuel rising levels of oil and gas consumptions since the 1980s are in their sunset years. ","Public land drillers have announced the retirement of 200 land rigs in the past few months, despite generally rising day rates. Obviously, the market makes an enormous distinction between new rigs and old rigs. The retooling phenomenon is most advanced in the U.S., where about 40% of the fleet has been replaced over the past several years. However, this likely overstates the impact somewhat because many rigs early in the replacement cycle were simply copies of old 1970s designs. The effective replacement rate is probably closer to 1\/3. And at the current rate, we are probably replacing 6% or 7% per year. The 3,000 or so rigs in the international markets, land rigs in the international markets are in the very early days of retooling. Nevertheless, NOV and our competitors have sold new rigs now into most major markets, so early adopters are starting to prime the demand pump in these regions by differentiating themselves through performance. ","The replacement of the jack-up rig fleet is probably roughly 1\/3 of the way through too, inclusive of rigs still being constructed in shipyards to be delivered by 2014, representing about a decade's worth of serious effort. The strength of the jack-up cycle in particular has surprised many analysts but we believe it will continue. Lately, we have seen the customer base shift to national oil company owned or controlled drilling contractors for a conventional 350-foot or 400-foot leg cantilever jack-ups, and IOC-driven mega jack-up projects that can approach $0.5 billion in total costs.","Overall, we believe extrapolation of progress thus far in replacing these rig categories implies another 20-plus years to go. No question that the next 20 years, we'll see commodity price and day rate volatility starts and stops, but building will need to happen more years than not.","And finally, the third major trend driving NOV's destiny is shales. A major catalyst for the retooling of the land rig fleet in particular is the shale revolution. Like the deepwater revolution, the shale revolution was born of science and entrepreneurial ingenuity, thus creating jobs across North America, creating wealth for mineral rights owners, helping local governments balance their budgets and EIA report by EIA report, demonstrating a U.S. that is remarkably moving closer to energy independence.","So here's an economics question for you. If 14th century alchemists had actually been successful at transforming rocks into gold, what would have happened to the price of gold? Answer, pretty much what is happening to the price of gas now. As 21st century alchemists have figured out how to turn rocks into gas. Like everyone else, we're wondering where North American gas prices find support and what does gas drilling look like once the dust settles. But encouragingly, the entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well in our industry, which is repositioning, rotating, some say, sprinting, from gas to liquids, which still enjoy robust pricing. Kind of like how gas in Continental Europe still enjoys robust pricing, 5 or 6x higher than it is in the U.S.","We predict this equilibrium spanning the Atlantic will equilibrate over the next several years, as the industry employs technologies honed here into shales located there to make Europe more energy self-sufficient. To this end, we are expanding our rig up and manufacturing operations in Poland and elsewhere across Europe and adding new European rig designs to our offering, to help our customers make this happen.","The shale revolution is gaining traction elsewhere too, in places like China and Argentina. The EIA sees nearly 6,000 Tcf in shales across about 3 dozen countries. So how long do Europe and other countries continue to pay $10 or more for an Mcf of gas? NOV is a key supplier and the leading supplier of many the technologies that go into successful shale programs: rigs, drill pipe, drilling motors, bits, coiled tubing and pressure pumping equipment, just to name a few. ","And although shale gas supply will certainly present structural pricing challenges from time to time, temporary slowdowns in drilling should quickly correct imbalances given steep decline curves that wipe out 75% or more of most wells production within the first 2 years. Against the backdrop of this very drilling and hardware intensive process, our outlook for drilling and hardware demand remains bright. ","Commodity price volatility and rig count activity storms they unleash are nothing new to NOV. Over the years, we've learned that the best course for our company is to always invest for the long haul. We remain passionate in our views on deepwater development, on retooling a fleet of rigs critical to the world's energy equation and of an amazing new incremental source of energy wealth from shales. Our strategies and investments in 2011 reflect our high level of conviction in these themes.","But when it comes to the continued growth and success of NOV, our most valued resource is an exceptional workforce we are honored to serve. Pete, Loren and I are exceedingly grateful to work with a team of professionals at NOV, who daily provide terrific service, products and technology to the world's oil and gas industry. We thank you all for your hard work in 2011 and look forward to a terrific execution in an exciting 2012 and beyond. You are the best.","Now let me turn to our segment operating results. NOV's Rig Technology segment generated revenues of $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter, up 18% sequentially and up 32% compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Operating profit was $603 million, yielding operating margins for the group of 26%, a decline of 80 basis points from the third quarter and 250 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2010. Incremental operating leverage or flow-through was 22% of the sequential sales improvement of $346 million, and incremental leverage or flow-through was 18% from the fourth quarter of 2010 on the $559 million revenue improvement, with a little less than the 30% to 35% we would typically expect. ","This is due to the gradual decline in margins we'd been guiding to for about a year arising from a mixed shift in the group. High operating margins north of 30% that we're seeing in the first half of 2010 from projects sold at exceptionally high pricing in 2007 and 2008, being executed in a low-cost deflationary environment. As fatter margin projects wind their way out of the backlog, we are reverting to a more normalized margin. Therefore, our guidance for this segment calls for margins to flatten in the 25% range before beginning a very gradual rise in the second half of this year. ","As a later-cycle business, in effect, we're seeing the economic downturn of 2009 manifesting in the group's P&L right now. Importantly, performance remains superb, as the group's annualized fourth quarter NOPAT returns on tangible capital achieved triple digits this quarter.","On previous calls, we've noted that construction cycles for offshore rigs are shortening, a result of increasingly hungry shipyards in Asia finding themselves with more and more idled assets that they can redirect to rig building, speeding the process. They are committing to build schedules that are 6 to 10 months shorter now, which requires a little faster delivery of drilling equipment packages into these projects by NOV. ","Unlike a land rig project, where NOV essentially builds the entire rig and is wholly responsible for the critical path, the offshore rig critical path still resides almost entirely within the shipyard. It takes longer to make a hull than it takes to make the drilling equipment package. But nevertheless, we have to step up our delivery rates to meet the needs of our customers, so we've been investing in expansion initiatives. This quarter saw our revenues out of backlog jumped 26% sequentially to a new record level of $1,775,000,000, as we responded to these more challenging build schedules.","Our fourth quarter orders for Rig Technology were $1,668,000,000 and included 3 floaters and 6 jack-up packages. Year-ending backlog totaled $10,164,000,000, down just a shade from September 30. For the full year, orders totaled a record $10,849,000,000. We expect about $6.6 billion of our orders on the books at year end to flow out as revenue during 2012. $1.8 billion to flow out in 2013 and the balance to flow out in 2014 and beyond.","86% of our backlog is destined for the offshore, 14% for land and 86% is international, while 14% is domestic. Outlook for orders remains good with several major projects seeking bids now.","Land bookings jump from the third quarter matched by higher land revenues, leaving our land backlog about flat. Land orders were balanced between domestic and international sales. And in addition to complete drilling and workover rigs, we sold several rig component packages. Demand for pressure pumping, oil tubing units and frac equipment remained exceptionally strong, with 2012 largely sold out and several expansion initiatives underway to respond to demand. ","We're delivering nearly 1 frac-sander a day now. Mix for wellbore stimulation equipment was steady at about 60% North America, 40% international. We continue to see interest from emerging international shale markets as oilfield service companies begin to layer in infrastructure to accommodate hydraulic fracture stimulation. Domestically, pressure pumper seemed to be settling on larger diameter, 2-inch coil tubing. While internationally, 1 3\/4 inch is still preferred. Larger diameter permits accessing longer laterals without buckling and offers higher flow rates and better hydraulics but also requires much larger, heavier reels that can present transportation challenges. ","Non-backlog revenue for the group declined 4% sequentially this quarter due to lower aftermarket sales around the holidays. We saw the same thing in the fourth quarter of 2010, when non-backlog revenue declined 1% from the third quarter to the fourth. Year-over-year, it was up 11% for the fourth quarter and annual growth rates for the aftermarket has averaged over 20% over the past 6 years.","For the full year, Rig Technology generated $7.8 billion in revenue and $2.1 billion in operating profit or 26.6% compared to $7 billion in revenues, $2.1 billion in operating profit and 29.7% operating margins in 2010. The mix effect we\u2019ve described in the past led to lower operating margins for the year as expected, but the group generated very strong returns on capital for the year and $10.2 billion in backlog after record orders, positions Rig Technology for a strong performance in 2012. During the fourth quarter, the group commissioned 6 offshore rigs, bringing our total to 23 for the year and over 120 offshore rigs since 2005. Looking into the first quarter of 2010 -- or sorry, 2012, we expect Rig Technology revenues to be roughly flat with the fourth quarter at slightly lower margins.","The Petroleum Services & Supplies segment generated total sales of $1,570,000,000 in the fourth quarter of 2011, up 8% from the third quarter and up 38% year-over-year. Operating profit was $301 million or 19.2% of sales. Margins fell from 20.5% in the third quarter, as the contribution from Ameron came in at a little lower margin and a couple of the products within PS&S posted lower margins due to unfavorable mix and some higher costs. Most notably, margins for Drill Pipe declined sequentially due to much higher sequential purchases from third-party of third-party green tubes, owing to our third quarter maintenance shutdown of the Voest-Alpine mill and adverse euro movements early in the fourth quarter. Margins, nevertheless, remained accretive to the segment margins over all. And we expect that these cost factors will be transient and for Drill Pipe margins to improve in the first quarter. Further in the year, our outlook remains strong for Drill Pipe demand given that there are dozens of new build offshore rigs, which we expect to buy premium Drill Pipe.","Mix and cost headwinds in certain businesses were partly offset by strong sequential performance at downhole tools, with higher royalty revenues and strong sales growth in Canada and in the eastern hemisphere. Wellsite  services also had an excellent sequential performance, with growth in equipment sales and rental and leasing operations in the U.S. XL Systems posted a strong finish to the year and Tuboscope, Quality Tubing and Mission all showed sequential sales gains as well. For the full year 2011, Petroleum Services & Supplies segment generated a record $5.7 billion in revenue, up 35% from $4.2 billion in 2010. The segment generated $1.1 billion in operating profit, almost double operating profit levels for 2010 and representing 35% leverage on the year-over-year sales growth.","Operating margins of 19.4% for the year were up from 14% in 2010. Looking into the first quarter of 2012, we expect Petroleum Services & Supplies segment sales to grow in the low-single-digit percentage range sequentially and for operating margins to push back above the 20% level.","Turning to Distribution & Transmission, first note that it has a new name. The change to this quarter reflects the inclusion of Ameron's water transmission and infrastructure products groups from October 5 onward. For the quarter, the group generated $560 million in sales and $45 million in operating profit or 8% of sales. Compared to the third quarter, sales improved 17%, mostly due to Ameron. And year-over-year quarterly sales grew 32%. ","Sequential operating leverage or flow-through excluding charges was 10% and year-over-year flow-through was 11%. Margins for the newly acquired businesses, in the aggregate, were in line with the segment margins. The legacy NOV distribution portion of the segment saw revenues up slightly, with strong flow-throughs due to terrific performance in Canada. International was up slightly and the U.S. was down slightly, owing to rig moves towards liquids plays together with related drill site construction delays and weather issues in a few markets.","Mono posted good performance, once again, with strong demand for power sections and artificial lift equipment. Fourth quarter results capped a strong year for the segment overall, with a record $1,873,000,000 in sales, a record $136 million in operating profit and 7.3% operating margins. Revenues were up 21% and flow-throughs were 18% for the year. Typical flow-through for the group runs about 10%, so we were pleased with the strong incremental and resulting margins for the group.","For the first quarter of 2012, we expect Distribution & Transmission revenues to be down slightly, and slightly lower margins as compared to the fourth quarter. National Oilwell Varco's consolidated fourth quarter income statement saw SG&A increased $35 million sequentially due to acquisitions and sales growth. SG&A as a percent of sales was 10% in the fourth quarter, down from 10.5% in the third quarter and down from 11.8% in the fourth quarter last year. Transaction costs were $12 million pretax and the equity income in our Voest-Alpine joint venture was $12 million, up slightly from the third quarter. We expect similar profitability in the first quarter of 2012.","Other expense moved $13 million unfavorably from the third quarter to the fourth due to the non-recurrence of favorable FX moves in Q3, which offset bank charges and other items on this line, which usually run about $11 million a quarter. FX was relatively quiet this quarter. ","The tax rate for the fourth quarter and for the full year was 32%, about what we expect in 2012. Unallocated expenses and eliminations on our supplemental segment schedule was $89 million in the fourth quarter, up $3 million from the third quarter due to higher inter-segment eliminations. Depreciation and amortization was roughly flat at $142 million, and EBITDA excluding transaction charges was $1 billion for the quarter and $3.6 billion for the year.","NOV's December 31, 2011, balance sheet employed working capital excluding cash and debt of $3.5 billion or 20.6% of annualized sales, up $84 million from the third quarter on higher inventory and accounts receivable, partly offset by higher accrued taxes and liabilities. Total customer financing on projects in the form of prepayments and billings in excess of costs, less cost in excess of billings, was $865 million at December 31, down $276 million due to the large increase in revenue out of backlog. Cash flow from operations was $622 million for the fourth quarter and $2,143,000,000 for the year.","CapEx increased $41 million sequentially in the quarter to $166 million, bringing full year capital expenditures to $483 million. We expect CapEx in 2012 to move into the $600 million range as we pursue a number of expansion opportunities launched last year, as well as follow through on projects brought in with Ameron. Cash spent on 9 acquisitions totaled $1,038,000,000 for the year, and dividends paid to our shareholders totaled $191 million during 2011. Finally, NOV's cash balance was $3.5 billion at December 31, 2011. ","Now let me turn it back to Pete.","Merrill A. Miller","Thanks, Clay. I'd like to make a few brief comments and I'll turn it over for questions in just a moment. But you know, as we look back on the past year, there's really been 3 things that we've emphasized greatly in this company, and the first one has been efficiency. And that's driving cost out of the system and that's being able to deliver products on time, on budget. And we've invested heavily, we've gone into our facilities, we've changed things around, we've gone to cellular manufacturing. You've heard us talk about this an awful lot. We've expanded. We bought new facilities. And this has allowed us to do a couple of fairly unique things. We have been able to drive almost a year out of the delivery of deepwater rigs. If you would have been ordering those back in '06 and '07, it was about a 36-month lead time, today it's 24 months. The reason for that is great shipyards, Samsung, Hyundai, the people in Korea, the people in Singapore have all done a very good job. But more importantly, we're able to get throughput out much more rapidly than we could before because of these efficiencies. We're driving down costs. You see great margins that are coming out of it, and we're going to continue to emphasize this. ","The second thing is personnel. Personnel are extremely important. They're the most important thing we have in this company. We're investing heavily in training. We've opened up colleges around the country for our technical people. We currently have them in Norway, in Singapore, Brazil and here in the United States. But interestingly, in these colleges, we actually, last year, sent 5,000 of our customers' people through them. And this year, we expect to surpass 6,000 of that. So we're able to not only train our own people, but we're able to train our customers' people, so that we can better take care of these products as they're in the field. ","We also have agreements with Purdue University, Rice University of Texas and Texas A&M, that we utilized and having different classes and different courses for our people internally, so that we can emphasize manufacturing, sales management and other things that we do such as taking technology and turning it into a profitable venture. ","And then finally, the thing I want to mention our new products. The lifeblood of the company is making sure that you're having the best technology out there that really our customers can utilize to create efficiency in the oilfield. The shales have really created that. We're pushing more and more different things in the shales. We see the technology, as Clay kind of mentioned, we're turning that stuff into gold, making it a little bit cheaper. But we have a lot of new products. We continue to press ahead on our R&D efforts. We introduced a new frac pump recently. Our Helios bit, which is something that I think is going to be very, very effective in drilling these shale wells. And a lot of products like that. So when we think about things, it's about efficiency, it's about personnel and it's about new products. We think those are what's going to lead us into the next couple of years to really be the market leader that we continue to be. ","So we're excited about it. We like what we're seeing, in the first part of 2012. I think 2012, while it will have some challenges, will be a very, very exciting year for us. ","So, Dawn, at this point, I'd like to turn it over to our callers for any questions they might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  Our first question comes from Douglas Becker from Bank of America.","Douglas L. Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Maybe as we think about PS&S going forward, there's a few moving parts here. I know that we will see some acceleration in Drill Pipe, the Ameron acquisition could be coming in, getting some synergies there. And then just -- we guess, we have the low natural gas prices. Do you see the potential for 30%, 35% incrementals like we've seen in 2010 and 2011 as we go through 2012?","Clay C. Williams","Yes. Doug, I think so. In Q4, as we -- if we talked about last quarter, we had Ameron coming in so far so good on integrating that business and improving the margins that we see incremental from that, and so that will help. And as we expected last quarter, we dropped a little below 20% margins. We're posting 19.2% this quarter. Going into 2012, as we began to get traction on those efforts, plus we continue to see improvements in our other businesses in terms of efficiency, maybe a little better pricing. We perceive marching up above the 20% range. And so I think 30%, 35% incrementals generally make sense. One thing though that I'll point out is that, the pricing gains that we appear to be getting in the fourth quarter and as we move into 2012 within PS&S are a little more limited, they're a little more focused on either specific products and technologies or specific geographic areas like the Eagle Ford or the Bakken, where you're seeing rigs moving into that area. So it's more of a little -- little more of a mixed bag. In the past, PS&S has been able to post incremental margin gains north of 35% during periods when the rig count is running up. And right now, we're seeing the rig count in North America a little more flattish and pricing gains a little more limited as a result.","Douglas L. Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Makes sense. And then just -- so I'm still very positive on the retooling of the industry. Have you noticed any short-term changes in maybe some of the more price sensitive or North American-sensitive land rigs, coil tubing, frac spreads or stimulation equipment in terms of orders?","Clay C. Williams","No. We've -- again, a good demand but I think pricing is probably stabilized but demand remains high. We haven't had any -- although I think most of our customers are a little nervous like we are about gas prices. We haven't seen anybody backing off their ordering for well stimulation equipment or land rigs. And again, it's -- we do a lot North America, but we're also seeing a lot of interest from international markets too. So those, of course, are unaffected by the recent gas price downturn.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Crandell from Dahlman Rose.","James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Many of your traditional customers seem to be taking a bit of a pause in their deepwater rig ordering. Given the strength in deepwater day rates that we've seen recently, do you expect this to be short lived?","Merrill A. Miller","Yes, Jim, I think so. I mean, if you look at this, there's a couple of things that are impacting this right now. My comments, I mentioned that the speed with which we're getting these things out, we've knocked about a year off. And so, I think the customers are taking a look at that going, instead of having to plan 3, 3.5 years out, now they can kind of look ahead to 2 years and it gives them more flexibility. And also, I think as you look at some of the rigs that are being built right now, there's probably a pause that people are waiting to see some of those get contracted. And as they get contracted, then I think you'll see them come in and, okay, let's go and let's order. So we're actually fairly optimistic as we look at the project list that we review every week, and we kind of look at the things out there. We think that the ordering in fact will pick up from some of the traditional customers.","James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I realize you don't run your business off ODS-Petrodata data. But if you look at all your deepwater rig orders we've seen and what National Oilwell has brought, do you think there's still some orders that are generally known to have happened in the industry or reported in ODS-Petrodata that for some reason you haven't put into your backlog? And is that number larger than usual right now?","Merrill A. Miller","Well, we -- as we take a look at that, Jim, obviously ODS-Petrodata, I mean that's out there and it's public. We generally don't make our information public for a lot of reasons. I mean, obviously, competitive reasons and everything else. But I would say that we probably have a little bit better knowledge as we look at things, simply because -- as I've said many times, if you're going to order a rig, you got to come to us. Not even if you don't want to order from us, you can at least use us as a stalking horse. And so, we think that we've got a little bit better insight into this and probably, the things that we know don't necessarily match up with ODS-Petrodata. And obviously, having said that, I'm kind of bouncing around a little bit. But clearly, there's stuff out there and stuff that we know about that's not necessarily known publicly.","James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And last question. Clay, one for you. Can you give a sense as to the overall breakdown of PS&S? How much of that total segment now was North America? And in your North American business, a guess as to how much could be natural gas oriented?","Clay C. Williams","Yes. Jim, in the fourth quarter, the total North America was 58%. It's revenues by destination. U.S. is right at 50%, Canada is about 8%. That's within the PS&S segment. And with regards to how much of that is gas, it's purely a guess, perhaps 1\/3 of the U.S. land fleet is drilling for gas. It's probably a pretty good proxy.","Operator","Our next question comes from James West from Barclays Capital.","James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Clay or Pete, with $3.5 billion in cash on the balance sheet and just on my numbers, I have you generating some $5 billion or so in free cash flow the next 2 years. It seems like you got a lot of firepower to put to work. I know you guys are focused on M&A. Do you think that we'll see deals here in the near term? Has the acquisition market improved? And I've heard from some that at least one of the competitors for deals has kind of dropped out of the market, to which may clear the way for you to get some work done.","Merrill A. Miller","Yes. I think, James, as we've said many, many times, our preference is really to utilize our cash to grow the company. And we've done that, we think very effectively through M&A. Obviously, in the last quarter, we brought in Ameron. And that was, I think, give or take about an $800-million deal. There are a lot of things that we're looking at today. I think that the buying opportunities are there. It's always kind of nice when people take a little bit of a pause and they think, maybe there's some choppy waters ahead because that really makes the buying opportunities much more attractive for us. If you take a look at our history, we probably made the best deals when things were kind of down a little bit. We're very disciplined. We stay very true to our core values on that. And if other people are willing to overpay, that's kind of the way it is. We get in very few auctions. We kind of put a value on something, and tell people this is what it is, and we've been successful at doing that. Having said that, it does appear that some competitors for things have dropped out, and we're very optimistic that we'll probably be able to announce a few deals here in the near future. A lot of good things that we're looking out, out there right now.","James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Good to hear. And then just somewhat related follow-up on that, what\u2019s your exposure to pressure pumping equipment sales? Are there certain product lines that go into stimulation equipment that you are currently not in that maybe you would acquire companies to get into or maybe organically get into those certain products?","Clay C. Williams","Yes. The most conspicuously absent product has been a pressure pump. And here over the last 18 months or so, we've developed our own. So we've approached that organically and have a couple of dozen 2,400-horsepower pumps at work in the field and doing very, very well. So as you know, we package a lot of frac spread equipment, well stimulation equipment and so we've had a lot of pressure pumps kind of pass through our operation being unitized and going into the field that way. And we also have, over the years, probably made more drilling pumps than anyone. So we make a lot of pumps on the one hand but we weren't really focused in this area before. So a couple of years ago, we recognized that and launched organic initiative to develop our own pressure pump. And so far, so good. Very, very excited by the prospect for that.","James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And does that include float-ins as well, Clay?","Clay C. Williams","Yes, yes.","Merrill A. Miller","Absolutely.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Uhlmer from Global Hunter Securities.","Brian Uhlmer - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","I just want to follow-up on James' question on the pump. I know you've got about 20 or 30 of those out in the field or so as of this date. Can you follow up on how testing is going with those? Number one. And number two, are you looking at that as adding to the new market or as these things wear out, that you pass through that, you're going to have also a very robust replacement market as you put your pumps on some of the equipment that you've previously delivered using other folks' pumps.","Merrill A. Miller","It's a good question, and I would say it's all of the above. Obviously, as we have this pop out there and we're very, very pleased with this performance at this point in time. And again, we're good pump manufacturers. This was almost just kind of a natural offshoot for us. But the thing about it is, we'll also have a footprint on it, that not only will we put it on new equipment that goes out, but as you have to replace pumps on existing equipment, it will be able to be retrofitted onto those trailers very easily. So we think it's a tremendous business, and also it's kind of a follow-up to the fluid end part of it. The expendable side of that business is outstanding. Not only do we have the expendable side on our regular drilling pumps, but now with the expendable side on these frac pumps and they go through expendables, very, very rapidly. That's a real positive business for our Mission group.","Clay C. Williams","Brian, on this same theme too, in addition to the frac pump, over the last 2 years or so, we've added other products that contribute to go into that pressure pumping phenomenon that we're seeing so much demand for. So we're, for instance, a lot of flow iron, we brought in through acquisitions. We made an acquisition last year that brought us some frac-sander products that are used to transport and to move profit to locations and around locations. So those sorts of -- we're kind of quietly been building out more and more in this area to satisfy the needs of our customers.","Brian Uhlmer - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And my follow-up kind of along those consumable lines. Is really do -- you mentioned artificial lift in power section business, you had some capacity expansion in the powerlift -- I mean, in the power section business. As you would deliver all those horizontal rigs this year and a lot of your rigs, do you see that ongoing demand increasing fairly substantially as we go through 2012? And then, on artificial lift, what other areas -- what's your strong foothold right now? What other areas of artificial lift do you think you want to expand into either organically or through acquisitions?","Clay C. Williams","Yes. We've -- through our Distribution & Transmission segment, we have long sold a lot of artificial lift products and it's kind of a variety of things. Mostly -- in the past, mostly we bought in those from other suppliers. But here, again, over the last couple of years, we've been quietly building out our own products, our own kind of manufacturing capabilities. Mono within distribution manufactures the rotors and stators that, really, form the progressing cavity pumps that are used in certain artificial lift applications and it's the same design and technique that goes into downhole drilling motors. And so that business sells in to both of those. The strategy here is pretty straightforward. With a sharp increase in a number of rigs drilling for liquids, on down the road as those wells start to make water, start to lose initial reservoir energy, they're going to need to have artificial lift to lift them. And so we want to be position ourselves to sell into that trend. Likewise, we have seen a big explosion in demand for downhole drilling motors used to drill horizontally, and are the leading supplier of those kinds of motors to the industry. And so -- and it's basically, the same kind of manufacturing technology. To that end, we've been expanding our manufacturing capabilities in Europe and expanding our motor reline and servicing capabilities here in North America to meet the demand.","Merrill A. Miller","And, Brian, I'd also add that when you talk about drilling motors today, you really are going to be using those on almost every type of well that you drill, even if it's just a traditional vertical well. They add so much to your efficiency and your ability to get hydraulic horsepower to the bit and torque, that it's really almost a natural part. Where in the past, to having a drilling motor was something unique, today it's almost just like having drill colors and a drill bit. You're going to have that motor there and our market position on those is quite good.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim Securities.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Clay, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that the FPSO orders were slow in coming in 2011. But obviously, you've been in the market, marketing the concept. And in particular, I guess more of a modular or kit approach as opposed to sort of the one-off in custom designs. I was wondering, if you could just sort of address how that's going? And maybe talk about the uptake of a more modular concept relative to what we saw in the drilling rig market in the earlier 2000s.","Clay C. Williams","Yes. We're about -- we required APL in December 2010. So we're, what, 13 -- 12.5 months into it, so it's still early days. We kind of also bought the business as we're seeing the effects of the financial market meltdown in 2009 sort of show up in the business. And so our sense is, right now, the whole subsea space is now just starting to kind of pull itself out of that downturn and getting serious about placing orders. We've also pointed out in the past, Michael, that the sanctioning of large subsea development projects doesn't move very quickly. You're talking about billions of dollars of expenditures for the FPSO, for the subsea wellheads, for the flow lines and manifold. And so getting approval within an IOC, plus getting approval usually within their partners' organizations takes a while. So this doesn't move quickly and that's no surprise to us. But as we've discussed with you and with others through 2011, our plan here really is to make this more modular. And we think that, that really will enhance the value to our customers. One of the big challenges that the owner operators of FPSOs have is after the initial contract, they'll sign a contract to produce a field for, let's say, 10 years. The economics -- the ultimate economics on that project will often hinge on whether or not they can find a second field to move that FPSO onto after the initial contract expires, out in year 11. So the sales pitch basically is to say, look, if we have a more systematic design of the turret, which is physically where the FPSO actually plugs into the field, it's going to increase potentially the number of fields that, that FPSO can go into and work on its second career and improve the returns to our customers. So in a nutshell, that's kind of the plan. And it seems to work well. We think we're going to get some traction out there with that, and hope to standardize those designs and that's a big part of our strategy. So I'd say so far, so good. But we'll know for sure once, I think, orders start to flow. And I think orders ought to start to flow this year 2012.","Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","That was actually going to be my follow-up. I think with the subsea orders expected to ramp up this year, just in terms of timing, I would imagine construction of FPSO is a longer lead time item. So should we see that even ahead of trees [ph], do you think?","Clay C. Williams","Yes. I think we're going to start to see some activity in 2012. And as also referenced in my comments, we're quoting more projects now. We've got more feed studies going along. We've got a lot of people who are very, very interested in this hardware and a lot of activity. It just hasn't necessarily translated through the contracts yet.","Merrill A. Miller","And then again, as we've said a lot of times, Michael. I mean, kind of B follows A. and you take a look at the number of deepwater rigs that we're putting out there. As I tell people, they're not drilling for practice. They're drilling so they can find oil and gas. And the approved solution when they find it, really, is going to be the FPSO mode of production. So we think that you'll probably see, certainly, this year and in 2013, you'll see a greater demand for the products that we have in that regard.","Operator","Our next question comes from Marshall Adkins from Raymond James.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Let's talk backlog for a minute. I think in the third quarter, your backlog came in huge, a lot of bigger than most of us thought and this quarter may be a little bit shy of what we thought. It seems to me like that's just a lot of lumpiness. Going forward, should we expect the backlog adds that we had this quarter to be more run rate or was this kind of a one-off lumpiness where it was down a little more than it would be on a run rate?","Merrill A. Miller","Marshall, as we talk about backlog, and we've said this an awful lot. You almost have to look at backlog not necessarily on a quarterly basis but over about 2 or 3 quarters. Because you take a look at the quarter we just came out of, effectively, it's a 9-week quarter. You've got 2 weeks of Christmas, a week of Thanksgiving that you don't, really, aren't get to get much of anything done. And as we've always kind of said, it doesn't really matter to us if somebody orders something on the 30th of December or the 5th of January. But it does matter to that backlog because we cut it off on the 1st of January. So I think by definition, you'll see a little bit of lumpiness. You'll see some coming in a little bit better and some coming a little bit weaker than you think. But when you look at it over the long term, for instance this year, we did about $10.8 billion of new orders. And we think the coming year will also be a positive year. But I think it's very difficult for us to say, it's all going to come in the first quarter or the second quarter or the third quarter. We are optimistic that it will be a positive year on new orders.","Clay C. Williams","Yes, yes. And actually, that's why we really encourage everybody to look at the fundamentals here. The costs of these rigs is pretty reasonable, pretty stable. You have a lot of hungry shipyards, in Asia in particular. And the day rates, which could drive the returns particularly for the deepwater assets are -- the bias is that they're moving up now. And so that sets up a pretty good year we think for 2012 orders.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes. Hard to believe it slows down, if freights are going up. That's why I asked the question.","Merrill A. Miller","Absolutely, absolutely.","Clay C. Williams","Right, right.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","All right. Second question, the distribution side, the biggest margins we've ever seen, that I'm remembering in that business. How much of that was the Ameron versus being added to the mix versus maybe just a more sustainable distribution business?","Merrill A. Miller","Actually, I'll let Clay give you the exact numbers on it. But I'll take this point just to say, most of it is our regular distribution business. Our folks are phenomenal at this. I mean, we've got people that are out there, Marshall, as you take a look, you can go back 3 or 4 years, we're always much better than the competition. We've got some folks that really know this business and they really deliver to our customers and they're really able to rub that buffalo off the nickel. I mean, these guys are really, really good at being able to run an efficient operation. I just have to do a shout out to them.","Clay C. Williams","Yes. The short answer to your question is, that they were all about the same. Ameron came in roughly in line with our legacy businesses within the distribution segment. Actually, they were just a shade below and then our legacy business outperformed just a shade. But if you squint, they're all about the same.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","But clearly, I don't remember margins ever being high? Is that fair?","Clay C. Williams","Yes. We did -- a little over 8%, I think, a few years ago. But their -- what we've seen this latest cycle since 2009 is, really, good, sustained margins out of the group. That just feel like they're more sustained and more solid than we were seeing '06, '07 and '08. So I mean, just to Pete's point, outstanding execution by that team.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robin Shoemaker from Citi.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wanted to ask you about, Clay, a little -- just clarify your guidance on the Rig Tech margins. So it sounds like from what you're saying, you're kind of expecting Rig Tech margins in '12 to be kind of flattish with '11. A little bit lower in the first half and higher in the second half as, I guess, deliveries pick up. Is that roughly correct?","Clay C. Williams","Yes, that is correct, Robin. And one kind of potential misunderstanding that I want to make sure we dispel is we've guided to margins kind of drifting down in that segment. Don't expect the V-shape sort of pattern. We think mid-20s margin is a more normalized kind of margin, and the margins over the past several quarters have been slowly moving down into that range. And we've guided to bottoming mid-20s, around 25%, let's say and then start to slowly lift out of that late in 2012. So that's kind of the pattern we see over the next 4 quarters. And again, I'll stress, margins at 25%, 26%, 27% for Rig Technology equals outstanding returns on capital. So that's a terrific margin. One that's rarely equaled by other manufacturers both within our industry and other manufacturing businesses more broadly.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, okay. So then on the top line of Rig Tech, you mentioned $6.6 billion of revenue from backlog. And then, in '11, the growth in non-backlog revenue was pretty impressive, and it increased over the quarter-by-quarter through year. So kind of ending up in this mid-$500 million per quarter level. Is -- should we expect kind of double-digit growth like you had in 2011, again in '12 in the non-backlog portion?","Clay C. Williams","Yes. I think that's a good -- year-over-year, I think that will be a good kind of range for growth for the non-backlog business. It did actually decline 4% sequentially. But we look back at last year's fourth quarter, it was down 1% sequentially. We suspect that had something to do with the holidays. When we look at that business longer term, the aftermarket business which comprises almost all that non-backlog revenue, over 6 years, has posted compound annual growth rates north of 20%. And very, very strong performance. And so for 2012, we see good growth ahead for that business as well. One thing when it comes to our overall segment revenues for Rig Technology, we had a big, big increase in revenue out of backlog in Q4, up $368 million sequentially. We do foresee that coming down, Q1. And if you look back at revenue out of backlog for that segment, which is on the supplemental information we provide on our website. What you see is it's not uncommon for that business to jump up and down, $200 million or $300 million quarter-to-quarter. And what we saw in Q4 was a big spike up in well stimulation equipment deliveries in particular, and also land rig package deliveries. Both of which are recognized on a completed contracts basis. So that completed contracts rev rec model for Rig Technology drives a lot of volatility there. So that's kind of some of the basis for our outlook for the first quarter of 2012.","Operator","That was our last question. I will now turn it back to Mr. Miller for closing remarks.","Merrill A. Miller","Thank you, Dawn, and thank you all for listening in, and we look forward to talking to you when we release our results for the first quarter of 2012.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Loren Singletary, Chief Investor and Industry Relations Officer. Sir, you may begin.","Loren Singletary - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Welcome, everyone, to National Oilwell Varco's Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Clay Williams, our Chairman, President and CEO, and Jose Bayardo, our Senior Vice President and CFO.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of today's comments are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws.

Reconciliations to the corresponding GAAP measures are in our earnings release available on our website. On a U.S. GAAP basis, in the second quarter of 2017, NOV reported revenues of $1.76 billion and a net loss of $75 million, or $0.20 per share. Our use of the term EBITDA throughout this morning's call corresponds with the term adjusted EBITDA as defined in our earnings release.","Later in the call, we will host a question-and-answer session. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up to permit more participation.","Now let me turn the call over to Clay.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Thank you, Loren. In the second quarter of 2017, NOV generated $1.76 billion in revenue and $142 million in EBITDA, a strong $37 million sequential EBITDA improvement. Much of our business continued to rise with higher oilfield activity, particularly in North America, leading our Land business 7% higher sequentially in the quarter. But this was largely offset by reductions offshore and certain sluggish international markets, like Asia and Africa, that pushed our consolidated offshore mix down to 39% and our Land mix up to 61%. So NOV continues to pivot to where the action is.","Our business unit leaders executed superbly on cost reductions and efficiency improvements. Case in point, the Rig Systems segment posted lower revenues and EBITDA, but the team there once again managed costs remarkably well, as sequential decremental EBITDA margins came in at only 15%. The rest of our segments all posted improved revenues and EBITDA and margins for the second quarter.","Rig Aftermarket grew revenues meaningfully, with whopping 60% incrementals driving a 220 basis point sequential improvement in margin. Solid second quarter top-line growth marked the first real sign we've seen through the downturn that many of our customers have depleted their spare parts inventories, which points to stability and future growth for Rig Aftermarket.","Our Wellbore Technologies segment revenues improved by over 10% sequentially, with nearly 50% EBITDA incrementals driving a 390 basis point sequential improvement in EBITDA margins. Longer more challenging laterals drove rising demand for NOV sophisticated technologies. Our Completion and Production Solutions segment also achieved strong incrementals on 1% revenue growth, as cost reductions, better-than-expected performance from offshore projects and solid execution across the board drove EBITDA margins up 310 basis points sequentially.","Overall, during the second quarter, we were very pleased to see very strong execution by operations as well as solid progress in our many strategic initiatives, new products and technologies we are innovating and five acquisitions closed during the second quarter. NOV continues to enhance the solutions our customers need to navigate a low commodity price world.","One such solution is solids control and waste management. We're a leading provider in this area, having steadily built our position over 20-plus years through a combination of acquisitions and investments in organic growth. Now, Wellbore Technologies derives roughly a fifth of its revenues from this business. Frankly, today, when it comes from solids control, we're it. If you're wondering what solids control is, let me take a minute to explain.","On a drilling rig, mud pumps push drilling fluid or mud down the drillstring to the drill bit, where it exits the bit and in mixes with solid drill cuttings to form a slurry. This slurry is then pumped back up outside the drill pipe to the surface. There, NOV specialized solids control technologies separate drill cuttings from the slurry so that clean mud is recycled and recirculated back down the drillstring over and over as drilling progresses and the separated drill solids can be disposed of safely. This is a critical process.","Accumulated drill solids and mud reduce rates of penetration and cause issues like excessive torque, drag and abrasion, pack-offs and stuck pipe and potentially lost circulation and\/or lost production, all of which are expensive and most of which are very, very expensive. This makes solids control processes employed in drilling operations very, very critical.","Being the global leader in this technology means that NOV is the go-to name in the oil field to manage these challenges. Most of you are probably familiar with the industry's recent gains in reducing days required to drill wells. What this means is that the more capable higher-tech rigs we provided are manufacturing more borehole per rig day than ever before.","In fact, the super-spec land rigs in highest demand today boast a third mud pump to push more drilling fluid downhole to drill larger diameter longer laterals, all of which combine to create more borehole volume created per rig day. More footage and larger diameter boreholes drilled each rig day means more drill cuttings volume that must be separated and managed every day on every drilling rig. NOVs Wellbore Technologies segment is generally driven by footage drilled as opposed to rig count, and our solids control business is the perfect example of this.","Good solids control begins with high-tech shale shakers, vibrating devices that separate large drill cuttings by passing the drilling fluid through a filter called a shaker screen. 20 years ago, rigs had two shale shakers, each equipped with four shaker screens, usually vibrating linearly. Today we're adding a third, and in some cases a fourth, shale shaker to land rigs that vibrate elliptically with patented processes to control G-force that automatically adjust to the mass of cuttings received in real time.","Our new shakers have increased from four to six screens on each shaker, meaning we've doubled and tripled the actual number of shaker screens on each rig from eight to as many as 24. Shaker screens encapsulate a tremendous amount of technology and IP to handle higher drill cuttings volumes, but they're consumed quickly and they must be replaced nearly every week.","NOV leads in this area, offering three of the five primary high-end shale shaker products that most in the oilfield turn to for solids separation. NOV is also a leading provider of other sophisticated solids control technologies, like gas busters that separate entrained gas from the mud, and hydrocyclones and high-speed centrifuges that are used to remove microscopic high-density solids from drilling muds to improve their performance downhole.","Lately, deeper wells and longer laterals mean higher borehole and drilling fluid temperatures, sometimes exceeding 300 degrees Fahrenheit. Excess heat can damage drilling motors, rotary steerable systems and downhole electronic components. NOVs WellSite Services group helps drillers manage this by cooling drilling fluids before they're circulated back downhole to improve drilling performance and extend downhole tool life.","We developed a fully automated land mud chiller, that's essentially an on-site refrigeration system to cool drilling fluids by as much as 25%. Drill cuttings usually comprise the biggest waste stream coming from drilling a well. Frequently drill cuttings must be treated to remove residual oil mud before they can be disposed of so we pioneered several technologies to accomplish this, including using heat to cook out residual oil, which we condense and recycle.","Our thermal desorption units operate in 12 fixed facilities around the globe that process drill cuttings down to negligible levels of residual oil, making the cuttings environmentally acceptable for disposal. In many areas we apply our technology to grind and reinject these cuttings back down the wellbore.","Failure to remove drilled cuttings from drilling mud can bring a rig to its knees. We have the technologies, experience and knowledge to deal with our customers' most challenging applications. And through dozens of applications, experience on tens of thousands as well and scores of patents and unique technologies over the past two decades, we have built sustainable, competitive advantage in solids control. It's what we do.","Let me give you another example within our Completion & Production Solutions segment. The oil and gas business uses a lot of pipe, steel pipe, to case wells, to gather oil and gas, to inject CO2 and water. But steel pipes do not mix well with the corrosive oilfield fluids that pass through them, like sour oil and gas and produced water with high chlorides, CO2 and H2S. Untreated steel flowlines in certain fields may corrode through and begin to leak within a few months. Corrosion is one of the industry's biggest production challenges.","NOV's Fiber Glass Systems business, which comprises about 15% of our Completion & Production Solutions segment, provides a solution: composite pipe that is impervious to corrosion. In fact, we are the leading global manufacturing of composite pipe for the oilfield and a major provider of composite pipe for marine, offshore and chemical industrial markets.","Nearly 50 years ago, oilfield innovators begin to use fiberglass and composite pipes to handle produced water to avoid having to frequently replace corroded steel flowlines. Some of our earliest installations of fiberglass pipe are still in operations because they are so durable. Since then, NOV has continued to innovate. And as pressure and temperature ratings have risen and our size range expanded, NOV's composite piping systems have steadily won share in the oilfields' most corrosive environments.","Decades ago, NOV was the first supplier to win API Certification, and today we are the leader, having installed enough fiberglass pipe in oil and gas applications to go around the world twice. And this area continues to offer great growth prospects.","Fiberglass pipe, though more expensive than steel pipe initially, has lower installation costs because it can be assembled by hand, whereas steel pipe must be welded. And by pioneering flexible composite pipe that can be wound on a reel, our Fiberspar spoolable pipe enhanced this installation cost advantage because real pipe in 9,000-foot links can literally be plowed into the ground at a rate of many miles per day \u2013 far, far more pipe than a pipe welding crew can accomplish in the same time period.","Once in, fiberglass is a long-term solution to corrosion, whereas steel typically must be replaced or continuously treated with expensive inhibitors throughout its life. Fiberglass is also more resistant to paraffin and scale buildup that can slowly choke off steel flowlines. In addition to flowlines, NOV also manufactures fiberglass tubing and casing for production, injection and observation wells for certain fields, and a spoolable variation is used to deploy ESPs with embedded cabling in certain applications.","Our leadership position is built on technology and cost advantages. Our proprietary methods of winding pipe enable us to achieve higher pressure ratings, up to 3,500 psi, and our epoxy technologies enable us to achieve high temperature ratings exceeding 200 degrees Fahrenheit.","In addition to flowline products for gas and oil, we also manufacture piping systems for gasoline stations, for refineries and petrochemical plants, for municipal applications and for firewater and ballast saltwater systems in marine vessels.","Through our recent acquisition of Pipex, NOV entered into the composite structures market \u2013 think platforms, tanks and handrails \u2013 which enhances NOV's offerings in offshore rigs, FPSOs and other marine vessels due to the ability of composites to reduce weight and corrosion susceptibility in marine environments. For example, we recently executed a North Sea platform project where we ended up reducing the platform's weight by almost 700 metric tons.","In the mining market, we embed structurally-reinforced epoxy resin pipe with high alumina ceramic to create a product that's both durable and corrosion-proof, even in abrasive slurries like mine tailings. Our enhanced manufacturing and design technology, combined with our global presence and raw material advantages, again equal competitive advantage. Amid challenging offshore drilling conditions, NOV is pivoting to new markets and new opportunities. I offer these examples to illuminate the robust portfolio of technologies NOV will bring to the next oilfield upturn.","Last quarter, I talked about our Downhole Tools and our Process & Float Technologies businesses, and today NOV WellSite Services and Fiber Glass Systems. In these, and in all of our business units, we steadily and smartly applied capital, both organically and through M&A, to build global leading franchises that are capable of generating strong through-cycle returns. It's what we do. NOV remains exceptionally well-positioned for the inevitable upturn.","Finally, before I hand it over to Jose to review the operating results for our second quarter, I want to take a moment to convey our thanks to our terrific employees. Your performance has been amazing and I'm proud of the great job you continue to do. So, thank you.","Jose?","[064WZK-E Jose Bayardo]","Thanks, Clay. To recap our second quarter results, NOV consolidated revenues increased by $18 million from the first quarter of 2017 to $1.76 billion. Continued growth in the U.S. and stabilizing international markets were partially offset by the seasonal Canadian spring breakup and the ongoing challenges in the offshore market. As Clay mentioned, the organization executed extremely well, delivering a $37 million sequential EBITDA improvement, to $142 million.","Looking at select line items of the P&L, SG&A decreased $13 million sequentially, as we realized meaningful cost savings from ongoing efficiency improvement initiatives. Interest and financial costs increase by $1 million due to the release of unamortized debt issuance costs, a non-cash item associated with the termination of our prior credit facility. Under our new five-year credit facility, future amortization costs and unused commitment fees will actually decrease by $620,000 per quarter. So, going forward, we expect interest and financial costs to return to the $24 million to $25 million a quarter range.","Our GAAP tax rate was 15.9%. Excluding other items, the tax rate would have been 8.6%. As we have previously noted, while we operate at near-breakeven income levels, relatively small changes in income by jurisdiction or discrete items can result in significant changes in our effective tax rates. This volatility presents challenges in forecasting rates, but at this time our best estimate for the effective tax rate for the remainder of the year is 10%. Our longer-term expected tax rate remains in the 30% range.","In the second quarter, cash flow from operations was $168 million, and after deducting $43 million in capital expenditures, we netted $125 million in free cash flow. We believe our capital-light business model and strong execution will continue to drive free cash flow margins in the top quartile of the oilfield services and equipment sector.","We also invested $76 million on five technology acquisitions that were mostly focused on rounding-out our emerging directional drilling and completion tools product offerings. Our cash balance increased $51 million, to $1.53 billion, and total debt remained at $3.2 billion, with nothing outstanding on our credit facility.","During the second quarter, our Rig Systems segment generated $346 million in revenue, down $47 million or 12% sequentially. Revenue from backlog dropped to $224 million, $61 million lower than the previous quarter and $36 million below our prior guidance, as certain capital equipment deliveries slipped into the third quarter. EBITDA was within guidance at $26 million, as strong execution by our team limited decrementals to 15%.","As we downsize our Rig Systems operations, our team continues to seize every opportunity to high-grade capabilities, improve efficiencies and lower costs. A recent facility consolidation required relocating our large rig gear cutting and grinding operation. The move would've required shipping 14 very large, old machines. Instead, we purchased and installed two cutting-edge technology machines for a capital investment that was roughly equal to the cost of moving the old machines to the new facility. The new, more nimble equipment achieves the same throughput as the 14 old machines, with significantly reduced cycle times, maintenance cost and roofline requirements.","Like us, our customers are seeking ways to improve the efficiencies of their operations, and we're here to help. For example, we recently introduced a new 1,200-horsepower high-torque induction motor-powered top drive to deliver more torque and more power to drill extended lateral wells. And for all our customers who already own our market-leading TDS-11SA top drive, we developed an upgrade kit to provide them with the same high-torque capabilities. Our upgrade goes beyond replacing the top drive motors and includes important modifications to the gearbox and other components to support the 50% horsepower increase.","We are also receiving increased inquiries for other products that improve our customers' key processes, including our Stand Transfer Vehicle, which automates pipe handling operations, ensures consistent tripping speeds and eliminates the most dangerous job on the rig by removing the need for a man in the derrick. And offshore, we're seeing customers evaluate potential upgrades for future contracts, including improved lifting capacity, pipe handling systems and BOPs.","We booked $124 million in new orders in the second quarter, a slight improvement from last quarter. Land-related orders were $75 million, or 60% of the total and included one 1,500-horsepower AC Ideal Rig and the complete land equipment package that includes our NOVOS Control System as we continue supporting private North American drilling contractors' efforts to upgrade their rig fleets.","We see opportunities for continued increases in bookings, yet remain realistic on the impact lower commodity price can have on capital equipment orders. After rising approximately 15% off the bottom, gains in day rates for land rigs in North America have stalled at around $20,000 per day, leading many drillers to defer new build capital commitments. OPEC cuts also appear to have delayed anticipated rig tenders in the Middle East.","Despite a slow, grinding recovery for the land drilling market, we have averaged close to $120 million per quarter in Rig Systems orders over the past four quarters. This order rate plus our current non-backlog revenue of another $120 million per quarter implies a recent run rate of about $240 million per quarter, or close to $1 billion per year for Rig Systems, which compares to the annualized Q2 revenues of $1.4 billion.","To be clear, I'm not guiding to $1 billion in annual revenue for Rig Systems, but I am pointing out that our numbers through the last four quarters would indicate a floor at about $1 billion per year if there is no meaningful recovery in land equipment demand. We don't think this is a realistic scenario. The success of the shale revolution was built on drilling challenging wells efficiently, which, in turn, was built on better rig technologies. The have-nots around the globe are almost certainly going to up their game with modern rig technology, which only continues to get better.","As a result, we can just as easily envision a scenario in which slightly higher commodity prices and activity levels will drive future bookings that more than offset the gradually falling contributions made each quarter by our existing $2.2 billion in backlog, propelling annual revenues well beyond our current run rate.","Even though we expect modestly higher revenue in the third quarter, because of our stubbornly low book-to-bill, 55% this quarter, we are not calling a bottom in Rig Systems yet. For the third quarter, we expect margins to tick down slightly due to a lower-margin mix of projects that will be delivered in Q3.","During the second quarter, our Rig Aftermarket segment generated $341 million in revenue, an increase of $20 million or 6%. Higher volumes of spare part sales and improving absorption of our service and repair facilities drove 60% EBITDA incrementals for a $12 million increase in EBITDA to $83 million, or 24.3% of sales.","Q2 marked the second quarter in a row of increased spare parts revenues, primarily driven by increasing demand in North America. Service revenues also improved, with North American service rig utilization reaching the highest level in the past 18 months, supported by land rig reactivations and installations of our NOVOS Control System.","Lastly, repair revenues increased sharply, supported by growth in SPS-related work in Norway, Brazil and Africa. Across our Aftermarket business, we're seeing elevated interest for spares, service and repair from customers nearly everywhere, as drilling contractors look to reactivate, recertify and ensure rigs are well-positioned to compete for new contracts in today's competitive market.","As noted in the press release, we recently signed a 10-year service and support agreement with Transocean for 15 drilling rigs. The goal for both parties is to lower total cost of ownership and maximize equipment uptime by fully leveraging NOV's leading drilling technologies, global aftermarket service and repair capabilities and data-driven solutions. Our condition monitoring solutions will help reduce unnecessary maintenance, improve equipment reliability and assist our efforts to provide more in-field certifications to eliminate downtime associated with trips to port.","Historically, the industry has maintained equipment using time-based triggers and has only recently begun migrating to more usage-based triggers with the ultimate goal of achieving symptom or condition-based maintenance. At NOV, we are pioneering condition-based maintenance using a combination of sensor data and advanced proprietary algorithms to inform users about the health of equipment, allowing them to reduce unnecessary maintenance and improve reliability.","We can spot patterns that predict future conditions before they occur to identify looming performance issues, using data not to describe things as they are today, but to predict what they will be in the future to provide value-added, actionable feedback for our customers. We believe we are able to develop superior predictive algorithms by merging the power of Big Data analytics with extensive data libraries and equipment expertise that is only available to us as the original equipment manufacturer.","Our Rigsentry condition-based monitoring system is one of our solutions designed to help our customers operate and maintain their equipment more effectively. And we're building similar solutions in our other capital equipment businesses by leveraging our installed base of equipment, product experts and Big Data technologies.","While the control sensors and predictive algorithms we have today create tremendous value, ultimately we intend to combine the many solutions for discrete pieces of capital equipment into one system that will help maintain, monitor and automate entire processes, such as a complete drilling operation. Taking responsibility for the comprehensive set of equipment on our customers' rigs will provide us with the opportunity to accelerate the development of such a system.","Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect Rig Aftermarket to continue its pace of slow, steady improvement with a couple hundred basis point increase in revenue and strong incrementals. During the second quarter, our Wellbore Technologies segment generated $614 million in revenue, an increase of $59 million or 11%. Robust U.S. activity growth and modest improvements in many international markets, partially offset by the Canadian spring break up, increased customer demand for Wellbore Technologies' products and services. The segment delivered 47% incremental margins, resulting in a $28 million increase in EBITDA to $66 million or 10.7% of sales.","Robust improvements in U.S. land markets drove the segment's bigness in North America to 58% of total segment revenue and pushed revenue from land markets up to 82%. Many of our U.S. businesses and product lines grew well in excess of rig count and general activity improvements. Early in a recovery, our product-oriented business tend to lag rig count growth as customers work through oversupply levels of readily available product inventories. But as we talked about last quarter, scarcity can and has returned quickly to the oilfield.","Customers are scrambling to acquire the technologies NOV provides to help them drill farther and faster, and we're seeing demand inflect for many of our valuable differentiated technologies, with nearly 30% growth in drill bits, motors, borehole enlargement equipment, agitators and rig instrumentation.","Longer laterals demand more advanced technologies, and we continue to address our customers' primary needs through innovative solutions like our Tektonic drill bits, ION cutters and our new Series 36i downhole drilling motor. The proprietary new motor provides low-amplitude oscillations that vary weight on bit by approximately 30%. The oscillations reduce friction and stick-slip to increase rate of penetration in extended-reach drilling. During the second quarter, we signed two new drilling motor rental supply agreements with customers operating in the Permian, Anadarko and Eagle Ford Basins that total over 150 motor rentals per month.","Our Downhole Tools business is also seeing growing demand from the coil tubing market, having recently secured an order for 60 TerraMax milling systems to mill out bridge plugs on long laterals. The order totals over 260 tools, including motors, agitators, circulation subs and through-tubing connectors, making it our largest through-tubing tools order in North America since 2012.","As customers bring rigs back into service to drill increasingly complex wells, they're demanding better instrumentation and data acquisition equipment. We believe our MD Totco business has the most recognized name in the industry for top-tier instrumentation and data acquisition systems, and our customers seem to agree, as growth in this business exceeded the sequential growth in rig count.","Elsewhere, our growing Directional Drilling Tools business and our drilling optimization and automation products and services realized worldwide growth of almost 16%, led by several key product sales from our directional drilling tool product line and continued market adoption of our eVolve closed-loop drilling automation and optimization services. The growing demand for our eVolve services drove another record quarter for our IntelliServ business unit, which provides wired drill pipe and related technologies that enable our automation projects by delivering real-time, broadband downhole data to our control systems.","Our Drill-Pipe business rebounded more sharply than anticipated on improving volumes, with second quarter bookings growing another 11% above first quarter levels for a book-to-bill of approximately 120%, driven by demand for our recently introduced Delta drill-pipe connection.","Year-to-date, we've sold 500,000 feet of pipe with Delta connections. Four major operators are making substantial use of the pipe, and they have validated the connection's enhanced mechanical performance and improved total cost of ownership. The technology has performed exceptionally well on North America land and offshore operations, and we anticipate Delta connections will be used internationally for the first time by the end of the third quarter.","The improved activity in our Drill-Pipe business also helps boost our U.S. Pipe-Coating operations. For the third quarter, we expect segment revenue will increase another 8% to 10%. Increasing demand across the segment allows us to reactivate idle machinery and add second and third shifts, significantly improving absorption across many of our North American manufacturing and service facilities. While it's still early, we also see more meaningful opportunities for price improvements across the segment, giving us more confidence that we should be able to sustain strong incremental margins through the remainder of the year.","During the second quarter, our Completion & Production Solutions segment generated $652 million in revenue, a $4 million sequential increase. Improvements in land-oriented operations were mostly offset by declines in offshore businesses. EBITDA increased by $21 million to $98 million, or 15% of sales. Better-than-anticipated execution on offshore projects, FX benefits and our cost savings initiatives drove the outsized incrementals.","On the order front, nearly all of our business units secured orders well in excess of 100% book-to-bill. Total segment bookings were $501 million for an overall book-to-bill of 127%. The benefit NOV's completion offerings received from the ongoing North American market recovery is amplified by favorable secular trends that drive higher capital and service intensity. The growth in enhanced completion techniques, for example, requires more pressure pumping equipment for the increasing number of higher-volume stages, more coiled tubing equipment to mill out plugs used to separate frac zones and more wireline equipment needed to perforate each stage.","For the second quarter in a row, our Intervention and Stimulation Equipment business unit achieved a book-to-bill of approximately 140%. Included in the order book was a total of 107,500 horsepower of pressure pumping equipment and orders for seven new coiled tubing units. Beyond new capital equipment, our Intervention and Stimulation Equipment business unit continues to see growing demand in North America for refurbs and spare parts, including valves, seats and flow iron, as increasing pressures and higher rates of abrasive proppants pumped downhole cause increased wear on even the most reliable equipment and consumables.","On the production side, our Process and Flow Technologies business unit achieved a book-to-bill above 1 based on rising demand for production chokes, LACT units, wellhead separators and other processing equipment. Additionally, efficiency improvements resulting from the integration of our Fjords transaction contributed to 85% incremental margins on a modest revenue increase.","Our Fiber Glass Systems business unit continues to realize solid bookings and revenue growth supported by spoolable pipe demand in the Middle East and U.S., partially offset by declining demand for the more offshore-oriented Southeast Asian market.","As anticipated, we saw an aggregate net sequential decline in revenue from our three offshore production-related businesses, which include our subsea flexible pipe, large-diameter conductor pipe connections and floating production systems business units. However, all three operations achieved better than anticipated profitability on exceptional execution, cost savings and foreign exchange benefits. All three business units also booked orders well in excess of 100% book-to-bill.","We received an order for a subsea soft yoke system for a floating storage regasification unit in Brazil, our first significant order for our Floating Production Systems business unit in 18 months. Our XL Systems business unit also won a multimillion-dollar order for our fatigue-resistant Viper conductor casing, which is ideally suited for extreme service conductor and casing applications in deepwater operations.","Notwithstanding the quarter's strong bookings, the near-term outlook for our offshore-levered businesses remains challenged. While our recent offshore orders helped partially replenish depleted backlogs, many are for long lead-time items with deliveries that extend into 2018, limiting their impact on near-term revenues. As a result, we expect our offshore production-oriented businesses to take another step down in the third quarter.","On land, strong activity levels and pent-up demand following two years of limited investment in capital equipment support the remaining business units within our CAP segment. However, the recent dip in commodity prices to the low $40 level noticeably reduced customers' sense of urgency related to large capital equipment orders, creating uncertainty for the pace of future order intake. In the third quarter, we anticipate a 300 basis points to 500 basis point improvement in revenue, with margins declining between 100 basis points to 200 basis points due to less favorable mix and FX benefits that we do not expect to repeat.","For NOV, the second quarter was about exceptional execution and realizing efficiency improvements from investments we've made in our operations over the past few years. While oil prices continue to linger under $50 per barrel, causing a wary mindset among our customers, we remain extremely encouraged by the ongoing depletion of excess equipment in all markets around the world, pent-up demand for more efficient modern equipment in international markets and the way our people have positioned this organization for the future.","With that, we'll open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Jose. Ladies and gentlemen, we are now open for questions. Our first question is from Marshall Adkins of Raymond James. Your line is open.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Clay, as tempted as I am to ask about your proprietary elliptical shale shaker G-force control technology...","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Feel free.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","...I think just to keep my sanity here and knowing I wouldn't understand half of it, I'm going to focus on your Completions & Production segment. Phenomenal margins there. Jose, you briefly went through kind of how you got there. But I'd like to get a little more color on what's going on there. It sounds like your growth in the U.S. Completions is offsetting the declines in offshore Production.","But more specifically, I'd like to know where are there shortages in the U.S. Completion side? What product lines we've heard about, niche product lines, where you're just out of different stuff? Can you help us understand the landscape on the U.S. Completions side?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","You bet. The portion of the Completions & Production Solutions business that's seen the highest levels of activity really is centered on the pressure pumping equipment space right now. So a lot of demand for frac equipment, for coiled tubing, for all of the consumables that go along with that, so valves and seats and so forth. And you've heard from I think a number of pressure pumpers so far through this reporting cycle of all of the reactivations that are underway there. So we're seeing repair services and the like, really strong levels of demand.","We went through our fiberglass flowline and pipe offering there. We're also seeing really strong demand in that area as well, along with strong demand for production equipment in our Process & Flow Technologies group, things like production chokes and other items that we sell there, both across North America as well as places like the Middle East.","But, yes, our offshore offering that makes up the rest of our Completions & Production Solutions group has been under pressure with low levels of FIDs and so forth. And so that's where we're really seeing the most pressure. I'm very pleased with the pickup in margins this quarter. And, as Jose mentioned in his prepared remarks, a lot of it had to do with exceptional execution on certain offshore projects within that group.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Are we out of certain things on the U.S. side? Are there exceptionally long lead times for products right now?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yeah, like I said, we are pretty busy on the pressure pumping equipment. But I would say we're able to deliver new frac equipment, for instance, in a quarter and a half, maybe two quarters. So we're able to get components so far to go into the fabrication of that equipment.","What I'd tell you is that in terms of the scarcity that we refer to, really we're seeing that most acutely, though, actually Wellbore Technologies group, and specifically around Downhole Tools and bits, downhole drilling motors, drill bits. The equipment that we supply there is seeing a high level of demand. Rig Instrumentation Systems, our MD Totco unit that Jose referenced, the Solids Control business that I talked about in my prepared remarks. Again, we're seeing a lot of customers burning through existing inventories.","The good thing for us is that over 900 rigs running in North America \u2013 or in the U.S. right now are consuming a lot of that at a much higher rate than the 350 or so that we bottomed out at last year. And so the rate of consumption has stepped up and that means they have less opportunities to cannibalize inventories and consumables of off idled rigs and have burned through inventories. And so we're starting to see a resumption of demand.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. That's helpful color. Thank you, all.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","You bet. Thanks, Marshall.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Herbert, Simmons & Company. Your line is open.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company","Thank you. Good morning. Clay, just trying to reconcile your comments with regard to frac and Jose's earlier comments with regard to the downward flurry in oil prices diminishing the sense of urgency with regard to capital equipment items. Are you making the distinction between large horsepower orders, for example, that you got in Q4 and Q1, 75, 75, and 107.5, something like that, in Q2, versus consumables?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yeah. Yeah, what I'd say is although we continue to have conversations with a number of customers around new frac spread additions, and I would add new land drilling rigs, the urgency is a bit diminished over the past six weeks, eight weeks with lower oil prices. They're still going on, so we're still having these conversations. We're probably talking to a half a dozen different pressure pumpers, for instance, around new frac spread additions, but the urgency has slowed down a bit.","In contrast, on the smaller quicker-turn items, the consumables, the repair services, the reactivation-related things that we're doing within the pressure pumping space and the rig upgrade and repair services that we're offering in the land drilling space, those continue to be really, really strong.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company","Okay. Great.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Does that makes sense?","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company","Yeah. Yeah, it sure does. Thanks. And then with regard to Wellbore, you guys have been extolling the scarcity theme for a while. And Jose went through a long list of items that generated over 30% sequential growth in the quarter. I'm curious as to whether, one, in the event that activity flattens out here, although oil prices seem to be moving higher, but in the event activity flattens out, how much runway do you have for continued lead lag outperformance on the Wellbore consumables? And then moreover, can you talk about drill-pipe as well, please?","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Hey, Bill. It's Jose. Yeah, it's a good question. And one of the things I was trying to get to in some of my prepared remarks is to help folks understand that there is a bit of lead time and backlog that gets built into even the quick-turn portions of our business. So that's kind of what I was getting at.","Related to the business taking a little while to ramp up as that excess capacity in the market gets absorbed, but then things snapped back pretty quickly. And our ability to turn serviceable items as well as provide new product, the time period in which we do that has extended quite a bit. And so even with a flattening to potentially a slight downturn in the rig count environment, we expect a good period of time in which we could actually continue to see revenues for those types of products and services continue up and to the right.","And also, as we've talked about before, with improving efficiencies, more footage drilled per day, that also is a great driver for us. Probably the last thing I'll mention on that as well is, for our business, it doesn't necessarily take a dramatic pick-up in activity for our business to get better. We saw some glimmers of hope in the international markets. As two-and-a-half plus years of this downturn have gone on, the stuff that we've had out in the marketplace is slowly getting consumed. Those inventories are diminished and depleted and folks have to step back to the table and start ordering more of our products, even at very low activity rates. So we're seeing some positive signs that give us some optimism in some sustainability of those businesses even in a flattening rig count environment.","Specific to drill-pipe, we were pretty pleased with the rebound that we saw this quarter in demand for the pipe. We expected last quarter coming into the second quarter that we would slowly start rebuilding a pretty depleted backlog. I think our bookings were better than we anticipated as were volumes through the system and, quite frankly, the performance of our team in terms of not only just getting things through the system but basically creating a lot of operating leverage on that increased volume.","So all-in, pretty pleased with the way things shook out.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yeah, two quarters in a row of book-to-bill north of 1 for drill pipe. The other thing I would add, too, is that we store a fair amount of our customers' inventory. We've seen that tick down about 15% to 20% of the past six months, nine months. So things are going the right way there.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company","Very good. Thanks, guys.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning, guys.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Jim.","James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","We had discussed in previous quarters that Rig Systems may have bottomed as long as there aren't delays in commissioning and launching new deepwater rigs. And this quarter, there seem to be some delays. Can you talk about how is this one off? Is it systematic? It would appear that the oil price weakness of the last couple of months has probably put deepwater back another year. Can you talk about the outlook for the rig commissionings and getting those done so we can finally see Rig Systems bottom sometime in the near future?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yeah, I think things are stabilizing there, Jim. To be clear, we haven't called bottom on Rig Systems, nor did we do that this quarter. We did call for a slight uptick in revenue on our guidance going into Q3.","But when it comes to our offshore construction projects, offshore rig construction projects, we did have a couple things move to the right again. But I would say so far so good. It feels like things are more stable than they were, let's say, this time last year and we're kind of achieving more of something maybe closer to kind of a smoother or more stable level of work on Rig Systems.","What's I think most encouraging to me about the outlook for Rig really is our land offering. We saw our land Rig orders rise to 60% of total orders in the quarter. And so although we're still struggling with a book-to-bill significantly below 1, we do think a recovery and demand for land rigs is out there. We've got conversations going on with operators in North America, with operators elsewhere around the globe. They're all looking at Midland, Texas, seeing the extraordinary drilling gains that are happening with super-spec rigs out there. And so I think that will be the engine that fuels future demand for Rig Systems.","James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And, Marshall's question, talking about what's in short supply and we've heard the perforating guns and you mentioned your downhole motors. But it seems to me, and talk about shortage of people and everybody thinks about field people, but we're hearing that machinists in Houston are exceptionally hard to find. Somebody who can operate a CNC machine. And that would seem to be your strength and bailiwick. And I'm just wondering if there is a shortage of people in that category, one we don't pay attention to all the time, and the implications of it.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yeah, don't think it's an acute shortage. We're fortunate in that we have, as you know, lots of different manufacturing businesses. And as we've talked about some of those businesses are trending up and some are trending up sharply now and others going down. So we have the opportunity to redeploy resources towards our businesses that are growing. So I think NOV's probably unique in our footprint and scope within manufacturing, which gives us more flexibility to navigate labor shortages that arise from time to time in our space.","James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Guys, thank you very much.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Thank you.","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Thanks, Jim.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from James West of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","James West - Evercore Group LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Good morning, James.","James West - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks for the detail in the prepared comments. I'm very glad Lydia just sent the comments out to everybody so I could read them about five times to figure out everything you said. You guys were talking very fast there.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","We're prepared to answer questions on high G-force elliptical shakers, by the way.","James West - Evercore Group LLC","Perfect. So my first question on elliptical shakers. Clay, what you said about inventories on offshore rigs caught my attention because we're not nearly as negative as I think as most people are on the offshore markets. I know you guys aren't calling bottom on rig tech orders and things like that. But it seems to me we've seen a large number or at least a better number of FIDs for big offshore projects so far this year.","We've seen actually a rig that was smart stacked is going to go back to work, so we're actually seeing some rigs that have been laid up. And have these rig companies, in your opinion, because most of these guys haven't spent money in years I mean on anything, and they've cannibalized assets and that's hurt your Aftermarket business. Have they gone too far? And do you see just outside of just a pickup and a little bit of pickup and demand here for the rigs driving some Aftermarket, do you see some restocking that needs to go on?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Absolutely. And, by the way, offshore hadn't gone to zero, right? So in the second quarter we just reported, 40% of our orders were related to the offshore. We're seeing customers upgrade certain rigs around lifting capacity, around pipe handling and racking capacity and capabilities, and that's helpful. Obviously, the oil and gas companies have the leverage in this kind of market, and so they're becoming a little more vocal in pushing some of those drillers to upgrade rigs before, for instance, they'll roll over contracts. And so that's constructive.","But, you're right, James, both categories, jack-ups and floaters, both categories of rigs have seen a very small recent uptick in activity. We're hearing from our customers more conversations that they're having with their customers around tenders and the like. And, frankly, with all the costs we've taken out of our business, relatively small improvements in activity I think are going to drive really outsized performance in rigs.","So, I want to be clear, we're not calling for a sharp increase in offshore activity and we remain very, very cautious in this space given all that's going on. But as you correctly point out, yeah, there's a few green shoots out there that are interesting.","James West - Evercore Group LLC","Sure. Okay. Great. That's what I expected. And I do want to ask about your shaker business, your Solids Control business. I'm probably not going to get too technical here, but as I think about it, we're adding additional mud pumps to onshore rigs, which is, obviously, necessary for the additional loads of mud going into the wells, which then, of course, hits the shakers as the mud comes out. And that's causing more damage, more needs for shakers and screens, et cetera. To me, is that a linear type of demand driver? Or does that actually go exponential with just the higher pressures and then the size of the wells?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Well, the size of the wells go up by 2 Pi, right?","James West - Evercore Group LLC","Right.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","So, for every foot of well, you're creating 2 Pi r more circumference and more volume of cuttings that you're drilling up. And so it presents a challenge on the rig, which is driving demand for a third and sometimes a fourth shale shaker. So there's a lot of implications coming out of the way wells are drilled now with longer laterals and larger diameter and more hydraulics on location. And one of them is around the management of drill cuttings that come out of those wells. And so really the purpose of all that was to highlight NOV's exposure to that trend of technologies we bring to that space.","James West - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks, Clay. Thanks, Jose.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","You bet. Thanks, James.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jud Bailey of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Hi, Jud.","Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","A lot of good discussion today over Wellbore, and you guys have given a lot of helpful detail in terms of directionally how some of the product lines are moving. I was wondering if it'd be possible to maybe help us think about the sizing of some of these different businesses. Things have moved so much in the last couple of years. You highlighted Solids Control. I think you said about a fifth of Wellbore revenue. Would it be possible to get some other kind of sizing for some of the other business lines within Wellbore as we \u2013 kind of what they were in the second quarter?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yeah, I tell you what, we're going to probably continue on what we've been doing in the last two calls, which is to highlight a couple of really interesting businesses, one in each of our Wellbore Technologies and Completions & Production Solutions groups, largely because I think a lot of investors out there, they're very familiar with Rig Systems and Rig Aftermarket, but less familiar with Wellbore Technologies and CAPS. And so as we kind of tick through those, we'll provide a little more mix information.","The other thing, too, Jud, I would stress is that mix between these product lines and mix across these segments changes period-to-period as well. So I think we prefer to do it that way.","Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, that's fair. Just thought I'd ask. Just transitioning over to Rig Systems. Jose, if I could follow up on your commentary regarding I guess $1 billion in revenue for Rig Systems. I know you said and stressed that wasn't guidance, but I just want to understand a little bit better the context of how you're thinking about the scenario in which that would be an outcome, I guess. Is it just nothing else from offshore-related activity and just what you're seeing on the land side these days? I just want to understand that a little bit better.","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Right. Really, effectively what we're getting at is what's pretty close to the darkest view imaginable on our part, which is, look, we're right at a point in the cycle where demand remains very, very low, although interest is picking up, conversations are picking up and our bookings have increased slightly, but we're still at very low and, in our view, unsustainably low levels of demand right at the moment.","And so really what we wanted to provide is just some really, really simple math to say that, in the current environment, if we stay here forever, that Rig Systems is effectively a $1 billion a year business. So that's basically the roughly $120 million to $125 million a quarter that we've been booking here over the last couple of quarters, plus our own internal demand, plus the other little bit of revenue that doesn't really pass through to backlog, which is a pretty small amount. So that basically gets you to about $1 billion a year.","But as I stressed and continue to stress a very deep dark scenario. Obviously, folks have to come back, maintain the rigs that are operating. Just by doing that we think there's more opportunities for capital sales growth. And also we do see a good number of new build opportunities that are not too far out on the horizon. So we're much more optimistic about the future than that dire scenario.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yeah, this is probably the most common question we've been getting for two-plus years from investors is where does Rig Systems bottom and what does it look like. And it's worth noting that that analysis is based on looking back over the preceding four quarters, which includes the lowest rig count scene in the United States in 70 years. So it's a pretty bleak market. But there's sort of, we think, a floor that's in those numbers. We just wanted to \u2013 again, we don't think we'll fall to that level, but that would be a worst-case scenario.","Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. I may be pushing my luck here, but if you were to actually, say, generate $1 billion in revenue, would you venture a guess as to what the margin level could be if it was that kind of level?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","I would tell you that look back at where that business was in 2014 and see how far it's fallen and see the fact that it did 7.5% EBITDA margins this past quarter. And that team is remarkably talented when it comes to squeezing profitability out of a smaller revenue base. So I certainly would not bet against them. They will get as much profit out of that whatever revenue base we have in Rig as any management team on the planet.","Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you. I'll turn it back.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Thomas Curran of FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Thomas Patrick Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Thanks for squeezing me in, guys.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Hi, Tom.","Thomas Patrick Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","So for Rig Systems, shifting from such a bleak potential take on it to a possible bright spot, in the U.S. land drilling rig market, as the secular two-one rig construction boom matures and your predictive analytics capabilities advance, are you considering or already pursuing any commercial models on the Aftermarket side to further entrench yourself with customers? Is there an opportunity for the type of long-term service and support agreement you just inked with Transocean or some other form of total cost of ownership approach?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yeah, I absolutely think there is. Maybe a little trickier for our onshore customers. They tend to be a little scrappier and a little more comfortable doing their own maintenance and things. But I think as we continue to pioneer predictive analytics, which we are very successful at. We're on 17 offshore rigs today and have 20 or so instances of where we've warned customers in advance of issues they needed to take care of when it was opportune. So, I mean, this is really a powerful technology.","That coupled with things that we're doing in closed-loop automated drilling using machine learning algorithms to better drill, I'm actually very, very excited about really upping our offering into the land space and getting closer with our customers there and doing more to help them manage their fleets.","To me, it just makes a lot of sense. I think drilling, being a contract driller, requires being great at managing logistics and drilling operations and talented workforces that can focus on drilling efficiently on behalf of their customers. Whereas as an OEM, I think NOV is very well-positioned to help them manage their fleets and maintain their fleets and so forth. So, yeah, I'm pretty excited about that actually.","Thomas Patrick Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","And, Clay, remind us, do you currently manufacture and sell Walking Systems as a stand-alone branded product line? And, if not, is that in offering you'd like to expand into at some point?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yeah, we offer Walking Systems. In fact, we're seeing decent levels of demand for that, I would say Walking Systems plus a third mud pump plus a fourth generator set plus a high-torque package. Jose reference the ability to upgrade top drives. That really transforms a Tier 1 AC rig to one of these super-spec rigs that are winning a 15% and in some instances 20% premium on day rates. So, yes, we do.","Thomas Patrick Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. And then last one for me. You know, shifting to the frac spread manufacturing and capital equipment market. Following Forum's acquisition of J-Mac, and now Kirby's pending merger with Stewart & Stevenson, would you expect further consolidation in that arena? And how do you think about how the WISE Group and Rolligon are positioned? Is there anything else you might want to add in response to what those competitors have done?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","We have a great offering there we're very pleased with. I think our more recent focus has been around enhancing the technology embedded in what we do. And actually, I'm glad you asked the question, Tom, because just last quarter we introduced a condition-based monitoring system the frac spreads. And, in fact, one of our North American customers put that in place for their customer. And their customer, which is a large independent, monitored frac jobs over the course of a couple months, and was very pleased. They monitored those remotely and was very pleased with the reduction in instances of stuck pipe and things like that. So our focus really continues to be around a differentiated offering, a high-tech offering that earns good returns on capital deployed there.","Thomas Patrick Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","All right. Thanks for the answers, Clay.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Thanks, Tom.","Operator","I think that...","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Sorry, Vince. Go ahead.","Operator","I'm just handing it back to Mr. Williams for closing remarks.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Great. Thanks very much.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. ","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference Mr. Blake McCarthy, Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Blake McCarthy","Thank you. Welcome everyone to National Oilwell Varco's third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With me today are Clay Williams, our Chairman, President, and CEO and Jose Bayardo, our Senior Vice President and CFO.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of today's comments are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws. They involve risks and uncertainty and actual results may differ materially. No one should assume these forward-looking statements remain valid later in the quarter or later in the year. For more detailed discussion of the major risk factors affecting our business, please refer to the latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Our comments also include non-GAAP measures, reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measures are in our earnings release available on our website. On a U.S. GAAP basis for the third quarter of 2019, NOV reported revenues of $2.13 billion and a net loss of $244 million or $0.64 per share.","Our use of the term EBITDA throughout this morning's call corresponds to the term, adjusted EBITDA, as defined in our earnings release. Later in the call we will host a question-and-answer session. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up to permit more participation.","Now, let me turn the call over to Clay.","Clay Williams","Thank you, Blake. In the third quarter of 2019, NOV generated EBITDA of $262 million, up $67 sequentially despite a modest revenue decline from our second quarter. Our third quarter benefited from credits related to the close out of the handful of projects in our Completion & Production Solutions and Rig Technologies segments, which contributed nearly $20 million to our improvement.","The more important driver behind our improving profitability was our cost savings which added over $20 million in EBITDA sequentially. The balance of the sequential improvement related to favorable product mix shifts for instance rising revenues in our Rig Technologies aftermarket. NOV made excellent progress on restructuring to drive efficiency and in a moment Jose will update you in more detail on our revised cost savings targets.","Additionally, we are pleased with the progress on improving cash flow. Cash flow from operations was $352 million in the third quarter, reflecting improving working capital intensity arising from the organization's heightened focus on receivables, inventory, and payables.","Despite the challenging market backdrop, NOV's team performed well and I am proud of everybody's hard work. Our third quarter international revenues grew 3% sequentially fully offset by 5% sequential declines in North America. The U.S. land rig count is now down more than 20% from its recent high in late 2018. And while this will eventually result in decelerating U.S. production growth, it is currently pressuring our domestic customer base and consequently our short-cycle U.S. business lines.","On the other hand, international and offshore activity continues to grow at a modest pace both the IOCs and NOCs have used the prolonged down-cycle to pull cost out of their planned projects and FID approvals appear to be increasing. International and offshore growth helped NOV post an overall book-to-bill ratio north of one in the third quarter.","As cross currents and deep cyclicality continue to affect the global oil and gas business, NOV continues to benefit from; one, its broad geographic and product diversity, a key strength of our business model. Two, its market leadership which provides numerous scale advantages; and three, it's enormous installed base of equipment.","These business model attributes lend NOV the necessary durability to navigate the extreme volatility experienced in oil and gas and are, in my opinion, important to understand with regards to the investment case for NOV at a time when oil and gas is deeply out of favor.","I believe there is no single greater determinant of long-term returns than a company's strategic positioning and NOV's is unique among oilfield ecosystem participants. Our diversity along several dimensions is a great example. We make a broad array of oilfield tools and equipment and consumables which we sell to more than 8,000 discrete customers.","Some energy services companies, some producers, and even some in unrelated industrial enterprises. We operate in exploration development and production phases in both land and offshore markets across 65 countries. Although almost all are affected by oil and gas commodity prices, which are cyclical rarely do all the subsectors move exactly in lockstep. So as North American cycles down, we can pivot and redeploy assets to areas like the offshore and international markets that are exhibiting growth. Q3 is a good example.","Our business has low capital intensity. NOV's manufacturing assets are generally not specialized even though they are used to make specialized equipment. Machine tools, assembly plants and rig up yards can be repurposed to areas of highest demand. They are also relatively small capital investments as compared to the revenues that they can generate.","Our ongoing maintenance capital investment needs are far lower than most oilfield participants as measured by CapEx as a percentage of revenue. Over the trailing 12 months for example, our CapEx is only been 2.8% of sales. Lower capital expenditure requirements equate to higher free cash flows and represent another attractive and differentiating attribute of NOV versus other in the oilfield.","We focus on market leadership. Our size and scale provide us clear advantages in procurement, manufacturing, logistics and distribution. We have built the largest installed base of equipment globally within most of the equipment categories we supply, something that would take many years for our competitors to replicate. This provides NOV the opportunity as OEM to sell spare parts and maintenance services to the owners of this equipment even during downturns.","As a result, our Rig Technology segment saw higher margin aftermarket revenue growth to 57% of its mix in the third quarter. Our installed base also provides proprietary opportunities to develop and sell digital enhancements to the owners of our equipment like Cerberus and NOVOS operating systems, software optimization tools, condition based maintenance programs and predictive analytics. These are all digital enhancements we've capitalized on through the downturn made possible by our enormous installed base.","Market leadership positions NOV best to help our customers achieve standardization, which helps them drive better service, training and procedural consistency across their own operations. All of this improves efficiency which in turn drives greater financial performance and capital returns for our customers.","Standardizing on technology from the market leader with global support capabilities and strong financial resources is the logical choice for an entrepreneur in the oilfield seeking to profitably grow his or her business. Many in our senior leadership team started our careers in the brutal 1980s and 1990s, another generational downturn in the oilfield.","We know that diversity and strategic positioning are critical to successfully navigating a tough downcycle, but so is executing well on cost savings initiatives and effectively managing working capital to maximize cash flow. In the third quarter NOV benefited from all of the above.","Pulling oil and gas out of the ground remains one of the most capital-intensive activities in the world, one that consumes equipment steadily and one that will continue to be required for decades to come as a key part of the mix of supplying rising global demand for energy. Eventually there will emerge an need for sustained reinvestment and retooling across oil and gas value chain. That said in the near-term, we are focused on the things that are directly within our control in this market costs and working capital.","Our capital allocation continues to focus on strategic positioning and returns. We are using the current period to review our portfolio of businesses to ensure that we are engaged in activities where we have a clear and demonstrable competitive advantage or where we see a low risk capital efficient opportunity to develop a new business that demonstrates competitive advantage and can be expected to generate solid financial returns within a reasonable timeframe.","Some of our products won't make the cut and will be divested to free up capital. With respect to capital deployment, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet to preserve our investment grade credit rating and ample liquidity.","After our CapEx needs we will continue to execute smaller M&A transactions, which enhance our business positioning and competitive mode and which can typically be further enhanced by organic investment in technology and product development and integrated into NOV's global network. Overall, despite a very tough five year downturn NOV has materially improved its positioning and its prospects and I remain optimistic about our long run success.","Finally to our employees listening your hard work, perseverance and professionalism during these rough times humbles me. You are truly what differentiates NOV and I consider myself fortunate to be a part of your team. Thank you.","With that I'll turn it over to Jose.","Jose Bayardo","Thank you, Clay. NOV's consolidated revenues were essentially flat sequentially as the continued momentum in our international and offshore operations was offset by deteriorating conditions in the North American market or revenue decreased 5%. Revenues from offshore markets improved 7% sequentially bringing the percentage of our consolidated revenue from offshore markets to more than 40% for the first time, since the first quarter of 2017.","Improving conditions in the offshore and international markets also helped us achieve our third quarter in a row, with a companywide book-to-bill of over 100%. EBITDA increased $67 million, sequentially to $262 million, reflecting great progress on our restructuring efforts a more favorable business mix and some favorable project completion variances.","As noted, we made great progress on realizing incremental cost savings, which totaled roughly $80 million on an annual basis. To date, we are realizing greater savings and initially anticipated on certain of our restructuring initiatives and we are continuing to find additional opportunities that will help make the organization more efficient. We now believe we will realize a total of approximately $200 million in annualized cost savings from our restructuring efforts by the end of 2020.","For the fourth quarter, we expect to realize an incremental $40 million of annualized cost savings. During the third quarter, we also made great strides in our efforts to reduce the capital intensity of our operations by reducing our working capital and improving our cash flow. We generated $352 million in cash flow from operations and after deducting $69 million in capital expenditures, we netted $283 million of free cash flow.","During the third quarter, we also collected a $65 million note receivable related to a divestiture we completed a few years ago. Even though the $65 million was on our balance sheet as a current asset, and therefore part of working capital it flowed through the cash flow from investing activities on our cash flow statement. If you included the $65 million in our free cash flow number, it would total $348 million.","No, matter how you look at it we're well on our way to achieving our target of between $300 million and $500 million of free cash flow in the second half of 2019. Couple of quick housekeeping items, before we jump into our segment results, SG&A declined $124 million during the quarter returning to a more normalized level relative to the second quarter. Additionally, during the third quarter our intercompany eliminations fell to a lower-than-normal level due to the timing of projects.","In the fourth quarter, we expect eliminations and corporate cost to return to levels in line with what we saw during the second quarter.","Turning to our results of operations, our Wellbore Technologies segment generated $793 million in revenue in the third quarter, a decrease of $57 million or 7% sequentially. Excluding results from our drill pipe manufacturing business, which tends to behave more like a capital equipment business, revenue in North America declined 7% in line with the fall off in drilling activity","EBITDA for the segment was down only $1 million sequentially as cost savings initiatives helps limit detrimental margins to approximately 2% a testament to the effort of our team to flex the size of our operations with the change in market conditions. Our ReedHycalog drill bit business posted a slight revenue decline due to weaker domestic activity, partially offset by growth in international markets","A contracting North American market is causing fierce pricing competition among our competitors, but our ability to deliver superior value to our customers through technology leadership has to date helped insulate more business from the pricing pressures without exceeding market share.","Our M\/D Totco business unit experienced a mid-single digit drop in revenue due to the same North American headwinds affecting the rest of our business. While M\/D Totco is certainly not immune to the headwinds of the current market environment, we expect our list of closed loop automated drilling and surface optimization projects in North America, the Middle East and offshore Europe will continue to grow as operators around the world look to our digital solutions to improve their ability to generate returns.","Revenues in our Downhole business unit also declined due to lower motor agitator and fishing tool sales in the U.S. International revenues were mostly flat and we are seeing rising demand for our agitators and other drilling tools in the Middle East in Europe. Part of this growing demand is coming from service companies seeking to drive additional efficiencies in their drilling operations as they execute on lump sum turnkey contracts.","We're also seeing more customers leverage our agitator technologies to improve efficiencies and completion operations. Our TerraPULSE coiled tubing agitator system is enabling customers to meaningfully reduce the time and cost to complete the long lateral multi-stage drill out operations.","Our Tuboscope business posted results that were roughly flat for both revenue and EBITDA as the fall off in North American operations was offset by growth in international markets. The decline in Tuboscope U.S. coating revenue was compounded by downtime associated with planned equipment upgrades as well as lost days in our Houston area plant which resulted from Tropical Storm Imelda.","Strong demand for coating services and an increase in deliveries of our Thru-Kote sleeves to the Middle East more than offset the fall off in North America. Additionally, the decrease in drilling activity in the U.S. hurt demand from steel mills and pipe processors, resulting in a slight decline in revenue from our inspection service operations.","Our WellSite Services business unit experienced a high single-digit drop in revenue. Like the other business units in this segment, U.S. operations were impacted by slowing activity levels, which will continue to be a near-term challenge.","But we did begin start-up operations for projects in the Gulf of Mexico, which tend to drive higher revenue and profitability due to the sophisticated technology employed in offshore operations.","We're also excited about a series of additional offshore projects scheduled in 2020, for which the team is currently preparing. Our Grant Prideco drill pipe business recorded, a double-digit percent decrease in revenue, as demand from new pipe has fallen sharply in North America, as a result in the fall of rig count.","The decline in revenue from North America was only partially offset by increasing demand from international and offshore markets. While orders have been solid, international orders typically take more time to convert from bookings into revenue.","However, for the first time and quite a while, Grant Prideco's top line is more than 50% offshore. And while the business units revenue declined in Q3 bookings actually improved 30%, as international and offshore orders continue to flow in, at a welcome pace.","In the fourth quarter of 2019, we expect continued capital restraint across North American E&P complex, combined with the holiday season to result in further declines in U.S. activity, while our international and offshore markets are expected to continue their measured recovery.","We therefore expect revenue for our Wellbore Technologies segment to decline 5% to 7% with continued focus on cost savings, limiting our detrimental margins to approximately 25%.","Our Completion & Production Solutions segment generated $728 million in revenue in the third quarter, an increase of $65 million or 10% sequentially. Higher revenues, cost savings and favorable adjustments associated with the completion of certain projects, drove 46% incremental margins, resulting in a $30 million increase in EBITDA to $82 million or 11.3% of sales.","Order intake remained healthy, and we captured $535 million in bookings during the third quarter. Orders exceeded shipments by 24%, providing us with our fourth quarter row of a book-to-bill in excess of 100% for this segment.","Backlog at quarter end totaled $1.3 billion. Sharp improvement realized by this segment over the past two quarters, is a further testament to the diversity of our operations.","We've been able to more than offset the rapid deterioration in demand from completion service providers in the U.S. by capitalizing on improving fundamentals in the international and offshore markets, which allowed us to drive sequential revenue improvements in all, but one of our business units within the segment.","Our intervention and stimulation equipment business, experienced a 7% sequential decline in revenue, resulting from the sharp fall off in U.S. completions activities, that is once again causing customers to delay acceptance of equipment, ready for pickup and other customers to request deferrals on more recently placed orders.","Despite the sequential deterioration in performance, the business service is a great example of how our leadership, breadth and scale, enhance our ability to navigate through difficult market conditions. And give us the flexibility to pivot where opportunities exist.","While the need for new pressure pumping spreads has been virtually non-existent for the past year. And more recently we've experienced a sharp decline in orders for new coiled tubing equipment, in the U.S., demand from international markets remains robust.","In Q3, we booked orders for nine coiled tubing units, 24 nitrogen units, and a significant amount of other support equipment, from a wide range of customers that will deploy the assets in numerous international markets.","We also saw an increase in international orders for wireline and flow line, including a sizable order for our Anson 20,000, PSI-rated flow line, that's destined for China. And despite generally weak demand for pressure pumping equipment and aftermarket support, we were still able to book a few orders for blenders control systems and support pumps.","Our unparalleled global footprint, service infrastructure, technology, quality and customer base, can even create a safety valve for at least some optionality for our customers that can't be obtained from other vendors.","One of our loyal U.S. coiled tubing customers, we've seen rapidly deteriorating demand and it was able to sell their order slot. And associated deposit to an international service company that still sees unmet pent up need for more modern equipment in the markets they serve.","We believe no other vendor in the space has more customers that standardized on their equipment and has an install base as large as NOV. Our market position global footprint service infrastructure technology and quality make us uniquely positioned to help our customers in ways that others cannot.","While this type of transaction could temporarily cannibalize our near term opportunity set, it ultimately creates a healthier market over the long-term term and did not prevent us from realizing a respectable 92% book-to-bill order intake for our intervention and stimulation equipment business in the third quarter.","Revenue for our Process and Flow Technologies business unit was roughly flat, as growing contributions from the execution on projects to build offshore production equipment booked over the past several quarters were mostly offset by a deteriorating North American market that is dampening demand for production chokes and pumps. EBITDA margins improved on a better mix, cost savings and favorable adjustment on a legacy project closeout.","Near term, we expect growth from our Process and Flow Technologies international and offshore operations to more than offset the challenges associated with North American production and midstream markets that continue to contract in response to tightening E&P CapEx budget.","Tendering activity for APL and wellstream processing operations remained strong particularly for large-scale offshore gas development projects which supported the second sizable award for a submerged turret production system in as many quarters and allow the unit to post its third quarter in a row with a book to bill more than 100%.","Our Fiber Glass business unit posted another strong quarter of growth. Steady improvement in our core composite tubular offerings was supplemented by the first shipments from our new manufacturing plant in Dammam Saudi Arabia, an acquisition that was completed during the second week of July and rapid growth in demand from shipping companies for marine scrubber system components as they scramble to retrofit vessels to comply with IMO 2020 requirements.","Excluding additions from the acquisition orders for our fiber glass business unit improved 34%. Lastly in our subsea flexible pipe business bookings were light, despite the continuation of a steadily growing opportunity set that allowed us to realize 3 straight quarters of improved bookings prior to Q3 and led to 22% sequential revenue growth.","Looking at the fourth quarter, we expect improved international and offshore directed activity to offset the impact from rapidly deteriorating market conditions in the U.S. completions market, resulting in fourth quarter revenues that are flat with Q3.","We also expect Q4 EBITDA to remain in line with third quarter results for our Completion & Production Solutions segment as cost savings realized should make up for the falloff in favorable project closeout settlements.","Our Rig Technologies segment generated $649 million in revenue in the third quarter, a decrease of $22 million or 3% sequentially. Aftermarket revenues which improved 5% were more than offset by an 11% decrease in revenues from capital equipment sales.","Growing contributions from our naval design jacking system and pipelay tensioner offerings from our marine construction operations were more than offset by a fall-off in drilling equipment project revenues associated with the completion of several projects in late Q2 and early Q3.","While revenue declined we realized a much more favorable shift in our product mix and when combined with project closeout variances and strong progress on our cost savings initiatives, we realized a $31 million improvement in EBITDA to $105 million or 16.2% of sales.","Rig Technologies' capital equipment orders totaled 221 million, a sequential decrease of $89 million or 29%.Shipments of $246 million outpaced bookings providing us with a book to bill of 90%. Total segment backlog at quarter end was $3.14 billion. We continue to see a growing opportunity set in the renewable sector where we are able to leverage our core expertise in lifting and handling and in naval architecture to serve this rapidly growing industry.","After booking a record size order for the jacking system of European offshore wind construction vessel in the second quarter, we received another large order associated with a 28,000 ton offshore wind turbine installation vessels that will be constructed at Japan Marine United shipyard or Shimizu Corporation.","NOV was awarded the design work, a telescopic leg crane and the jacking system for this 142 meter long 50-meter wide vessel, that is being purpose-built to efficiently construct the next generation of offshore windmills which will incorporate turbines with capacities of up to 12 megawatts and the rotor diameters of up to 220 meters.","NOV proprietary telescopic leg crane will provide a unique combination of high elevation hoisting capability for turbine installation and heavy load capability for foundation installation.","The crane will have a maximum lifting capacity of 2,500 tons and a maximum lifting height of 158 meters. The unique design of the telescopic boom also avoids per fusion outside the whole dimensions during transit, which increases the maneuverability of this vessel. Larger more economically efficient ultra large-scale wind turbines ranging from nine to 12 megawatts in size, will greatly improve the economics associated with the offshore wind industry.","We're excited about this opportunity, which has a dollar value roughly equivalent to a full equipment package associated with the high spec jack up rig and see the need for a healthy number of additional vessels over the coming years due to the limited fleet of installation vessels currently capable of installing wind turbines eight megawatts or larger.","As offshore rig activity continues to recover at a measured pace, we continue to see steady order intake associated with upgrading and differentiating the performance of offshore rigs with a heavy emphasis on automation and multi-machine control enabled by our NOVOS control platform.","While the number of rig contract tenders has increased, these processes remain very competitive and operators are increasingly insisting that these capabilities are included in bid packages. We booked four NOVOS orders associated with these automation upgrades during the third quarter, in addition two NOVOS systems for land rigs bringing our total number of orders to over 130.","While land rig capital equipment orders remained challenged in the Western Hemisphere as North American customers cannibalize equipment off their stacked assets and the short devaluation of the Argentine peso models the near-term outlook in that particular market.","We continue to see pent-up demand for cutting edge drilling technology and equipment in other international markets, including the Middle East where we were able to secure an order for two land rigs during the quarter.","In our Rig Aftermarket business, the positive booking momentum continued with another double-digit sequential increase in orders, yielding our highest order flow since Q1 of 2015.","While service and repair work was roughly flat, we continue to maintain a steady backlog of reactivation upgrade and recertification project volumes. In addition, we're continuing to realize greater adoption rates of our condition based monitoring solutions and total cost of ownership service model.","Looking at Rig Technologies fourth quarter, we expect revenues to improve between 4% to 6% on higher revenues from land rig sales and service and repair work. EBITDA margins are expected to decline between 200 and 400 basis points due to less favorable mix, a fall-off in favorable cost variances on project closeouts and limited incremental contribution from cost savings between now and the first quarter of 2020.","While we expect market conditions will remain challenging, we're pleased with the strides our people are making to improve our profitability, our working capital intensity and our already strong competitive positioning.","With that, we'll now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Byron Pope from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.","Byron Pope","Good morning, guys.","Clay Williams","Good morning.","Jose Bayardo","Good morning, Byron.","Byron Pope","Is it really encouraging to hear that international recovery continues and steady fashion for you guys. And I was particularly struck by the growth in caps. Clay, I want to ask you to speak to specific countries and customers obviously. But could you just frame for us the maybe the regional international drivers for caps as you see it as we step through the next 12 or so months.","Clay Williams","Yeah. What's encouraging to us Byron is the pickup in activity in the offshore, in particular and I think that's been driving a lot of orders source in the Completion & Production Solutions group. So generally, the world seeing rising demand for LNG in Asian markets and that's contributing to, I think, some decisions by operators to move forward with development of gas discoveries in places like East Africa and elsewhere.","Our customers there, in many of the major basins, have had five years of reengineering and focusing on cost through this downturn and have been high grading their prospects have been taking advantage of deflation in the supply chain to reduce their cost of development. I think there are to a point where they're getting more confident about moving forward.","I think you have a lot of operators around the globe that are -- have seen our normal depletion and declines of the base loads around some offshore infrastructure, gathering hubs and pipelines and things like that who recognize the need to replace some of that production. And so, I think that's kind of giving a little impetus to operators to move forward on some of these developments.","So it's really -- it's been a slow, but steady recovery and very pleased to see it continue on through the third quarter. But really a global phenomenon. We're seeing, I think Jose in his prepared comments referenced some of the equipment that we expect to go to work in the Gulf of Mexico and the U.S., lot of interest in the Mexican side of the Gulf of Mexico, Brazil offshore, North Sea. So, again very, very steady and slow and encouraging for the outlook and lots of markets around the globe.","Onshore, the Middle East has remained fairly active through the downturn and just continues to be a lot of things going on there. And so we've got a number of tenders that we're looking at. With respect to providing equipment into that market, we've opened a number of facilities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia that came online specifically, for instance, our Fiber Glass pipe manufacturing plant in Dammam that Jose also referenced. We opened that in April and it's ramping up production, now we're making both real pipe and jointed pipe there, and so just a lot of -- as opposed to North America, we're facing a lot of headwinds, international offshore seems to be much brighter.","Byron Pope","That's really helpful. Clay I appreciate it. And then Jose just one quick question, I mean the strong free cash flow generation in Q3, but I think I heard you say that the back half free cash flow target is still intact the where you guys had previously characterized it. Is that fair?","Clay Williams","It is fair. So yeah, obviously, we made some really good progress during the course of the third quarter. Made more progress than we had anticipated related to collection of receivables, we're continuing to tighten up and improve our processes. So even as business mix becomes a little bit more challenging as it relates to collections, organization is doing a great job, getting their arms around the process and it's squeezing down the days receivable.","So as we look at the fourth quarter, we are holding our prior guidance intact, the $300 million to $500 million in free cash flow for the second half of the year, but obviously we've made great strides in getting there, and so you could be pretty confident that we would look at the upper end of that range.","Byron Pope","Great. Thanks guys. I appreciate it.","Clay Williams","Thanks Byron.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Herbert from Simmons. Please go ahead.","Bill Herbert","Good morning. So sticking with the free cash flow theme, so if you could hit the upper end or your guidance for free cash flow for the year that implies yet another significant working capital harvest in Q4 that's not necessarily dissimilar to what was witnessed in our Q3. Is that correct?","Jose Bayardo","It certainly involves some additional contribution from working capital and we're confident in our ability to realize that. But later today once you -- once we are sure of our Q, you'll be able to see a little bit more granularity from the cash flow statement. As I mentioned, we made great progress as it pertains to harvesting cash flow from receivables and other elements of the -- of our working capital.","We started to get cash from our inventory. However, the contribution in Q3 was pretty light and so I think you'll see a little bit of shift in terms of where the source of cash is coming from. You'll have continued source just from operational performance, but you\u2019ll see a shift from more contribution from inventory versus receivables as we move into the future.","Clay Williams","Yeah, we're really going to focus our attentions I think on getting better at inventory. We did as Jose mentioned was a source of cash but that's where the -- I think remaining opportunity is for us.","Bill Herbert","Okay. So we have a shift from receivables to inventories in Q4, but nonetheless the working capital harvest in Q4 is still fairly considerable?","Jose Bayardo","Our expectation is to see continued contribution from working capital.","Bill Herbert","Got it. And with working capital spending, I'm not sure if you touched on this in your commentary Jose, but what should we expect with regard to Q4? And also if you can just take a look into 2020 and what your expectations would be for capital spending intensity. It's been fairly low as Clay pointed out year-to-date. And I'm just curious is as to whether it can stay that low?","Jose Bayardo","Yeah, sure. I think there are a couple of questions mixed in there. One additional question related to working capital. So, yeah, as we move forward into the fourth quarter as we've touched on, we expect to continue -- continued improvement on the working capital intensity of the business. And we're certainly not going to sit still as it pertains to 2020. Still think there are more opportunities for improvement through the course of 2020 to bring down that ratio of working capital to our revenue run rate.","Yeah, as it pertains to the capital intensity of our business associated with capital expenditures, yeah I think its most folks are well aware, we have a very capital-light business that's operating in a pretty capital-intensive business which is prone to generation of cash flow and we continue to view our business in that way and manage it that way.","As you've highlighted, our capital expenditures for this year is certainly below the plan, which we laid out at the beginning of the yea, at $69 million in CapEx in Q3. Q4 is normally our highest CapEx quarter of the year. But I think we'll probably finish up the year at about $260 million of CapEx full year. One of the several reasons why our CapEx for 2019 is a little bit below or is a bit below our original plan is no surprise that things are going -- we've factored the budget around sort of best case scenario in terms of progress associated with the new rig manufacturing plant in Saudi Arabia. Things take a little bit more time and so we're not surprised that's taking a little bit longer when you're building a facility in completely undeveloped territory within Saudi. So, some of that CapEx will shift into 2020 and so we can see a little bit of an increase for 2020. But then after that expect our capital expenditures to get back in line with history which should be plus or minus 3% of our revenue run rate.","Bill Herbert","Okay, fine. So it's basically a little bit of an increase for 2020, is that splitting the difference between Q3 and Q4.","Jose Bayardo","We have -- we're in the middle of our planning process right now. But I think -- I think that's a safe assumption.","Bill Herbert","Okay. Thanks very much.","Clay Williams","Thanks you, Bill.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vebs Vaishnav from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Vebs Vaishnav","Hey good morning and congratulations on the very good quarter.","Clay Williams","Thank you, Vebs.","Vebs Vaishnav","I guess just following up on the last questions, if I think about the CapEx for next year, my sense from what we were talking is, it could be flattish. Is that fair way of thinking?","Jose Bayardo","No Vebs. So when we came into this year, our initial expectation was CapEx plan just a little south of $350 million. So, as we move into 2020, we will see that step-up associated with the increased spend related to that rig manufacturing plant. So as Bill was kind of indicating, I think you'll see somewhere between through the $260 million that we're calling for now this year and that $350 million number for next year, but subject to revision next quarters as I mentioned we're in the middle of our planning process right now.","Clay Williams","Yeah. The plant that Jose referenced in Saudi Arabia is the big piece this year. I think, if you recall when we came into 2019, we basically said, we're taking 2018s level of CapEx at about $250 million and another $100 million for that plant in Saudi Arabia. The reason we're a little bit hesitant is, it depends on how constructions progressing there and as Jose mentioned, some minor delays there. But on the whole, we're developing kind of our and fine-tuning I think our outlook for CapEx as we move into 2020.","Jose Bayardo","Yeah. And there is spend that is occurring on that plant. So therefore, we certainly wouldn't expect 2020s CapEx to be in line with what our original plan was for this year which had assumed everything went as quickly as possible.","Vebs Vaishnav","Yeah, got it and I'm sorry, if I missed it, but did you guys call out how much was severance cost in your free cash flow number in 3Q?","Jose Bayardo","We did not specifically called that out but I think in Q2, you saw the non-cash charges associated with some of our severance expense. The majority of that would have flowed through as a real cash expense in the third quarter.","Vebs Vaishnav","And that should decline in 4Q.","Jose Bayardo","Yes it should.","Vebs Vaishnav","Okay. And I guess last question for me, just if I think about those cost savings, can you just help me think about you went from $160 million to $200 million. Like what are the incremental steps that you guys are taking you have been very proactive at that?","Clay Williams","Yeah. We spent all time on that on the last couple of calls Vebs. And we've continued to evolve our plans, but as we've mentioned before, we're kind of more fundamentally reorganizing how we execute our businesses. And as you're well aware, we operate through fairly autonomous business units, but as we enter 2019 and market outlook was diminished a little bit, we said you know, now is the time really to go into in particular the administrative support functions and support those business units and see where we can capture more savings.","And so a lot of the effort that's going on through the summer and now into the fourth quarter has been around that reorganization along with other cost savings measures that we're undertaking kind of business unit by business unit across all three of our segments.","And so the difference between 160 million target that we talked about in the second quarter and now the revised $200 million target that we're talking about in the third quarter is just kind of the -- getting deeper into it and refining of the steps that we can and are taking and so the savings have continued to now.","Jose Bayardo","But also I want to add. Very, very proud of the organization for stepping up for this to this challenge and for our employees and our managers looking for ways to run our business more efficiently. They're doing a great job on this.","Vebs Vaishnav","That's all for me. Thank you for taking the question. And great job.","Clay Williams","Thank you, Vebs.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Gruber from Citigroup. Please go ","Scott Gruber","Yes, good morning.","Clay Williams","Hi, Scott.","Scott Gruber","Just staying on the same line of questioning, the cost-out program now up to $200 million. Is there more to go here? Do you think it could keep moving beyond that $200 million mark in 2020 in the absence of any divestitures. And then as you start to think about that portfolio mix, it sounds like there could be some divestitures on the horizon. Could the cost-out program continue to grow as some businesses come out or should we think about those two separate?","Clay Williams","Yeah that's a great question. I'm -- to compete effectively in oilfield services, you always have to be paying attention to cost inefficiencies and I think it's kind of in our DNA to continue to look for cost savings efforts. And so I think that really is -- the part of the reason we have overachieved on cost savings around our plans.","But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are reviewing parts of our portfolio, products and services around the globe to see kind of where there may be opportunities to further improve our returns on capital, in fact, I'm going to ask Blake to comment on that process.","But one of the things we got to think about is, how -- what -- if you take some product or revenue stream out of a business then how do you adjust the fixed cost to support that business, so you don't run into an absorption.","Blake McCarthy","Right and Scott, I think we're looking at this more from a returns basis than just a pure cost standpoint and we're being pretty methodical about it. It's more than just a math exercise. We're looking at it from a qualitative basis as well, right. Well, we don't want to sell businesses that we feel we have a real competitive advantage on it and we're just looking at a trailing 12 months return, where it's been bouncing along the bottom of the downcycle.","So we're looking at both from the numbers standpoint and where we stand in the business and we're looking at it across all of our different product lines and taking our time on this. As we look to either exit through whether it's through divestiture or whether we just have to close the product line, we will obviously take a long hard look at the RemainCo fixed cost structure.","Jose Bayardo","Yeah. And yeah, I think there may be some opportunities come out of that but too early to say.","Scott Gruber","Got it. And then just a follow-up on the portfolio review, great to hear the returns focused. Are you guys starting to think about the mix of businesses within the portfolio that mix of kind of upstream, downstream, other industrial you've taken on some contracts to access the renewables mark in a bigger way with those vessels. Is that part of the review?","Clay Williams","I would say -- I think we're more of a bottoms up sort of analysis than a top-down. We don't sort of think of what's an optimal mix of exposures for NOV and as much as we think about. Hey, here's a really interesting business that has demonstrable competitive advantage.","To me, I think and I think I said in my opening remarks, I think the strategic positioning of businesses is critically important to returns and so kind of understanding how businesses can outperform competition in this space and can carve out long-term returns that are very attractive.","It's more of a granular sort of thinking through what's -- what sort of competitive advantage or what sort of moat does this particular business have? And that tends to guide our decisions more than hey, I would like to optimal mix to be you know 20% midstream and something like that if that makes sense.","So it's less of a view on -- on kind of sector exposure, more of a view of hey, how do you get, sort of, classic competitive advantage and I think over the years that's probably been much more of an important guide in terms of our strategic capital allocation decisions here at NOV.","Scott Gruber","Got it. Great color. Thank you, Clay.","Clay Williams","You bet. Thank you, Scott.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead from RBC. Please go ahead.","Kurt Hallead","Hey, good morning.","Clay Williams","Hey, Kurt.","Kurt Hallead","Hey, congrats. Great job, guys. The question follow-up was given the cost saving dynamics you guys have put in place. Just curious as to whether they give us an update as to the incremental margin profile for the respective segments as we kind of going to move forward from here. In the past I think you've going to give us some indications on what they were maybe on a pre-cost savings dynamic. So just curious as to how these cost savings may change that incrementals on a go-forward basis?","Jose Bayardo","Sure. Kurt. Yeah, so the prior guidance that we have provided related to what we believe normalized incrementals are for each of the segments still stands. But as you've touched on you've got to adjust for the nuances that take place from quarter-to-quarter. And right now as we're undergoing our cost savings initiatives you could expect incrementals to be bigger than that prior guidance. And you can expect decrementals to be smaller right.","And then you also have those individual nuances quarter-to-quarter such as pricing dynamics et cetera that come into play. But so if you look at the guidance that we provided for Q4 in our prepared remarks those factor in the impacts of cost savings that we anticipate will materialize during the fourth quarter.","Kurt Hallead","Okay, great. I appreciate that color. And then Clay just kind of curious, you know, as you've had a variety discussions with a number of different customers and things are pretty uncertain as it relates to the North American market going into next year. But what I want to get your sense as to how you might see this thing evolving and given your experience of prior cycles. And kind of what's similar, what's different and what we from the outside looking in potentially drawn to determine what kind of growth rate we could see from this business over the next three to five years potentially.","Clay Williams","Yeah, I think, it's a great question, Kurt. I think that the challenge through the first five years in this downturn is that every time we start to see the signs of recovery there is a another big production report coming out of West Texas. And you've had unconventional shale surprise to the upside on production through this five-year period, which I would characterize as a lot of entrepreneurial aggressive smaller E&P companies in kind of a land rush phase still of securing acreage and drilling it up.","And as the Permian Basin and other unconventionals across North America evolve into to move to a handful of larger players who I think are going to be steadier in kind of their drilling and production then maybe the possibility of big production surprises to the upside diminishes a bit. It's kind of a steadier more workman like undertaking and developing that acreage.","I think that could basically provide maybe a little more confidence in other EMPs around the globe. More confidence to their price decks and lead to the return to normalcy over the next few years in terms of development that's more balanced in international markets and offshore markets. I think we're starting to see the early signs of that perhaps in 2019 and -- but certainly 2020 the near-term looks -- in North America looks pretty challenging in Q4.","2020 is -- remains opaque, but what's been missing through the five years of the downturn really is the offshore and international markets. And so we're pleased to see progress over the last several quarters. Slow and steady in those marketplaces. But kind of a more levelized level of production out of -- out of the Permian and North American unconventionals. I think could help maybe accelerate that just a tad and we could get back to a greater level of prosperity globally, which is really what we've all been -- have been seeking.","The other big factor too which is really come to bear here in 2019 is the fact a lot of the North American producers responsible for those production out-performances were finding a much more challenging to get capital. And the level of capital austerity and discipline that's going into their drilling programs and living with cash flows and so forth. I got to think that's going to -- that's going to affect U.S. production growth going forward. And I think be one of the building blocks for a healthier industry.","Kurt Hallead","Great. Thanks, Clay. I appreciate that color.","Clay Williams","You bet. Thanks, Kurt.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Cole Sullivan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Cole Sullivan","Congrats on a good quarter guys. Within Wellbore the North American declines kind of hit in 3Q and obviously fell out a lot more and \u2013 over the September time. And you guys held in pretty well on the margin side actually kind of beat guidance. Obviously on cost savings and the fourth quarter guidance it looks like it's holding in as well pretty \u2013 pretty strongly. Is that cost savings that's really driving that stronger performance expected in 4Q there in Wellbore?","Jose Bayardo","Yeah. There is certainly an element of cost savings, but I think the \u2013 really the contributions we provided from a consolidated standpoint is consistent with what we're seeing across each of the segments, where the contribution from cost savings in the fourth quarter will be a little bit less than what we experienced in Q3. So, we're also seeing mix shifts across all of our businesses, which contribute to the performance and I'm not entirely clear. I got your question precisely right, I think to recall is that Wellbore Technologies is still 46% of its revenues is coming from the international markets.","Clay Williams","Yes. That will help, but you know \u2013 so in the third quarter coming from the second quarter top line were down 7% and the Group there did a fantastic job managing detrimental leverage to only 2% sequentially. Really basically holding EBITDA flat despite a 7% top line decline, going from the third quarter to fourth quarter we're guiding down I think Jose said you said 5%, 6%, 7% top line decrementals more like 25%. So which is lower than you would otherwise expect normal operating leverage or normal variable margins to be in that space, which are probably 35% something like that. So that's where kind of the cost savings show up, but to be clear we are guiding down again in Q4 around on the topline of Wellbore Technologies.","Cole Sullivan","All right. That's helpful. Thanks. On CMP revenues were guided to kind of flattish for revenues. Can you help us think about the backlog conversion there with the higher orders that have been flowing through this year that are I guess implied in the fourth quarter number? And then how to think about the non-backlog revenue side for the shorter cycle items in 4Q guidance?","Jose Bayardo","Yeah. So, Cole that's a good question. So with the shift in the mix that we're seeing you're right we are guiding to effectively flat quarter in the fourth quarter, but an increasing proportion of that revenue will be from our backlog oriented businesses. So we expect that revenue from backlog to pick up just a little bit from Q3 to Q4.","Cole Sullivan","All right. That's all I had. Thanks.","Clay Williams","Great. Thanks, Cole.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Connor Lynagh from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Connor Lynagh","Yeah. Thanks. I was wondering, if you could just characterize we've spent a fair bit of time on it already I know but just what drove the cost out to surprise to the upside. What specifically were the \u2013 the things that move to on faster than you expected?","Clay Williams","It\u2019s hard to generalize honestly other than just really, I mean, I've said it before and it's probably worth repeating, it's a pretty volatile business and you got to be able to downsize when called upon. And I think our teams are really good at sort of moving quickly and acting decisively in taking costs out. And so we entered this latest round in the first quarter of 2019 and begin to get traction in the second quarter and then in the third quarter. I think you're seeing a lot of the results of steps that have been taken. And I can't say this enough we have a great team, who really understands we have to constantly size our business to market requirements. And in a down market, you're downsizing, but it up market we're also pretty good at flexing upwards to meet market demand, which can rise pretty sharply in this place \u2013 in this space as well. So just really good execution all the way around, and again difficult to generalize other than to say I think it's embedded in our DNA here and the good news is we're continuing to take the steps necessary to position the Company and we're making good progress on that.","Connor Lynagh","Got it. That's helpful. Maybe to pivot a little bit since we are talking about the portfolio. I would assume that you will still be active on the building portfolio as well, where you see opportunities. I'm wondering if you could just characterize how you see the M&A market right now. And just any portions of your portfolio that you find interested to add on to in the current market environment.","Clay Williams","I'm going to hand that off to Blake to speak to.","Blake McCarthy","Yeah I mean there's definitely -- as we've mentioned in the past like the buyer universe with running parallel with the limited access to capital in the space is definitely getting smaller, and so we find that we think we're in a pretty opportunistic situation.","There are some business lines that we definitely think we can augment through M&A over the next year. But also like -- I think we're in a pretty good spot when I look at the overall portfolio. There is no huge gaps that I think that we need to fill. So we're definitely can be very disciplined and take our time. I think patients is the name of the game right now.","Clay Williams","Yeah we're -- I'd add too. In contrast with prior eras, we are more -- we're using M&A in conjunction with organic investments in technology and kind of these are smaller more rifle shot sort of acquisitions were mostly doing. And then investing internally to enhance our technology to take their products through the NOV infrastructure to really -- we think that's the most efficient use of capital now. But it is to Blake's point it's a becoming more of a buyer's market. So we're watching that intently.","Connor Lynagh","Got it. Thanks a lot.","Clay Williams","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sean Meakim from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Sean Meakim","Thank you. Hey good morning.","Clay Williams","Good morning Sean.","Sean Meakim","So Clay or Jose, just one point of clarification, I was curious how much did -- or to what extent did the write-down\u2019s of inventory in the second quarter aid the margins in 3Q across any of your segments. Can you maybe give us a sense of magnitude if there is one? And two to extend is that a tailwind for you going forward?","Clay Williams","Yeah, there really is not a contribution or any sort of tailwind that comes from us writing down our inventory. So we have been very consistent in terms of our approach related to how we've dealt with items that go through our P&L or come out of our P&L via other items.","And well first of all, the vast majority of inventory that we write down is heading for the scrap heap and really over the last three years, we scrapped over $700 million of the inventory. There are times where we are writing things down to a lower cost of market.","And occasionally, those do sell and usually they were at zero margin to the extent they were at any sort of material margin. We will actually reverse the write down through or other items.","And so, if you go back and you look at some of our prior quarterly press releases and 10-Qs and you study those other items, you can actually see that there are places where we are reversing those charges because there have been a couple of areas. I think Q1 of 2018, Q2 of 2017 specifically you can go back and look and see that there are reversals of some of those charges and that's why, that's happening is because we were pleasantly surprised with the outcome on a couple of those write downs. But we do not take that back to the P&L to inflate our margin.","Jose Bayardo","Yeah that's really rare for us to write something down and then be able to sell it for margin. But when it does happen we're pretty -- it's pretty consistent in taking it to other item.","Sean Meakim","Thank you for that clarification. That's really helpful. The other point on working capital, you're targeting free cash in the back half of the year obviously a very good shape there. Could you maybe just give us your latest thoughts on working capital to sales maybe -- actually 2020 because again you've made significant progress there? How is that change and maybe just Jose, how you think about DSOs, DSIs, DPOs what's kind of the normalized run rate that you're trying to accomplish from that angle?","Jose Bayardo","Yeah Sean, I think of course we're going through our planning process and trying to determine what all the right metrics are for 2020. It\u2019s probably a little bit premature for us to give you a precise guidance. But pleased with the progress that we have made so far in the back half of -- in 2019 getting extremely close to the targets that we set at the beginning of this year and we look for continued improvement moving into 2020.","And so, as I mentioned earlier, it is about focus on all of the blocking and tackling details associated with improving our processes. We have made considerable strides. But there is still meaningful room for improvement.","So, with our DSOs, I think at about 77 days. I think we can get a little bit better than that. Our turns, as I mentioned earlier, we've made some progress but not nearly enough progress in terms of inventory turns, so we can do better with that in 2020.","And so, we'll be working on setting that guidance. But needless to say, we're going to continue to squeeze it down and get as efficient as we possibly can, as it pertains to working capital intensity in our business.","Sean Meakim","Got it, fair enough, thanks a lot.","Jose Bayardo","Thanks, Sean.","Clay Williams","Thanks, Sean.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes our Q&A session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Clay Williams, CEO for closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir.","Clay Williams","Thank you, Duanne. And thank you all for joining us this morning. Also thanks to our employees that are listening. We look forward to updating you on our fourth quarter and full year results, in early 2020.","Goodbye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect. Good day."],"15826":["National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NYSE:NOV) Q3 2017 Earnings Call October 27, 2017 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Loren Singletary - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Analysts","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to the National Oilwell Varco 3Q 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Mr. Loren Singletary, Chief Investor and Industry Relations Officer. Sir, you may begin.","Loren Singletary - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Welcome, everyone, to National Oilwell Varco's third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With me today are Clay Williams, our Chairman, President and CEO; and Jose Bayardo, our Senior Vice President and CFO.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of today's comments are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. They involve risk, uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. No one should assume that these forward-looking statements remain valid later in the quarter or later in the year. For a more detailed discussion of the major risk factors affecting our business, please refer to our latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Our comments also include non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measures are in our earnings release available on our website. On a U.S. GAAP basis, in the third quarter of 2017, National Oilwell Varco reported revenues of $1.84 billion and a net loss of $26 million or $0.07 per share. Our use of the term EBITDA throughout this morning's call corresponds with the term adjusted EBITDA, as defined in our earnings release.","Later on the call, we will host a question-and-answer session. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up to permit more participation.","Now, let me turn it over to Clay.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Thank you, Loren. In the third quarter of 2017, NOV generated $1.84 billion in revenue, an increase of 4% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA of $167 million improved $25 million sequentially, representing 33% operating leverage and adjusted EBITDA improved $99 million year-over-year, representing 52% operating leverage from the prior year. This was our fifth quarter in a row of rising EBITDA.","Improving market conditions in North America and the Middle East since last year, together with the cost reductions we've executed, have driven our profitability improvements. However, the industry hit yet another headwind this summer, as oil prices began to decline in April and remained persistently weak in the third quarter. As a result since peaking at 958 rigs in late July, the U.S. rig count began a shallow decline to 913, which puts us back where we were in the U.S. in May of this year.","Rig reactivations have slowed and many of our drilling contractor customers are, once again, curtailing spending with our rig group. NOV overcame this by putting up strong top line growth in Wellbore Technologies, which rose 13% sequentially, owing to solid demand for downhole drilling technologies globally.","Completion & Production Solutions also posted strong growth, up 5% sequentially, led by demand across North America and the Middle East for frac stimulation equipment, completion tools and fiber glass pipe. These two segments led NOV higher overall, up $76 million in revenues sequentially and resulted in our land mix increasing, once again, to 65% of consolidated sales in the third quarter.","Oil prices had moved back up above $50 lately, which is timely, as our customers are launching their budgeting processes for 2018. Nevertheless, the recovery narrative right now seems tepid and visibility into 2018 is limited. Customers seem to be waiting for sustained oil price improvement before ramping up land spending or pulling the trigger on long-awaited offshore FIDs.","In the meantime, we continue to see pockets of demand emerging with three years of underinvestment and cannibalization and, lately, rising scarcity fueling demand for certain areas like frac equipment. Other pockets of demand arise from technologies changing the landscape and providing opportunity, think closed-loop drilling, downhole tools and completion tools.","Strategically, NOV continues to pivot into these areas with smart organic investments and rifle-shot M&A. Capital deployment at NOV is guided by our conviction that unconventional shale technologies are the most important development in energy in a generation; that gun-barrel-straight boreholes geo-steered to the sweet spots within formations, with low tortuosity, are materially more valuable to E&P companies than lesser quality attempts; and that NOV can bring proprietary tools to oilfield service companies to deliver these wellbores.","We believe that composite technologies will defeat corrosion in the oilfield, the most expensive production problem that many of you probably never think about. We believe that big data and predictive analytics will drive efficiency and that, as the largest OEM of drilling equipment, NOV is uniquely positioned to bring automation and big data solutions to the oilfield.","We believe that as production shifts to unconventional basins, the industry will need more fluids processing technologies that NOV is well positioned to deliver. And we believe the industry will adopt a more efficient industrial model to construct the floating production facilities needed to develop the planet's immense deepwater resources.","We continue to execute our business plan around these perspectives, while reducing costs and monitoring fundamentals that are slowly but steadily improving. U.S. crude inventories have declined 23 of the past 29 weeks, pointing to steadily tightening supply. NOV's optionality into a more vigorous recovery continues to be enhanced by our actions through the downturn.","As I've done on past calls, I'd like to take a few minutes and tell you about one of the compelling businesses that reside within NOV's portfolio. NOV Tuboscope is the world's largest provider of tubular inspection and internal tubular coating services, comprising one-quarter of Wellbore Technologies segment revenues.","The oil business uses a lot of pipe. A lot of pipe. For example, in 2017, the industry will consume about 14 million tons or about 1.3 billion feet of oil country tubular goods or OCTG pipe, casing, tubing and drill pipe. The oil and gas industry will drill and case and complete an estimated 650 million feet of borehole globally in 2017.","On average, the industry consumes about two feet of OCTG pipe for every foot of borehole it drills. As I said, that's a lot of pipe; in fact, enough to completely encircle the globe nine times. This makes the oil and gas industry an enormous consumer of steel. There are literally hundreds of steel mills around the world that manufacture OCTG pipe of all sizes, weights and grades, to meet the demands of an industry with a voracious appetite.","The industry's productivity gains in drilling are well documented; each rig is drilling more wellbores each year, and each wellbore contains longer and longer laterals. All these gains are conspiring to drive ever-higher consumption of OCTG pipe for each operating rig each year.","Consequently, steel mills that manufacture OCTG pipe have been adding capacity, mostly in North America, to meet this ravenous incremental demand. Pipe mills generally prefer long runs of the same pipe size, since larger runs allow them to spread their high setup costs across more pipe.","They frequently sell raw pipe or green tubes to pipe processors, which quench and temper them to adjust the metallurgy to desired strength and hardness. The pipe is then sold to distributors who perform the important economic task of breaking the large heats down into smaller quantities that better fit the needs of their E&P customers.","OCTG's distributors are mostly private businesses that take speculative positions in various sizes, weights and grades of pipe where they foresee the highest future demand. Some larger E&P customers perform their own buying functions, but even these will supplement their pipe needs with occasional distributor purchases.","So, the first point I'd like to make about the OCTG world is that it is usually characterized by lots of transfers of ownership, joints of pipe flow from mills to processors to distributors to oil companies. And I would add that there exists a robust market for used pipe as well, distributors that purchase used pipe from one oil company to sell to another.","The second point I'd like to make is that pipe defects are not uncommon. The manufacturing process can result in cracks, voids, inclusions and mill scale. Pipe can be damaged in handling and accidentally deformed to be oval. Used pipe may suffer from corrosion and pitting. All of these can affect the pressure rating and future performance of the pipe.","The third point I'd like to make is that pipe failure in the oilfield is a serious matter. It's always expensive and frequently dangerous. Fishing jobs are costly, and if unsuccessful, the operator may lose the well completely.","Around 80 years ago, NOV's Tuboscope business recognized the need to bring better quality assurance to the oilfield pipe world, adapting military technology used to inspect cannon barrels. Today, we use sophisticated physics, including magnetic flux leakage, eddy current, and ultrasonic technology, to provide critical quality assurance for oil country tubulars.","And every time a new joint of pipe is born, or processed, or sold to a distributor, or sold to an oil company, or pulled out of an existing well and rerun or resold, there is an opportunity for NOV Tuboscope to inspect the pipe to assure its new owner that it is fit- for-purpose. And with enough joints to go around the world nine times in 2017, that is a terrific business. It is essentially a tolling business, wherein NOV Tuboscope is the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval for pipe transactions.","A single joint of OCTG pipe may be inspected several times through its life. We provide this critical service in steel mills, in the pipe processor's operations, in the pipe yards of our oil company and distributor customers, on the rigs that run the pipe and pull the pipe, and in our own network of pipe inspection yards.","Our network of pipe yards is, we believe, the largest in the world. NOV operates 75 pipe yards, which offer pipe storage as a service, which cover more than 2.5 square miles over 1,600 acres. Let me say that again, we operate 75 yards totaling more than 1,600 acres, and today we're in possession of 88 million feet of OCTG pipe, over 2.5 million joints or 3.5 weeks of global forward supply.","I mentioned earlier that pipe can be damaged in transport. It's heavy and it's expensive to load on a truck and move. And that means that possession of OCTG pipe within our yards is effectively a competitive advantage, because additional services can be performed on the pipe by NOV without having to ship it by truck, reducing risk and cost.","Consequently, we steadily expanded our services beyond warehousing and inventory tracking to include services like thread repair, bucking on couplings, application of external coatings, straightening, belling for our proprietary Zap-Lok flowline installation method, installation of fiberglass TK Liners, and installation of our Thru-Kote sleeves to combat corrosion, just to name a few services. We also hardband drill pipe, we repair tool joints, and we install RFID chips to provide full lifecycle management. Our TracID system captures complete drill pipe history, including ownership, usage and service.","One particular pipe service has grown through the past several decades to become a tremendous NOV franchise. Years ago, NOV Tuboscope pioneered a proprietary method of applying thermoset plastic coatings to the inner surface of OCTG, something we do at 15 facilities globally, to combat corrosion and to improve hydraulic performance of the pipe.","One major oil company reported it achieved 25% higher flow rates from its Gulf of Mexico wells by running internally coated tubulars. I would add that the cost of failure of internal coatings is high. Thousands of feet of peeling thermoset plastic can easily clog up a well and necessitate an expensive workover, if the application process is not performed well.","As the oldest and largest applicator of internal OCTG coatings, NOV Tuboscope, again, is the most trusted name in this business. There are very few joints of pipe in the oilfield that NOV's Tuboscope unit does not touch at some point, and as drilling efficiencies continue to rise, the amount of pipe consumed by each drilling rig also rises every year; in fact, it's up about 50% over the past five years. This 80-year-old business unit, which derives 84% of its revenue from land markets, provides yet another example of how Wellbore Technologies benefits from footage drilled much more than rig count.","Turning to NOV's Completion & Production Solutions segment, we're benefiting from rising demand for frac stimulation equipment in North America and the Middle East, as completion intensity in unconventional reservoirs continues to rise. NOV's intervention and stimulation equipment business unit has witnessed rising demand for the capital equipment, consumables, and aftermarket service and repair that it provides to oilfield pressure pumpers, coiled tubing operators and wireline operators. It is the largest business unit within Completion & Production Solutions, accounting for about 30% of the segment's revenues.","Completion intensity of unconventional wells continues to move up and to the right. Laterals are getting longer, stage counts are increasing, pressures and proppant loadings per stage continue to rise, and completions now represent 65% or more of average North American well costs. The pressure pumpers who execute these frac jobs, our customers, are putting more abrasives and more horsepower into the ground than ever before, and executing more stages per day, which makes this endeavor highly capital-intensive and highly consumptive of frac iron.","More stages require more coiled tubing equipment to mill out plugs used to separate the stages. And more stages require more wireline equipment to deploy plugs and perforating guns downhole. NOV is a leading provider of all the equipment used to execute these completions, particularly the higher-valued technologies and complex process equipment, like hydration units, chemical additive systems, blenders and control systems. We provide data van control centers equipped with industry-leading software systems that coordinate operating results and reduce maintenance, enabling operators to control high-pressure, high-volume pumping of abrasive proppants downhole through 24 frac units simultaneously from a single control panel.","Complex, demanding operations like this require high reliability, which is why we developed bonded Blue Thunder valves for frac units that last 50% longer than competitor products in the most demanding frac jobs. Our new stainless steel Patriot fluid ends target triple the life of conventional fluid ends, with design improvements that make them easier to service.","Coiled tubing is a continuous length of steel tubing, typically around 2 inches in diameter and up to 30,000 feet in length, which is wound on a reel as we manufacture it. It is used to perform arthroscopic surgery in the oilfield, with the capability to enter existing, even flowing wells, and traverse long laterals to perform completion and well remediation operations, like setting plugs, perforating, pumping acid, or even pumping frac jobs.","NOV is the leading provider of coiled tubing hardware and consumables, dating back to the 1970s. We provide coiled tubing units, control systems, pressure control devices, and coiled tubing itself, which is a consumable that must be replaced regularly. We've delivered over 1,500 NOV Hydra Rig-manufactured units in service today, and many more injector heads as well.","Coiled tubing is the only industrial application of steel that pushes steel past its plastic deformation limits, while demanding it continue to hold pressure and weight. But there is a limit to the capabilities of steel. Every round trip downhole takes coiled tubing through six plastic deformation cycles. Operators must track the number of cycles each coiled tubing string has been subjected to so that it does not exceed its limits, and thus fail.","NOV's Cerberus software system has been the industry standard in coiled tubing monitoring for this purpose for over 20 years. These operating constraints dictate that coiled tubing strings be retired and replaced every two to three months under normal pressure and utilization. As a leading provider of these coiled tubing strings, NOV recently introduced QT-1400, the highest strength coiled tubing in the world, with a threefold increase in overpull capability, lighter weight, and thinner wall, enabling people to reach farther in plug-and-perf and intervention operations.","We are also the largest manufacturer of coiled tubing BOP stacks through our Texas Oil Tools name, offering our customers the capability to monitor remotely and in real time, the status of their coiled tubing blowout preventer rams. We provide real-time condition monitoring of coiled tubing operations designed to identify equipment failures before they occur, including pumps, filters, engines, hydraulic systems, lubrication systems and specific bearings within rotating machinery. The system's alarms that can be configured with remote alerts sent via text message.","Additionally, E&P operators and service company experts can monitor control panels remotely, to follow in real time the progress of high-risk jobs. One independent reports that they have avoided incidences of stuck pipe by utilizing this system, which they now use routinely. In addition to frac spreads and coiled tubing units, intervention and stimulation equipment business is a leading provider of nitrogen equipment, with over 1,000 nitrogen units in the field. It is a leading provider of snubbing units, with over 150 snubbing units in the field. We are a global leader in design and manufacture of wireline products for slickline and e-line applications, including critical pressure control equipment like wireline lubricators.","In fact, our Elmar brand has delivered more than 60,000 feet of lightweight wireline lubricator used to control pressure. With our enormous installed base of operating equipment, NOV is uniquely positioned to provide aftermarket service and repair as the OEM, and we have invested steadily in this opportunity. Everything we make in this area is experiencing higher wear and tear.","For instance, coiled tubing injector heads typically undergo a major overhaul at 10 million running feet. Five years ago, this would be two to three years of normal service. Today, our customers are hitting the 10 million running feet mark in a year, tripling the frequency of coiled tubing unit overhauls. With trained technicians in more than 40 locations across 14 countries, we have what our customers need, when they need it, and where they need it, precisely what our customers expect from NOV.","Today, aftermarket services and spares account for about 40% of the intervention and stimulation equipment business unit sales. Here, as in every other business at NOV, we deliver field-proven solutions that maximize efficiency, improve service and value, and increase our customer's bottom line.","Tuboscope, and intervention and stimulation equipment are two more terrific businesses within the NOV portfolio that are global market leaders that the oilfield relies on. Both provide mission-critical equipment and services to our customers' global operations. Both benefit from sustainable competitive advantage through scale and scope and technology and installed base.","Before I turn it over to Jose, I'd like to thank NOV's incredible employees. You may have noticed that we did not call out any impact from Hurricane Harvey in our third quarter results, despite being based in Houston with nearly 100 facilities on the Gulf Coast area that was affected by the storm.","Company facilities endured, for the most part, pretty minimal damage. Unfortunately, many of our employees were not so lucky. Fully 20% of our workforce live in the areas affected by the storm and 600 NOV employees were displaced from their homes by floodwaters.","Our thoughts and prayers remain with them and their families as they put their lives back together. I am particularly proud of the hundreds of fellow NOV employees who pitched in to help their co-workers, families and friends and neighbors by rescuing those trapped by high water by serving meals, by volunteering in shelters, and by pulling wet carpet and sheetrock out of nearly 140 employee homes. You worked very hard to take care of both our co-workers as well as our customers through this period. I've always said that NOV is a special place and it has never been more apparent than it has been in recent weeks. You folks are awesome, and all of you have my heartfelt gratitude. Jose?","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Thanks, Clay. To recap our third quarter results, NOV consolidated revenues increased by $76 million from the second quarter of 2017 to $1.84 billion. Strong demand for our technologies, products and services from our short-cycle land businesses in North America, along with growing demand in the Middle East drove our top line growth, more than offsetting continued challenges in the offshore market and other international land markets that remain stagnant.","During the third quarter, land-related revenues were 65% of total company and North America supplied 43% of sales. EBITDA improved $25 million to $167 million. For the first time in two years, we achieved at least breakeven operating profit for each of our reporting segments, but reported a consolidated operating loss of $7 million after accounting for corporate costs. We anticipate we will have positive operating income in the fourth quarter.","A few items worth noting related to the consolidated P&L. SG&A has ticked down another $1 million sequentially. Interest income increased $7 million due to an interest payment received from a favorable ruling related to a long-disputed tax assessment. Other expense increased $4 million due to FX. And our tax rate came in at 10% as expected.","Also of note, for the first time in quite a while, we reported no one-off other items, as restructuring initiatives reached at least a temporary pause. In the third quarter, cash flow from operations was $232 million, and after deducting $42 million in capital expenditures we netted $190 million in free cash flow, giving us free cash flow margin of 10.4%.","While we believe our free cash flow margin remains in the top quartile for the OFS&E space, we know we can do better. We're refocusing our efforts and taking actions to improve our management of working capital. We expect improvements in our cash conversion cycle, combined with our capital-light business model, will help ensure we remain at or near the top of the pack in free cash flow, and will ultimately help us improve our return on capital employed.","Our cash balance increased to $192 million to $1.72 billion at September 30, 2017, and total debt remained at $3.2 billion with nothing outstanding on our credit facility. As a result, our net debt decreased to $1.49 billion. During the fourth quarter, we plan to pay off a $500 million senior note that will reach its maturity on December 1, 2017 using cash on hand.","The overarching macro commentary for our rig business is that the commodity price pullback that began late in the second quarter, which saw oil prices fall into the low to mid-40s, and ensuing activity declines, caused our drilling contractor customers to retrench and stop spending on all, but the most essential of items. The result for us was deferred deliveries and a sharper-than-anticipated falloff in orders for new equipment, re-activation services, and spare parts.","During the third quarter, our Rig Systems segment generated $330 million in revenue, down $16 million or 5% sequentially. EBITDA increased by $2 million to $28 million. As disclosed in our press release, we agreed with a customer to cancel two jackup drilling equipment package orders in exchange for firm commitments to continue forward with several other jackup packages the customer has under contract, retention of down payments, and other consideration.","The agreement resulted in the deletion of approximately $100 million from the segment's backlog and a small gain that, along with outstanding efforts by our team to continue removing costs and improving efficiencies, contributed to the segment's sequential EBITDA improvement.","Bookings were limited to $84 million in the third quarter, as customers deferred several anticipated orders, including a large subsea BOP stack, into the fourth quarter and beyond. Among the orders received were several rig upgrade packages, five top drives, several high-spec well service rigs, and pressure control equipment.","We're encouraged by the continuation of robust dialogue with our customers regarding rig upgrades to improve the positioning of their marketed fleets and heavy quoting activity. However, we expect conversion of quotes to POs to remain very slow as tenders push to the right and as customers postpone decisions to upgrade until they have better visibility into contract opportunities that are slow to emerge in a near $50 oil price environment.","Despite our low bookings in the third quarter, we remain steadfast in our belief that $1 billion in annual revenue represents a draconian scenario floor for this business, and that the current level of order intake is incapable of supporting the large installed base of NOV rig equipment actively deployed around the world. We are optimistic that bookings will return to the $100-plus million range in the fourth quarter.","We also expect revenue out of backlog to pick up $40 million to $50 million as items that pushed out in the third quarter will be shipped in Q4. Margins should decrease by approximately 150 basis points due to a lower-margin mix of backlog deliveries and the non-recurring nature of the benefit received from contract terminations.","During the third quarter, our Rig Aftermarket segment generated $311 million in revenue, a decrease of $30 million or 9% from the second quarter of 2017. As I mentioned earlier, activity associated with rig reactivations and upgrades fell more sharply than we anticipated because of deteriorating macro conditions. The resulting decline in spare parts sales and falloff in our service-related revenue drove 47% EBITDA decrementals for a $14 million decrease in EBITDA to $69 million or 22.2% of sales.","Notwithstanding the overall sequential decline, demand for certain expendables for the U.S. land market continued to grow throughout the quarter, particularly demand for our pump expendables which reached its highest level since 2014. Additionally, we did see a 40% increase in the number of special purpose surveys. However, customers continue to reduce the scope and resulting spend of most projects as they seek to limit spending only to what is absolutely necessary.","Recent improvements in spare part bookings give us some confidence that fourth quarter Rig Aftermarket results should be in line with third quarter, and we expect this segment will return to a slow, steady pace of improvement in 2018 as customer inventories of spare parts are depleted, opportunities to cannibalize parts diminish, and visibility into longer-term activity levels improve.","During the third quarter, our Wellbore Technologies segment generated $693 million in revenue, an increase of $79 million or 13%. Adjusted EBITDA increased $28 million to $94 million, or 13.6% of sales. North America and the Middle East led segment growth, and we also realized meaningful top line improvements in every major region of the world outside of Asia.","We believe our growth in this segment continues to outpace global activity levels for three primary reasons. First, after nearly three years spent depleting equipment inventories purchased in a period of much higher activity levels, customers need to replenish their supply of the critical technologies NOV provides to help them drill farther and faster. Second, faster drill times result in much more aggressive consumption of the equipment we provide, and product demand increases with each additional foot drilled per day. And third, the rapid adoption of our latest drilling technologies is driving market share gains around the world.","We see compelling evidence in virtually all of our business units within our Wellbore Technologies segment that supports our belief, and I want to give a few examples this morning. In our downhole tools business unit, which designs, manufactures and sells downhole motors and other critical drilling tools, we experienced 24% sequential revenue growth in the U.S. as there appears to be an insatiable demand for additional motors and tools as scarcity builds despite a plateauing rig count.","Also supporting our outsized growth in our downholes business are our new products and technologies that directly contribute to our customers' ability to increase their rate of penetration and lateral lengths. Tools like our new AgitatorHE, which provides greater friction reduction than our standard Agitator tool to help drill long laterals more easily, is driving significant improvements in drilling results for our customers.","In West Texas, for example, customer drilled their fastest and longest 83\/4-inch section in Reagan County, realizing rate of penetration improvements of 74% while sliding and 38% while rotating, allowing them to drill at an average rate 79 feet per hour faster than a direct offset, which used a standard Agitator.","In Colorado, the AgitatorHE allowed another customer to drill with 22% less weight on bit and an 18% decrease in pressure drop versus the standard Agitator, significantly increasing rate of penetration and reducing wear on the bottomhole assembly and other drilling equipment.","As a result of the rapid growth in demand for motors and drilling tools, we've added third shifts to many of our North American manufacturing and service facilities, and we are even starting to add a fourth shift in certain facilities until we're able to catch up with the recent pickup in demand.","Within our ReedHycalog business, we're also realizing rapid market adoption from our recently introduced products and technologies. Our recently established directional drilling tools platform also realized outsized growth in Q3, as we secured multiple orders in key international markets for our Tolteq mud-pulse measurement-while-drilling tools and our Vector series rotary steerable systems.","Our customized drill bits outfitted with industry-leading shaped cutter technology continue to set field records around the world, resulting in share gains in key markets. Our new Chainsaw bit design features 3D cutters on the bit's primary blades that pre-fracture the formation, making it easier for the cylindrical cutters on the secondary blades to shear off the remaining rock, boosting the bit's rate of penetration.","After successfully trialing the Chainsaw design in the U.S. last quarter, we took the technology international, where we're already setting field records in the Middle East. And our eVolve drilling automation products and services are delivering significant improvements in drilling efficiencies and gaining more traction with customers around the world. We've helped customers realize drill time improvements of up to 50% and are delivering an unsurpassed level of insight into downhole conditions that lead to significant improvements in the predictability and consistency of drilling operations.","Lastly, within our drill pipe business, we saw revenue grow 17% sequentially. Growth that is certainly driven by depleted inventories in our customers' possession after several years of underinvestment in this critical product, and growth that is compounded by significant increases in drilling intensity as drill strings require higher-torque connections when pushed harder around 90-degree bends and through ever-increasing lateral wellbore lengths. Yet, our industry-leading technology has driven much of the recent growth we've seen in this business.","We designed our Delta premium drill-pipe connections to improve drilling times and reduce total cost of ownership. The thread design requires significantly fewer turns from stab to makeup than comparable connections and requires no stabbing guides, making it significantly easier to handle on a rig. The faster makeup of the connection is partially accomplished by deeper stabbing, meaning there are more threads engaged at the time two joints come together, which minimizes damage by more evenly distributing stresses on the connection.","After a few quarters of use in the fields of North America, the Middle East and deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we're pleased to confirm our claims of lower cost of ownership as we've seen re-cut rates of less than 1% after our initial runs on this connection versus an average rate of 10% to 20% for our prior generation, market-leading connections.","Even with the recent growth in our drill pipe business, we suspect there is pent-up demand in the system that continues to build with each passing day. In our Tuboscope pipe yards that Clay described earlier, we've seen customer-owned drill pipe inventory decrease by approximately 17% year-to-date, supporting our view that existing inventories will eventually need to be replenished in a material way. Though we believe customers have mostly exhausted their 2017 budgets and expect lighter bookings and flat revenues through year-end, market dynamics appear to be setting the stage for an inflection in demand during 2018.","Across our Wellbore Technologies segment, we expect to continue realizing growth that outpaces the broader market in the fourth quarter for the same three reasons I mentioned earlier; the depletion of NOV products and technologies in customer inventories, secular trends driving increased drilling intensity, and accelerating adoption of our latest technologies. Specifically, we expect to realize 300 basis points to 500 basis points of top line growth with stronger incremental margins than we saw in the third quarter.","Our Completion & Production Solutions segment generated $682 million in revenue during the third quarter, an increase of 5% or $30 million sequentially. Robust completions activity in North America and the Middle East drove strong demand for our intervention and stimulation equipment, fiber glass systems, completion tools, and process and flow technologies business units, partially offset by declines in our offshore-oriented operations.","In line with expectations, EBITDA margins decreased 80 basis points to 14.2% due to less favorable mix and FX benefits realized in the second quarter which, as anticipated, did not repeat. Specifically, our subsea flexible pipe, floating production and conductor pipe connection businesses posted lower margins sequentially in the face of continued offshore challenges. The segment booked $463 million in new orders during the third quarter for a 119% book-to-bill. Almost all business units achieved book-to-bills at or near 100%, and we ended the quarter with a total backlog of $974 million.","Favorable secular trends support increasing growth in our land-oriented businesses within the segment and we expect will continue to do so in the future. Rising well counts, longer laterals, growing number of frac stages, and enhanced completion technologies meaningfully increase service intensity and the strain placed on completion equipment.","The primary beneficiary of the secular trends in this segment is our intervention and stimulation equipment business unit. The business unit achieved a book-to-bill of approximately 154%, which, as Clay mentioned, marks the fourth consecutive quarter where order intake exceeded 100% book-to-bill.","Increasing service intensity combined with our customers' year-end rush to procure new pressure pumping equipment before Tier 4 emission standards come into effect more than offset cautiousness surrounding capital equipment commitments in the sub-$50 oil price environment.","This quarter, we booked two complete 50,000-horsepower frac spreads, plus an additional 37,500 horsepower of individual pump units, bringing our year-to-date total pressure pumping equipment orders above 400,000 horsepower. We also booked two coiled tubing units and a number of discrete pieces of pressure pumping support equipment, including blenders, hydration units and liquid additive systems.","Additionally, we received customer commitments for extensive pressure pumping refurbishment programs, bringing our committed refurbishments to over 100 pumping units. Our fiber glass systems business unit continues to see considerable demand from Middle Eastern markets. We booked our largest order ever of Fiberspar spoolable composite pipe in the Middle East. Customers there increasingly seek corrosion-free, lightweight, easy-to-install products for gathering and injection infrastructure systems. We anticipate regional demand for composite solutions will continue, which is why we're building a fiberglass plant in Saudi Arabia, where we expect to be up and running by mid-2018.","Our completion tools business unit also experienced significant wins in the Middle East during the third quarter. We successfully qualified and used our i-Frac CEM ball-drop-activated multistage frac sleeves and Burst Port System to help our customers successfully complete the toe section in a record-setting long string completion. Our completion tools unit also notched a few key wins in the Middle East for its recently introduced liner hanger systems.","The Middle East is also a strong source for growth for our process and flow technologies business, specifically for production chokes, water management, separation, and early production equipment. In the U.S., the business unit also continues to see growing demand for production chokes and processing equipment, which includes water treatment systems.","In the third quarter, we secured our largest value order ever for a saltwater disposal facility and we sold two of our WaterWolf Dynamic Oil Recovery systems. Our WaterWolf system recovers oil and removes suspended solids from produced water in a single stage of treatment using hydrocyclone technology that replaces using chemicals, filters or tanks. The system significantly improves oil recovery and reduces waste, improving economics for our customer, yet another example of how we help our customers lower their marginal cost per barrel.","Outside of bright spots in the U.S. and Middle East, demand remains muted. Because of low commodity price, large capital equipment purchases have been yet to manifest in most international markets and offshore. For the fourth quarter, we expect bookings will taper off as most of our customers' 2017 budgets are exhausted. The opportunity to secure Tier 2 pressure pumping equipment has passed, and commodity price outlook remains uncertain.","After several quarters in a row of strong bookings, this segment is well positioned to realize mid-single digit percent revenue growth in the fourth quarter. However, we expect business mix shifts and lower margins from our offshore-related businesses to push EBITDA margins down around 50 basis points.","We're incredibly proud of the organization's tenacity, having delivered five quarters in a row of improving results amidst challenging market conditions. While headwinds will persist in a $50 world, we believe the eventual collision between shrinking global oil inventories, steadily improving demand, underinvestment by the industry, and favorable secular trends will drive step-change improvements in our businesses. Until that happens, the talented and dedicated teams at NOV will remain laser-focused on making the most of each market opportunity, squeezing out every possible efficiency improvement, investing in compelling solutions for our customers, and enhancing the position of our operations in the markets that will matter most in the future.","With that, we'll open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company.","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company","Good morning. Thanks.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Good morning. Hi, Bill.","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company","Yeah. Hey. A question with regard to the frac booking outlook. If I just heard you correctly, you're waxing a little bit cautious with regard to the continuation of the strength that we've seen year-to-date, yet that was the same refrain we heard on the Q2 call and Q3 ended up being a very strong bookings quarter. So, apart from the dynamics quarter-on-quarter, I also want to understand if you guys, with regard to your discussions with frac service providers, envision an inflection higher with regard to the refurbishment wave and rebuild wave due to the wear and tear on the fleet.","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, Bill. It's Jose. Fair questions. I think throughout the course of the year, we have been pleasantly surprised by our bookings related to pressure pumping equipment. We've certainly gotten our fair share and the market has been more buoyant than probably we anticipated coming into the year.","However, as I pointed out, a couple of dynamics at play. First of all, little bit of uncertainty continues to linger in the market and now that we're \u2013 sort of during the budgeting cycle for pretty much all companies in the industry, things are getting a little bit more quiet as 2017 budgets are mostly exhausted and people are really starting to think more about 2018.","Also, the dynamic that I touched on related to a little bit of a pull-forward effect from folks trying to capitalize on a great opportunity to get equipment at a little bit of a lower cost in 2017 than what they will be able to get that same equipment for in 2018 as those Tier 4 emission requirements come into play. But the outlook for 2018 and beyond, I think, is pretty promising due to some of the secular trends of what we're talking about as well as what you touched on.","The equipment is definitely getting chewed up much more quickly. Folks, quite frankly, even though there was a little bit of a pull-forward associated to the Tier 2 emission \u2013 Tier 4 emission requirements, folks are still trying to do everything they can to not commit large amounts of dollars for capital equipment programs, so they're only doing it when they have to. And so that sets the stage for an equally strong, if not better outlook for 2018 and beyond.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yeah. And I would real quickly add, I think the mix towards zipper fracs is increasing and driving more 24-hour operations, which means the consumption of frac equipment continues to rise.","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company","Okay. Thank you. And then with regard to Wellbore, could you comment a little bit with regard to the sequential incrementals in Q3, super strong revenues, all the trends that you extolled were extremely favorable, but the incrementals were just a bit weaker in light of the narrative that you extolled and witnessed.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yeah.","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company","And then last one for me, just very quickly, Clay, you stoically chose not to quantify Harvey, but if you don't want to address the financial impact, which businesses could have been impacted the most from a dislocation standpoint and a disruption standpoint in Q2? And should that set up for a decent snap-back with regard to those incrementals in the afflicted businesses?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","This is highly anecdotal. I'm not going to quantify it for you, but we did have anecdotal examples from all the segments around impacts. But I know, for instance, within the Completion & Production Solutions group, we had some of our pump businesses had trouble getting components shipped in to the Houston area for assembly and then also had trouble getting finished goods shipped out.","What helped us a bit, Bill, was the fact that this hurricane hit over Labor Day, so we still had sort of 30 days left in the quarter to recover. And so I don't \u2013 I wouldn't plan on a big sort of snap-back out of Hurricane Harvey.","With regards to Wellbore Technologies, again, really strong quarter. What we saw in North America though with the flattening and then subsequent decline of the rig count, the sort of plateauing, I guess, of activity, was that we felt a little bit of a slowdown in pricing momentum in some of our business units.","For instance, some of our WellSite service businesses after getting pretty good pricing improvements through the first half of the year saw that sort of break over a bit across North America. And so that limited incrementals out of that business unit. We saw really good sequential improvement in drill pipe revenues, but we're also continuing to see the mix shift from offshore to land and so incrementals in drill pipe business were a little lighter.","So, net-net, that added up to diminish our overall segment leverage a little below what we otherwise expected. But I would add to the downhole technologies that Jose talked about earlier, the bits, the motors, the agitators, posted really good growth with really good incrementals overall.","Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company","Okay. Thank you.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Byron Pope with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Loren Singletary - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Byron? Hello?","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hello. Morning.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Morning.","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Morning, Byron.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hey, Clay, I've got a question about Wellbore Technologies and appreciate at the drivers footage drilled per day, but it's something that's tough for folks on my side to really quantify. So, if we think about the potential for, let's say, a flattish activity environment in North America, it certainly feels as though given what you've described, the tailwind for Wellbore Technologies should be that it should continue to outpace whatever that activity level is just given what happened in Q3. Is that a fair characterization? Just curious as to how you think about it.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Absolutely. Although we're looking forward to recovery and our resumption of growth, if we are stuck in a world for the next several quarters where, let's say, drilling activity remains flat, in Q3, we had globally 2,100 rigs running and I would tell you, I think they're being run harder than they've ever been running. And that's tough on drill pipe, that's tough on downhole tools. You've got rig operators that are pretty good at forestalling expenditures on spares for a quarter or two, but eventually their opportunity to cannibalize, to avoid buying spare parts, visually (45:50) that comes to an end.","And so even in that world, where we all just move sideways, I think our prospects continue to improve as our customers burn through a lot of the things that we provide, scarcity of returns, as we've said many times, that we're seeing it return to certain pockets and that drives future demand for NOV both within Wellbore Technologies, but also Rig Aftermarket, Rig Systems and our other businesses.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thanks. And then just one quick follow-up, also related to Wellbore Technologies and it's really more of a longer-term strategic question. NOV has long since been an enabler for the independent directional drillers and now you've got, I would argue, a very full suite of directional drilling tools, enablers for those independents. As you think about the opportunity set for that business going forward, is it more skewed toward North America, or maybe some of these international dealer (46:44) markets where we don't have nearly as much visibility?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Well, first, great question and thanks for pointing out that we are the largest provider of tools to directional drillers. But secondly, I really think it's both. Across North America, where most directional drilling is being performed today, it's being done without the latest, greatest technologies, things like rotary steerables, and I think there's more that can be done with regards to geosteering, and so we've got some terrific new developments, great quarter this quarter for rotary steerables and MWD.","And then overseas, you've got an opportunity, I think, to help directional drillers bring some of these shale technologies that have worked so well in North America and drive more directional and horizontal drilling longer laterals. There's a lot of interest overseas in what's gone on here in North America with regards to unconventional technologies and a real appetite to apply these technologies more vigorously to the rocks and basins on other continents. And so, I think that's going to drive future demand for what we're doing in Wellbore Technologies. So, I feel really good about the offering of tools and equipment and technologies that we have in this space to help drive that trend forward.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Very helpful. Thanks, Clay. Appreciate it.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","You bet. Thank you, Byron.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thanks for that. And I think, now, Clay, I understand why you recently spent so much time talking about Tuboscope.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","It's near and dear to my heart, Ole.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","It came up a lot in every meeting, so yeah. This Middle East stuff seems pretty sizable. Could you just \u2013 are you bringing out new products within Tuboscope that allow the adoption of fiberglass in a wider space than those previously kind of you thought of as application, is that it?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yeah. There's lots of things going on in both Tuboscope and fiber glass and those two business units work together to actually install fiberglass liners inside steel tubulars, which gives you a super high-pressure rating pipe that is also well protected from corrosion. And as we said many times before, corrosion is a big problem in the oilfield, so that's one way those two business units are working together. But within the Middle East specifically, we noted a very large sale of flexible fiberglass pipe into Saudi Arabia this quarter. And so, once again, here's another oilfield market that is adopting composites technology to manage corrosion challenges.","Within Tuboscope, as I said, we steadily invested in new capabilities, our RFID chip to enable tracking of drill pipe tubulars, for instance, is a great example. I didn't talk much about it this morning, but our Zap-Lok flowline installation technology, which is a mechanical flowline technology, is a real leap forward in terms of speed and efficiency with which flowlines can be installed. And so we really continue to enhance and invest in the technologies across all of our business units, Tuboscope, fiber glass as well as all the other ones that are here at NOV.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, when you look into next year and you think about the drivers of your revenues in Wellbore and Completion, both of which now are incidentally larger than your combined Rig Systems and Aftermarket. So, I mean, an impressive pivot to your company, I must say, but how do you think about the general recovery and just replacement of worn out equipment relative to the drive from new product lines?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Well, it's really interesting. There's a lot of things written and analysis done around big sort of galloping advancements and the efficiencies in this industry, and a lot of it takes a toll on equipment that is provided by Wellbore Technologies and a lot of it's opening up future opportunities for Completion & Production Solutions. And so I think we're really, really well positioned around these trends and continue to kind of turn the ship in that direction. But importantly, Ole, I would add, there's a tremendous amount of optionality that resides in our Rig Systems and Rig Aftermarket businesses as well.","Drilling contractors, both land and offshore, have been under financial pressures, that's taken a toll on our numbers. But as I said earlier, there's a limit to how much they can cannibalize. We're coming out with new technologies around equipment monitoring that will make that drilling equipment more efficient, new models on total cost of ownership that we put in place with some of our offshore customers, some rig upgrade opportunities. So, really across the board, we've used this downturn, I think, to enhance our offerings into what we think are going to be the most attractive and interesting markets in the next upturn, and I think the company is really well positioned for that upturn.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Now, I have a good news for you, Brandt just got a six handle on it and we've seen a bunch of contracts, particularly in jackups, I mean, up a lot over the past six months and we're starting to see contracts, although lousy day rates, but see contracts, nevertheless, for deepwater. So, this strikes me that in light of that, at least your Aftermarket business line right now seems to be artificially low. Can you tell us a little bit about at least the conversations you're having? And what you're seeing on a sort of three to six-month view?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yeah. Ole, I know you know a lot of drilling contractors and you know they're very good at tapping the brakes when oil prices tick down or they face a little more headwind in the marketplace. Q3, I think, reflects what we were seeing in Q2, which is oil prices wandering down, this sort of flattering of the rig count, a little more dire outlook. And so what we saw in the quarter was slowdown on spare purchases and on service around both land and offshore, but a lot of slower level of reactivations onshore North America.","What we didn't see was a slowdown at all of repair work and which goes directly into ongoing drilling programs and so that remained steady. We'll see how Q4 unfolds, but I guess the good news is very late in the quarter, we did see a modest improvement in spares bookings. So, that's caused some encouragement, but nevertheless I'll stick with Jose's earlier guidance, I think we're looking for a kind of a flattish Rig Aftermarket at this point going from Q3 to Q4.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Well, thank you for that.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, good morning.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Morning.","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Good morning, Kurt.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. So, you know what's great about you, Clay, is that every quarter, right, we really get a MBA in oilfield services business and I've started a book and when I'm done with this business, I'll share it with you, so you could publish it, how does that sound?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Good. Thank you, Kurt, look forward to reading it.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Anyway. So, just one quick housekeeping item and maybe kind of a little bit longer-term question is that, so Jose, on the sequential dynamics for the Rig Systems business, you gave us a couple of different components, not quite sure how that would map out, say, on a sequential revenue change basis, right? So, you gave us revenue out of backlog and you kind of gave us bookings, not quite sure how that backs into kind of the expected growth rate in the fourth quarter Rig Systems.","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yeah. I think you can expect the revenue that's not out of backlog to remain flat.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. All right, appreciate that. That's great. So, Clay, the dynamics that are at play, it looks like in the U.S. land drilling market is a push for the U.S. land drillers to become much more vertically integrated into the directional drilling process. Obviously, you guys have always been enablers of varying industries to buy more stuff. So, even with oil prices hovering around $50, the push-forwards for the land drillers to get more efficient, I would think, would bode well for incremental spend by these companies on this vertical integration. So, you guys have done a great job packaging offshore rig stuff together and packaging land rig. How do you see this entire \u2013 how do you see this playing out in its entirety?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","First, it's a great question, Kurt, and I think a great opportunity for NOV and I think you're right. You've seen some really interesting strategic moves lately, things like Patterson acquiring MS, getting into the directional drilling space. H&P and others, Precision making moves in that direction. We view that with a very high level of interest because these are customers we already have who potentially we can provide additional technologies and products and equipment to let them expand their businesses, expand the services that they offer.","I think, more importantly, though, really expand the value that they're bringing to the oil and gas companies. One of the observations that we've shared with these land drillers and others is that the oil and gas companies really are aiming at something that's slightly different than they used to aim at when I first got into the business. So, if you look at drilling, a generation ago it tended to be vertical, we tended to have drilling contractors for (56:57) rig zone location and drill as quickly as they could to total depth to drill a low-cost borehole.","If you fast forward to today, the land drilling that's underway really is aiming at something slightly different which is now a closely geo-steered well that lands in the sweet spot in the formations that doesn't have a lot of porpoising, doesn't have a lot of tortuosity, it's really a gun-barrel-straight wellbore and ultimately that's a higher value wellbore to the oil and gas companies.","I think it's within the capability of the land drilling contractors to move more into the directional space and deliver that higher value-added wellbore and NOV is here to help. And so a great opportunity for us. We're pioneering technologies to enable both directional drillers as well as traditional contract drillers to do that, and I think it's a very interesting time.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then maybe just one follow-up sticking to the land drilling theme, you talked about some things getting pushed and maybe some of the land drillers tapping the brakes. As you look out initially into 2018, what's the best guess on how many rigs, legacy AC rigs, you think could ultimately be upgraded to the super-spec capability?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Well, I'm going to \u2013 what I'd say is there's a clear desire that's evident in the marketplace for super-spec capabilities. AC rigs that are pad capable, have walking features, have high pressure mud systems, have a third mud pump, a fourth genset, more solids control capabilities and that's being expressed in the day rate structure. So, I think this industry is going to continue to evolve in that direction and so I won't hazard a guess on the number, but I think this fleet that's being employed across North America continues to evolve and we're here to help.","And the other point I'd make, Kurt, is overseas, I think if you compare the fleets across North America versus the land fleets in other regions around the globe, it's a really stark contrast in terms of capabilities and technology. So, I think sort of one of the next new opportunities for NOV's Rig Systems group is to upgrade those overseas rigs and then another great opportunity for our Rig Aftermarket group is to bring our new NOVOS control system across all these rigs.","We have a fantastic capability in terms of bringing machine automation and third-party developed apps and whole new ways of drilling through this NOVOS control system that we're pretty fired up about. So, again, a difficult quarter in the third quarter, but looking forward, I think, a bright future for our rig business.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, thanks, Clay. Appreciate it.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","You bet. Thank you, Kurt.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Q&A portion of today's conference. I'd like to turn the call over to Clay for closing comments.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Thank you, Kevin. I think when I reflect back on the third quarter, very instructive for our shareholders to observe that really strong growth in our Wellbore Technologies group, and Completion & Production Solutions group was really able to overcome a difficult quarter for our rig businesses and decline in demand for equipment spare parts.","Second point I would make is that this was really accomplished through meaningful wins in new technologies that we've been investing in for the past three years, so rotary steerables and MWD and completion tools and things like that really are driving higher demand. And then, number three, that was really also helped by the fact that scarcity is returning to the oilfield and these pockets of demands that are emerging, NOV is capitalizing on.","So, thank you all for joining us and we look forward to reporting our fourth quarter results in early 2018.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation.

Our use of the term EBITDA throughout this morning's call corresponds with the term adjusted EBITDA as defined in our earnings release. Later in the call, we will host a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions].","Now let me turn the call over to Clay","Clay Williams","Thank you, Loren. In the first quarter of 2018, NOV generated $1.8 billion in revenue, a decrease of 9% sequentially, and an increase of 3% year-on-year. EBITDA was $160 million, down $37 million sequentially, representing 21% decremental leverage to our fourth quarter 2017 results. Our performance was disappointing and less than we expected, leading us to announce preliminary results several days ago, specifically calling out some of the challenges we faced in the quarter. While some of these were outside our control, many were not. We were focused intently on improving execution, and this morning, I'm going to go straight into operations to explain what we're seeing and doing in more detail. And importantly, show why despite this slow start, we believe that 2018 is shaping up to be a much stronger year.","Wellbore Technologies revenues declined a little less than 1% sequentially in the first quarter, down $4 million to $711 million, but strong Western Hemisphere growth, up 7% sequentially, was obscured by lower drill pipe sales and lower sales in the Eastern Hemisphere. Customers continue to deploy excess drill pipe from stacked rigs to working rigs, which has kept demand low and contributed to drill pipe revenues declining 12% sequentially. However, that may be changing as our first quarter drill pipe book-to-bill exceeded 200%, reaching the highest volumes we've seen since the third quarter of 2015, helped by our new delta proprietary thread design. With more than 1,000 rigs operating in the United States diminishing excess drill pipe inventories and E&P companies beginning to speck our sophisticated thread design. The outlook for drill pipe has begun to brighten.","Excluding drill pipe, Wellbore Technologies North American revenues increased 7% sequentially, and Latin American revenues increased 6% sequentially, driven by stronger demand and share gains for downhole tools including bits, MWD kits, drilling motors and related equipment. As we've discussed before, NOV has directed M&A and organic development investments into tools to enable our customers to geosteer their wellbores to the sweet spot within the reservoir, and to drill straighter, lower dogleg well and encounter less vibration, torque and drag.","To this end, we're seeing more uptake on our 3 Rotary steerable systems product lines. Our MWD kits, which offer 3 different types of telemetry, were also seeing sharply rising demand. In the second quarter, we expect to run our patent and select shift adjustable downhole bit motor, which may prove to be the next-generation of directional drilling technology beyond rotary steerables. This new technology targets the cost-effective delivery of the perfect wellbore, precisely placed and geosteered to the right spot in the formation. The first quarter saw bits and downhole tools post strong double-digit gains in the Western Hemisphere, where we are benefiting from pricing improvements on certain products. NOV continues to enhance a downhole tool portfolio that can provide higher quality wellbore and more precise wellbore placement, which we see as key differentiators and profitability drivers for E&P companies.","We are also seeing steadily rising demand for closed-loop automated drilling optimization services employing heuristic algorithms in our proprietary Wired Drill Pipe. We expect to have 7 jobs running simultaneously soon in the Permian, Oklahoma, Alaska, Norway and Saudi Arabia. Higher levels of demand broadly for Wellbore Technologies and the strong North American market were largely offset by lower international sales sequentially, reflecting hesitancy by some Middle Eastern customers on spending money. Seasonal challenges in Russia and labor and currency devaluation issues in certain other markets. Nevertheless, with oil prices marching upwards, we believe we are seeing international markets slowly recover, and we are very enthusiastic about continued strong growth in the U.S. and higher margins.","So to summarize, through the downturn, NOV has a assembled a differentiated portfolio of the most effective downhole directional drilling tools, strong first quarter uptake in the busiest, most sophisticated directional drilling markets indicates we were on the right track.","Turning to Completions & Production Solutions segment. Revenues declined 3% from the fourth quarter to the first quarter to $670 million, but decremental EBITDA leverage was held to only 5% due to cost-cutting and the resolution of the subsea flexible pipe issues we discussed last quarter. The segment faced a number of unexpected challenges in the quarter, including the cancellation of a large order for the Ca Rong Do project due to the territorial dispute between China and Vietnam. Ex this cancellation, book-to-bill for the segment was 90% with most businesses reporting strong book-to-bills exceeding 100%, offset by very weak flexible pipe demand. Consequently, our flexible pipe revenues declined sequentially partly due to sluggish orders and partly because we ended up with pipe on the keyside that our customer didn't pick up by the end of the quarter, thereby deferring revenues into the second quarter. Importantly, the business successfully solved the technical torsion challenges that we described to you last quarter. Nevertheless, for the offshore products across the Completions & Production Solutions segment generally remain challenged, but higher oil prices and significant reengineering and cost reductions set the stage, we believe, for offshore FIDs to creep higher in 2018, which should lead to higher demand for our offshore products.","First quarter revenue for stimulation in fracking equipment declined as well due to the lull we mentioned last quarter of customers slowing buying on the change in environment standards related to Tier 4 emissions and to customers not taking delivery of equipment by the end of the quarter.","The logistical challenges in certain shale basins around labor, trucking, rail, proppant and general congestion are well documented. We believe that some of our customers are slow-rolling equipment deliveries because they may not have the cruise and logistical infrastructure fully in place to launch these new assets just yet. This is transitory, much of this equipment has already been delivered to the first few weeks of the second quarter, and our outlook remains strong as the business posted a book-to-bill well north of 100%, underpinned by very strong demand for coil tubing equipment. ","The segment's Fiberglas Pipe business also declined sequentially as a large shipment into West Texas did not quite make it there before the end of the quarter, but it is it there now, so we will be recognized as revenue in the second quarter. Again, this business unit is seeing strong demand, transitory factors like the West Texas order notwithstanding, and it benefited from a book-to-bill well north of 100% in the first quarter too, leading to its highest backlog ever, eclipsing the previous high set in 2014.","So to sum it up. The Completion & Production Solutions segment continues to struggle with lower offshore demand, but we believe we will begin to see modest increases in offshore FIDs this year, which will be additive to the strong demand we continue to see in composite pipe, frac equipment, coiled tubing and stimulation equipment.","Finally, Rig Technology segment declined 21% sequentially at 19% decremental leverage. Decrementals were limited by continued cost reductions that the segment has underway. Although we guided last quarter down for low double-digit declines for the segment, following a 20% sequential growth in this -- in the fourth quarter, the first quarter results declined even more than we expected for a couple of reasons. First, progress on new offshore rig construction was less than we forecasted. As the offshore newbuild rig market has deteriorated, the execution on certain projects has become more challenging because we rely on our shipyard customers and others to supply key functions to support our own operations. Functions such as rigors and welders, crane support, et cetera. With shipyards under stress near the bottom of the market, we find that sometimes it is more challenging to get the resources that we need. Our business has become bumpier and more difficult to forecast accurately as a result. ","We've seen this effect throughout the downturn, so this is really nothing new. It's just that we missed the forecast for this quarter. Second, like our other businesses, we also saw customers not pick up equipment by the end of the quarter on items like mobile rigs, which we suspect is related to, again, not yet having cruise and logistical support in place to initiate operations with these new assets.","Like our other segments though, we see an awful lot to be encouraged about in Rig Technologies. And while not calling bottom yet, I am convinced the segment is finding firmer footing in a new mix of business that reflects market demands in the coming upturn. For the first time since the downturn began, we saw a book-to-bill above 100%, with nearly 60% of new orders for land markets, including 2 rigs for the Middle East, and excellent uptake on new, organically developed drawworks product that targets the upgrade of the North American land rigs. ","After a couple of head fakes earlier in the downturn, some key Middle Eastern tenders are moving forward now. And since the close of the quarter, we sold 2 more land rigs into Latin America, where we see more interest for high-spec AC rigs from drillers pursuing unconventional drilling programs. We were also seeing rising levels of demand for upgrade equipment, and potentially for a new super spec rigs for the North American market, which is seeing higher day rates of late.","Like our other segments, Rig Technologies has used the downturn to enhance its technologies and products including introductions like our NOVOS control system, which is being specified by several major oil companies now and provides a platform for our Wellbore Technologies segment's closed loop drilling optimization service. The NOVOS systems open architecture facilitated the 15 different third party apps now available for drillers on NOVOS, and more are being written as we speak. We have finalized agreements with offshore drillers for more total cost of ownership contracts built on big data predictive analytics to improve their operational efficiency. And we saw a sharp increase in spare parts orders which may be signaling that contractors are diminishing their stocks of inventories and their cannibalization of idle equipment. Again, I'm not prepared to call bottom, but a 22% sequential increase in spare parts orders is pretty stout.","We're also encouraged by the number of special-purpose surveys that we are engaged in is growing in the second quarter and we think because offshore contract velocity is rising as average contract duration has declined. Contractors want to be in the mix to win new contracts and must have the rig certifications up-to-date in order to bid. Overall, with land rig demand beginning to grow in North America underpinned by stronger day rates with new incremental land demand emerging in Latin America and the Middle East, with higher spare parts and aftermarket order levels offshore and with new technologies like NOVOS and actionable predictive analytics products in the field, the Rig Technology segment continues to pivot steadily towards greater levels of prosperity.","On a consolidated basis, NOV's first quarter for 2018 was not strong. The first quarter is historically slow for E&P CapEx, and this year's budgeting CapEx felt especially tentative. We completed equipment that we didn't get off of our loading dock by quarter end, but I want to be clear, every quarter, we complete equipment and doesn't ship on time, so that is no excuse. We expect NOV to execute better, and we will, as we for, example, make additional cost adjustments like the closure of 32 more locations in addition to the 376 we have closed so far during the downturn. But my key message this morning is that we made good progress during the first quarter 2018. Just like we've made good progress throughout an extraordinarily challenging downturn to reposition NOV for the inevitable upturn. Within all 3 segments, there is a great deal to be encouraged about. We still have a long way to go and the first quarter results are a reminder that this industry is not yet healed. But the stronger, synchronized global economic growth, with oil inventory levels normalized and still declining, with customers running out of spares and consumables, and with technology proving demonstrably that horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracture stimulation could change the energy equation for the world, NOV is positioned well for the coming upturn and stronger performance as these year progresses. I'm confident our second quarter results will be much better.","To our hard-working employees listening, thank you for going the extra mile to take care of our customers. You make NOV special. And Loren, Jose and I appreciate you. ","Now let me turn it over to Jose for more operational color. Jose?","Jose Bayardo","Thank you, Clay. To quickly recap the quarter, NOV consolidated revenue was $1.8 billion, a decrease of 9% or $174 million sequentially. EBITDA declined $37 million to $160 million as decrementals were limited to 21%.","Looking at the line items of the P&L, as anticipated, SG&A increased $10 million sequentially due primarily to the nonrecurrence of certain credits realized in the fourth quarter. Interest expense decreased $1 million due to a full quarter impact from the retirement of our $500 million, 1.35% senior note in December. Equity income increased $3 million, primarily due to rapidly improving results in our post-Alpine joint venture which we realized a 14% revenue growth sequentially. Other expenses increased $40 million, primarily due to losses associated with FX and certain owned assets.","We reported a GAAP loss before income taxes of $63 million and tax expense of $3 million. The negative tax rate was a result of the valuation allowances applied to foreign tax credits and an increase in nondeductible expenses associated with the recent tax reform legislation, which prevented our tax benefits from fully offsetting income realized in a number of foreign countries. While we operate at or near breakeven income levels, relatively small changes in income by jurisdiction or discrete items will result in significant volatility in our effective tax rate's from quarter-to-quarter. We anticipated that incentive compensation and income and property tax payments would meaningfully reduce cash flow from operations in the first quarter. However, delayed orders and deferred deliveries further contributed to our increase in working capital resulting in a $129 million net use of cash from operations. ","As Clay mentioned, inventory that was expected to ship and translate into revenue by quarter end did not make it out the door and remained on our balance sheet in greater quantity than expected. We also invested $75 million in capital expenditures and acquisitions, resulting in cash balances decreasing by $201 million during the first quarter. While we're not pleased with the increase in working capital, we remain confident in our ability to convert our inventory and IRR to cash throughout the course of 2018, and expect our future cash flow generation to better reflect our market-leading positions and capital-light business model.","Last quarter, we described our philosophy regarding capital allocation. With the expectation that we will generate cash flow that meaningfully exceeds our near-term organic investment requirements. We highlighted that we would like to return excess capital to shareholders in the event that attractive investment opportunities did not materialize. However, we felt that the M&A environment was constructive, which we still feel is the case today. We expect to close several transactions during the second quarter, and we continue to see other attractive M&A targets in the market. This potential high return M&A opportunities likely differ an increase in return of capital to shareholder, but we will closely monitor cash flow generation and future cash needs.","Turning back to results of our operations. For the first quarter of 2018, our Wellbore Technologies segment generated $711 million in revenue, a decrease of $4 million. EBITDA also decreased $4 million to $103 million or 14.5% of sales. Strong momentum resulting from our technologies that helped customers more efficiently and precisely placed low torch velocity horizontal wellbores carry forward in Western Hemisphere during Q1, but this growth was more than offset by various slow start to the year across the Eastern Hemisphere, and the 12% falloff in revenue from our drill pipe business. ","Segment growth in the U.S. continued to outpace industry activity levels and we also realized strong improvements in certain Latin American operations, particularly in Argentina, which more than offset slowing activity in Brazil and Mexico. ","Overall, segment revenue increased almost 7% in the Western Hemisphere, led by strong demand for products from our ReedHycalog and downhole business units. No operational highlights of the dichotomy in demand from the 2 hemispheres is better than our downhole tool business, which realized 14% revenue growth in the Western Hemisphere and a 10% decline in the East, but delivered 8% sequential growth overall, with strong incrementals. ","Robust demand continued through Q1 for our drilling, motor and agitator tools and we saw a 20% step change increase in demand for coiled tubing tools as customers replenished depleted inventories and prepare to ramp completion-related activities. ","Demand for our drilling motors increased 8% sequentially, driven by the enhanced drilling performance provided by our products. We continue to see customers break drilling records when utilized our latest drilling technologies found in products like our Vector Series 50 drilling motor and ERT power section. These products working in tandem recently helped and operate a deliberate 223-foot per hour average rate of penetration on a 10,000-foot horizontal run in the Williston Basin. ","We also experienced the 10% improvement in demand for our agitator tools, driven in large part by our new Agitator HD product, which continues to gain greater adoption due to its exceptional performance. We've seen the tool enable operators to reduce weight on debt by up to 50%, while delivering 35% improvements in rate of penetration versus offset wells, less we are and increased speeds contribute to meaningfully reduce the cost of drilling operations. ","Our ReedHycalog business also demonstrated strong performance, realizing a 4% sequential improvement that was led by our bits and borehole enlargement operation in the U.S., which realized 11% sequential growth. We continue to achieve market share gains with our fixed cutter bits as a result of our ION-shaped cutter technology, which provides superior impact and thermal resistance for greater durability. Additionally, our proprietary-shaped cutter designs increased formation fracture propagation by concentrating more force on a defined point, improving drilling efficiency in tough formations. These designs have also been proven to meaningfully decrease the average size of drill cutting particles, significantly improving fluid dynamics, rate of penetration, bit life and the bit's ability to evacuate cuttings from the wellbore.","Our downhole measurement tool offering is also realizing market share gains and posted a 12% sequential increase in worldwide sales. Orders included 1 sale for 16 Tolteq MWD strings for the U.S. as well as orders for our newly introduced I series near-bit subsystem and NXT directional module. The near-bit subsystem places MWD tool between the drill bit and the mud motor to provide near-realtime data that originates inches from the bit. Significantly improving response time and enhancing the ability to stay within the formation's target area. The NXT module provides the ability to capture continuous inclination in azimuth readings. Realtime measurements at annular and internal bore pressure while drilling and stick-slip detection, enabling better drilling performance via realtime optimization.","Our eVolve automation and optimization services continue to knock strong 8% sequential growth and received several project bookings, which should drive even stronger growth from Q1 to Q2. And performance of our ReedHycalog and downhole tools businesses is indicative of the success we are realizing from our strategy to provide customers with better physical and digital solutions to more precisely and accurately place low torch horizontal wellbores at lower cost. ","Our legacy wellsite services businesses posted a 1% sequential increase in revenue. Strong demand for solids control equipment and services from increasing activity in the Permian and Oklahoma resulted in 6% top line improvement in our U.S. operation. This robust growth creates opportunities to begin regaining some pricing power in the U.S. WellSite Services also realized robust sequential improvement in Latin America from increased activity in Argentina as well as from new projects in other countries, which included a pipeline tunneling job that is using Brandt solids controls equipment and our portable power generators to drill 3-meter diameter, 2.5-kilometer long gas pipeline channel north of Mexico.","Like our other businesses in the segment, strong results in the Western Hemisphere were mostly offset by challenging conditions in the Eastern Hemisphere and offshore markets, with, Africa and Asia realizing the largest sequential declines. ","Our Tuboscope operation also experienced similar market conditions as other businesses within the segment. The challenges were further compounded by lost productivity in the U.S. due to weather-related disruptions in January as well as maintenance shutdowns impacted our coating plant in Midland, Texas.","As previously described, our drill pipe business experienced another sharp sequential fall off in revenue, but bookings exceeded our expectations, reaching levels not seen since 2015. While customers remain capital constrained, we are growing more confident rapidly improving fundamentals for this business and expect to see a material improvement in revenue during the second quarter. Improve prospects for our drill pipe business will amplify overall segment results, which should also benefit from strong momentum in the U.S. and rebound within certain Eastern Hemisphere countries. As a result, we expect to realize high single-digit percentage top line growth, with strong 40% to 50% incrementals. ","Our Completions & Production Solutions segment generated $670 million in revenue in the first quarter, a decrease of 3% or $20 million sequentially. EBITDA decrementals were limited to 5% due to cost-reduction initiatives and the resolution of manufacturing challenges that impacted our Subsea Production Systems business unit in the fourth quarter.","As a result, EBITDA fell by $1 million to $73 million. As Clay mentioned, bookings were generally solid for the segment, with most businesses reporting book-to-bills in excess of 100%. But weak demand for subsea flexible pipe and the cancellation of the Ca Rong Do project resulted in total net bookings of $324 million or an 84% book-to-bill. Total backlog remained above $1 billion at the end of the quarter.","Our Process and Flow Technologies business unit realized a 3% sequential top line improvement, and recorded a second quarter in a row with a book-to-bill greater than 100%. The business is seeing increasing demand for reciprocating pumps and midstream products, including closures and pumps for North America. Additionally, we're seeing growing demand for industrial pumps and mixers. ","Notwithstanding solid bookings for produced water, sand handling and gas dehydration packages associated with the Johan Castberg and Johan Sverdrup developments, the more offshore-oriented wellstream processing area of this business unit remains challenged. ","While we are generally seeing improving market fundamentals and an increasing number of FIDs, offshore markets remain challenging and we, therefore, see significant crosscurrents across this segment. As Clay mentioned, our Subsea Production Systems business units saw a sequential decline in revenues and soft orders as projects remain limited and competition is fierce for the limited opportunities that do emerge.","A bright spot within this business unit is the success we're seeing with the recent commercialization of our proprietary Seabox subsea seawater treatment system. The initial unit was deployed in Q1, and its performance has exceeded all expectations, garnering additional interest from other potential customers. The system also recently won an Offshore Technology Conference 2018 Spotlight on New Technology award, which recognizes the industry's most advanced technologies. Ones that are poised to dramatically change offshore exploration and help the industry operate more efficiently, safely and sustainably. ","Another bright spot among our offshore-focused operations was our XL Systems conductor pipe connector business unit. The operation delivered strong sequential revenue growth and solid bookings, driven in large part by ramping activity in Guyana. Our fiberglass systems business unit posted a sequential decline in revenue, primarily due to the delayed delivery mentioned earlier as well as limited market demand in the marine and offshore markets. Notwithstanding the challenges in the offshore area, we anticipate growing demand in the North American and Middle Eastern marketplaces for our corrosion-proof piping systems, more than offset stagnant after demand in the foreseeable future.","In the first quarter, Fiberglass Systems posted its third quarter in bookings over $100 million, and book-to-bill of over 100%. The bookings included an order from a customer in West Texas, for whom we will have provided over 70 miles of corrosion-proof pipe for a saltwater gathering and disposal system. ","As unconventional production rises, so too does the production of brine, enhancing the importance of saltwater gathering and disposal systems. Our corrosion-proof composite pipe offers a compelling long-term cost advantage over steel tubing and we see the oil and gas market steadily converting conventional steel installations to composite pipe for its longer lifespan and higher corrosion resistance.","As previously noted, our Intervention & Stimulation Equipment business units saw a sequential decline in revenue, primarily due to deferred deliveries of pressure pumping equipment as well as large wireline equipment deliveries that occurred in Q4 but did not repeat in the first quarter. Regardless of the softness in revenue during the quarter, we remain optimistic regarding the future performance of this business unit after realizing $120 million in bookings, making Q1 the fifth quarter out of the last 6 in which we have posted a book-to-bill in excess of 100%.","Notable in the order book was a substantial increase in orders for coil tubing equipment as well as a resumption of orders for pressure pumping equipment after taking a bit of a pause in Q4.","Looking at the second quarter, we expect to see a 4% to 5% sequential improvement in segment revenues. Crosscurrents will continue through at least the first half of the year, and we anticipate our pure play offshore business units will partially offset the recovery in our land-oriented operations, limiting operating leverage to around 30%.","Our Rig Technology segment generated $483 million in revenue, a decrease of $131 million or 21%. EBITDA declined $25 million to $45 million or 9.3% of sales.","Revenues from capital equipment fell by $110 million. In addition to slower-than-anticipated progress on offshore rig construction and deferred deliveries of equipment, we also saw a $23 million net reduction of revenue associated with new revenue recognition standards, which slightly alter the timing of when certain revenue streams are recognized.","The changes in timing also resulted in a $110 million upward adjustment to segment's backlog in Q1. ","Bookings for the quarter were strong, coming in at $201 million. The highest level achieved since the third quarter of 2015 and the first time we exceeded 100% book-to-bill since the second quarter of 2014. Clay touched on several specific highlights from the order book, but I'll provide some additional color on what we're seeing from a customer base.","Pent-up demand for more modern land drilling technology is bubbling to the surface with greater frequency. We've seen it in North America over the past 1.5 years in the form of equipment technology upgrade to achieve Tier 1 super spec capabilities. This opportunity continues to evolve and the average project scope is increasing for NOV, and as the easy-to-upgrade rigs have mostly been converted. We now see increasingly complex upgrades, including DC to AC conversions and upgrades that incorporate our newly introduced DSGD 425 drawworks. This dual-speed, gear-driven, 425-ton, 2,000-horsepower system was specifically designed for extended-reach drilling applications in North America.","We believe that steadily improving activity levels and corresponding increase in day rates support this more elaborate upgrades and will eventually support more new build opportunities in North America.","More importantly, we also believe we are beginning to see the early stages of our larger upgrade cycle in the international markets, particularly in certain Middle Eastern and Latin American countries. Capabilities of the drilling fleets in these markets are 1 to 2 decades behind us commonly found throughout the active rig fleet in North America. As a result, we believe the cycle in international market will be better characterized by newbuild rigs rather than equipment updates. We have long believed there is building pent-up demand for high spec land rigs in the international markets and that our agreement with Aramco to build 50 high spec rigs for the Saudi Arabian marketplace would be the first of many international newbuild opportunities. But such projects have been slow to materialize. While we are not prepared to say that we're at a tipping point, we are seeing more opportunities emerge in the form of tenders and spot rig purchases. As Clay mentioned, we sold 2 rigs just in Middle Eastern in Q1 and booked sales earlier in Q2 for two rigs destined for Latin America. We could also see several additional land rig sales over the remainder of the second quarter.","In our aftermarket operations, the seasonal falloff in service and repair-related revenue more than offset a $12 million increase in spare parts sales, which resulted in a $20 million overall decrease in aftermarket revenues. We're encouraged by what we are seeing in demand for spare part bookings, which increased 23% sequentially, and reached levels not seen since Q3 of 2015. While indications are hard that we'll see another sequential increase in spare part bookings in Q2, we're hesitant to call bottom due to the head fake that we saw in 2017.","Near-term, we expect the volatility in the segment to continue as we bounce along the bottom of the cycle. The booking-to-revenue conversion cycle, to shorten, as we continue to hold ample inventory for land rigs and equipment; and limited operating leverage, as we reward first-mover customers with discounts and convert to cash the inventory that has been slow to move during this prolonged downturn.","Specifically for Q2, we anticipate top line growth of roughly 20%, with incremental margins in the low to mid-teens for our Rig Technology segment.","So while we were a little slow getting off the blocks in 2018, this organization has a long history of executing extremely well. And we know we will perform better. While challenges persist, broader market fundamentals continue to improve, creating additional demand for our critical enabling technologies. We are also seeing more and more signs of a nascent recovery in international markets, and in more of our longer cycle product lines including drill pipe and land rigs. Our ability to execute in improving markets give us confidence that we will get back to our prior trajectory during the second quarter.","With that, we'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Byron Pope from Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Byron Pope","Just have one question. I tend to think of Wellbore Technologies, many technologies within that portfolio, is being early cycle in nature. And it seems like it's just a matter of time before we see the Eastern Hemisphere come around. So Clay, could you just frame, based on what you're hearing and seeing from customers with regard to inquiries, which regions or countries in the Eastern Hemisphere you would expect to lead the recovery there?","Clay Williams","Yes, Byron. We're currently hearing a more interest out of the Middle East. Of course, Middle East, through the downturn, has remained at higher activity levels and seen less of a falloff. But kind of what I'm hearing lately from, in particular, national oil companies across that region is they're looking to the productivity gains that have been made in the Western Hemisphere, and really focus on how to replicate those. And in particular, deliver the sorts of long laterals and highly productive wellbores that have been accomplished here in the United States, and so I think a lot of excitement there. Also encouraged by recent developments in Asia. That region, I think, turned down harder than many others in the downturn, and has been hit particularly hard. But in the last quarter or 2, I think, we're getting some more interest there, so that's encouraging. And then lastly, we kind of referenced this in our prepared remarks, a lot of people are very focused on, in particular the Vaca Muerta shale in Argentina, and recognize that newer and more modern levels of technology need to be brought to bear to that formation I think to achieve the sort of results that our producers in North America have achieved with unconventional. So again, there's a lot to be encouraged about in terms of the uptake for the technology NOV offers.","Byron Pope","That's helpful. And then just one follow-up with regard to the North America part of Wellbore Technologies. I assumed, based on what you guys are seeing in terms of footage drilled, even if we were to see the pace of incremental rig adds and based on the Permian slow, the trends that you guys are seeing with regard to footage, horizontal footage drill, I would assume, continue to progress in fairly conservative faction. Would that be a fair way to think about it?","Clay Williams","I appreciate you bringing that up, Byron, because as you know, is that Wellbore Technologies is probably more driven by footage drilled than actual well count. And the industry continues to improve productivity per rig. In fact, if you look at just over the long-term the footage drilled per active rig is up fourfold from where it was, say 30, 35 years ago, back in the early '80s, so steady gains being made there. But in a lot of ways, that just means we're consuming tools and rigs faster. It's, as I say with cars, it's not the age, it's the mileage. So that's really what NOV benefits from.","Operator","Our next question is from Sean Meakim of JPMorgan.","Sean Meakim","So maybe given the dichotomy you talked about between hemispheres in wellbore. Can you maybe just give us a little bit more granularity of what drove the decline in Eastern hemisphere? Is it just slow start to budget implementations in those types of markets? You mentioned drill pipe being a source of weakness, was that more weighted towards EH as well where the 2 connected, I guess, maybe the western side seem to make sense as you broke that down for us, which was very helpful. Maybe we could drill a bit more on the eastern sides.","Jose Bayardo","Sure, Sean. It's Jose. And effectively, the primary reason is really the typical slowdown that you see in the Eastern Hemisphere in Q1. So it's certainly not unique to NOV. I think maybe we were a little overly optimistic in terms of what the budgeting cycle might look like in 2018. If you'd recall back in 2017, with a slight improvement in commodity prices, you saw activities sort of continue to carry forward and build. This year, even though we had a better commodity prices and arguably a faster pace of improvement in commodity prices, we went back to sort of a traditional budgeting process, particularly in the Eastern Hemisphere. Let's say that we remain very optimistic about where things are headed in the Eastern Hemisphere, in general, a couple of quarters ago, we started seeing that area of the world come to life a little bit more for us. And that wasn't even a result of improved drilling activity, it was really more a result of the scarcity that just takes place over time as operators and service companies consume the inventories of the product they had on hand. So when people come back with those budgets, we are optimistic about what 2018 will look like as the year unfolds. As it relates to the drill pipe question, it's really, obviously, with the 12% sequential decline, it's pretty bad everywhere. But extremely encouraged about what we're seeing in terms of the bookings that we attained this quarter as well as the continued falloff in customer on pipe that we see within our Tuboscope yard. So feel good about where things are headed.","Sean Meakim","Got it. Okay. That all makes sense. On Rig Technologies, given some of the issues that you outlined, maybe you can you give us an update on how you see the cadence, what's in there today in terms of backlog? Perhaps maybe what you see as likely what you defined as likely 2019 and beyond? You said that the business has become lumpier in terms of the throughput, so that will be great just to get a little update on kind of how you see that cadence based on what you can see today.","Clay Williams","Generally, Sean, and you're very familiar with this, but our -- we've been working down our backlog of newbuild offshore rigs, which we entered the downturn with a lot of projects underway, and so those have sort of been diminishing over time. And as I mentioned, and again, in prepared remarks, maybe subject to a little more drama in terms of getting them completed in a steady fashion and being able to forecast progress and those. And what we're seeing now is the replacement of that with more land rig demand. So almost 60% of this quarter's orders for rig technology were for land rigs and we've got a pretty good start on Q2 with the sale of 2 more land rigs into Latin America, and outlook is brightening for demand there. And so what we see -- how we see that business progressing through the remainder of 2018 is kind of continuing to complete these offshore rigs and then pivoting to the land rig business, which we think is very promising for NOV. I think for next quarter, we are looking for about $260 million or maybe $270 million to come out of the existing backlog. And for the remainder -- or for the full year, I guess, 2018...","Jose Bayardo","900","Clay Williams","About $900 million to flow out as kind of the current -- currently what's in there. But as Jose mentioned, I think there is a lot of sort of building demand for better technology to achieve higher levels of productivity in drilling. And that really rests on a more modern rig fleet. And the rig fleet throughout most of the international markets is still a generation behind, really the super spec AC sort of capabilities that we have here in North America. And that will be the engine that will drive demand and results for rig technology.","Operator","Our next question is from James West with Evercore ISI.","James West","Clay, I wanted to dig in a little bit more on NOVOS. This is something you've been highlighting more and more. I got a chance to spend some time with your guys that have developed this, and I'm hearing from a lot of the -- at least several of the drilling joint contractors that they were very happy with the software. Could you just talk about maybe the penetration that you guys have so far with NOVOS? And then also, I'm curious of the 15 apps that have been developed and more that are being written right now, is there any types of trends that you're seeing with those applications? Or are they kind of all across the drilling spectrum?","Clay Williams","Yes, they're really kind of all across the drilling spectrum, James. And coming from all corners of the oil and gas world, so we have drilling contractors that have written apps, we have service companies that have written apps and we have major oil companies that have written apps, and in fact, we had a successful test on an app here in the first quarter from one of the majors that we're very excited about. And so a lot of interest in developing a specific applications that work within our NOVOS environment. And just to explain to listeners who may not be completely familiar, this is -- the NOVOS system is an operating system that operates drilling rigs. And it's an open architecture system that permits third parties to come in and write applications to control the rig in a safe environment, in an envelope that we define to execute their specific operations on the rig. It enables third parties to automate certain steps on the rig. And really what we're trying to accomplish with that software package is to bring more process control and automation to the repetitive actions that are done on rigs.","And so there are dozens, if not hundreds, of specific steps in the drilling of a well that are accomplished through a lot of manual steps executed by the driller and the crews. And so in many ways, drillers are really kind of rig drivers. And what we're trying to do is lift that profession up and make that individual more of a process manager and a team leader, less intently focused on driving the rig and more focused on kind of the work environment and the people to think ahead and to let the machines do the repetitive work on the rig. And so it's a really interesting development, I think. And the move here towards effectively sort of crowdsourcing rig activities and doing that in a way that it enables third parties to launch apps that underpin their services or their operations on a rig is pretty interesting. So not surprisingly, I think we're seeing a lot of interest in this and really good adoption. There's 1 large drilling contractor in particular that's been a good partner in this, and then as well as a number of other smaller joint contractors onshore. And now we are migrating this technology offshore this quarter. And there are a number of folks out there. And the last thing I would add on NOVOS, James, is that it's been noticed by the oil companies. And so we're -- I think some drilling contractors are experiencing a lot of pull on this technology and capability from their customers.","James West","That's great to hear. It's very exciting. And just one kind of unrelated follow-up from me. The Middle Eastern tenders that are out there today, which are some pretty big ones, am I correct in thinking that all of them basically spec in this new super spec type of land rigs?","Clay Williams","Well, we can always hope but not quite yet. We do have, again, there is a lot of interest overseas for kind of newer, more modern capabilities and technologies. But I would say it's still a mixed bag in terms of [indiscernible] over there. But the good news I think for NOV in the longer-term is [indiscernible] very aware of the technology of new super spec rigs. And so we are seeing some of these standers start to fall that in.","Operator","The next question is from Marshall Adkins of Raymond James.","James Adkins","So Clay, I'm sitting here thinking about this, I mean, we got oil up sharply last 9 months, Brent's at 75 today. Every U.S. company we talked to is out of equipment. And most of them have depleted their inventories, and I would assume that's the case for offshore as well. So what am I missing? I mean, Q1 seems to be very transitory in nature, and we should see a meaningful improvement in your business in the back half of '18, and really going into '19 given the later cycle and the lagging part -- the buying phase that you insisted. What's wrong with that logic?","Clay Williams","I think that describes it perfectly, Marshall. Obviously, as we mentioned, we are disappointed with Q1 but we do view it as largely transitory. The trends are intact. I -- the only sort of caveat I would make to what you just said is offshore, there are a lot of stacked rigs and so cannibalization continues. We did see a lot of encouragement in the first quarter around spare parts orders that point to maybe we're near the end. So I am a little hesitant to say that our offshore customers are out of spare parts just yet. One quarter doesn't make a trend, but certainly a really strong move on spare parts orders at 22% sequentially in Q1 is pretty solid there. But yes, I think you step back and look at how the company evolves out of this downturn, I think we would have all predicted it would start with consumables and a lot of quick turn items in Wellbore Technologies, which we've seen that pricing leverage would return around those product lines and then a little later in the recovery demand for capital equipment. And so far, we seem to be sort of on that progression.","James Adkins","Are you saying -- with the recent upward surge in the last few months, are you seeing more green shoots across the board in the offshore side? And you mentioned that the parts, but are you seeing more stuff on the consumables offshore, et cetera, et cetera? Has that -- have those discussions changed?","Clay Williams","Yes. But what I would add is that they tend to be more conversations and -- we're not seeing the purchase orders falling yet. And so the offshore has lagged, certainly, the North American land market and certain other markets around the globe. But what is encouraging is the number of conversations that we're having, for instance, around our new FPSO topside package initiative appears to be rising. We're getting some feed studies here and there. So yes, I think we are seeing some green shoots and $75 a barrel Brent is precisely the thing that we need to start turning those into purchase orders.","James Adkins","One last quick one for me. Free cash flow of potential seems to be pretty meaningful looking out to later this year and '19. Could you all just comment on your thoughts there?","Jose Bayardo","Sure, Marshall, it's Jose. Yes. So we continue to believe that we will generate an ample amount of free cash flow over the next couple of years. Obviously, Q1 wasn't great from a free cash flow perspective, as we commented. It was anticipated, but also magnified by the fact that inventory stuck around a little bit longer than we had hoped. So we still have the same goals and objectives as it relates to working capital. It is a huge area of emphasis across the organization. As we talked about before, our goal is to get back to historical norms in terms of working capital levels, which we look at as working capital as a percentage of revenue run rate. And what that means is that over the course of call it the next 24 months, we will be able to get back in the vicinity of sort of 35% range for that metric, which, if we do that and if we perform operationally the way we expect to, we'll realize ample amount of free cash flow.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Sill with SunTrust.","Kenneth Sill","Two questions that are kind of minor issues but interesting. Schlumberger is back talking about the rig of the future. They're going to deploy 1 in the U.S. and a couple internationally. Is that a project where they're kind of competing with your designs? Or it's just an alternative to your designs, but they use your parts? It's hard to gauge talking to them what their potential is and I'm just wondering what you guys read on that is.","Jose Bayardo","Ken, being a provider of rig equipment and complete land rig packages, obviously, we've been paying close attention to what they're doing. I think they're probably in a better position to comment on them than we are.","Kenneth Sill","Come on, you know they won't comment on it.","Jose Bayardo","To focus on enhancing our rigs, developing our rigs with features like the NOVOS control system, for instance, we introduced a new drawworks package to upgrade 1,500-horsepower of drawworks to 2,000-horsepower drawworks, which we think is something that is -- we're already finding actually that North American drillers find that attractive. We are kind of focused on our own rigs and rig offerings to the marketplace and can't tell you precisely what they're focused on.","Kenneth Sill","Okay. Another question, obviously, you can't tell us you're working on R&D, but with longer laterals, we're hearing people taking laterals out to well beyond 2 miles now, which inhibits the use of coiled tubing at the far end. Is there anything in the skunk works related to either an enhanced workover rig that's more automated? Or some way to make coiled tubing so it can get further out?","Clay Williams","Yes. So larger diameter coiled tubing, higher strength coiled tubing, we've focused on to reach further out. We have completion tools, including sliding sleeves where you can change the way that you access the wellbore further out. We are -- we manufacture well servicing rigs, which you join a pipe to reach out further into the laterals, and we're seeing higher, basically, customer demand for higher mass on well servicing rigs and more pumping capacity and kind of better pipe handling capability driving further demand. So yes, we're kind of all over that trend, including some hybrid units that we're developing to. And so in terms of accessing that wellbore, yes, there are several different ways that NOV is helping customers achieve that. I would add too that in terms of creating that wellbore, you heard on our prepared remarks all the things that we're doing with regards to geosteering, to directional drilling and drilling a straighter wellbore, including Rotary steerable tools and other directional drilling tools because one of the big challenges that E&P company faces, torque and drag is sort of cumulative as that lateral goes longer and longer and longer, so that becomes a problem further out and vibrations, and maintaining oil control and the like. So both the creation and the drilling of that wellbore and also the completion of that wellbore, we have a lot of things going on.","Operator","Our next question is from Marc Bianchi with Cowan.","Marc Bianchi","Again Jose, looking at the guidance here for second quarter, I suspect there's some proportion of kind of catch up from what you lost in the first quarter. Is there any way you can help us think about how much of it is just due to the catch up? And then how much is sort of the underlying performance of the business as we try to take a better baseline for modeling beyond second quarter?","Jose Bayardo","Yes, sure, Marc. I can't get into specifics associated with precisely how much slipped from 1 quarter to the next. But there are a couple of elements you got to consider when thinking about the impact to the second quarter and beyond. So certainly we had some of those equipment deliveries get deferred from Q1 to Q2, which will help the revenue in the second quarter. But the other item that corresponded with the deferred deliveries is deferred orders. So orders that took longer to materialize than what we would have otherwise anticipated, meaning a lot of orders came in very, very late in the quarter. So there's a little bit of an element of things slipping from Q1 to Q2, which boost Q2. And then there is another issue associated with timing of those orders that came in late in the quarter which will likely push what we otherwise would have expected in Q2 to take place in Q3. So it's a little bit of a mixed bag there.","Marc Bianchi","Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And I guess, another one for, maybe for Clay. If you guys are talking about the M&A potential now potentially putting on hold and kind of capital return. At the point you do get to thinking about capital return, how do you weigh opportunities for further M&A versus stock buyback versus dividend? And how does the level of stock come into play for that?","Clay Williams","That's a great question. And so, as we've mentioned in the past, kind of our hierarchy of attractiveness typically is around organic investment to support our ongoing operations and development of new technologies here internally. And then acquisitions of businesses to sort of enhance our businesses and to deploy capital in new attractive areas. And then the return of excess capital is what we look at and with regards to either through a dividend, special or increasing our regular dividend, or through share buybacks. And so as Jose mentioned in his prepared remarks, we're not prepared yet to increase our capital return to shareholders, but we are in close consultation with our board. And as the year progresses, the way we think we will, will be, I think, probably looking more closely at that, but we will be comparing it to our other potential applications of capital. The company has been busy on the M&A front, and we continue to see a lot of attractive opportunities out there. We had 3 closings in the first quarter and we've got several companies now that we're in the middle of discussions with. And so it continues to be a pretty interesting market for M&A. But basically, to answer your question, we sort of compare application of capital net direction versus either share buyback or an increase in dividend.","Operator","Our last question is from Jud Bailey of Wells Fargo.","Judson Bailey","A question on C&P margins. I appreciate kind of issues going on in the front half of the year in terms of mix, et cetera. How do we think about margins in the back half of the year assuming things progress as you think. Is it reasonable to think we can get back to kind of where you were 2Q, 3Q last year, kind of 14%, 15% type margins in the back half of the year if you start to see decent order flow return? Or help us think about margins in the back half of the year for that segment, if you don't mind.","Jose Bayardo","Hey Jud, it's Jose, I'll start with and Clay will add, if you like. Ultimately, it depended on what the revenue flow and what the opportunity set is. But the thing is, as you know, that's been creating challenges for us on the margin front are the cross currents and the decline in the offshore-related components of that segment. We think we're getting close to a bottom as it relates to those types of issues but we still think over the next quarter or 2 that, that will continue to be a drag on potential incrementals for that segment. With as we get into the back half of the year, certainly expect that business to start generating much more meaningful incremental margin improvements.","Judson Bailey","Okay. Yes, and my follow-up, I just wanted to circle back on the Rig Systems guide, pretty strong revenue growth but low incrementals. I apologize if I missed the explanation on that. But what's kind of driving the mix there with the lower incrementals relative to pretty strong kind of improvement in the revenue?","Clay Williams","Yes, what we try to describe there is a lot of these initial newbuild land rig sales that are going out the door, we have had, as you know, quite a bit of excess inventory sitting in our yards. And also our rewarding first mover customers with some pretty attractive pricing, so here we are in the very initial stages of the recovery of the land markets. We're anticipating less-than-ideal incrementals associated with those but that would be a very short-lived phenomenon.","Operator","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Williams for closing remarks.","Clay Williams","Thank you all for joining us this morning, and we look forward to sharing our second quarter results with you in July.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."],"15674":["National Oilwell Varco, Inc.

My name is Kevin, and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session with instructions given at that time.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Loren Singletary, Vice President, Investor & Industry Relations. Mr. Singletary, you may begin.","Loren Singletary - Vice President-Investor & Industry Relations","Thank you, Kevin. And welcome, everyone, to the National Oilwell Varco third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With me today is Clay Williams, President, CEO and Chairman of National Oilwell Varco, and Jose Bayardo, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin this discussion of National Oilwell Varco's financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2015, please note that some of the statements we make during this call may contain forecasts, projections and estimates including, but not limited to, comments about our outlook for the company's business. These are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws based upon limited information as of today, which is subject to change. They are subject to risk and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially.","No one should assume that these forward-looking statements remain valid later in the quarter or later in the year. I refer you to the latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q National Oilwell Varco has on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a more detailed discussion of the major risk factors affecting our business. Further information in regarding these, as well as supplemental financial and operating information, may be found within our press release, on our website at www.nov.com, or in our filings with the SEC.","Later on this call, we will answer your questions, which we ask you to limit to two in order to permit more participation. Now let me turn the call over to Clay.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Loren. National Oilwell Varco continued to face a very challenging market during the third quarter. The company reported GAAP earnings of $0.41 per fully diluted share, including restructuring, asset impairments, facility closure cost and other items of $112 million pre-tax or $0.20 per share after-tax. Excluding these, earnings were $0.61 per fully diluted share, down 21% from the second quarter of 2015 and down 62% from the third quarter of 2014 excluding restructuring and other items from all periods.","Third quarter 2015 revenues were $3.3 billion, down 15% from the second quarter of 2015. Operating profit for the quarter was $346 million or 10.5% of sales and EBITDA was $511 million or 15.5% of sales excluding restructuring and other items from both. Decremental operating leverage was 18% from the second quarter to the third, as cost reductions across the organization helped minimize the margin impact from lower sequential volumes.","A second major decline in oil prices from the high $50 range back into the low to mid $40 range since June has increased financial stress and led to a second round of rig activity reductions, sending the U.S. rig count down by almost 60% since late 2014 peaks. We expect to see further activity reductions and pricing pressures continuing into the fourth quarter. Visibility is limited, but we believe most producers will further reduce their 2016 CapEx plans after cutting spending significantly in 2015. The industry has not seen two years of declining CapEx since the 1980s, signaling the severity of the downturn we find ourselves in.","We believe many, if not most, North American producers and OPEC countries are producing existing fields close to maximum levels, trying to offset lower revenues due to oil price declines with higher volumes while sharply reducing drilling activity. OPEC and non-OPEC production are up year-over-year. This is not sustainable. Production will begin to decline naturally, as it has begun to in the United States. And therein lies the seeds for our recovery.","However, with swollen inventories, moderating demand growth with economic weakness in Asia and elsewhere around the globe and an uncertain trajectory for incremental oil exports from Iran, we don't expect recovery any time soon. Nevertheless, it will come. And our plan is to manage what we can, namely cost, through the downturn while continuing to position and strengthen our franchise for the inevitable upturn.","We expect to accomplish this through a combination of organic investment in new technologies and capabilities, as well as extraordinary acquisition opportunities that we expect to emerge. Through the first part of this downturn, we deployed $3 billion of capital into our share repurchase program, retiring one out of eight shares over the past year while maintaining capital flexibility through a $4.5 billion revolving credit facility. As the downturn has lengthened, we believe values of potential target companies will become more and more compelling. Thus far, it has been challenging to bring the bid and the ask on potential acquisitions into alignment, but we remain patient and disciplined in these discussions.","As we move into 2016, we believe sellers are likely to reduce their expectations and better capital returns on M&A will follow. Consequently, our capital deployment strategy is shifting from share buybacks to an external focus on potential acquisitions. This is a sound capital deployment strategy that we will continue to execute in a disciplined way. NOV closed small four acquisitions during the third quarter of 2015. The strategic goal of these and other transactions will continue to focus on cultivating market leadership in selected subsectors within oilfield services and manufacturing.","As we have said many times before, market leadership yields competitive advantage, economies of scale, purchasing leverage, the ability to leverage R&D and introduce new products through a larger revenue base, the more rapid accumulation of experience within a subsector, our global aftermarket support network, et cetera.","Our market positions make us a trusted, efficient, low-risk supplier to our customers. These are the types of opportunities that we look for. And the businesses we have built employing this strategy are leaders in their respective fields. In short, NOV represents a portfolio of market leaders with the deepest experience and the most expertise. Within these businesses, we have assembled discrete packages of equipment and services to drive higher efficiency in ways that our customers really want and in ways that really improve their businesses.","This means we take a view on where the logical boundaries of these packaged offerings should lie. Our acquisitions are of enterprises where NOV can be a better owner, to accelerate growth, drive efficiency and fully unlock their potential to create value for our customers and our shareholders. This view on product groupings or packaged boundaries rests on questions like: what products have complex technical interfaces that are difficult for our customers to manage, interfaces where a single vendor can and should undertake the management challenge, what proprietary technology can we build a logical package of products and services around, what trends do we see amongst customers as they all seek to reduce cost and risk around their operations.","The development of our corporate strategies within our business units guides both our M&A strategy, as well as our research and development strategy; both work in concert. In the near-term, we will continue to focus on managing costs to the marketplace and our shallow decremental margins speak to the great job NOV's business unit managers have done in this effort. SG&A is down 34% year-on-year and down 15% sequentially. Rig Systems posted decremental leverage of 28% on a 23% sequential sales decline. Rig Aftermarket held operating profit flat despite unexpectedly high 13% revenue decline. Wellbore Technologies held decrementals to 21% despite a 13% sequential sales decline. And Completion & Production Solutions held decrementals to 24% in the face of a 9% sales decline.","I'm extraordinarily grateful to these business leaders who are skillfully reducing our capacity, managing costs and leading our core team through this challenging time. They're providing their teams with a vision of better days ahead to make sure that our folks see the prosperity that will follow for NOV. That's critical in a downturn. We are fundamentally a service business, even in our manufacturing units. And ensuring our workforce continues with our long tradition of taking care of our customers and not getting distracted during stormy weather is critical. I want all of our employees to know that I am very proud of what you are doing.","Difficult market conditions will persist for the foreseeable future. We supply a highly capital intensive industry and have benefited from decade-plus period of retooling with improved levels of technology and automation. But the industrial transformation is far from over. Our view is that we are currently in a cyclical pause. Recent oversupply of oil exacerbated by weak economic demand growth has demonstrated the power of newer, more capable rigs and completion equipment and techniques. During such a cyclical pause, our biggest competitor becomes the overhang of products and consumables and equipment that our customers cannibalize extremely effectively in their Darwinian quest to preserve cash.","The idle rigs and pressure pumping fleets and wireline units and myriad of other items we sell are being systematically stripped of spare parts and components to keep the much smaller fleet of units that remain under contract working.","This remains a highly capital equipment consumptive industry. The life expectancy of mechanical equipment is tied to the footage it drills or the volume of profit it pumps. The ability of the industry to increase borehole created per year or stages fracked per year means that the physical consumption of mechanical equipment per year has also risen sharply, probably linearly. NOV will be called upon again to resume capitalizing the critical fleets of equipment required to supply a growing population with rising energy needs once we've passed through this cyclical downturn. And as I said, we will emerge better and stronger.","Our Completion & Production Solutions segment held operating margins of nearly 8% despite a 9% sequential sales decline. The group benefited from strong performance from our floating production unit and our flexible subsea pipe unit in the quarter.","We also posted good orders in the quarter, helped by a large deepwater flexible pipe order arising from our proprietary heated pipe solution. This resulted in an ending backlog level of $1.2 billion. We expect orders to decline in the fourth quarter as the market faces an overhang of fracture stimulation equipment across North America and as operators seem in no hurry to sanction any deepwater developments at the moment.","Nevertheless, we are engaged in several FEED studies around the globe and meeting with a lot of operator interest in standardized, more industrial, efficient solutions to improve deepwater development economics. We're encouraged by a handful of public statements from major oil companies on meaningful double-digit cost reductions on deepwater projects, driven by the combination of design simplification, supplier participation in design and supply-chain deflation; fit-for-purpose solutions rather than \"perfect\" solutions.","We continue to develop new products within the group in areas like composites, spoolable piping systems for corrosive produced fluids. In fact, we shipped our first string of spoolable composite pipe into Saudi Arabia this quarter. And we expect to install our first string of our proprietary SmartPipe for shallow well dewatering in Australia in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, with 30%-plus declines in prices for steel pipe have made steel pipe more competitive for our composite pipe unit. However, as fields mature and water cuts rise, we expect our customers to gravitate to our corrosion-proof solutions. We were also pleased to see higher sales of coiled tubing in the quarter on gains with key accounts and our new service center in the Northeast pulling sales through.","Our Wellbore Technologies group is driven by rig activity and we're now facing a second rising wave of price pressure across all our products and services as rig activity declines. The group saw demand for almost all of its products and services decline, except for our IntelliServ Wired Drill Pipe technology, which has seen growing interest form operators in conjunction with our automated drilling solutions. This technology enables micro-second data from downhole sensors to control rig machinery much more effectively than human drillers and increases rates of penetration significantly. We have several programs scheduled to spud with this later this year and into 2016, and are excited about the transformative capabilities of high-speed data from the bottom of the well.","New bit technologies we've introduced are helping drive market share gains and we are pressing forward with new products in managed pressure drilling and wide-catch fishing tool technologies. The operation of our test rig is helping accelerate time to market for many new products and new condition-monitoring technologies.","We've seen our customers aggressively reposition and utilize their own fleets of equipment wherever possible to preserve cash and our mix of drilling tools shift from sales to rentals as a result. The demand for drillpipe has been very weak, as drillers cannibalize strings from idled rigs to support working rigs, but we have reduced capacity to match the current market. Our Tuboscope unit has held up reasonably well, as its work has shifted from drillpipe to linepipe and tubing.","The Rig Aftermarket segment declined 13% sequentially as more and more rigs went idle and became fresh sources of spare parts for their owners, driving sales of spare parts and manifolds lower. Nevertheless, the group held operating profit flat and operating margins increased 350 basis points. We saw our count of SPS projects on offshore rigs flatten this quarter after increases through the first half, as many planned-for reactivation and recertification programs are being shelved by drillers due to growing concerns about the near-term outlook for offshore rig demand.","Nevertheless, SPS activity is up year-over-year and we are also seeing rising inquiries around maintenance services we can provide on stacked rigs.","Rig Systems demand remains weak overall and we are downsizing to address this reality. We still see certain markets moving into the 21st Century to employ proven technologies: Argentina, the CIS, the Middle East, and we are aggressively pursuing these opportunities. We also know many North American drillers plan to continue to high-grade their fleets to AC Tier 1 capabilities once prosperity returns. Orders in Rig Systems included land rigs for international markets and two jackup packages and were up modestly from the second quarter, resulting in an ending backlog of $8 billion for the group.","We expect orders to remain low through 2016, with scheduled outflows from backlog will be in the $2.4 billion range. Those are orders that are scheduled right now in the backlog. In certain instances, we continue to work with customers to systematically delay deliveries of rigs, which is improving our project margins as we are able to reduce overtime and source components more efficiently.","Brazilian rigs totaled $3 billion of the $8 billion in our September 30 backlog and accounted for only $53 million in revenues during the third quarter. As we reported previously, we have suspended or delayed work on certain of these 22 rigs. Our shipyard customers who are continuing to work with their customers, Sete, to address overdue funding needs and future funding to move the projects forward. In the meantime, we are reducing costs in-country.","Within Rig Systems, third quarter revenues associated with new offshore rigs, both floaters and jackups, totaled $860 million or 26% of consolidated revenues during the third quarter. While we expect some new specialized offshore rigs to be built by the industry over the next couple years and we are developing new designs and capabilities around these, we do not expect the level of building that we have seen over the past decade to resume for quite awhile. Like many, we're awaiting an increase in scrapping of older units across the fleet, which seems inevitable at this point.","Finally, I'm delighted to welcome our Chief Financial Officer, Jose Bayardo to our team. Many of you know Jose from his time at Complete Production Services and, more recently, at Continental Resources. Let me turn it over to Jose to discuss our third quarter performance and outlook in more detail. Jose?","Jose A. Bayardo - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Clay. It's great to be here with everyone this morning. Our Rig Systems segment generated revenue of $1.5 billion, down 23% from the $1.9 billion earned last quarter and down 44% from the $2.7 billion all-time high revenue generated from the segment in the third quarter of 2014.","Revenue out of backlog was $1.3 billion, down 24% sequentially, in-line with total revenue for the segment. Revenues declined as we continued to adjust our project schedules and manage output to navigate effectively through fewer orders of lower backlog and customer-requested delivery delays on certain projects. For Q3, the split between offshore and land-related revenue was 78% and 22%, respectively.","Operating profit, as adjusted per the reconciliations in our earnings release for the Rig Systems segment, was $275 million, yielding operating margins of 18.4%, down 210 basis points from Q2. Decremental operating profit margins were 27.6% sequentially and 22% year-over-year. Low decremental margins demonstrate the effectiveness of our efforts to improve process efficiencies and resize the business to anticipated production levels. EBITDA was $300 million or 20.1% of sales and EBITDA margins decreased 160 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2015.","During the third quarter, we received $367 million in new orders, resulting in a book-to-bill of 28%. Orders for the quarter were fairly evenly weighted across offshore and land and included two high-spec jackup drilling equipment packages and two 3,000 horsepower land rigs for the Middle East. FX adjustments of $77 million resulted in quarter-ending backlog of $8 billion, down 11% sequentially, of which approximately 90% is offshore and 93% is destined for international markets.","We expect orders to remain subdued as activity continues to decline on land and offshore and uncertainty regarding the timing of a recovery persists. We are seeing some demand for a few jackups from NOCs. And while opportunities for floaters are generally scarce, meaningful conversations on 20kpsi floaters and other application-specific rigs continue.","As we move into the fourth quarter of 2015, we expect total Rig Systems revenue to decline approximately 10% into the $1.3 billion range and revenue out of backlog to decrease to about $1.1 billion, as we see reductions in new order activity work through existing projects and work with customers to accommodate certain requests to extend delivery dates.","Resizing the business to reflect market activity remains critical to margin preservation and we will continue to focus on cost reduction opportunities, including process, efficiencies, vendor pricing and facility consolidations to better align our resources with anticipated production levels. That said, cost control will not be enough to fully offset the impact of lower volumes and we anticipate segment margins will decline into the mid-teens during the fourth quarter.","Despite the current challenges and customer capital constraints, longer-term fundamentals remain solid for our Rig Systems segment. Land rig customers continue to show a strong preference for rigs which utilize the latest technologies to most efficiently and precisely drill longer lateral wells from multi-well pads. And offshore exploration and production companies are committed to utilizing new rigs and equipment that enhance their ability to more safely and economically access hydrocarbons in increasingly challenging environments. NOV will continue to make long-term investments in the development of the best technological solutions that provide industry-leading quality and reliability to most effectively address the needs of our customers.","Our Rig Aftermarket segment generated revenues of $570 million during the third quarter of 2015, down 13% sequentially and down 32% year-over-year, driven by lower spare part sales as drilling contractors continue to focus on reducing their expenditures amid activity declines. The reduction in spare part sales was partially offset by a slight increase in service-related work. Despite the low-teens revenue decline, the segment maintained flat operating profit at $146 million, resulting in operating margins of 25.6%, a 350 basis point improvement sequentially due to effective cost controls and inventory charges incurred in the second quarter which did not repeat.","EBITDA was $154 million or 27% of sales. Consistent with the second quarter, land-related sales were approximately 22% of total segment revenues. Near-term, we expect the segment will continue to ebb and flow as our customers try to identify the bottom of this current cycle.","As we move into the fourth quarter, we believe the pick-up in service and repair revenue we have seen the last quarter of prior years will be much more modest this year, as uncertainty leads to more cautionary spending by our customers. However, we do anticipate Rig Aftermarket revenues will be up slightly in comparison to Q3. Operating margins are expected to be similar to the third quarter, as increases resulting from incremental revenues will be offset by product mix.","In our Rig businesses, we distinguish ourselves through service after the sale. We are committed to the success of our customers and driven by a sense of urgency in maintaining and supporting our equipment and technology in the field. The capabilities of our global service network are unrivaled.","The mid to long-term outlook for the Rig Aftermarket segment remains bright and we anticipate sales will begin to improve as soon as customers work through their limited existing inventories of spare parts. We also anticipate the improvement will accelerate once overall industry activity levels begin to increase, causing a rush to return sub-optimally maintained, stacked and partially cannibalized rigs to proper operating conditions.","For the third quarter of 2015, Wellbore Technologies segment generated revenues of $834 million, down 13% sequentially and down 43% compared to the third quarter of 2014. Almost all business units within the segment were impacted by the overall decrease in drilling activity levels, with production-oriented businesses realizing slightly better performance.","Customer interest continues to grow in our technologically advanced products and services, which reduce drill times and lower operating costs, such as our Tectonic Drill Bits, ConneXion Drilling Performance Software and our SoftSpeed stick-slip prevention services. One of our Tectonic Bits was recently paired with our HellCat Motor and Agitator drill system to drill a 2.5-mile long lateral in the Bakken in what we and our customer believe to be a record time of 4.5 days.","Operating profit for the third quarter was $22 million or 2.6% of sales, down 230 basis points from last quarter. Sequential decrementals were limited to 20.5% as we continue to focus on expense reduction and process efficiencies to develop a leaner cost structure for the business. Q3 EBITDA was $119 million, or 14.3% of revenue.","Looking into the fourth quarter of 2015, many of our North American customers are bracing for a further fall-off in activity during what they anticipate will be a prolonged year-end holiday slowdown. Fewer rigs running will result in weaker demand for Wellbore Technologies' products and services, and we are seeing a new wave of pricing pressure which may offset our cost reduction efforts. As such, we believe revenues in our Wellbore Technologies segment will decline in the mid to high-single percentage range, with decremental margins in the mid-20%s.","Longer term, we anticipate continued market share gains from our advanced products and services designed to enable the drilling of more complex, productive and safer wells at a faster rate, thereby enhancing the economics. We believe our strategy to help our customers achieve their objectives succeeding and we will continue to invest in solutions our customers value today and which will further enhance our position for the eventual recovery.","Our Completions & Production Solutions segment generated revenues of $798 million for the third quarter 2015, down 9% sequentially and 33% compared to the third quarter of 2014. Revenues declined across most businesses on lower backlogs and customers delaying pick-up of finished work, with some offset coming from higher sales of floating production-related equipment and flexible pipe.","We also saw increased coiled tubing sales, as our investments in placing tubing centers closer to our customers' operations enable us to provide better service. Operating profit for the segment was $63 million, resulting in operating margins of 7.9%, down 140 basis points sequentially and 750 basis points year-over-year.","Sequential decrementals were 24% and third quarter EBITDA for the segment was $117 million or 14.7% of sales. Operating margins were negatively impacted by volume, pricing pressure and product mix, but most cost control initiatives helped to offset some of the margin decline, resulting in improved decrementals versus prior quarters.","Turning to our capital equipment orders and resulting backlog for the Completion & Production Solutions, the third quarter saw a much improved order intake of $467 million. That's an increase of $212 million or 83% sequentially, led by improved bookings for floating production-related equipment and fiberglass pipe, as well as a large order for subsea flexible pipe.","We recognized $472 million of revenue out of backlog, resulting in a book-to-bill of 99%. Of the $1.2 billion backlog at quarter-end, approximately 76% is offshore and 86% is international. As we move into the fourth quarter, we anticipate demand for new pressure pumping and coiled tubing units, especially in North America, will remain low. While customer interest remains elevated for NOV's more cost-effective solutions in the FPSO space, near-term we anticipate a general slowing in prospect development due to the current commodity price environment.","We believe revenues will decrease by a mid-single digit percentage, and expect revenue out of backlog to remain in the $450 million to $470 million range. Margins should move down slightly on lower volumes.","Now let's discuss some additional detail regarding our consolidated financial statements. Working down the Consolidated Statement of Income for the third quarter, gross margin declined 110 basis points to 21.2%. SG&A decreased 15% or $63 million sequentially due to cost reductions and was 10.7% of revenue. Other items of $112 million for the quarter resulted primarily from a $55 million pre-tax intangible asset impairment as well as a $57 million pre-tax charges associated with severance, facility closures and other costs.","Equity income fell to breakeven as demand for OCTGs, or Green Tube, associated with our Voest-Alpine joint venture remains muted, given the low demand for new drillpipe. Other expense for the quarter decreased $10 million sequentially to $20 million, due primarily to a reduction in foreign exchange-related losses relative to the second quarter of 2015.","The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 18.8%, down from the 26.9% rate posted in the second quarter of 2015. Excluding the impact of our $112 million in other items, the effective tax rate would have been approximately 24%, reflective of a continuing high mix of income from low-rate foreign jurisdictions. EBITDA for the third quarter excluding other items was $511 million or 15.5% of sales.","Turning to the balance sheet; working capital excluding cash and debt totaled $5.9 billion at September 30, 2015, down $206 million or 3% sequentially. The decrease in working capital was primarily the result of a $222 million reduction in inventory levels, a $151 million reduction in accounts receivable, an $88 million increase in accrued taxes and a $10 million decrease in customer financings, which is the net of prepayments and billings in excess of costs against costs in excess of billings.","The reductions in working capital were partially offset by decreases in accrued liabilities and accounts payable. While we were pleased to see total working capital decrease and we anticipate the pace of cash flow generation from working capital will increase as we move forward, we continue to manage several items impacting our efforts to reduce the capital employed in our business, including in-sourcing of machining hours, which increases our inventory by bringing in raw materials which otherwise would have been held by third-party vendors, customers looking to delay equipment deliveries and extend payment terms and our Rig Systems backlog and its associated customer financings.","Regarding the financings, as projects approach their completion, we do anticipate the spread between prepayments and costs in excess of billings to narrow, further contributing to a future reduction in working capital.","For the quarter, the company generated $410 million in cash flow from operations. Offsetting this cash flow were share repurchases of $444 million, dividend payments of $174 million, investments in our business of $124 million and FX impact on our cash balances and other items totaling $44 million. The net impact of our cash flow for the quarter was a $376 million increase in net debt. However, total debt decreased $322 million, as we successfully repatriated $1.1 billion to the U.S.","We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.8 billion, $4 billion in debt and our net to debt capitalization was 11.8%. While we remain focused on managing costs and improving efficiencies, we believe the strength of our enterprise uniquely positions NOV to capitalize on compelling acquisition opportunities that will emerge in this downturn and to continue investing in the development of technologies that will help our customers improve their economics.","With that, we'd like to turn it open to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","Our first question comes from David Anderson of Barclays.","J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, thanks. So, Clay, I was struck by the commentary. You said extraordinary opportunities rising from this downturn. Can you help me understand a little bit of how you're thinking about this? You have a lot of product lines out there. Are you talking about adding new product lines or do they expand out the current ones?","And I guess I'm also wondering, are you willing to look outside of the traditional upstream oil and gas market, or do you see other opportunities potentially emerging, say maybe midstream, downstream or maybe even industrials?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, David, I'm going to stay away from getting too specific, but I will tell you we take a pretty broad view and look both at enhancing our existing product lines. We report four reporting segments and those are comprised really of 15 business units that make those up. And I would say all 15 we continually look for opportunities to enhance and expand.","And then beyond that, the great thing about oilfield services is it's composed of dozens and dozens and dozens of interesting subsectors. And so we're continually looking across those for opportunities to deploy capital and develop our business.","We also have some great industrial product lines and businesses in markets that we serve. Usually those are characterized by some sort of overlapping competence that that we have in the oilfield. We make a product, for instance, if the oilfield needs it, it also goes into other industrial segments. So usually there is some sort of overlap or synergy that's embedded in those sort of opportunities. But, yeah, we're taking a very expansive view.","The reason for the comments obviously is a lot of parts of \u2013 well, really all parts of oilfield services and manufacturing are under stress in the current environment and landscape shifting. And so at the low points in the cycle is where we frequently see the best opportunities. And as you know, we have a long history of executing acquisitions. And both National Oilwell and Varco came out of private equity roots. And through the years, between our two organizations, we came together about 10 years ago, we've done probably in excess of 300 transactions. So this is becoming a buyer's market and we're pretty excited about that.","J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Now, Clay, you mentioned three smaller acquisitions during the quarter. Can you just help us understand a little bit where those fit in? Obviously, you didn't announce any numbers here behind it. But just maybe just more qualitatively what these businesses are?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, actually it was four, David. And they are between our Wellbore Technologies and our Completion & Production Solutions; both those segments picked up smaller deals. And these are the sort of bolt-on things that we do continuously here. I think in last quarter I mentioned we had a half dozen or so Letters of Intent out there, and this was a completion of four of those. And we still have a number of smaller things that we're looking at. But as we move into this kind of market, we're looking at some larger things and really looking across the board.","J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. And I guess a follow-up would be on your cost initiatives and some of the internal stuff that you're doing there. You've talked in the past about pulling in-house some of \u2013 I think actually Jose even mentioned this, about pulling some of your outsourced manufacturing. I think you have said something like 52% was outsourced before. Can you tell me where you stand on that front?","And I guess also secondarily, we're hearing from some of the subsea guys that forging costs are not really coming down because of strengths in other markets. Are you faced with that same issue that maybe you can't squeeze as much out of your suppliers as you're hoping to?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we do have sort of an outsourcing model. Basically we recognized all of the things that we manufacture serve cyclical industries, so demand rises and falls.","So we're trying to avoid scaling up to internally manage peak demand. And over the past few years, a number of our business units have done more outsourcing. So as you go with the other way and things sort of cycle down, we really try to bring more in house, keep our core teams busy. And we're doing that, moving machining hours to our plants. As Jose mentioned, that takes a little more inventory to accomplish.","On the steel cost front, it varies by product line. We've seen dramatic deflation in pipe prices, for instance. On castings and forgings, yeah, I think we're seeing the same thing others are, which is a little less deflation. But really across the entire supplier network, we're pressing for lower pricing and continually trying to become more efficient.","J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, Clay.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, David.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Crandell with Cowen.","James Crandell - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning. And congratulations, Jose, on joining NOV.","Jose A. Bayardo - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you. It's great to be here.","James Crandell - Cowen & Co. LLC","Clay, how do you see your non-Rig Systems business trending in the first half of the year if oil prices remain where they are today?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Jim, like a lot of companies, moving into the fourth quarter, we're doing more detailed planning around what 2016 is going to look like. And we always reach out to our customers to get their guidance. And what we're finding is they don't know what they're going to spend.","So generally, though I think the first part of 2016 is going to continue to be really challenging and, as I said in my prepared remarks, our expectation is activity is going to trend lower. I think like everybody in this industry that we remain hopeful we'll get a little bit of commodity price help and relief and then maybe in the second half of the year we start to see maybe some activity pick up a little bit. But I don't have a lot of data to point to this as to why that would happen.","Jose and I were chatting earlier and, Jose, you mentioned the fact that producers come under a lot of pressure when they start facing production declines. And so I think there'll be an impetus, at least across North America, to get back to drilling as soon as they can. Of course, that will take a while. A lot of the equipment that's out there has been depleted of spare parts and cannibalized. And so a little bit of uptick in activity is going to take a lot of work from NOV, so we're looking forward to that time.","James Crandell - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Follow-up, Clay, is in your Wellbore Technologies group, is Grant Prideco falling off meaningfully more steeply than your other businesses there? And is that a business where just because of the nature and its exposure to new rigs, a business that's going to continue \u2013 or will fall off at a greater than average rate?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, that business is certainly under a lot of pressure. And the management team there has done a great job scaling back to match the market and holding as best they can.","But, yeah, that's our business that makes drillpipe, for the rest of you. And what we see is particularly onshore operators moving drillpipe off of idled rigs and moving that onto the rigs that remain working. It's a little more challenging offshore. It's expensive to demobilize a string of pipe off of an offshore rig. And so a little less impacted from cannibalization there, but certainly onshore that's impacted them.","The good news is is that their mix has improved. We're the market leader in terms of providing premium connections of high-tensile strength pipe, set new records in places like Sukkwan Island in terms of extended-reach drilling, out seven miles, eight miles. And really, broadly speaking, you step back and view the demand for drillpipe, a lot of technology in drillpipe. And drillpipe is consumed at a much faster rate when it's used to drill these horizontal wells, these long patterns (40:43) that are really making the shale plays go.","So, yeah, we're in this period when demand is down. The team has done a great job. They're managing through it. But once we recover, I think the shale phenomenon is going to continue to consume more and more drillpipe that we make.","James Crandell - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Okay. Thanks, Clay.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yep.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International","Thank you. Good morning. Hey, Clay, to clarify, did you prophecy or guide for Rig Systems revenue out of backlog in 2016 at $2.4 billion?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, that is out of the $8 billion that we currently have in our backlog, that's things that are scheduled to flow out in 2016 without benefit of orders that we will continue to win in the fourth quarter and into the first part of 2016, Bill.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International","Got that. Thank you. And then back to your use of the term extraordinary, and I'll ask the question a little bit differently. I understand that that encompasses the prospect of enhancing existing product lines, but really what I'm most interested in is you're extolling the attractive economic propositions given the adjustment in price.","But I'm also curious as to what's the subset of opportunities that you're looking at which are really transformational to NOV and whether or not they at least potentially fundamentally redefine National Oilwell Varco if your aspirations are consummated? And adding to that, does this entail significantly increased service content? Does it entail possibly significantly increased non-energy exposure? I'm just curious as to how expansive your view is.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, you want stock symbols alphabetically?","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International","Yeah, please. Thank you. And also price, too.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Bill, I know you'll appreciate if I don't precisely give a roadmap in terms of what we're thinking over here. And I tried to touch on this in my opening remarks, the principles that we apply. Since I've been with the company, we've grown from two business units to 15. And I'll reiterate, we take a broad view across oilfield services and look for opportunities to deploy capital and develop strategies around things.","I'll go back a couple years and give you a real-world example. We launched an FPSO initiative about four years or five years ago. And I'll just point out, this was long before anybody was talking about standardization, about industrial efficient supply chain, when we were sort of a lone voice on this subject.","But we recognized NOV has built and installed and commissioned 300 complicated offshore rigs. We've worked with every major shipyard out there. We've got great project management expertise, great relationships with every major shipyard around the globe, and these same shipyards where customers are very challenged when it comes to building FPSO vessels on time, on budget.","Plus, when we looked at our portfolio of product offerings between hose reel systems, offloading systems, cranes, composite piping, production chokes and valves and manifolds and other things, we had a lot of content on FPSOs. So we've cultivated an FPSO strategy and said, we're uniquely positioned in terms of our shipyard expertise to execute a strategy of improving FPSO construction, bringing more industrially elegant solutions to the supply chain, again, simplifying, the things you're hearing a lot more of lately to reduce cost and risk around FPSO construction.","And NOV is uniquely positioned with regards to a vessel strategy in the deepwater. And then we've supplemented that with acquisitions along the way, including APL turret mooring systems, one of the three global providers of turret mooring systems in swivel stack technologies, with NKT Flexibles, which is NOV Flexibles, one of the three global providers of flexible pipe, a big component of SURF packages that fit this strategy.","So that's an example of where we're deploying capital to execute a strategy that I think has positioned us to be transformative in a significant sector in oilfield services, and thereby reduce costs for our customers. So that's an example of the kind of things that we're looking at. And so suffice to say in a cyclical downturn, we're continuing to look for other opportunities to deploy capital and develop businesses.","William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International","All right. Thank you.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet. Thank you, Bill.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Tillery with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Jeff.","Jose A. Bayardo - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Morning.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Clay, it's a relatively broad question, but as you look at the relatively short-cycle businesses that you have and obviously the customers are consuming what they have, but could you just walk us through what you perceive to be the customer inventories in terms of when we ultimately do see an uptick in activity, whether it be spare parts for rigs or some of the consumables in the other product lines, how much of a lag before you think your business starts to improve?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, it's a great question, Jeff. And unfortunately it's driven by rig count and really the inverse of rig count, which are stacked rigs, because the stacked rigs, as activity goes down, then it frees up a string of drillpipe, it frees up the downhole tools that otherwise would be working on that working rig. And so it's very fluid and very difficult to tell, frankly, until we hit bottom on activity and we see a little time pass beyond that. Very difficult to tell where that's going to lie.","We're seeing customers be far more aggressive I think in this downturn with regards to cannibalizing their equipment, about repositioning it. If they have a particular piece of equipment in a different region, there's a cost to repositioning that; there's freight, there's \u2013 they have to invest in that just to move it and maybe to get it back to working order. And we're seeing customers go to more extraordinary lengths I think in this downturn than we have in the preceding couple of downturns with regards to cannibalization.","So there is a very, very Darwinian, very Draconian move to preserve cash and use what's on hand. And so we're seeing that. We do know it will turn around and when it does, one day the phones will light up and people will all of a sudden need it yesterday. And so that's the other side of this. But at this point, we don't know when that's going to occur.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful context. As I think about the Rig Systems business as we progress through the next year or so, there will continue to be some volumetric pressure. And some of the offsetting factors are your ability to do more in-house. I mean, how do you think about the floor and margins? Not looking for a single quarter. But at the top of the cycle, is that a business that can sustain low-teens operating margins do you think?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, first, I have a lot of confidence in our management team there to manage through this. They have a done great job along the way. Second, as I mentioned, we have sort of an outsourcing model in good times and they're doing a great job scaling back our outside suppliers about insourcing more and managing to the volume that's out there.","Third, as backlog moves down, there's more flexibility that opens up with regards to steps that they can take. Absorption does become harder I think from here on out. And then, fourth, I think the wildcard out there remains pricing to some degree \u2013 where that lands. So it's very difficult I think. If you were looking to throw a margin number or range out there right now other than, as I said many times before, we're going to manage what we can and manage to the market.","It might be helpful, too, to point out that our global network within Rig of plants and facilities really serve both Rig Systems and Rig Aftermarket. The same plants that make components for rigs also makes spare parts and these components are used both offshore and on land.","And between Rig Aftermarket continuing demand and ongoing work and ongoing demand for components to replace things that are worn out and replace things that are burned up, to upgrade rigs even in the downturn; you're going to see rigs that need to upgrade certain components in order to qualify for certain work. I think we can keep a decent load on our plants and our core team through that, so that's what we're shifting to as new builds slow down a little bit.","The other part that I'm probably more optimistic about in terms of demand in Rig is we know a number of drilling contractors in North America and around the globe who are completely bought into the idea and the need to upgrade their fleets to AC technology. This is clearly where the market is going and so I think in terms of recovery, that's where we would see it next.","Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","All right. Thank you very much.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Loren Singletary - Vice President-Investor & Industry Relations","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo.","Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the comment on revenue out of backlog and try to dig a little deeper in that, if I could. Could you tell us, does that number include any revenues from Brazil-related projects or does that exclude anything from SA (51:17)?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Minimal revenue out of Brazil.","Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And in helping us think about book-in-turn for the year, what was that number a year ago, to help us calibrate how to think about your revenue out of backlog as we go through next year? Do you have that?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't have that at my fingertips, Jud. But, yeah, right now based on what we have on the books, that's what we foresee.","Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. All right, that's fair. And then my follow-up question is on Rig Aftermarket. I wanted to just follow up. You said Aftermarket would be up slightly in the fourth quarter. And I may have missed, what exactly is driving the uptick in the fourth quarter for Aftermarket?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","There's usually some seasonality in Aftermarket, a little bit in Q4, one. Two, we're seeing rising inquiries around stacking service and equipment things, and then some specific SPS things that are happening out there that we're working on. So that's what gives rise to our outlook for Rig Aftermarket.","Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Marshall Adkins with Raymond James.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, guys. I want to come back to the margin thing. I think we're all surprised at how good a job you all did at holding up margins. In the commentary you've given so far today, it sounds like, at least on Rig Systems and Aftermarket you think that the margins will be fairly resilient. Is that...","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Am I reading that correctly?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, yeah. And, again, we pulled up from quantifying that, but...","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Right, right.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But high level of outsourcing, the flexibility opening up there and we've got a great team there working on that question.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Subject to a few things, one of those you included was pricing. I assume pricing is holding up fairly well?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I would say everything we do is under pricing pressure, Marshall.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. A last one from me. Your orders in Rig Systems are a little higher than I thought they would be given the current commodity environment. What are floater people ordering right now?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We're still seeing interest out there, mostly from international markets, mostly from drilling contractors that are working closely with national oil companies. And I think this quarter was around half land, half offshore.","But even in the worst of times, there is an ongoing level of demand for components for rigs. Things burn up, they break, they have to be replaced, they have to be upgraded. And so that hits a pause when you first hit a downturn and customers will look at pulling off of other rigs. And we're certainly seeing that. But rigs are working. And as I said in my comments, when they work, they consume mechanical components. So, that's what we're seeing out there.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good stuff. Thanks, guys.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet. Thank you, Marshall.","Loren Singletary - Vice President-Investor & Industry Relations","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Sanchez with Howard Weil.","William Sanchez - Scotia Howard Weil","Thanks. Good morning.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Bill.","William Sanchez - Scotia Howard Weil","Good morning, Clay. Good morning, all. I know you all dedicated some time in terms of just the revenue out of backlog number, Clay, for next year, $2.4 billion. I was just curious if you could help us. Could you maybe talk about given the deliveries you've seen push the right, maybe just how much revenue maybe you've had slide here that you thought you would've booked in 2016 out a backlog that's now moved into 2017? And I guess, given that, is it too early for you guys to have a 2017 number in terms of revenue from backlog?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, well, what that encompasses is, as we said over the last couple of calls, we've worked with our customers to push certain deliveries out and you've seen some announcement. So this is the latest estimate including all of those shifts. And as I just said, it includes pushing out a lot of Brazilian revenue as well. And so it's the latest and greatest. We're continuing to work this. It remains a little bit fluid, but this is what we're looking at right now.","William Sanchez - Scotia Howard Weil","Got you. And it didn't sound like anything in terms of the terms in which you agreed to with these customers, nothing's really changed on these delayed deliveries. Is that fair?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, no, no, no, and I would add, there's a little bit of upside. I don't want to overstate this, but we're picking up incremental maintenance work around this equipment. If it's going to be in a shipyard for an extra 12 months, then it needs some OEM maintenance and care, extension of warrantees, those sorts of things. So we're being compensated for this.","And then operationally, the added benefit is that we're able to execute these projects at lower cost and better margins. And specifically, if we slow down the pace of work on some of these, then we're able to avoid overtime, for instance, we're able to execute these with the best part of our supply chain, our top-tier suppliers and the like. So, that's the benefit for NOV.","William Sanchez - Scotia Howard Weil","Great. One more, Clay, if I could ask, for you. As far as the buyback is concerned, you finished that up. You've talked about a focus on M&A, but that really being more of a 2016 event it sounds like, just given the bid\/ask spreads out there right now. Was there any thought or is the board going to reexamine a new authorization here and possibly seeing some repurchases take place in 4Q? Or is the buyback for now just shelved?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The recommendation from management \u2013 we're going to be talking about this with our board here through the fourth quarter, but I really want to really be focused on M&A. We're fortunate to have both I think as attractive applications of capital and we can always put a buyback back in. But I think given the emerging things that we're seeing in the M&A space, as we said in our opening comments, that's probably a better use of our capital right now.","So if that starts to diminish a little bit, if we feel like we're not going to get bids and asks to converge, then we can go back to buying back shares. But I would say here I think we're going to see more attractive opportunities emerge in the M&A space.","William Sanchez - Scotia Howard Weil","I appreciate the time.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet. Bye-bye.","Loren Singletary - Vice President-Investor & Industry Relations","Thanks, Bill.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Williams for closing remarks.","Clay C.

(NYSE:NOV) Q4 2018 Results Conference Call February  7, 2019 11:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Loren Singletary - Chief Investor and Industry Relations Officer","Clay Williams - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Jose Bayardo - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","Marshall Adkins - Raymond James","Byron Pope - Tudor Pickering Holt","James Wicklund - Credit Suisse","Chase Mulvehill - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Jud Bailey - Wells Fargo","Edward Muztafago - Societe Generale","Operator","Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the National Oilwell Varco Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Loren Singletary, Chief Investor and Industry Relations Officer. Sir, you may begin.","Loren Singletary","Welcome everyone to National Oilwell Varco's fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings conference call. With me today are Clay Williams, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Jose Bayardo, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of today's comments are forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. They involve risk and uncertainty and actual results may differ materially. No one should assume that these forward-looking statements remain valid later in the quarter or later in the year. For a more detailed discussion of the major risk factors affecting our business, please refer to our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Our comments also include non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation to the nearest corresponding GAAP measures are in our earnings release available on our Web site. On a U.S. GAAP basis, for the fourth quarter of 2018, NOV reported revenues of $2.4 billion and a net income of $12 million or $0.03 per share. For the full year 2018, NOV reported revenues of $8.45 billion and a net loss of $31 million or $0.08 per share. Our use of the term EBITDA throughout this morning's call corresponds with the term adjusted EBITDA as defined in our earnings release.","Later in the call, we will host a question-and-answer session. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up to permit more participation. Now, let me turn the call over to Clay.","Clay Williams","Thank you, Loren. National Oilwell Varco delivered solid results for its fourth quarter 2018 as revenue increased 11% sequentially and 22% year-over-year, and EBITDA increased to $279 million or 11.6% of revenues. All three segments increase sales and EBITDA sequentially due to strong operational execution during the quarter.","Revenues for the full year 2018 were $8.45 billion, a 16% improvement from the prior year. Full year EBITDA of $910 million improved 49% year-over-year and represents 26% leverage over 2017. During 2018, NOV continued its pivot towards unconventional shale technologies, while preserving and enhancing optionality in offshore and international markets. We continued to benefit from the cost reductions and efficiency improvements we put in place over the past few years and we remain vigilant with regards to continuing to manage costs closely.","Before diving deeper into our fourth quarter results, I want to tackle the question that is on everybody's mind, the outlook for the coming year. In a few minutes, Jose will step you through our detailed outlook by segment. But to state the obvious here upfront, the outlook is significantly more opaque than it was just 90 days ago. Oil prices declined sharply through the fourth quarter before recovering modestly in recent weeks, aided by OpEx and Russia production curtailment announcements.","In our view, stability at levels of above $50 per barrel for WTI can help maintain oil field activity near current levels in North America, or at least help minimize activity declines, while also continuing to incentivize the recovery in international and offshore markets. We believe this provides a plausible backdrop for a scenario where prospects and activity can brighten for NOV throughout the year particularly of oil prices demonstrate an upward bias from here. However, we are managing to the reality that the lingering effects of WTI hitting a 17 month low in December, will negatively impact our business, particularly in the first quarter.","Specifically, we saw some of our customers accelerate shipments of equipment near year-end, which means we benefited from revenues in the fourth quarter, which would have otherwise been recognized in the first quarter of 2019 despite lower oil prices turning into the mid $40 range during the fourth quarter. This contributed to our strong Q4 results but it means that we will face lower sales in the first quarter, which will also be impacted by the slowdown in ordering we saw late in the year as our customers watched oil prices melt down and grew more cautious. We suspect some customers wanted to get equipment into their operations in advance of looming CapEx budget cuts for 2019, and want to report lower CapEx in 2019, which drove the acceleration.","As we look forward into 2019, candidly, none of us know precisely yet the impact of the sharp oil price downturn. Having been through a few downturns, there's typically a three or four month lag before we see the meaningful response, but it inevitably moves directionally oil prices. And as our oil field service customers look to their E&P customer spending plans for clues as to what to invest in, in equipment sets, their mood is very cautious as well.","Whatever the future holds, I'm confident that NOV will execute crisply. And our fourth quarter results provide the latest example. Wellbore Technologies grew 4% sequentially with robust 54% incrementals. Within our completion and production solution segment, all but one of our business units posted sequential top line growth. And we posted a book-to-build above one for the segment. Rig Technologies' strong finish to the year came from improved progress on offshore projects, and a shipment of land rig packages for the U.S. and Argentina markets. Rig's also helped by higher aftermarket revenues as our customers' desire to use that budgeted CapEx and OpEx at year-end led to more service calls to repair their equipment during the fourth quarter.","Let me now turn to a couple of key regions. Overall, 42% of NOV's consolidated revenue during the fourth quarter came from North America, which grew 1% or $10 million sequentially. Our drill bits continued to gain share in West Texas, driven by superior performance and drilling motors posted a 60% year-over-year sales increase in the U.S., due to technical improvements in reliability and performance, which have enhanced NOV's reputation in this area, particularly among E&Ps. Motor performance has a lot to do with well success as a premature motor failure can lead to a six figure unplanned trip. Some downhole service providers seeking to move old inventory and preserve cash have been putting together motors and BHAs from old disparate parts at their bone yards. Not surprisingly, these cobbled together motors tend to fail more frequently. And in response, several E&Ps have begun directly sourcing drilling motors from manufacturers, a trend which has clearly benefited NOV.","Our fourth quarter saw double digit growth in drill pipe sales as some customers pulled deliveries forward from the first quarter. North American customers were also noticing that our premium delta drill pipe connection reduces their recut rate well below the industry average, reducing the cost of ownership for them. Delta now represents 25% of our drill pipe revenue mix. In addition, we just introduced a new connection for work streams that expands our reach into the adjacent market of workover operations. While North America pressure pumping equipment demand has slowed considerably. No surprise given the sharp pricing erosion witnessed by our customers. Thankfully, coil tubing remains a different story.","Our new high capacity genesis coil tubing unit is seeing brisk demand, both domestically and overseas due to its ability to access deeper wells and longer laterals. Additionally, demand for cementing equipment remains strong in North America, but wireline demand has leveled off through the first few weeks of 2019. With respect to drilling equipment, we continue to witness steady demand for upgrade components, including high torque top drives, Novos control systems and DC to AC land rig convergence. As drilling contractors are eager to expand their service offerings in a highly utilized the Super Spec rig base where day rates were strongest.","We\u2019re approaching an install base of 50 Novos rigs in North America with contractors and oil companies alike, clearly recognizing the increased safety and efficiency of implementing process automation. Our completion tools business posted another solid quarter of growth and profitability, and we saw strong sequential growth for desanders and spherical sand traps, which are up to 3 times more efficient than traditional designs for North American producers.","Turning the international markets, the recovery continued to unfold slowly. A quick reminder, our international revenue stream tends to be more project driven and therefore lumpier than our North American businesses. The Middle East was once again a standout, posting solid double digit sequential growth numbers on demand for products such as shaker screens, rig instrumentation packages and liner hankers, as well as rig equipment sales into Algeria and Kuwait.","Our new world class fiberglass pipe manufacturing facility is set to open in Dammam, Saudi Arabia on April 1st, expanding our capabilities to serve the Middle East region. In Latin America, NOV posted double digit revenue growth sequentially in the fourth quarter, helped by strong shipments of flexible subsea pipe into Brazil.","We continue to expand our presence in Vaca Muerta shale play in Argentina. During the quarter, we were awarded a contract to provide comprehensive well site services to a major IOC, and shipped a new modern land rig into the region. After a particularly deep down cycle over the past five years, the Asia-Pacific region is starting to show signs of life as substantial revenue improvements were driven by growth in the Chinese and Singapore markets. Additionally, the first installation of our offshore liner hanger system for a major operator in the region is another indication that our completion tool strategy is growing legs.","Finally, turning to the offshore, NOV we saw a very strong sequential performance as revenues increased 23% sequentially, driving our offshore mix to 37% of consolidated revenues or about $888 million. Q4 saw excellent flexible subsea pipe sales in Brazil, as our customer pulled deliveries forward. Outside of Brazil, our subsea flexible pipe business is seeing intense competition for tenders for fast track brownfield developments and tiebacks.","Our business that makes conductor pipe connections XL Systems posted record hard bookings with strong activity in supportive of the ramp up in activity for offshore South America. However, conductor pipe orders have slowed in the first quarter, indicative of the uncertainty in the offshore marketplace. On previous calls, we stated our expectation for the offshore businesses within our completion and production solutions segment to bottom in the second half of 2018. However, due to the accelerated deliveries we executed in the fourth quarter, the bottom may still be a quarter or two away. In the offshore drilling space, activity around rig reactivations continues to build momentum, driven by rising volume of tenders, the drilling contractors are readying their iron to go out and win.","As we have returned to rigs that have not worked for some time and reflect upon what we've see, here's what we've discovered. The longer piece of steel sits in salt-water the rustier it gets. Reactivations tend to become costlier and more complicated with time spent idle. Stacked time drives up rig reactivation costs. Rig upgrade orders, which frequently go hand in hand with reactivation projects, have of late focused on increasing hoisting capacity, adding crown mounted compensation and adding more sophisticated control systems like NOVOS. Some of these reactivations are driving demand for new drill pipe, which again helped our fourth quarter.","As I stated at the onset, we entered 2019 with more uncertainty than usual, a $20 drop in crude price during budgeting season is bound to take a toll on activity plans. When we asked our customers what they expect, the answers we hear all over the map. But the most consistent theme seems to be their fidelity to earning returns on the capital that they deploy. Here's where NOV shines. A relentless focus on innovative technologies and tools and delivering superior service and knowhow, all of the singular objective of reducing our customers' cost of operations and cost per barrel, positions NOV to enable our customers to maximize their capital returns. So, we're cautious in the near-term, keeping a close eye on costs while we continue to position the company to be at the right place the right time with the right tools for recovery.","For employees who are listening around the globe, you put up a tremendous fourth quarter and a full year 2018, keep up the great work. Your talent and dedication make NOV a world class business and make me very, very proud. Jose, Loren and I appreciate all that you do.","Now, I'll turn it over to Jose.","Jose Bayardo","Thank you, Clay. To recap the quarter, NOV consolidated revenue increased $244 million or 11% sequentially and EBITDA improved $34 million to $279 million or 11.6% of sales. Operating profit was $87 million, and we posted net income of $12 million or $0.03 per share. On a GAAP basis, our operating profit and net income included $21 million of pretax charges, primarily related to the closure of one of our facilities.","Looking at a couple of select items on the P&L, other expense increased $9 million, mainly due to higher FX losses and like last quarter, we reported an outsized income tax expense, primarily a result of valuation allowances that prevent us from recognizing foreign tax credits. In our segment level detail, higher inter-company sales resulted in a $13 million sequential increase in revenue eliminations. The margin associated with higher inter-company revenues and an increase in unallocated expenses resulted in $23 million increase in eliminations and corporate costs. In the first quarter, we expect inter-company sales as a percentage of pre-elimination revenues to remain in line with Q4. Lower inter-company revenues along with lower corporate costs should reduce elimination and corporate costs by roughly $10 million in the first quarter.","In the fourth quarter of 2018, cash flow from operations totaled $221 million. And after deducting $71 million in capital expenditures, we netted $150 million in free cash flow. NOV has always been focused on generating cash flow and returns, which is why we explained on last year's call that we were making a concerted effort to improve the management of our working capital.","We exited 2018 with a revenue run rate that was 22% or $1.7 billion per year higher than our run rate at the end of 2017 and only added a total of $86 million to our working capital in 2018. Our working capital as a percent of our revenue run rate decreased to 36.7% at the end of 2018 from 43.6% at the end of 2017. While we consider our efforts related to working capital in 2018 a large success, we still see opportunity for additional improvement. In 2019, we expect our capital expenditures to increase roughly $100 million to about 50% more annual depreciation and amortization expense, primarily due to construction of our new rig manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia, which we'll use to execute on our $1.8 billion rig order. We\u2019ve always prioritized investing in compelling organic investment opportunities and this project checks that box.","Let's turn to the results for our operations. Our wellbore technology segment generated $884 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of $37 million or 4% sequentially. Solid sequential revenue increases in our well sites services Grant Prideco and Tuboscope business units help the segment meaningfully outpace industry activity levels, particularly in the U.S. where the segment posted 4.5% revenue growth against 2% increase in the active rig count, a better mix of business and higher volumes drove very strong sequential EBITDA leverage of 54%, resulting in $20 million increase in EBITDA to $155 million or 17.5% of sales.","In our well site services business unit, we realized sequential revenue increases in all major product offerings and almost all operating regions. Revenues increased 7% and the business unit solidly controls those business led by increased job counts in the U.S. and Latin America. We realized strong sequential increases in Colombia and Peru and successfully wrapped up a long term project in Brazil. Screen sales also improved in most regions with notable strength in Africa and Southeast Asia. The capital equipment sales portion of well site services also realized strong growth due to a sharp increase in shaker sales, which resulted from three consecutive quarters of improved bookings.","Our Grant Prideco drill pipe business recorded its third straight double digit percent sequential increase in revenue, and posted its fourth straight quarter of bookings in excess of $100 million. Additionally, we are seeing sales of Delta in the international markets increase, demonstrating broad application and demand for this high performance premium drill pipe connection that delivers faster connection times and lower total cost of ownership. We are encouraged by the growing adoption of Delta and are equally encouraged by a sharp increase in offshore bookings, accounting for almost a third of our order book in Q4. This was the first meaningful uptick we've seen in offshore orders for drill pipe since 2015, an indication that certain inventories of pipe for offshore markets are drawing down unsustainable levels.","Notwithstanding the strong Q4 performance and solid bookings, near-term challenges remain in our drill pipe business. Rental companies and operators exhausted capital expenditure budgets at the end of 2018 and appear to be heading into New Year with some trepidation as a result of lower oil prices. So despite what we believe are meaningful improvements in underlined drill pipe market fundamentals, we have already had a number of customer requests to defer first quarter deliveries of new drill pipe for the North American marketplace.","Our Tuboscope business realized another solid quarter on strengths from our coating operations where we achieve double-digit percent sequential revenue increases in our U.S. and Eastern Hemisphere coating operations. Tuboscope's inspection services saw a slight decrease in revenues lower volumes from U.S. steel mills and outside processors and from lower sleeve sales in Europe. In our downhole business unit, we saw a small sequential decrease in revenues during the fourth quarter. Notwithstanding the recent year-end softness, we've seen a remarkable growth in demand for our drilling motors. Reflecting market share gains, enabled by our technology leadership and products, such as our Series 50 and ERT motors and power sections.","An large independent operator recently drilled its fastest intermediate section in a zone where temperatures exceeded 300 degrees Fahrenheit, using a NOV 8.25 inch ERT motor. The operator was able to drill 13,800 feet in 223 hours, setting records for both time and interval length in this field while also achieving 19% reduction in cost. Another promising new technology in our downhole business unit is our select shift downhole adjustable motor. This tool offers the ability to adjust the motor bend setting while the tools in the wellbore, saving money by eliminating trips, proven rate of penetration and reducing torch velocity. We began testing this tool in the second quarter of 2018 and have now logged over 700 hours on the tool, drilled over 57,000 feet and completed more than 150 downhole shifts. Based on the success, we began to build out our fleet of commercial tools.","Our ReedHycalog business unit also realized a small sequential decrease in revenues during the fourth quarter in the Eastern Hemisphere, due to bulk sales in the MENA region, which occurred in Q3, but did not repeat in Q4. This falloff was partially offset by solid improvements in the Western Hemisphere. ReedHycalog's downhole measurement and steerable technology businesses realized sequential improvements led by increased demand from the Eastern Hemisphere.","Lastly, work on land-based North American drilling optimization project slowed as we prepared for major ramp-ups in automation and optimization work for Equinor in the North Sea, having signed an agreement with them to outfit their global drilling fleet with IntelliServ wired drill pipe. Interest in wired drill pipe continues to grow as more customers recognize the performance and safety improvements made possible by control systems and applications that can harness real-time broadband data transmission from along the drill string and the BHA.","As Clay mentioned, outlook is opaque at best. But in the first quarter of 2019, we expect to see slightly lower activity levels in the U.S., a slightly slower than normal start to the year in the Eastern Hemisphere and fewer deliveries of drill pipe and capital equipment. If this scenario plays out, we would expect revenues for our Wellbore Technologies segment to fall between 5% to 10% with decremental margins in the 40% range.","Our Completion & Production Solutions segment generated $788 million in revenues during the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of $53 million or 7%. All business units reported sequential top line growth except for Fiber Glass Systems, which suffered raw material supply shortages that we spoke about on our last call. Holiday slowdowns and the raw material issues impacted manufacturing plant absorption, limiting sequential EBITDA leverage to 25% and resulted in a $13 million sequential increase in EBITDA to $112 million or 14.2% of sales. Bookings of $470 million increased $98 million or 26% sequentially and exceeded shipments of $456 million, resulting in a 103% book-to-bill for the fourth quarter, led by XL Systems. Total segment backlog at year end was $894 million.","Our Intervention and Stimulation Equipment business unit realized a 3% sequential increase in revenues. Despite the fall-off in completion-related activity and resulting follow-on demand for pressure pumping equipment, global bookings for our coiled tubing equipment remains strong. NOV's technology leadership in all things coiled tubing, makes us the go-to supplier as the industry continues to push the limits on extended reach lateral well completions. Even as the market leader, we never sit still. In the fourth quarter, we delivered our first Genesis coiled tubing unit, which is designed to carry the largest tubing load possible from a single trailer unit.","Additionally, we will begin deliveries of our new HR 6120 injector head, which combines the ability to handle higher strength, heavy wall coiled tubing with increased pull and snub capacity, all in a platform that's smaller and weighs less than our legacy units. Our QT-1400 is the highest tensile strength coiled tubing on the market. And as highlighted in our press release, we recently introduced our TRUE-TAPER XR string design. The string's improved weight distribution enables users to place more weight in vertical sections of the well and less weight in lateral sections, extending the limits for which coiled tubing can be used in extended reach applications. One customer recently used TRUE-TAPER XR to reach TD on several wells that were each over four miles in measured depth and had 1- to 2-mile long laterals. This application was not possible with other string designs.","Even with extremely limited orders for pressure pumping equipment, the business unit delivered a sequential increase in revenue and a 112% book-to-bill in Q4. However, we expect a rapidly contracting pressure pumping equipment backlog, softening demand for wireline equipment and constraints on how quickly we can execute on our large coiled tubing equipment backlog to result in a fairly sharp fall-off in this business unit's revenue during the first quarter.","Our Completion Tools business unit posted another quarter of double-digit percentage growth. While still a relatively small business for NOV, 2018 revenues almost doubled from 2017, primarily from organic initiatives as this business unit's last acquisition was completed in early 2017. Even in a slowing North American completions market, this operation continued its rapid growth by taking market share in the U.S. and continuing to leverage NOV's platform to push its product offering into additional markets. There were several examples of this in the fourth quarter, including our first sales of burst port systems in Saudi Arabia, subsurface safety valves in Russia and liner hangers in Bahrain, Iraq and offshore China.","Our Fiber Glass Systems business unit's revenues declined roughly 15% sequentially, in line with the expectations we set during our Q3 conference call. As a reminder, our primary supplier of a critical resin used to make our flexible pipe experienced a major plant failure, leading to a global shortage of the resin. The supplier's plant is now back online, but stocks of the resin remain low, which will continue to constrain Fiberspar's production, albeit not nearly to the same extent as in Q4.","Additionally, while the quarter played out as anticipated from a P&L perspective, bookings came in lighter than we hoped. Order intake fell sharply in December and remains low for North America, as cautiousness has crept into infrastructure-related capital projects, but orders for international markets appear to be improving. Unfortunately, due to soft demand in the U.S. and certain international orders that we expected in late Q4 now expected in mid- to late Q1, we anticipate our Fiber Glass Systems business unit will see another sequential decrease in the first quarter. While the business unit's traditional offshore market has not yet recovered, we are focused on other emerging opportunities, including a fairly large potential market resulting from IMO 2020, which requires ships use marine fuels will sulfur content of no more than 0.5% or install exhaust gas cleaning scrubbers on their vessels by January 1, 2020.","Analysts expect it will be more economic for larger vessels, those with over 80,000 deadweight tonnage that are under 15 years old to install scrubbers, rather than switch to low sulfur fuels. There're roughly 25,000 existing vessels in this category. Scrubber systems are manufactured by folks such as Alfa Laval, [Motzilla] and others, but are typically housed in composite towers and gases are poured in, in and out of the scrubber's tower via a corrosion resistant composite tubulars. As you might imagine, ship engine rooms are low on space and retrofitting a scrubber system will require a complex, highly customized solution. Based on recent experience, complete system installations average roughly $5 million with NOV's opportunity ranging from $80,000 to $250,000 depending on the vessel. Fiber Glass Systems is the leading provider of composite materials to the energy industry and has a long history of providing and installing piping systems for marine vessels and shipyards, which means we are well-positioned to support our customers in their efforts to comply with IMO 2020.","Our Process and Flow Technologies business unit realized solid top line growth, but with little flow through to the bottom line, as a result of less favorable product mix. In the unit's midstream business, revenues declined slightly in North America from lower demand for reciprocating pumps, chokes and\/or artificial lift, red iron equipment. The falloff in North America was more than offset by the Eastern Hemispheres, which realized strong demand for pump packages in Africa and Asia.","In our Wellstream Processing business, revenue from North America increased as we continue to expand the customer base for our spherical sand trap solution. We also realized a meaningful increase in revenues as we completed several large projects in our legacy offshore production and processing business. While tendering activity remains high, awards continue to push. And with the aforementioned completion of several large projects, we expect a sequential decline for this operation and the business unit as a whole.","Revenues for our flexible subsea pipe business unit recovered nicely after a challenging Q3. As Clay mentioned, customer deferred deliveries from Q3 shipped in Q4 and certain orders we didn't expect to ship until Q1, were accelerated into Q4 by customers eager to exhaust 2018 capital budgets. This pull forward was good news for Q4, but will cannibalize first quarter results. Further compounding this challenge in Q1, our orders we anticipated receiving in Q4 that were deferred and are now expected in late Q1. The net effect will be a sharp sequential revenue decline in the first quarter. Consequently, we now anticipate that our primary offshore business unit in this segment will not hit bottom until sometime in the first half of 2019.","Not all news related to the offshore markets is bad. As clay mentioned, our XL Systems conductor pipe connector business unit had an exceptional quarter, delivering strong sequential growth and incremental margins. The unit also posted its sixth straight quarter with a book-to-bill in excess of 1 and achieved an all-time high backlog at year end. Looking at the first quarter of 2019, we expect revenues on our Completion & Production Solutions segment to decline roughly 15% with decrementals in the 30% range.","Our Rig Technology segment generated $804 million in revenues during the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of $167 million or 26% from the prior quarter. Revenues from capital equipment sales were up almost 50%, due to better-than-anticipated progress on projects and two land rig deliveries. Additionally, certain customers became eager to receive equipment prior to year end. And thanks to the segment's strong execution, we were able to fulfill those requests. Yes, this is the same good news bad news story you just heard in my remarks related to our Completion & Production Solutions segment.","Aftermarket revenue increased by approximately 5%, due to traditional pickup in fourth quarter service and repair work and due to spare part orders which increased in each of the fourth quarters leading up to Q4. EBITDA increased $24 million sequentially to $102 million or 12.7% of sales. EBITDA flow-through was limited to 14%, which was in line with expectations, primarily due to a lower margin product mix. Bookings of $119 million were the lightest we have seen all year. The low level of order intake is due in part to the uncertainty that a sharp drop in oil price injects into customers' future plans. However, as we've mentioned in the past, we expect orders and financial results to be lumpy, while this segment scrapes along near its cyclical bottom. Total segment backlog at year end stood at $3.1 billion.","In North America, our drilling contractor customers became cautious as we entered 2019. They're concerned about a potential decrease in E&P company capital expenditures and the likelihood that 2019 budgets will be more heavily weighted toward completion operations to stem the growth in drilled but uncompleted wells. Even though the market is bracing for a pullback in drilling activity, Tier 1 AC super-spec rigs remain in short supply and day rates remain strong. As a result, inquiries for newbuild rigs in North America have slowed, but customer inquiries related to upgrades remain robust. Contractors can obtain relatively fast paybacks for upgrades and more importantly, keep more of their fleet working. Due to a generational gap in rig technologies found overseas, economics associated with international land upgrades are not the same as in North America, creating more demand for future newbuild rigs.","While the pace of progress can be uneven in international markets due to NOC tenders that tend to push to the right, a growing number of international customers understand the value associated with NOV's latest land rig technologies. We believe our 50 rig commitment from Saudi Aramco will serve as a solid baseload of activity to help manage the choppy nature associated with this business. And we're excited about breaking ground on our new rig manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia this quarter.","Lastly, we still see limited offshore newbuild opportunities outside of certain niche applications, including 20,000-psi capable rigs, but remain optimistic regarding potential reactivations and associated upgrades as it certainly isn't getting easier or cheaper to reactivate a rig as time elapses.","While we are seeing improving fundamentals and more recently, customer inquiries that give us optimism regarding the future prospects for our Rig Technologies segment, near term this business remains challenged due to the wind down of offshore projects and customers that are still capital constrained. As such, for the first quarter of 2019 we expect revenues to fall 16% to 17% with decremental margins between 25% and 30%.","In summary, the dedicated employees of NOV executed extremely well and delivered solid results in 2018 by continuing to develop, deliver and support the technology and equipment on which our customers are aligned. We are working through what will be a tough start to 2019, but we are optimistic that the recovery could resume later this year and our people have positioned the organization well for any market environment.","We'll now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Marshall Adkins with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Marshall Adkins","I want to ask about the trends in U.S. versus the international\/offshore. It seems like last five years you've been -- had a concerted effort to increase levers in the U.S., your shale, the growing area. But it seems like now we're starting to see a resurgence in international. You mentioned stuff in Saudi Arabia, in the Middle East and other areas that started to pick up, plus the offshore side is picking up. So looking at it over the next several years, not the next quarter but the next couple of years, is it fair to assume that this trend we're seeing back to North America in the last five years maybe starts to moderate and we see more of a balanced growth going forward? Just comment on kind of U.S. versus international and offshore.","Clay Williams","I actually hope so, because that means that internationally we're seeing a more robust recovery. And you characterized it accurately Marshall. We did initially pivot toward unconventional shale technologies, which thus far have been mostly focused on North America. But importantly, we did that without sacrificing optionality into international markets or offshore markets. And so I view this as additive to a portfolio of businesses that we carried into the downturn. What's interesting to me is, and this has happened with prior technological evolutions in the industry going back decades that things were kind of figured out here in North America and then they're applied overseas.","And so what's encouraging to me is that some of these investments that we've made around horizontal drilling, around pressure pumping and fracture stimulation of these wells, which kind of drive unconventional shale production are being applied in more international markets and in particular, Argentina. It's really gaining traction. You've got a couple of major oil companies and several independents that are very intently focused on developing that resource base down there. Elsewhere, you get the Bowland shale in the U.K. You've got a new shale gas play in Abu Dhabi. The Saudis are focused on gas production out of shales. Lots of places around the world I think are going to see application of this technology.","And so it's not hard for me to see NOV providing these technologies to these sort of blossoming regions and seeing more unconventional shale technologies applied elsewhere. In the meantime, North America is going to continue to be cyclical. The oil and gas operators here are very responsive to commodity price changes. And so, yes, we're seeing definitely a slowdown. But if you look back at pressure pumping for instance over the past 15 years or so, it has going through a number of cycles. The good news for an equipment provider into that space is the basic operations of pumping high-pressure high-volume abrasive prompet through all these equipment is that industry tends to eat a lot of it. So supply demand I think kind of corrects itself over time.","Marshall Adkins","Let's talk Middle East and Saudi in particular, to the shift to more international. I know the Nabors JV, they're going to be building a lot stuff that you guys will be heavily involved in. Update us on the jackup stuff and what do you expect to see there to the extent that you can, and\/or any other initiatives in the Middle East that you'd like to comment on?","Clay Williams","So with respect to that we announced a joint venture with Aramco last year to build land rigs. And that's built on a cornerstone order of 50 land rigs, $1.8 billion, the largest rig order that's ever been placed in the history of the industry. So we're pretty excited about that. That facility, which we're breaking ground on here currently will have the capacity to make equipment, to also go into offshore rigs Aramco also has a joint venture with Rowan and has announced plans to build 20 jackups. And so we're working closely on that program. That is not -- there's not been determined yet, all the equipment for those 20 jackups, but we're working hard to support that program as well. Additionally, this joint venture is set up to provide equipment around the region and to support the growing rig fleet around the region. So really excited about the partnership there with Aramco and the prospects ahead.","The Middle East has been a region that through the downturn since 2014 has held spending and investment activity at relatively high levels. And so it's garnered a lot more focus from NOV through the past five years. And pleased to say we're in really good shape there in support of our customers throughout the region. In my prepared remarks I referenced a new fiberglass plant that we're going to have a grand opening on in April. And we've got some other facilities going into the kingdom as well.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Byron Pope with Tudor Pickering Holt.","Byron Pope","Realized there's tons of uncertainty -- near-term uncertainty with regard to North America. I guess, Clay, I thought about the potential impact on orders near term impacting more your OFS customers, but it sounds like it's also crept into the mind set of E&P operators. Could you just remind us in terms of your exposure to E&P operators directly? My sense is that that exposure is more skewed toward caps. But I know you're starting to sell motors and other things directly to E&Ps as well. So just frame that for us please.","Clay Williams","Yes. Generally it's about 30%. I don't have the precise number in front of me Byron, but it's been running about 30% of our revenue mix to oil and gas operators globally and about 70% are oilfield service companies that we outfit with equipment to execute the well construction plans for the E&P companies.","Byron Pope","And then on the international side. Just following on to what Marshall was asking about. I guess I have a specific question about Wellbore Technologies. It seems like you'll have already started to make some inroads in terms of being the enabler to some of these independent companies. Could you just speak to, as you think about the outlook for 2019, the opportunities you see there to continue to progress that part of the NOV strategy?","Clay Williams","Yes. We sell equipment and technologies really to all of the service companies and most -- in fact we're the leading provider of most of the equipment into most of the various service verticals that characterize the industry. And what we see in the North American market is, mostly these are fairly fragmented and competitive with respect to individual services provided. You go overseas and I think there's opportunities for smaller organizations to hang out a shingle and provide various services. So in a lot of ways our business plan is the enabler of some of those organizations to get going on providing services. And what we feel like we're tapping into is a real hunger out there that a lot of the oil companies have with respect to having more options around service providers in oilfield services. And our mission is to outfit those smaller companies with the latest and greatest technologies to make them competitive and to really bring higher levels of capability to their organizations. And so we provide the equipment, we provide training, we provide aftermarket support of those operations. We're really there to make them successful.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Wicklund with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","James Wicklund","Good Q4, but the guidance on Q1 looks to be well below consensus. And so I think that's what taking the stock down. The improvement that you expect to see, hope to see, plan to see in the second half of the year, how much of that is based on expectations of oil price? And how much of that is based on real conversations with customers that we have confidence in?","Clay Williams","Well, there's two pieces to it Jim. I think if oil will, let's say, stay here. And this is a think and maybe a little bit of a hope. But if oil will stay here in the mid-$50 range, I think there is sort of building pressure among the larger companies to go ahead and FID some more projects. I do think you're going to see international markets creep closer to recovery. And so that will help the second half of 2019. That's our hope. If oil prices go higher, I think that could lead North American independents to getting back to work in a more meaningful way and then would be additive with respect to the second half of 2019.","James Wicklund","And my follow-up if I could. I realized the fallacies of Bloomberg's calculations and all. But you've seen a big shift in the expectation of and valuation of E&P companies in terms of generating returns of capital and generating returns on capital. You guys do a very good job of returning capital to shareholders. But in terms of generating returns above your cost of capital, as a manufacturing company, what will it take over the next couple of years to change the trend of the last seven, eight years, where you're not earning your cost of capital and we hit an absorption level, on an activity level or whatever has to happen for those returns to be positive?","Clay Williams","I'm going to answer it in some detail if you don't mind, because I do think it's very important. The short answer is, as a manufacturing company, we need to bring great equipment to the oilfield service industry, which has the important role of constructing and developing wells on behalf of oil and gas companies. So we're always focused on new and better and more efficient equipment that's safer and reduces the cost of development. And that's the path to more prosperity. But in a broader sense thinking about returns on capital in this space, I would stress this is really nothing new to us.","I go back 20, 25 years ago before there was an NOV. And I used to cover us at Tuboscope and Varco. And we observed back then that manufacturing equipment for the oilfield was a low capital intensity undertaking. So the investments in rig-up yards and in plants and machine shops was small relative to the revenues and profits that those assets could generate, which is in kind of stark contrast to the rest of the oilfield ecosystem. So oilfield service companies tend to be very capital-intensive, as do E&P companies.","So the basic design of NOV around manufacturing equipment comes out of this recognition that since it's low capital intensity undertaking, we get to keep more EBITDA for our shareholders and have to reinvest less. And we I think did a great job of that. So as we entered a period of prosperity and a massive sort of build out, in particularly the offshore, generated strong returns on capital. That obviously all changed in 2014 when we entered sort of this generational down cycle. And I would add, throughout that entire period though, to put it in perspective, our CapEx levels have been pretty light. So 2018, for example, 2.9% of revenue in CapEx, $244 million. We've always been kind of in the 2%, 3%, 4% range, much lower than everybody else in the space.","For 2014, the things became more challenged from a return on capital standpoint, we put in place an economic value-add type compensation system to get our team more focused on capital returns, to drive us back toward earning our cost of capital and have had that in place since 2015, didn't make as much progress as we would have liked. So in 2017, Jose, actually really started breaking this apart and focusing on frankly our not very good job managing working capital here. So in this past year, we've layered in another driver of incentive compensation around working capital. And as you just heard a moment ago, made good progress on that in the year that we just wrapped up. We drove working capital as a percent of revenue, annual revenue, from 44% down to 37%. Good progress but aways to go.","Internally, we tend to focus on returns on tangible capital, which is a combination of PP&E and working capital by business unit. And have made good progress there, particularly in 2018. So it's kind of going in the right direction. But we'll acknowledge we have a long way to go. What I would tell you is to me the most important thing -- obviously, good processes to drive incremental returns, incremental investments need to be careful and cautious, but the main driver of returns on capital for not just this business, not just this industry, but all industries, really comes out of strategic positioning, which is why we spent so much time on our Analyst Day talking about what I think is the very thoughtful strategic positioning of NOV; our role in the ecosystem, how we provide capital and tools to oilfield service companies and more importantly, the competitive advantages that come out of that. I think we had nine competitive advantages and attributes that are characteristics of our positioning strategically, all designed to drive returns on capital.","So overall to me that's the purpose of business, to deploy risk capital to earn a return by providing a high-value product or service to customers that they pay for and then managing it smartly through that. We've got some cyclical challenges here, but very focused on improvement in that area.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Chase Mulvehill","I guess the first one, I guess I'll kind of come back to some of the targets that you gave at the Analyst Day and realizing that that was in a different oil price environment. But maybe if we can just kind of talk about the top line and expectations relative to kind of what you gave at the Analyst Day. If we step through each of your segments, maybe you could give us some outlook of kind of overall, whether you expect revenue kind of up or down across each segment for 2019?","Jose Bayardo","First of all, as you correctly pointed out, when we had our Analyst Day presentation we were in a pretty different environment. Back at the time WTI was pushing $65 a barrel. And in our presentation we layered in some very specific assumptions that were sort of the basis for the forecast in the overall outlook that we provided during that presentation. I think it included WTI in excess of $65 a barrel. Global CapEx spend increasing by at least 10% and a number of other assumptions, which obviously at this point after we saw oil prices collapse at the back end of the year from that sort of $65 price, down to the lower 40s appear to be somewhat off the table.","So as we look forward in time, as we mentioned, a number of times in our prepared remarks the overall outlook is very opaque right now. We give very clear guidance as it pertains to Q1 and are not prepared to sort of update full year guidance at this point. But think there -- the rest of the year, just depending on how the market shakes out, we could see a pretty decent recovery in the back half of the year as it relates to a question that Clay addressed earlier in terms of our split, in terms of where our revenue comes from between service companies and E&Ps, presents a little bit of an additional challenge in terms of trying of pin down exactly where the market is headed, because first of all, we're getting the vast majority of our outlook based on what our customers are telling us on the service side of the business, while they're still trying to hunt down what their customers are going to do. So probably in a little bit more time before we can provide you with a lot more precision related to the 2019 full year outlook. So that's kind of where we are right now.","Chase Mulvehill","I appreciate that. And then if we think about capital allocation and we get to the back half of the year and into 2020 things look a little better. How should we think about capital allocation, kind of split between dividend, buybacks, debt paydown or potentially M&A?","Clay Williams","Chase, so as far as capital allocation priorities, I'll also refer back to our Analyst Day presentation where I think we were pretty specific in terms of what our hierarchy is related to capital allocation. So nothing has changed on that front. Still first and foremost is our efforts to make sure that we have sort of the ideally optimized balance sheet structure. Next is investments in high return organic capital opportunities. Then we also look at compelling M&A and then a little further on down that list is return of capital to our shareholders.","And so, as I think you're aware, the Board authorized a $500 million share buyback program at the time of our Analyst Day. We set out some pretty specific criteria in terms of what kind of debt metrics that we did see before we really started leaning into that program. And that's -- as I mentioned nothing has really changed on that front.","Jose Bayardo","Yes. Critically important we maintain investment grade rating. That's very important to our business model.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Jud Bailey","Thanks. Good morning guys. Appreciate the commentary around expectations regarding activity levels and kind orders. But I wonder, focusing on the Wellbore Technologies segment, can you given any commentary on what you're seeing on the pricing front? Have you seen any weakness in pricing across any of the business lines? Or is it all pretty much activity-driven at this point?","Clay Williams","I would say Jud, first of all, we came into the quarter targeting pricing improvements to overcome some steel cost challenges and some labor cost challenges that we were facing. The tariffs went in place in the second quarter. The third quarter we really felt that. Q4, we were focused on trying to get pricing to go the other way. What I'll tell you is that oil prices have not been helpful, making that happen. And so through the fourth quarter we did gain some ground in a couple of product lines. But I would say others are definitely starting to feel more price competition out there. And we're certainly hearing that from our oilfield service customers as well. So they're starting to feel the pinch and we've all seen the rig count roll over a bit. So I think we're starting to see more price pressure emerge.","Jud Bailey","And then circling back a little bit on Chase's question. May be for Jose, I wanted to ask about the C&P and thinking about orders just for this year. There's a lot of moving pieces between what's going on with flexibles and ISE and then probably the delay of offshore orders. How do we think -- is there a scenario where orders year-over-year can stay flat? Would it take a big increase in kind of offshore-related orders in the back half of the year to pull that off? Or -- I'm just trying to gauge the magnitude of weakness in ISE and maybe flexible pipe versus the potential for that to maybe offset in the back half of the year by maybe some bigger, chunkier subsea or offshore-related orders. If you could help us maybe think about that big picture it would be great.","Jose Bayardo","Sure. That's a good question Jud, which has a lot of complex moving parts and pieces to it. So obviously even in a very challenging market environment, in Q4 we still booked 100%-plus book-to-bill for the segment, and -- our ISE group, which is the huge increase in demand that we've seen from a lot of our coiled tubing, coiled tubing-related equipment, had really strong bookings during the quarter. We just talked about very strong bookings for certain offshore components, specifically our conductor pipe connection business. So there's a lot of different avenues for NOV to sort of build its book of business as we move forward during the course of the year. And one of the things we pride ourselves on is position ourselves in the marketplace to capitalize on whatever market opportunity that we face.","But we also talked about in our prepared comments that we're sort of deferring our position in terms of when we think the offshore components of that business will bottom. And to some extent that was a result of a little bit of a pull-forward in some of those areas that we saw in Q4 that are going to more adversely impact the first half of the year, but also just the timing as it relates to some of the opportunities that we have been chasing pretty aggressively.","Clay Williams","We referenced within rig, shifting segments a lot of rig reactivations and sort of this greenshoots that are popping up that are reflective of oil companies tendering activity inching up. And then on the production side within C&P, again we're continuing to pursue projects that were very helpful that once we get into the second half of 2019, maybe even earlier and hopefully earlier, we'll see more FIDs around these. So specific opportunities in the North Sea, West of Shetlands, Caspian region, offshore Brazil, even offshore West Africa, which has been particularly hit hard through the downturn, a couple of projects that appeared to be [indiscernible]. So we're not yet seeing a lot of the purchase orders flow on those just yet, but again remain hopeful that those oil companies are going to move forward and sanction those projects.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Edward Muztafago with Societe Generale.","Edward Muztafago","I was wondering if you could perhaps talk a little bit about sort of your thought process on the uptake of downhole drilling automation or just drilling automation technologies. A couple other drillers have sort of said that they see the uptake as being somewhat slower, below expectations. But one at least likened it to what we saw with the kind of hockey stick change in the uptake of AC technology. Certainly if you look at AI [indiscernible] some of the survey suggests maybe doubling or tripling of the uptake of this over the next five years. Can you sort of opine a little bit as to how you see the evolution of that playing out? Clearly, you guys have focused your efforts there a lot and then maybe even could you give us an idea as to what percent of your portfolio today might be focused on just those areas in general?","Clay Williams","Well, to start having introduced new technologies in the oilfield and witnessed new technology introduction in the oilfield over many years, I would tell you it's not a space that bear hugs, embraces new things, because our customers do tend to be risk-averse. But nothing succeeds like success. And so ultimately you do have the adoption of things like MWD technology, rotary steerables, diamond bits, things like that that do once they do get proven in the oilfield and people kind of understand the risk and the value proposition, then they can sweep pretty quickly. So I guess I think internally we're realistic about the speed of the uptake.","With respect to the specific technologies that we're working on, as you know, we've got lots of them. Drilling automation is one. But very pleased to see, for instance, Equinor announce their intention to put wired drill pipe on their offshore drilling programs in a big way to enhance efficiency on those operations, to enhance safety on those operations. And several other oil companies as well, really putting this technology to work. It's now -- at this point it's field ready. It's a very, very impactful is sort of technology that's driving gains and efficiency in addressing specific downhole problems that we're excited about.","We're also in our press release we referenced our SelectShift tool, which is a really unique way of drilling horizontally. I mean we're now accumulating runs and experienced with that. And it has since -- I think we have a good chance here of having that be a very impactful technology, which will see greater adoption in the future. We made investments in MWD to enhance geosteering. We've made investments in rotary steerables. We've got three different platforms of that that are all making progress.","So it does take time, it takes a lot of patience to get a technology to go in the space, but there's lots of examples you can point to in the past where those that are patient and persistent do in fact win. They do in fact arrive in a place where they're providing transformative sort of technologies. And that's how this industry moves forward. So I really am very proud of the steps and the progress that NOV has made to be an innovator on behalf of our customers. And I think all these sort of new technologies around digital, around machine learning, around automation are going to continue to be transformative in the oilfield.","Edward Muztafago","I appreciate that and I'm glad that you're supplying a lot of that to all of the service companies. Maybe if we could just hone down on wellbore really quick. Clearly appreciate there's a bit of a backing here in the first quarter with the push out of drill pipe and pull forward of some orders. But we're also hearing that there is growing interest with the recovery in commodity price and re-contracting rigs. Would you be willing to call the bottom in wellbore in first quarter? Or do you not feel like we're quite at that point yet?","Jose Bayardo","I think Clay has said very well in his prepared remarks, where typically there's a sort of three or four month lead lag time in terms of how activity responds to commodity prices. It does feel like maybe that could be a little bit quicker and things might be a little bit shallower. But as we've said a number of times, there's just a significant lack of clarity in terms of how budgets ultimately get set and how this year plays out. So not going to say it's out of the question, but we're also not going to commit ourselves to anything like that.","Operator","Thank you. And this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Clay Williams, Chief Executive Officer, for closing remarks.","Clay Williams","Thank you Chelsea. So to recap, great fourth quarter performance and really appreciate NOV's team for the strong execution. But obviously challenges lay ahead for the first quarter. Nevertheless, we remain hopeful that for the remainder of the year the recovery gets back on track. So thank you all for joining us this morning.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day."],"15849":["National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NYSE:NOV) Q3 2018 Results Earnings Conference Call October 26, 2018 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Loren Singletary - Chief Investor & Industry Relations Officer","Clay Williams - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Jose Bayardo - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","James West - Evercore ISI","James Wicklund - Credit Suisse","Byron Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","Bill Herbert - Simmons","Sasha Sanwal - UBS","Marshall Adkins - Raymond James","Operator","Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the National Oilwell Varco third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Loren Singletary, Chief Investor and Industry Relations Officer. Sir, you may begin.","Loren Singletary","Welcome everyone to National Oilwell Varco's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With me today are Clay Williams, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Jose Bayardo, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of today's comments are forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the federal securities laws. They involve risk and uncertainty and actual results may differ materially. No one should assume that these forward-looking statements remain valid later in the quarter or later in the year. For a more detailed discussion of the major risk factors affecting our business, please refer to our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Our comments also include non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measures are in our earnings release available on our website. On a US GAAP basis, for the third quarter of 2018, NOV reported revenues of $2.15 billion and net income of $1 million. Our use of the term EBITDA throughout this morning's call corresponds with the term, adjusted EBITDA, as defined in our earnings release.","Later in the call, we will host a question-and-answer session. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up to permit more participation.","Now, let me turn the call over to Clay.","Clay Williams","Thank you Loren. National Oilwell Varco's revenue in the third quarter of 2018 increased 2% and EBITDA increased $19 million to $245 million or 11.4% of revenue. While the company posted consolidated sequential improvement, our third quarter performance fell short of our expectations. This was due to a combination of market headwinds which arose late in the quarter in North America, a sharper than anticipated falloff or product sales into offshore markets and a couple of self-inflicted execution challenges, which we were focused on fixing.","Jose will go into these in more detail in just a few minutes, but generally our completion and production solutions segment saw completion services customers slow deliveries of pressure pumping units, spares and coiled tubing strings in September in North America. Some of these revenues were pushed out into the fourth quarter as deferred units are delivered but nevertheless, we recognize that our North American customers for this equipment are facing lower day rates in pricing. It began slowing acceptance of equipment on order and cutting expenditures to manage their cash flows over the past few weeks. The completion and production solutions segment's offshore products also showed significantly lower sequential sales, which were partially offset by much higher sales of fiberglass pipe and completion tools at good incrementals throughout the third quarter.","The wellbore technologies group achieved its expectations for revenue, but with a different mix owing to some tool shipments that didn't make it out by the end of the quarter, which was roughly offset by higher drill pipe and drilling fluid sales. Margins for the group were below expectations due to mix and inflationary forces around labor and steel. We been less successful than we anticipated at passing on higher costs as our customers are pushing back hard on price increases.","Rig Technologies posted better than expected margins compared to guidance despite lower revenues, owing to a higher mix of aftermarket revenue associated with land rig demand and offshore rig reactivation activities as well as better execution on offshore projects. These revenue gains were offset by lower than expected revenues on a lower margin land rig, which was expected to ship in the third quarter, but did not which shifted revenues to later periods.","Overall NOV's EBITDA improved 8% sequentially. While EBITDA is going in the right direction, we are focused on delivering better results as we continue to position the company for future growth, which we expect to unfold in 2018. Before Jose goes into our detailed financial results for the third quarter, I would like to spend a few minutes offering color into some of our major geographic markets, beginning with North America.","46% of NOV's consolidated revenues came from North America during the third quarter, reflecting sequential growth of 7% or $66 million. U.S. revenues increased 6% sequentially in Canada. Seasonal improvement produced 17% sequential growth. Within the North America directional drilling market, downhole tools saw increase sales with share gains in both bits and downhole drilling motors. Our high torque, high flow rate ERT motors continued to win share and we are seeing more operators rent motors directly from us as opposed to relying on directional drilling service providers to supply them.","The strong performance of our motors has led to a 30% increase in power section sales year-to-date and our first half price increases appear to be holding, at least for these products. On the other hand, MWD spares sales into North America slowed in the third quarter after strong performance through the first half. Drill pipe saw double-digit sequential revenue growth and 58% of our global drill pipe bookings were for the U.S. markets in the third quarter as we achieved our highest level of Delta premium connection sales to-date at $44 million.","Drill pipe demand still remains materially below its long-term averages despite customer owned inventory being at the lowest levels that we have seen since 2010. But customers are focused on Delta's lower cost of ownership as they resume buying. U.S. solids control rental jobs increased 6% in the quarter and we have been able to get selective price increases in North America for rig instrumentation services. Nevertheless, steel and labor costs are continuing to rise, eroding margin gains from price increases across many of our businesses.","Tuboscope posted North American revenue gains from both coating and inspection services. Higher steel prices are driving demand for our tubing and sucker rod reclamation services, which provide lower-cost used pipe and sucker rods, as compared to new. As I mentioned, our well intervention and equipment businesses within our completion and production solutions segment saw generally lower sales for everything except coiled tubing units for North America.","Pumping unit deliveries fell from 40 units in the second quarter to only 24 this quarter, but processing equipment like mixers and blenders still see comparatively strong demand. We secured new orders for about 27,000 horsepower in the third quarter for replacement units and we are seeing high interest in our new high-capacity coiled tubing units as well as our new 2.4 million pound SandBank proppant silo system, which we are introducing this quarter.","Coil tubing string sales declined in the third quarter at high decrementals hurt by higher steel costs. Within workover rigs, our customers were interested in taller mass and 1,000 horsepower pumps to reach down the longer laterals characterizing North American unconventional wells. We sold another super spec land drilling rig to a repeat customer from North America and we saw improvements in demand for spares for land contractors.","57% of our overall Rig Technologies capital orders in the third quarter were for land markets, partly in support of DC to AC land rig conversions as well as to add high torque top drives. We continue to promote super spec rigs to North American drillers, complete with NOVOS operating systems. Higher drilling day rates in North America around to $25,000 a day mean that they are very interested but smaller operators tell us that securing financing remains very challenging. Overall, our drilling contractor customers from North America seem to be willing to increase their spend while pressure pumpers are retrenching hard as we enter the fourth quarter.","On the production side, North America revenues for fiberglass flowlines are very strong, particularly in West Texas. Higher steel costs are helping shift more demand to composite fiberglass flowlines where NOV is the global leader. Our completion tools business sold its first new liner hanger product into the North American market in the third quarter.","Midstream pipeline valves and closures are also seeing brisk demand within our PFT group offset by lower demand for artificial lift products as many producers in Canada and elsewhere appear to be moving a little more towards gas lift. The PFT group won a nice order for 93 reciprocating pump packages for a major U.S. pipeline operator during the quarter and we are seeing high interest in separators and sand traps for the North American market for the group as well.","Turning to international markets. Overall National Oilwell Varco's revenues declined 2% sequentially mostly due to lower offshore production equipment sales. Middle East activity has been steady. NOV's consolidated revenues for the Middle East and North Africa totaled 14% of our third quarter mix and were roughly flat sequentially, with lower rig offset by higher wellbore technologies revenues. During the third quarter, we saw strong demand for drilling motors, roller reamers and fishing tool packages, including our Wide Catch overshot grow to support new drilling programs across the Middle East, North Africa region.","Bit sales declined following large sales into Algeria and Kuwait in the second quarter, but we did win a large three-year tender in North Africa during the third quarter and MWD sales improved there as well. 27% of our third quarter total global drill pipe orders were from the Middle East, North Africa region. However, we saw the sale of one string of wired drill pipe into the Middle East actually slip into the fourth quarter as the operator pushed it's spud date for this pipe back a quarter.","Pressure pumping aftermarket sales improved sequentially in the region offset somewhat by lower coiled tubing sales. But demand generally for stimulation equipment across the region appears to be rising. Demand for fiberglass tubulars is also high, again helped by higher steel costs shifting demand to composites. We are currently commissioning our new fiberglass tubular production plant in Saudi Arabia.","Our completion tools business sold its i-Frac system and burst port subs to a national oil company in the Middle East during the quarter but planned shipments of a large pumps skid order into Kuwait by PFT were delayed. Nearby, in Central Asia, we had successful test runs for our new rotary steerable offerings and MWD tools. Unfortunately though, these were completed after the end of the quarter, so again revenue was deferred into Q4. We expect Q4 sales of rotary steerables and MWD into Russia and China to be strong while bit sales will slow seasonally.","Our completion production solutions segment benefited from higher sequential shipments of fiberglass pipe into China and Russia and our completion tools business in Russia remains strong as operators are adopting our burst port subs and liner hangers, even though the oilfield market has been under pressure related to FX and budget constraints. Within Rig Technologies, we are also pursuing larger opportunities around the Caspian region.","Turning to Latin America. NOV's revenues declined 2% sequentially and made up about 10% of our consolidated revenue mix. Gains in Mexico were offset by declines in Brazil. In Mexico, we are benefiting from leasing rotary steerable tools and MWD equipment and drilling motors to an independent directional drilling services firm. In Argentina, we saw significant pressure on Tuboscope and well site services related to the devaluation of the peso, but we were nevertheless able to post sequential gains owing to fiberglass pipe shipments and rig sales into the region. And completion tools sold its first i-Frac order for three wells there during the third quarter. Despite the FX challenges in Argentina that Jose will address in a moment, the country remains a key focus area for us as operators there seek to replicate North American unconventional successes in the Vaca Muerta formation.","Finally turning to the offshore. NOV saw revenues decline 1% sequentially driving our offshore mix down to 33% of consolidated revenues or about $720 million. As we noted last quarter, we continue to see positive signs of offshore recovery. XL Systems, for instance, which makes conductor pipe connections, posted its fifth quarter in a row of book-to-bills north of 100%. Orders today for these products speak to offshore drilling plans for late 2019, early 2020, given lead times for specialized heavy wall, large diameter pipe from international mills. This business, like many other businesses, is having only mixed success on recouping higher steel costs through higher pricing, but the growing volumes of demand are a clear indicator of expected future growth in offshore drilling.","Rig Technologies is seeing rising inquiries in spares bookings on rig reactivations for the offshore, including larger more complex reactivations. Overall, spares bookings increased 7% for rig, our fourth quarter in a row of rising bookings and SPS work improved $7 million sequentially as contractors are seeing rising levels of rig tenders, particularly for jackups. This fits with what we are hearing from operators, who tell us that they are moving towards more FIDs and higher levels of activity, given higher stable oil prices.","After a few years of low activity, offshore market needs to get back to work. We are not seeing a lot of urgency here yet, but inquiries and tenders and studies appear to be accelerating. So in the meantime, we continue to pursue field development projects in our subsea flexible pipe unit in the face of tough competition and price pressure. Likewise, our wellstream processing group within PFT is bidding fluids processing skids into several offshore projects and our Turret Mooring Systems Group, which won a nice order this quarter for the Jubilee Field in West Africa, is doing the same. While we are still probably a couple of quarters away from significant activity level increases in the offshore, our customers' actions point to their early stages of an offshore recovery in the works underpinned by higher oil prices and growing global energy demand, all while we continue to invest in new drilling and production automation technologies, subsea water treatment technologies and fluids processing technologies to position ourselves for the coming recovery.","Although the near-term outlook is clouded by North American activity challenges, we think the coming year will see this reverse and 2019 more likely to bring broad-based offshore and international recovery. It is clear that North American producers have embraced capital discipline and are returning more cash to their shareholders, while also facing short term logistical constraints in certain unconventional basins. IOC's are continuing to reduce their per barrel development costs offshore after cutting CapEx by half since 2014 and are also exhibiting restraint and returning more capital to their shareholders. And many NOC's are struggling with outdated rig fleets and methods, while facing inadequate cash flows to fund both drilling needs and government takes.","Globally, oil companies in all regions have been cautious and measured in their drilling and development budgets through a difficult downturn as they navigated extraordinarily challenging commodity price declines. Meanwhile, global crude inventory overhangs have now evaporated and oil prices have doubled, in fact nearly tripled. While I think the next couple of quarters will be challenging, we also see more signs of recovery and improving macro tailwinds bolstered by stronger price decks.","To our employees who are listening, I want to tell you how much we appreciate all that you have been doing to take care of our customers around the globe that depend on you. You are part of a great NOV team and you make me, Jose and Loren very, very proud. Thank you.","Now, I will turn it over to Jose.","Jose Bayardo","Thank you Clay. To recap the quarter, NOV's EBITDA improved $19 million to $245 million and operating profit increased by $21 million to $73 million. However net income declined sequentially to $1 million due to higher other expense and a higher tax rate.","Other expense increased $17 million, primarily due to FX losses from the continuing devaluation of the Argentine peso against the U.S. dollar. Argentina was designated as a highly inflationary economy requiring us to change our peso currency functional ledgers to U.S. dollar functional during the third quarter, a change that has the unintended effect of amplifying the impact of movements between the Argentine peso and the U.S. dollar on our income statement. Other expense also reflects a small loss associated with a divestiture of a small non-core operation.","Pre-tax income totaled $33 million and we reported an income tax provision of $29 million. The outsized income tax expense is primarily the result of valuation allowances, which prevent us from fully recognizing tax credits and other increases in non-deductible expenses. As we previously mentioned, we will continue to have significant volatility in our effective tax rate until we begin reporting higher levels of pre-tax income.","One other item on the consolidated P&L worth pointing out is SG&A, which increased $17 million sequentially due to higher employee benefit and workers' compensation costs and an increase in property tax assessments. We expect to report a slight sequential increase in SG&A in the fourth quarter.","Looking at our operating segment detail. Lower inter-company sales led to an $11 million sequential decrease in revenue eliminations. This decrease along with lower compensation costs and a reduction in third-party service expense resulted in an $18 million EBITDA improvement at the eliminations and corporate cost line. Most of our business units sell products or services to at least one other business within NOV and the need for our inter-company sales are fairly obvious.","For example, if a customer orders a new drilling rig and wants it equipped with a full string of drill pipe, our drill pipe business unit will sell the string to our rig operation that will send one invoice to the customer. Some inter-company sales may be less obvious, such as Rig Technologies providing certain engineering, procurement and manufacturing for large components associated with our Seabox subsea water treatment system that is sold by our completion and production solutions segment.","We regularly leverage the scale and diversity of our operations around the globe to manufacture or fabricate or assemble products in plants where we can be the most efficient. Frequently, this results in sales across segment lines. The amount of inter-company revenue can fluctuate quite a bit from quarter-to-quarter as it did in Q3, due to a decrease in transactions between Rig Technologies and CAPS. As all of you know, total third-party revenue and profit is reflected in our consolidated results.","For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue eliminations will remain in line with Q3 and corporate costs to increase approximately $5 million. Cash flow from operations was $190 million and capital expenditures totaled $71 million. We did not complete any acquisitions during the third quarter, but see the potential for several attractive transaction opportunities in the fourth quarter and the early part of 2019.","Turning to results for operations. Our wellbore technology segment generated $847 million in revenue in the third quarter of 2018, an increase of $54 million or 7%, in line with our expectations. Segment revenue continued to meaningfully outpace the rig count in the U.S., but this growth was partially offset by a 12% decline in Latin America, mostly due to the devaluation of the Argentine peso, resulting in 2% growth in the Western Hemisphere. More signs of life are emerging in other international markets allowing the segment to post second quarter in a row of double-digit growth in the Eastern Hemisphere at 17% for Q3.","EBITDA increased $2 million sequentially to $135 million or 15.9% percent of sales. While we noted on our last call that rising inflationary forces were impacting our business, we had lower than expected success in passing costs through to customers in North America. We also had mix changes resulting in poor EBITDA flow-through. Even though drilling activity has not been materially impacted by the takeaway constraints in West Texas and the resulting slowdown in completions activity, it is difficult for an E&P drilling department to tell their executive management team that they are accepting price increases while their fellow completion department is boasting of price concessions from completion service providers.","Clay mentioned that our downhole tools business unit realized solid growth from all major regions of the world, outside of Latin America, driving a 5% sequential increase overall. The business unit is also seeing more demand from the offshore markets and received orders for two 8045 TorqueMaster units used to make and break threaded connections on offshore rigs, the first such orders received since mid-2015.","The downhole tools business also continues to advance new technologies. Our SelectShift downhole adjustable motor, which offers the ability to adjust the motor bend setting while downhole has been undergoing field trials in the Permian and the Bakken. The tool completed 13 runs, drilled over 45,000 feet and completed over 100 motor bend changes while downhole. Use of the tool is delivering substantial increases in rate of penetration and reductions in vibration, which should meaningfully improve economics for our customers.","The business unit also recently began field trials for its next generation two-and-seven-eighths inch coiled tubing Agitator. The new tool is designed to generate significantly higher pressure pulses than earlier generations of the product. This is important, because it can significantly increase the distance for which coiled tubing can effectively mill plugs in extended reach laterals.","Our ReedHycalog business saw a 5% sequential improvement in revenue during the third quarter. Share gains for fixed cutter bits and increased Canadian activity after the seasonal Q2 breakup were partially offset by hurricane related slowdowns in the Gulf of Mexico. Unlike other businesses in this segment, revenue decreased slightly in the Eastern Hemisphere after realizing strong growth in the prior quarter. Improved sales into the UAE, Qatar and Turkey were offset by sequential decrease in sales into other countries.","This group is achieving success with its directional drilling in downhole measurement tools. We have recently commenced rotary steerable field trials in three countries. Two of the trials are ongoing but one successfully completed resulting in the sale of two VectorEXAKT rotary steerable kits to the directional driller. Additionally, we have received our first orders for our symmetric propagation resistivity LWD tool.","With a successful commercialization of these products, we have filled two critical holes in our directional drilling tool portfolio and we are now positioned to capitalize on the compelling directional drilling tool market opportunity. We are also advancing our closed loop drilling automation systems, selectively executing our North American land projects and preparing for a major ramp-up in North Sea activity with several jobs expected to begin by year-end.","As Clay noted, our drill pipe business recorded its second straight double-digit percent sequential increase in revenue, but integration costs associated with our acquisition of Vallourec's drill pipe business limited EBITDA flow-through during Q3. Bookings decreased slightly from the second quarter but remained over $100 million for the third quarter in a row. We expect a traditional seasonal Q4 slowdown in drill pipe bookings as many customers have exhausted drill pipe capital budgets for 2018. Notwithstanding the anticipated one quarter pullback in orders, we believe customers will expand budgets in 2019 as their inventory levels continue to decline.","Our Tuboscope business realized a 5% sequential revenue increase in coating services, driven by increasing sales of drill pipe, partially offset by record Thru-Kote sleeve sales in Q2 that did not repeat. Tuboscope's global inspection service revenues decrease slightly. Strong demand for tubular inspection services in North America was offset by decreasing revenue in Latin America due to currency devaluations.","Lastly, our well site services business posted a 9% sequential increase in revenue, led by strong sales of drilling fluids in the U.S., our well spill containment systems and solids control services in North America and Europe. Improved sales were partially offset by lower revenues and on higher volumes in Latin America as a result of currency devaluations against the U.S. dollar. Demand for solids control services for offshore markets remains challenged.","However we saw our backlog for our prime inspection services increase to 12 jobs from two during the third quarter. Prime inspection services are detailed assessments of the condition and performance of solids control, fluid processing and waste management systems on offshore rigs. The service informs drilling contractors of what equipment needs to be repaired, replaced or upgraded in order to ensure solids control and waste management packages operate reliably and efficiently. This is another clear indication that offshore drilling contractors are preparing to get back to work, as Clay mentioned a few minutes ago.","For the fourth quarter, we expect a strong momentum in most of our Wellbore Technologies businesses to more than offset any softness in fourth quarter activity levels, resulting in a 2% to 3% sequential increase in revenue. We anticipate a better mix of business and slightly improved success in passing on increased inflationary cost to our customers, resulting in incremental EBITDA margins between 30% and 35% during the fourth quarter.","Our completion and production solutions segment generated $735 million in revenue in the third quarter, a decrease of $3 million sequentially. Slowing demand for pressure pumping equipment and sharper than anticipated declines in our offshore focused businesses more than offset strong growth in our fiberglass and completion tools businesses. An improved mix of product sales led to a $5 million increase in EBITDA to $99 million or 13.5% of sales. Shipments of $439 million exceeded our bookings of $372 million, providing us with an 85% book-to-bill. Total segment backlog at quarter-end was $880 million.","Sales in our intervention and stimulation equipment business fell sharply late in the third quarter. As anticipated, revenue from sales for coiled tubing equipment increased sequentially but not to the full extent we expected as deliveries of several large coiled tubing spreads slipped into the fourth quarter. The modest growth in coiled tubing equipment sales was more than offset by significantly reduced demand for pressure pumping units and associated aftermarket sales.","Wireline equipment deliveries also fell short of expectations due to a combination of customer change orders on several wireline skids and manufacturing challenges. The decrease in revenue also resulted in high decremental margins as inflationary pressures on steel, aluminum, hydraulic components and labor compounded the business unit's challenges. Q3 bookings declined 24% sequentially, resulting in a 69% book-to-bill for the quarter.","Demand for coiled tubing equipment remained strong and, as Clay mentioned, we are still seeing limited opportunities for additional pressure pump unit sales, primarily for replacements or backup units. Demand remained steady for other pressure pumping support equipment and wireline equipment bookings remain strong globally. However, U.S. customers are becoming noticeably more cautious as a result of the slowdown in completion activity in West Texas. So while we expect to ship the Q3 unit deferrals in the fourth quarter, we may see additional pushback in the fourth quarter.","Our fiberglass systems business unit posted a 23% sequential increase in revenue with strong incremental margins despite inflationary pressures on raw materials and wages. The business unit shipped major projects of jointed pipe into China, Russia and West Texas and delivered large orders of our Fiberspar spoolable composite pipe into Argentina, Oman and the U.S. As expected, bookings for the quarter returned above the $100 million threshold, an increase of 44% over an uncharacteristically low Q2.","While global demand for our corrosion-proof composite pipe remains strong and our backlog is solid, we were recently notified by our supplier of a critical resin used to make our flexible pipe that it had experienced a major plant failure which will persist into December. Consequently, there is a significant global shortage of this resin, which we expect will result in total business unit revenues falling back to the levels we saw in the second quarter. We anticipate high decremental margins associated with the revenue decline due to the additional absorption challenges we expect to face in our Fiberspar manufacturing plants.","Our completion tools business posted its second quarter in a row of double-digit percentage growth. It is garnering market share gains in a number of markets around the world as a result of our innovative product offering and our ability to leverage NOV's global infrastructure and customer relationships. Our process and flow technologies business unit saw revenues decline 6% sequentially. Strong demand for reciprocating pumps and chokes from midstream applications in North America, spherical separation equipment in the U.S. and pump packages in Africa and Southeast Asia were offset by weakness in Canada, delayed equipment deliveries into Nigeria and Russia and challenging market conditions for the business unit's offshore oriented well stream processing operation.","Our subsea production systems business unit saw a significant sequential decrease in revenue, which was greater than expected due to a customer delayed delivery and new project orders coming in much later in the quarter than planned. Bookings also remained soft with the business unit posting an 81% book-to-bill during the quarter. Notwithstanding the ongoing challenges, there are encouraging data points for the offshore businesses in our completion and production solutions segment. Our floating production systems business unit realized a slight sequential increase in revenue during the third quarter and more importantly had a book-to-bill in excess of 200%. Our XL Systems' conductor pipe connector unit achieved the highest backlog ever recorded for this business.","Lastly, tendering activity in each of our offshore businesses within this segment is materially higher today than it was at this time last year. While we do not yet see much urgency from our offshore customer base, as Clay mentioned, we believe market dynamics are improving and our operations are well positioned for the inevitable recovery in the offshore. Looking at the fourth quarter, we expect to see more demand from midstream production equipment, modest improvements in our offshore operations, a pickup in Q3 deferred deliveries of coiled tubing and wireline equipment and higher conductor pipe sales which should roughly offset the impacts from the slowdown of completion related activity in West Texas and raw material supply challenges in our fiberglass operations.","Our rig technology segment generated $637 million in revenue, a decrease of $14 million or 2%. Revenue out of backlog decreased $20 million to $256 million and EBITDA decreased $6 million to $78 million or 12.2% of sales. Margins came in better than guidance as a result of revenue mix. After achieving three quarters in a row of improved bookings, new orders decreased to $151 million, a sequential decline of 32% excluding the $1.8 billion in Saudi rig orders received in the second quarter. We exited the quarter with $3.4 billion in backlog for the segment. While bookings for capital equipment were softer in Q3, we see growing opportunities to support our North American land customers by providing upgrades to existing rigs and through occasional sales of super spec rigs into the market where utilization of these rigs remains near 100%.","In the international markets, operators continue to advance tenders for land rigs in the Middle East, Asia and North Africa. We are realizing rapidly growing demand for our NOVOS operating system. To-date, we have sold 103 NOVOS packages to a customer base that includes 11 land and five offshore drilling contractors. We also recently commissioned our first NOVOS installation on an offshore floater for one of these contractors and it is performing well. We, along with certain customers, have written over 30 applications for the control system and are seeing more pull-through sales from E&P operators who recognize the value of this unique process automation system.","While offshore contracting is slowly improving, the market remains oversupplied and we anticipate few newer term new builds apart from potential opportunities for niche applications, but we see growing opportunities to help our customers reactivate and upgrade rig fleets. As Clay mentioned, our offshore customers are seeing a significant amount of tendering activity and are working to make sure rigs are well positioned to go back to work. This work is driving demand for such items as our Crown Motion Compensation Systems, for which we booked an additional three orders in the third quarter.","For the fourth quarter, we expect continued progress on offshore projects and land rig upgrades for the U.S. market. Land rigs, which slipped from Q3 to ship and a seasonal pickup in service and repair work in our aftermarket operations to drive a revenue increase of 4% to 6% with incremental EBITDA margins in the mid-teens. While there will be near-term difficulties associated with year-end capital budget exhaustion and take away constraints in certain U.S. basins, we currently expect to realize a slight sequential improvement in our fourth quarter consolidated operating results. And, as Clay mentioned, we believe significantly improved macro fundamentals are setting the stage for a broader recovery in 2019.","We will now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Mr. James West with Evercore ISI.","James West","Hi. Good morning guys.","Clay Williams","Good morning James.","Jose Bayardo","Good morning James.","James West","Clay or Jose, I was wondering if you could kind of bracket for us, we share the bullishness around the offshore markets in the rig reactivations that you are starting to see and what does it cost for, I think these offshore drillers really went to the bottom of the barrel on spares and things like that during the downturn, because they had to. So to reactivate a cold stacked rig today, whether it's a jackup or a floater, can you give us some idea of what that would be in terms of revenue for NOV?","Clay Williams","Yes. It's a question we get frequently, James, but it's kind of like asking how long is a piece of rope, hence it depends on a lot of things. First, what condition was that rig in when it was stacked? How hard was it run prior? Secondly, what conditions was it stacked under? And so, were doors welded shut? Were dehumidifiers put onboard? Did you have a crew going around sort of bumping the electronics and cycling through the equipment periodically? And then, thirdly, how long has it been stacked?","We believe that after two, three years, the cost of reactivating that rig starts to go up exponentially. So there are a lot of variables here. And what I would tell you is, what we have seen is, it costs across all over the map. Generally though, given how difficult it is to store this complex equipment in salt air and this is equipment that we have been building through the last 10, 15 years, it really wasn't designed to be stacked. None of us really know.","So I would generally take the over. We do have one data point of an offshore rig that we are working on now that's basically a $40 million ticket to us. So I think the industry is going to find out as it goes back to work. But there's a lot of work for NOV and our competitors to do to put these rigs back to work.","James West","Okay. But you would say that some of the estimates that have been out there from some of your customer base, generally speaking, do you think the over is probably more likely now? It's not going to matter to really investors, because the rig is going back to work, but those probably are going to be a series of overruns, cost overruns?","Clay Williams","Yes. I am not referring to any specific estimate or any specific comment by a customer, but just generally taking equipment off the beach and putting it into a shipyard and really opening the hood and seeing what's under there. Until you do that, none of us really know. And I think even the drilling contractors wouldn't acknowledge this. There's still some uncertainty in that.","But nevertheless, I think we continue to move towards a world where more and more rigs are going to get reactivated and we have had several data points in our prepared remarks a few minutes ago around this. And so this is kind of where it starts. We alluded to it last quarter. We kind of saw it build through the third quarter. And so again, we are still a long way from a robust recovery, but it begins with drilling contractors looking at reactivating rigs and we are seeing clear signs that many of them are really thinking hard about it.","James West","And Clay, what's the timeline on a reactivation? When do they need to talk to you about the equipment versus when the rigs is supposed to, it should be back on contract and working?","Clay Williams","The sooner, the better.","James West","I am sure.","Clay Williams","We are pretty responsive. We certainly have some slack capacity. However it does take a lot of time, a lot of engineering effort that goes into these rigs. And actually in terms of tangibly what we are hearing from our customers, it's more along the lines of that. We are doing more engineering upfront work around these rigs to see what's needed and that's starting to go. But it's not a trivial undertaking.","And if history is a guide and I am going way back now, but usually when these stacked rigs go into shipyards and actually do get reactivated out of warm stacking or cold stacking, usually projects tend to run over budget and over time. I would also add that, it's quite ubiquitous, we do have some slack in the capabilities right now, but like virtually anything in our portfolio when things inflect, they tend to inflect pretty sharply and people come through the door at the same time.","So one of the things that we are already talking about and worrying about a little bit is a good problem to have when it arises, is how do we expand that capacity, because we are certain that will happen at some point. And things will get tight in a hurry. But we are looking forward to addressing that challenge.","James West","Sure. Got it. Thank guys.","Clay Williams","Thanks James.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from James Wicklund with Credit Suisse.","Clay Williams","Hi Jim.","James Wicklund","Hi guys. Good morning. International expectations out there seem to be for either high single-digit or low double-digit growth. The U.S. is expected to recover, you guys note that. Which one do you think in 2019 wins the race in terms of who grows the fastest? And which one is best for NOV? Is it better if international grows by 11% or the U.S. grows by 11%? Which benefits you guys the most?","Clay Williams","That's a hard question, Jim.","James Wicklund","Well, we don't have the easy ones, Clay. You know that.","Clay Williams","No. The good news is, NOV is certainly exposed to both. We are introducing new technologies to both. We have a lot of optionality with respect to both. And so I think that's all good. We are happy. I am happy with growth anywhere and I think that's good for the portfolio. Like I said, we have continued to position ourselves around unconventional technologies that in the past three or four years have clearly been outpacing activity gains in other areas.","I think 2019, you are going to continue to see more international customers look at employing these in their respective areas of operation. We are already seeing that in Argentina. We are seeing growing interest in the Middle East. And so, I think that trend is going to steadily kind of move ahead.","The other big opportunity for NOV overseas is the fact that the unconventional share revolution in North America started by replacing all of the older rigs with new modern AC rig technology and the Eastern Hemisphere still has a long, long way to go in that respect. And so, I think we are kind of in very early innings of seeing that happen as well.","So I can't do it. I don't know which one wins. I hope they both win.","James Wicklund","The tie of high numbers.","Clay Williams","But NOV really, again, we are positioning for that sort of recovery. And rolling into 2019 with materially higher oil prices than we have had over the past couple of years and a recognition of under-investment across kind of the global oil and gas infrastructure is setting up a pretty good backdrop for 2019.","James Wicklund","Okay. That's very helpful. I appreciate it. And when we talk about offshore, the improvement has been somewhat limited really so far to jackups and more shallow rigs. There have been more tenders for deepwater. But going into IOC budget season, some of that has to be just updating at least for budget submission. Can you talk about the scale differences between the work you do on jackups versus floaters? I know floaters are a whole lot more expensive, but just in terms of the workflow we see out there? I know you sell a lot of equipment to the deepwater floaters, but in terms of reactivations and the work you are doing, can you talk about the difference as we transition from jackup and shallow water into floaters over the next couple of years?","Clay Williams","Yes. Clearly the floaters are a bigger opportunity around reactivations. There is a lot more sophisticated equipment onboard, but nevertheless we have got good opportunities with jackups as well. In fact, we just introduced a new crane design that is kind of special fit for purpose for jackups that can be retrofitted and kind of improve their capabilities. So the opportunity is in both arenas, but the floaters typically are a little bigger ticket item for us.","James Wicklund","Okay. Gentlemen, thank you very much.","Clay Williams","Thank you Jim","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Byron Pope with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Byron Pope","Good morning guys.","Clay Williams","Good morning Byron.","Byron Pope","The continued topline growth for international wellbore technology suggest that you guys are having good success in terms of being that enabler to some of the independent service companies there. But Clay, I was struck by something you touched on with regard, it seems like some of your U.S. customers are purchasing some downhole tools directly as opposed to using it through directional drillers. So is that a sustainable trend and one that's in its early stages? Could you just provide some more color on your thought process there?","Clay Williams","Yes. I found it interesting too. We are seeing more components of the bottom hole assembly being accessed directly by the oil and gas companies that were probably previously lumped into kind of a directional drilling tool package. And by the way, we are happy to sell to either. But what it speaks to is that in certain North American markets, customers are disaggregating this a little bit and buying on -- I think, we provide the best drilling motors out there in terms of quality and longevity and value. And I think that's being recognized by some of the E&P companies that are sort of breaking that out of the packages. And so just kind of an interesting trend around disaggregation of the tools away from the service.","Byron Pope","Okay. And then just one additional question as it relates to thinking about the steel cost and the impacts there. From the way you guys described in your prepared remarks, it seems as though it's most acute in wellbore technologies? Or is it more broad-based than that? And at some point it seems as though the ability to get through some surcharges would be easier. So how do you think about that in terms of --?","Clay Williams","Yes. I think we are dealing with the first full quarter of higher steel costs arising out of the Section 232 tariffs. There are three business units here that are most affected by it, drill pipe, which is in wellbore technologies, but also XL Systems' conductor pipe connections and our coiled tubing string business, quality tubing, which are both in completion and production solutions. All three are kind of having mixed results with regards to passing on steel cost to their customers in terms of higher pricing. But I think we are going to achieve a little higher level of success as we work a little deeper into this and sort of adjust along the way.","One of the outcomes of all of this is that irrespective of where the steel actually comes from, we are seeing much higher steel prices across the board. And so it does show up really in all three segments to some degree but I would say those three product lines that I mentioned are most acute.","On the positive side, higher steel costs are actually helping our Tuboscope business that provides reclamation services around used tubulars and used sucker rods, because customers are saying, gosh, new sucker rods and new tubulars are so much more expensive. And so there we can inspect and reclaim tubulars and sucker rods coming out of existing wells for reuse and that's become incrementally more attractive.","And then likewise, our fiberglass and composite pipe business typically benefits when the cost of steel pipe rises incrementally, demand tends to shift more towards fiberglass and composite tubulars which offer, they are still more expensive, but the benefit is, is that they are not as susceptible to corrosion and so they tend to last much, much longer.","Byron Pope","That's really helpful, Clay. I appreciate it. We will see you all soon.","Clay Williams","All right. Thank you Byron.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Herbert with Simmons.","Bill Herbert","Good morning. Notwithstanding the slowdown in Q3 or relative to expectations, cash flow still strong. So you are on your way to becoming overcapitalized and you have mentioned that you are giving a lot of thought with regard to return of cash options. Clay and Jose, can you just give us your latest thinking on that front? Please. Thank you.","Jose Bayardo","Sure, Bill. It's Jose. And I will just say that nothing has really changed on that front except we are inching our way closer, as you described, with a continued healthy cash flow generation from the business. So as we have talked about before, by far the number one priority is making sure that the balance sheet is where it needs to be. It's certainly heading in the right direction and in great condition this quarter on an annualized basis.","Net debt-to-EBITDA, 1.45 times, we are very comfortable with that. Gross debt-to-EBITDA is about 2.77, so probably a little tiny, but higher than we wanted to be. But again, everything heading in the right direction. Outside of the balance sheet, it's about investing in compelling organic growth opportunities, which we have obviously ample cash flow to do that.","Then we look at, as we sort of exhaust those opportunities that put us into the realm of M&A. We were very active on the M&A front over the last several years with over 30 transactions, about $700 million that we spent on that. As we talked about last quarter, we sort of knew that the M&A environment was going to be a little soft in Q4, but we don't think that that's something that's going to be long-lived. We are pretty optimistic that more and more interesting opportunities are emerging here in Q4 and into early part of 2019.","But if they don't emerge and even if they do emerge and we spend at the same pace we have been spending over the last several years, we see ourselves having an excess of capital which we will then look to return to shareholders.","Bill Herbert","Okay. And two final quick ones from me. First, Clay, you mentioned execution challenges, which should ameliorate in Q4. What were those? And then secondly, Jose, expected revenues out of backlog for rig tech for the foreseeable future? Thank you.","Clay Williams","Yes. First, Bill, we had a number of things that we didn't quite get done building frankly by the end of the quarter and they didn't go out. We had some units particularly in the North American in the intervention and stimulation world that our customers really didn't want accept delivery of. So that's really not on us, but we had a few that we didn't quite get done and so a little disappointed in that. But good news is, they are done and should go in Q4. So we are working through those issues.","Jose Bayardo","And Bill, as it relates to revenue out of backlog for the fourth quarter, just for rig, we are looking at just a tiny bit over $280 million.","Bill Herbert","Thank you.","Clay Williams","All right. Thanks Bill.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sasha Sanwal with UBS.","Sasha Sanwal","Thank you guys and good morning.","Clay Williams","Good morning.","Sasha Sanwal","So just on wellbore, maybe without getting too much into specifics, would it be fair to say that margins for Grant Prideco are still significantly dilutive to overall margins, while maybe bits and downhole are above the average?","Clay Williams","Yes. We had some challenges in drill pipe. We had an acquisition earlier this year that was quite large. And so one of the drags on Q3 in drill pipe was the fact that we had some more integration cost flow through in the third quarter. Not big enough really to break out on a consolidated basis, but that was one challenge.","The second is that we inherited a lot of backlog there that's at very low margin. And so we have got to kind of work through that and ship that out. And that's a drill pipe that came in at that was diluted to our own drill pipe business.","And the third is that a part of the reason was the steel costs up for that business and in particular the raw materials, the green tubes and the tool joints that go into manufacturing that pipe are more expensive than we have in our base business. So the flow through for drill pipe was up as we mentioned, but the flow through was not nearly what it could have been, had we sort of had a more typical mix of our traditional Grant Prideco business.","With respect to the downhole tools business and the bits business, we referenced several different technologies in new products that we have been introducing across that business and really pretty strong growth in the third quarter and those businesses have continued to grow now for several quarters, more or less outpacing the rig count. And so really good base of new technologies that are really designed towards delivering wellbores that have lower torch velocity, that are more precisely geosteered into sweet spots of formations and getting some real traction with those. So a lot of things going in the right direction for our downhole tools business.","Sasha Sanwal","Thank you. And then just to follow-up, just to maybe touch on pricing briefly as well. So you made the point that it's difficult to kind of push through pricing kind of in this environment. So as we think about what the catalyst might be that might just make those conversations easier, does the Jan, Feb, kind of reset in E&P budgets, does that help? Or are we going to have to maybe wait till the back half of the year before we see a more meaningful turnaround in activity to drive those pricing discussions?","Jose Bayardo","Sasha, I will start and maybe Clay can chime in on this one as well. But one of things that I referred to in my prepared comments is just it's an unusual environment right now, right. We are continuing to see outpaced growth in demand for our drilling related products in our wellbore technologies segment. So that would typically be an environment which we could be very successful in passing on, at least passing on inflationary core cost to our customers.","But as I mentioned, it's just very unusual with the decline in pricing that's taking place on the completion side for our E&P contractors. So we think this is a very sort of temporary and transitory thing. As you know, first of all, pressure pumping and other completion services prices are probably approaching stabilization and once that takes place we can be a lot more optimistic and confident in terms of our ability to get those pricing concessions that we think we are deserving of.","Clay Williams","Yes. I mean ultimately it's all about scarcity at the risk of oversimplifying most products, most markets in oil field services are highly cyclical and as you are sort of tracing a path to the bottom of the cycle, everyone is focused on price and costs. And as you emerge from that, like a switch flips and everyone begins to become much more focused on time, so much that we provide into development and exploration activities is critical and you kind of have to have it all to spud your well and to develop your wells.","And so it feels like we are kind of knocking on the door of transitioning from that first world where everyone is very keenly focused on price into the world where everybody is focused on time. And we had some setbacks in the North American well completion world this quarter. But generally, I think the industry is moving towards that world of more scarcity.","Our customers are burning through their stocks of spare parts and inventory that we provide. They are burning through their drill pipe. They are burning through downhole components, through rigs. And so, I think generally we have got a fairly steady tailwind of moving back into a place where we have more pricing leverage and can do a better job overcoming higher steel cost.","Operator","Sasha, does that answer your question?","Sasha Sanwal","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Marshall Adkins with Raymond James.","Marshall Adkins","Good morning gentlemen. And I use that term liberally. Clay, I am going to ask you to speculate a little bit here. I know how much you like doing that. Let's assume oil prices stay roughly in these levels, $70-ish WTI, $80-ish Brent for the next few years. How do you see 2019 playing out generically? I am not asking for specifics on a subgroup in your businesses, but just generically how would you see it playing out in 2019? And then, wouldn't 2020 be meaningfully better than 2019, again assuming oil stays in roughly where it is now?","Clay Williams","Yes. First, I am a little more bullish on oil prices generally than the premise of the question. After four years of underspending and all the restraint in capital discipline that's in the space, I think, that that's going to have to turn around to more activity in the oilfield to continue to provide growing demand.","But given the premise of your question, I think oil companies are going to have to figure out how to replace reserves. I think they are going to have to get after developing more reserves in the offshore, in particular. I think take away constraints in a couple of the unconventional basins across North America are going to work themselves through in 2019. And I think that sets up, I agree with you, I think 2020 is even better.","Marshall Adkins","But in 2019, is that early 2019 or late 2019?","Clay Williams","In terms of improvements?","Marshall Adkins","Yes.","Clay Williams","I think early 2019. I mean here in the near term and you have heard this from others, I think a lot of people are kind of running out of 2018 budgets. I think E&P companies don't want to tell Wall Street that they want to up CapEx until they get into 2019 with their 2019 budgets. And so we are facing a little bit of near term pressure here in the fourth quarter around that. But I think once we get into 2019, I do think you are going to see people reload budgets, get back to buying. We have heard this from several different customers for different products that we sell. And so I think once we get into 2019, we are going to get kind of back on the path to more growth.","Marshall Adkins","Okay. My second one, I want to kind of shift gears here. We all kind of know that the U.S. business, I think, we are all pretty bullish on where the oil prices are. But I guess the surprise here is, as you are starting to see a lot of neat things going on in rig tech. So, help paint a picture here on the relative importance between rig reactivations, managed pressure drilling to me seems to be a bigger deal that a lot of people aren't paying attention to and you are in the heart of that and then obviously restocking of aftermarket? So all of those three, maybe some that I forgot or hadn't put in there, how relevant are those in terms of 2019 and 2020 going forward?","Clay Williams","Yes. It's really, I think, setting up for a better outlook for rig, although orders were down in the third quarter after three quarters of growth. We did see our mix continue to move upwards with respect to aftermarket, which is a higher margin opportunity for us. In fact, it was a little more than 50% of the rig mix in the third quarter. And we have had our fourth quarter of higher spares bookings with a little more offshore flavor to it in the third quarter, which reflects the fact, I think a lot of the offshore drillers have depleted a lot of their spare parts and they look at putting these rigs back to work.","So to kind of sum up the outlook for rig, you have got day rates around $25,000 in North America, which is right at the cusp of justifying new build super spec rigs. You have got some of the larger drillers now upgrading rigs, converting from DC to AC and moving towards the super spec rig category, which is at a very high level of utilization. So you got a lot of financial health across North American drillers.","Internationally, we have talked a lot about more modern rigs going into Argentina, opportunities in the Middle East, there's three or four major tenders going on across North Africa, the Middle East and India currently. And so that's picking up. So on the whole, the rig business, I think, is on a much firmer footing both land and offshore. And within the offshore too, I don't know if this will happen in Q4, but we have got a couple of large opportunities in the Eastern Hemisphere, which if they don't show up in Q4, I think we are going to show up early in 2019 that we are feeling better and better about.","So on the whole, I feel pretty good about where we are with rigs. Good acceptance of our NOVOS operating system, a good acceptance of our condition-based monitoring, aftermarket equipment maintenance that reduces total cost of ownership, interest in upgrading certain aspects of rigs. So on the whole, I think, we are in as good a position as we have been in for a couple of years here.","Marshall Adkins","Thanks guys.","Clay Williams","Thank you Marshall.","Operator","Thank you. And, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our Q&A session for today. I would like to turn the call back to management for any final remarks.","Clay Williams","Thank you Carmen and thanks to all of you for joining us. Goodbye.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program and you may all disconnect. Have a wonderful weekend."],"15516":["National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV) Q2 2012 Earnings Call July 26, 2012  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Loren Singletary - Vice President of Investor & Industry Relations","Merrill A.

Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Operator","Welcome to the National Oilwell Varco 2012 Second Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Christine, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Loren Singletary, Vice President of Investor and Industry Relations. You may begin.","Loren Singletary","Thank you, Christine, and welcome, everyone, to the National Oilwell Varco Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. With me today is Pete Miller, our Chairman, CEO and President of National Oilwell Varco; and Clay Williams, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin this discussion of National Oilwell Varco's financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2012, please note that some of the statements we make during this call may contain forecasts, projections and estimates, including but not limited to comments about our outlook for the company's business. These are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws based on limited information as of today, which is subject to change. They are subject to risk and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. No one should assume that these forward-looking statements remain valid later in the quarter or later in the year. I refer you to the latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q National Oilwell Varco has on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a more detailed discussion of the major risk factors affecting our business. Further information regarding these, as well as supplemental financial and operating information may be found within our press release, on our website at www.nov.com or in our filings with the SEC.","[Operator Instructions].","Now I will turn the call over to Pete for his opening comments.","Merrill A. Miller","Thank you, Loren. Earlier today, National Oilwell Varco announced second quarter 2012 earnings of $1.42 per share, on a record revenues of $4.7 billion. Excluding onetime transaction cost of $28 million, earnings were $626 million or $1.46 per fully diluted share. Operating profit for the second quarter was a record $907 million or 19.2% of sales. These results compare very favorably to the results of the second quarter 2011, and are continuing proof of the efficacy of our business model, our M&A strategy and our extensive product and service offerings to our customers.","Additionally, today, we announced the quarter-ending backlog of $11.3 billion. Organic new orders for the quarter were $2.2 billion, and new orders through acquisition totaled $500 million, for total new orders of $2.73 billion, or 1.5x book-to-bill ratio. We're very excited about these results and they demonstrate the continued excellent execution and performance of our employees around the world.","I will come back in a few moments for some brief comments regarding our operations, but at this time, I will turn it over to Clay to provide more color on our results. Clay?","Clay C. Williams","Thank you, Pete. National Oilwell Varco produced solid results in its second quarter, delivering $1.46 per fully diluted shares in earnings, up 28% from a year ago, and up $0.02 or about 1% from last quarter, excluding transaction charges from all periods. Revenues were a record $4.7 billion, up 35% from the year earlier quarter and up 10% from the first quarter of 2012. All 3 segments produced record quarterly revenue during the second quarter.","Operating profit x transaction charges was a record $907 million, up 27% from the second quarter of last year, and up 3% sequentially, and consolidated operating margins for the second quarter were 19.2%, excluding transaction charges. EBITDA was a record $1,084,000,000 for the second quarter.","We have been investing heavily in our businesses, both organically and through M&A, and our second quarter results include a partial quarter for 6 businesses acquired during the period. These, together with the seasonal downturn we see every year in Canada resulted in sequentially lower margins, down 130 basis points from the first quarter. Operating leverage or flow-through was 6% on a sequential revenue gain, and 16% on a year-over-year sales increase as a result.","Within our Distribution & Transmission segment, we were very pleased to acquire the Wilson Distribution business from Schlumberger, and Ensco, a Canadian electrical wire and cable distributor which, together, contribute about $190 million for a few weeks during the quarter. And just last week, we completed our previously announced acquisition of CE Franklin, another leading Canadian distribution business. These 3 businesses will serve to more than double the size of our Distribution & Transmission segment and more importantly, enhance NOV's distribution channels across North America, opening up new channels for NOV products into midstream and downstream markets.","We expect to achieve meaningful efficiencies over the next 18 months through combining ERP systems and securing greater volume purchasing leverage. Integration has proceeded quickly and smoothly so far and we are pleased to welcome the CE Franklin, Wilson and Ensco employees into the NOV family.","Within the Rig Technology segment, the second quarter saw us add NKT Flexibles to our subsea production equipment business, which complements our APL turret mooring systems and other FPSO package components. Demand for subsea equipment appears to be building after a slow 2011, and we have signed contracts for about $200 million in turret mooring systems, since June 30, following a light bookings quarter in Q2.","Recent third quarter -- third-party reports from Quest Offshore, DDB Bank, Douglas Westwood and others point to 100-plus FPSO installations through 2016, which were nearly double the existing fleet. With leading products in turret mooring systems and flexible flow lines, risers and jumpers for the subsea, NOV is well-positioned to support this future growth.","The Rig Technology segment also acquired Interflow, a leading provider of wells servicing equipment in Canada during the second quarter, which is being integrated into our well intervention and stimulation equipment group. We're excited about the new frac blenders, and pumpers, and cementers and other well service products and capacity this business brings for our franchise. We effectively sold out our coil tubing equipment for the remainder of 2012.","During the second quarter, we began to see a decline in new orders for pressure-pumping equipments, but rising orders for coil tubing and wire line units nearly completely offset this decline. Same-store bookings x acquisition effects fell only 3% sequentially for this group, so the business has held up reasonably well. Nevertheless, we expect demand for pressure-pumping equipment to continue to face headwinds in the short run, giving slowing demand for pressure pumping services in North America. We expect this to be partially offset by international markets. Demand has continued to grow in Russia, China and the Middle East. Interflow, together with recent expansion CapEx, further strengthens NOV's already formidable position in the supply of critical hydraulic fracturing stimulation technologies that make shale play economics work.","The Petroleum Services & Supplies segment acquired Zap-Lok Pipeline Systems within our Tuboscope unit late in the second quarter. Its revenue contribution during the quarter was therefore minimal, but we expect its low cost mechanical pipe connection technology to contribute meaningfully to Tuboscope's Thru-Kote and UV sleeve connections, and internal tubing coating products in the future by growing through our extensive international infrastructure.","Finally, the Well Sites Services unit of PSNS acquired a small company which holds patented technology using our water-based drilling fluids products.","All in, we spent $2 billion in cash for these businesses in the second quarter and expected after-tax return on capital of approximately 14%. We expect to continue to find and close attractive acquisitions and believe we find ourselves in a sweet spot in M&A. Sellers have the right mix of prosperity and fear, and we have a high level of conviction in our outlook for oilfield markets. We also have a strong balance sheet and a proven record of solid cash flow. As a group, these acquisitions closed in the second quarter illustrate well our expected returns and our strategies around capital deployment. First, they were all in oil and gas and touch customers and markets we know well. Second, they are simple business plans. Some are large consolidating transactions which we expect to yield meaningful efficiencies in economies of scales. Others are investments in new adjacent technologies that we can bring to market faster through our extensive worldwide infrastructure. Many bring follow-on opportunities for further growth investment. Still, others are new additions to product packages where we seek to standardize offerings to reduce risk and complexity for our customers. In each case, they represent strategies we successfully applied many times in NOV's past. Third, we believe we bought these businesses at fair and reasonable valuations. We've acquired nearly 300 businesses between National Oilwell and Varco over the past 15 or so years. And on average, we close one transaction for about every 7 that we look at. We are making acquisitions full-time, all the time, with a staff devoted to the effort to ensure that we stay in practice and that the process remains as dispassionate and objective as we can make it. We remain close to the market so that our investment decisions are informed, objective and well-reasoned, so that this isn't an ad hoc process subject to hijack by emotion. We run our discounted cash flow models through the pain and stress of down-cycles and we press for good value. In short, we know the market. Fourth, we are experienced at executing due diligence and focus closely on what matters most. We usually avoid stepping in bear traps. Finally, our operations managers are exceptionally good at integrating businesses, tackling organizational questions first, moving quickly and decisively. 300 acquisitions in 15 years means 300 integrations in 15 years. We've probably done everything wrong that you can do wrong on an acquisition and frankly, I wouldn't trade that experience for anything. Our integration processes are empirical and practical and they work.","In addition to acquisitions, NOV has continued to invest in organic opportunities around the world, expanding manufacturing facilities for blowout preventers, top drives, drill pipe, tubular coating, coil tubing in units, pumps, power sections, downhole tools, composite pipe, marine connectors and aftermarket services.","We're moving forward with a new test well research facility to ensure NOV's continued technical leadership on a variety of products. Our NKT acquisition brought with it a new flexible pipe manufacturing facility in Brazil. We expect our capital expenditures to total about $700 million this year, including a large flexible pipe plant in Brazil that NKT has underway. In the long run, deploying capital is arguably the most important function that management teams perform. Investment decisions, both organic and transactional, have a profound impact on the profile of an organization 10 years hence. We make these decisions with precisely that long view. The deployments you see are the seeds of future cash flows and technologies and capabilities that will bring opportunities to continue to build and grow our company and they reflect the responsibility to our shareholders, our customers and our employees that we take very, very seriously. We also rarely -- actually, we never time transactions perfectly. We serve cyclical markets and recognize that soon after closing, we may be faced with more challenging market conditions and we expect it out of the gate. We nevertheless proceed confidently for 2 important reasons. First, our business model is diversified within oil and gas. Early cycle distribution in Petroleum Services & Supplies businesses are juxtaposed on later-cycle Rig Technology businesses, which empirically lag about 7 quarters. And this has demonstrated compelling durability. I point you to our performance through the 2009 downturn, if you like to analyze this for yourself. NOV's balance between late and early cycle businesses enables us to shift resources from shrinking markets to expanding markets, making it incrementally easier for us to manage through down-cycles than our peers.","Second, and most importantly, our strategies around capital deployment at National Oilwell Varco work mostly because of the terrific employees that Pete, Loren and I have the pleasure of serving. It is tough to assume leadership of a business just acquired with lots of new nervous employees, and take these new teammates to a new place of productivity and contribution. It is tough to open new plants in exotic locations, hundreds or thousands of miles outside of established supply chains and smoothly deliver the high-quality products our customers expect. But we make capital investment decisions confidently because we know our exceptionally capable operational leaders in the field will jump right in and make it look easy. We know that our teams can and will respond to market ups and downs decisively and appropriately. And for all these NOV professionals we work with, we are very, very grateful, they do a super job.","Turning now to our segment operating results. Rig Technology group generated revenues of $2.4 billion in the second quarter, up 6% sequentially and up 27% compared to the second quarter of 2011. Operating profit was $571 million, giving operating margins for the group of 23.7%, down 70 basis points from the prior quarter. Incremental leverage or flow-through was 14% sequentially, and 11% year-over-year. Excluding the partial quarter results from the NKT Interflow acquisitions, revenues increased 2% sequentially, and flow-throughs were 31%. Operating margins on this basis were 24.5%, up slightly from the first quarter. Aftermarket sales increased 5% sequentially, and 20% year-over-year, and comprised 21% of the mix during the second quarter.","We expect continued growth for spares and aftermarket services, given our recent capital investments in this area, along with a steadily growing install base of new high-technology rigs. Importantly, the very first floating rigs delivered this construction cycle are now approaching their fifth birthday. And we expect these rigs to begin to march into shipyards for their inspection soon, which will present NOV with new opportunities to sell spares and replacement and upgrade capital equipment to these rigs.","Interest in new offshore rigs remain strong and steady. With limited deepwater and harsh environment jack-up availability, IOCs and NOCs anxious about their production targets, leading-edge day rates moving higher across a number of categories, ample capacity and pervasive hunger and highly qualified Asian shipyards and available financing, at least for established enterprises, our offshore drilling contractor customers find themselves in a uniquely attractive place. What I said earlier about capital deployment decisions having profound implications for the success of a business tenure, hence, applies to them too and they're planting the seeds for their future earnings and cash flow through fleet expansion.","The Land businesses is a little slower. Our North American land customers are continuing to build rigs, to which they have previously committed, but flattening to slightly declining day rates, very low gas prices and slightly lower oil prices appear to us to have curbed their enthusiasm, at least partly. Five years ago, such a market mixture would probably result in a dead stop, but interestingly, I think they are merely dialing back a little now. The difference is that there is a higher level of conviction amongst them in their need to retool their fleets to modern AC-powered, quick move, electronically controlled Tier 1 rigs. Market conditions are moderating the pace of retooling, but retooling is moving forward nonetheless.","International land prospects are brighter. Markets are strong in Latin America, the Middle East and Southeast Asia in particular. These markets lag North America in adoption of modern Rig Technology, but if history's a guide, international markets will fully embrace these new technologies and that trend appears to be moving forward. Second quarter revenue out of backlog for the entire group increased 6% sequentially, and 31% year-over-year, totaling $1,817,000,000. This is more than offset by new capital equipment orders of $2.2 billion, plus another $511 million of backlog that came in with NKT and Interflow acquisitions for a total of $2,733,000,000 in new orders flowing into backlog. Second quarter new orders included drilling equipment packages for 6 new floaters, including 1 for a shipyard in Brazil, and 5 jack-up drilling equipment packages.","Pending backlog as of June 30, 2012, was $11,280,000,000, of which, 14% was for land and 86% offshore, and 8% domestic and 92% international. Of orders on the books at June 30, we expect approximately $3.9 billion to flow out as revenue during the remainder of 2012, $4.9 billion to flow out in 2013, and the balance to flow out thereafter. We delivered 5 floaters during the second quarter, bringing our total to 137 offshore rigs supplied to the industry since 2005.","Our order outlook for the third quarter is strong, as there are a number of drilling equipment packages for Brazil that have not yet been awarded. Additionally, there is interest in construction of floaters in Asia to fill the gap between now and delivery of the rigs out of new shipyards in Brazil, plus growing interest in new deepwater frontiers in West Africa, East Africa, a recovering Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea and Southeast Asia. Included in these are inquiries around harsh environment semis. Most jack-up inquiries have come from smaller national oil company and line drilling contractors who tend to be very price-sensitive. Despite NOV's strong market position, we still face strong price competition from aggressive competitors. And overall, drilling equipment pricing has never returned to 2008 level.","Looking forward into the third quarter of 2012, we expect strong sequential sales growth up in the high single-digit percentage range at roughly flat operating margins as compared to Q2. We expect start-up costs associated with plant expansions in the U.S., softening shipments in North American service rigs, frac spreads, land drilling rigs and higher revenues from lower-margin FPSO products to be roughly offset by rising high-margin new rig project shipments.","The Petroleum Services & Supplies segment generated record revenues of $1,776,000,000, up 4% sequentially and up 31% year-over-year. Operating profit was a record $393 million and operating margins were 22.1%, down about 70 basis points sequentially. Compared to the first quarter of 2012, the $72 million revenue increase produced only 7% operating leverage or flow-through due to Canada breakup and some mixed changes I'll detail in a moment. Year-over-year flow-through normalized for the seasonal Canada effect and were therefore, a more normal 35%.","From a regional perspective, U.S. revenues grew 5% sequentially, and totaled 55% of segments mixed in the second quarter. Canada declined 14%, and totaled 7% of the mix. And international revenues increased 5%, and totaled 38% of the segment's second quarter mix. International growth was highest in the Middle East and Africa.","As is typical for the segment, seasonal declines in Canada due to breakup came at very high decremental, north of 70%, particularly in sales of downhole products and services. But these sales declines were more than offset by strong sequential performances from other parts of PSNS, including Mission Products and XL Systems. Drill pipe production increased 7% sequentially to new record levels, driving sharply higher margins helped by favorable mix of premium 4-inch XT pipe. However, orders for drill pipe had slowed in recent weeks and we are very cautious about the remainder of the year. Demand for Tuboscope tubular inspection and tubular coating in North America, together with sequentially higher sales of mill equipment, led to slightly higher sequential revenues and margins there. Sales of composite and fiberglass pipe increased sequentially as well, with lower oilfield demand in North America, more than offset by eastern hemisphere sales into FPSO construction projects carrying strong margins. Continued incremental cost savings from the Ameron acquisition drove operating margins higher there as well. Well Site Services posted slightly higher revenues but margins fell, due primarily to the Canadian break up effect and some pricing pressures in the U.S.","As we enter the third quarter 2012, we expect Petroleum Services & Supplies segment sales to begin to face some more headwinds in the North American markets, partly offset by continued growth overseas. As U.S. rig counts have flattened and maybe trending downward, we are beginning to see what we believe will be a modest downturn in activity. Specifically, bookings for new drill pipe, drilling and well servicing pump products and composite line pipes have all seen declines in the U.S. in recent weeks. While other products within the segment, notably Downhole Tools, XL systems and certain Well Site Service lines have seen sales trend higher lately. We believe commodity price softness will probably have an impact on drilling activity and potentially limit rig count recovery out of breakup in Canada through the second half of the year. However, we could be wrong. With gas back up over $3, and with WTI now flirting with $90, the North American rig count may well stabilize, potentially even grow. The Gulf of Mexico is marching steadily back to a robust level of activity and we know of 58 new offshore rigs that we expect to order drill pipe over the next year and a half.","Nevertheless, as of today, we see a little more caution in our North American customer spending. Given that backdrop with nearly 60% of segment revenues derived from North America, we perceive Petroleum Services & Supplies revenues declining 1% or 2% from the second quarter to the third and post slightly higher -- sorry, posting slightly lower margins.","During acquisitions, the Distribution & Transmission segment posted 38% higher sequential sales from the first quarter to the second, and 84% higher year-over-year sales. Revenues were $780 million and operating profit was $54 million. Operating margins were 6.9% of sales. Sequential flow-through or operating leverage was 5% and year-over-year operating leverage was 8%. Mix for the group's second quarter were 79% North American and 21% international. Almost all of the sequential growth was accounted for by the acquisitions of Wilson and Ensco. The legacy NOV distribution services portion of the segment saw its Canadian revenues decline 26% sequentially due to breakup, but its U.S. and international operations offset the declines dollar for dollar. The recovery of offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, project driven valve sales in Azerbaijan and higher North Sea activity contributed to the quarter sales.","Higher sequential transmission sales of Ameron products were partly offset by lower Mono sales of industrial products and delays in international artificial lift projects in Latin America. Demand for Mono power sections for drilling motors remains very high. As you can imagine, the group is very busy integrating all of the acquisitions made through the past couple of months and they're making great progress. NOV's combined purchasing power across is now more than doubled distribution business is substantial and we are working to capture additional savings for migrating to a single ERP platform. All in, we expect meaningful savings from the integration which will make our new combined business more efficient.","Looking into the third quarter 2012, we expect Distribution & Transmission group revenues to increase substantially, as we pick up by full quarter's results from Wilson and Ensco and almost 1 full quarters revenue from CE Franklin. We expect margins to decline into the mid-5% range, owing to the new mix of business along with North American activity headwinds I discussed earlier.","Turning to National Oilwell Varco's consolidated second quarter 2012 income statement, gross margin declined 160 basis points and SG&A increased $24 million, primarily due to the impact of acquisitions made during the quarter. SG&A as a percent of sales was 8.7% in Q2, down from 9.1% last quarter, and down from 10.7% last year. Interest expense of $9 million is expected to rise to about $12 million or $13 million in the third quarter due to debt taken on related to acquisitions. Equity income in our Voest-Alpine JV was $19 million, up $2 million sequentially, on higher sequential OCTG and line pipe volumes. We expect equity income to decline in the third quarter due to scheduled mill maintenance. Other expense improved $8 million from the first quarter due to FX and lower bank charges. The book tax rate for the second quarter was 32.1%, close to our expected rate for the remainder of the year of about 33%.","Unallocated expenses and eliminations on our supplemental segment schedule was $111 million in the second quarter, up $10 million sequentially due to higher intersegment sales eliminations. Depreciation and amortization was $157 million, up $9 million from the first quarter due to new acquisitions. EBITDA excluding transaction charges was a record $1,084,000,000, up $46 million sequentially to 22.9% of sales. National Oilwell Varco's June 30, 2012 balance sheet includes total debt of $1.4 billion, an increase of $938 million sequentially to finance acquisitions and domestic tax payments made during the quarter. Cash was $1.9 billion at quarter end with approximately 88% of the balance located overseas. Consolidated working capital excluding cash and debt was $5.9 billion, or 31.2% of annualized sales, up $1.6 billion from the first quarter due mostly to taxes and acquisitions. Inventory accounted for about 60% of our working capital growth of $973 million, with $689 million of that flowing in from acquisitions in the quarter. Legacy NOV business has increased inventory, $284 million, mostly in Rig Technology to support backlog requirements. Faster shipyard construction cycles are accelerating [indiscernible] deliveries from us. Other inventory growth occurred across numerous plant expansion initiatives we are getting up and running across all 3 segments. Domestic and international income tax payments drove accrued taxes down $441 million sequentially and were a significant use of cash in the quarter. Cash flow used by operations was $253 million for the second quarter due primarily to the income tax payments and other working capital items. CapEx was $140 million in the second quarter, and we expect it to rise in Q3 and finish in a range of about $700 million for the full year.","So now let me turn it back to Pete.","Merrill A. Miller","Thanks, Clay. I want to make a few brief comments on some issues that I think are very important to us as we look to the future. On the last 3 or 4 conference calls, you've heard me expound loquaciously on shales, so I'm not going to talk too much about shales today. But needless to say, for every segment of our business, shales are exceedingly important. They continue to be important, I think, especially North America, and they're something that are going to continue to provide growth for us. But the 3 things I'd like to kind of emphasize today are: Number one, it's our organic growth and what we're doing in plant expansion around the world. We really have some neat things going. In particular, we've just started construction of a new facility in Russia. That facility will be building rigs. The Russians are in dire need of the technology that we have and I think it's really going to be very, very important that we're able to do some things. When you see companies like Exxon moving into Russia, you know that the demand for quality equipment is going to improve. And I think that's something that's going to be very important for us and we're situating ourselves and within about a year to a year and a half, we'll be producing, I think, some fine equipment into that Russian market. But it's not just Russia. We're doing things in Southeast Asia. We're expanding our fiberglass facilities down there. We're doing things in the Middle East. Basically, all over the world, we're expanding our facilities and our ability to be able to help our customers there. And what that really does, and you'll start to see that, I think, as we go out a year, a year and half, is it reduces our transportation cost tremendously. It puts us in a position to be able to take advantage of a lot of the things that we have going on and building the products that we're building and putting them in there. So that organic expansion is very, very important. It really is important when you look at on a 5 to 10-year basis. Clay pointed out a lot of the things we're doing on M&A, but really, that organic expansion is one of the things that's really, really going to be a growth thing for the future. Secondly, I think is deepwater again. We're starting to see the Gulf of Mexico come back. That will be very beneficial to every one of the elements that we have on our company, every division is going to do well. But more importantly, look at the day rates of companies like Seadrill just signed up for. And then that's one of the reasons that we're very bullish on the fact that there will be more deepwater rigs constructed and we like our position in that marketplace. So I think deepwater will continue to be a big theme for us as we move forward. And then finally, the thing I want to talk about is technology. We have so many good things in technology today. And when you're looking at this, everybody out there that's drilling wants the best they can get. And we're doing some really, really cool things. I talked last time about our NOVA control systems and we were able to show that to a lot of our customers at OTC and they were very, very impressed. And I think that's a game changer. That's going to be a product that I believe that it's going to be -- allow people to do so many things with automation and the like on drilling rigs, but it really is going to position ourselves for wonderful growth into the future. Secondly, you're looking at things like BOPs. We've completed, organically, a lot of R&D facilities over the last couple of years. We've invested heavily in this because we know the industry needs the best products they can get. They need the most reliable products, they need the highest-quality products and we're positioning ourselves to be able to maintain that status as we move forward. We have Helios bids, we have our vertical drilling machines, we have pipe handling for land rigs, we're continuing to raise the bar. When people say, well, we're going to compete with NOV because we're going to have these products. That's okay, because we're going to continue to raise that bar and have new products out there that are really going to guide us to the future.","So I think those are the 3 things, operationally, that we're really excited about right now. It is that organic growth, the resurgence that we believe, both in deepwater, the building continues, but the drilling is going to improve around the world and then finally, the technology. So those are the things we're excited about. We like where we're going. I think this quarter was a good quarter for us, especially in the order arena. And the good news is every time we deliver one of those rigs, we have to support that rig for the next 25 years. And so we like where we are.","So Christine, with that, I'll open it up for questions that our listeners might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from David Anderson of JPMorgan.","John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Clay, did I hear you say $200 million award for turret this quarter that just came in?","Clay C. Williams","Yes, it didn't show up in Q2, David. It was after the close of the quarter. So this will -- and actually, it's not one turret, there's a number of pieces of equipment there and a couple of customers. But they aggregate to a lot of signings of orders here in just the past couple of weeks. It will show up in Q3.","John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, because I was actually kind of wondering about when you guys are bidding on rig, your rig packages, are you generally bidding on FPSO. I think you and I have talked about this, this is generally kind of piecemeal -- what is the bidding process like right now at FPSO? Sort of a new business for you. When you go into that, are you selling a package, are you offering a package or is it individual pieces and maybe could also provide a little context in terms of what that bidding activity has been like in FPSOs now, say compared to, I don't know, 6 months ago or so?","Clay C. Williams","Yes. That's a great question. Well, first, to answer your first question is the bidding process has been painfully slow here, the last few quarters. It's a market that's kind of we're still recovering, I think, to some degree, from the downturn from '09. Good news is though it's distinctly recovering, inquiries are rising and the like. We, as you know, our strategy here is to try to offer more of a packaged offering of FPSO components and in some way, change how that industry views these projects and execute these projects. And we think, by doing that, we can improve the efficiency, we can drive more standardization. And so we're having a number of conversations, they're very interesting and some enthusiasm in those, with shipyards and others about how -- what that might look like. But that's a very slow evolution and process and so that's kind of going on behind the scenes. In the mean time, we're in there, bidding. Still more on a component by component basis and slugging it out. But our outlook is improving. NKT came in and we've seen a rising interest in their products for flexible flow lines which, of course, plug in to FPSOs. And APL has a lot of good things going on too. So our bullish outlook on market demand is as enthusiastic as it ever was and I'm pretty excited about what's out there over the next couple of years. One final point to make here though is that, I think, the owner or operators of FPSOs, there's a couple of large ones that have some -- it's well-known that they're struggling a little bit with their business models and I think that's kind of what our customers are sorting through right now. Who's going to own and operate these things and how they're going to make money at it.","John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So kind of an opportunity from competitor weakness?","Clay C. Williams","Yes. Partly. Some of those owner operators are vertically integrated. As you know, we don't want to own and operate them. We just want to sell components into them, but we're also taking a look at their business model and figuring out what can we do to help them make a better return on investment. Ultimately, that's going to be the key, the path to success for us. If we can transform what we sell, make it more standardized, reduce the risk around building these large complex vessels and so that all parties have a better idea of what's going to cost. There's less uncertainty for shipyards, or less uncertainty for the owners operators of these things. And that's -- again, I'll stress, it's a very long-term strategy. That involves a lot of evolution of thinking across everybody that participates in this space. And -- but the end goal here, I think, is an attractive place where everyone involved here can make good returns and good profits on these projects.","Merrill A. Miller","David, I might add too. If you take a look at what we've done with drillships, it's really been the exact model. If you go back to the mid-90s and look how our drillships were built and you look at how they're built today, it's totally different. That's one of the reasons you aren't having the cost overruns, you aren't having all the issues you had back in the mid-90s. And so we -- it's our desire and I think it's our vision and we'll get there, that we're going to replicate what we've done for drillships with the FPSO market.","John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. Speaking of profitability, you're talking about rig tech margins being basically flat in 3Q. I assume flat from the 24.5 number that you guys -- ex acquisitions I assume, that was the number you're talking about?","Clay C. Williams","We're going to quit reporting ex-acquisitions because now everybody's part of NOV. But now I'm -- let's say around 24 is what our forecast calls for right now. If you recall, as we move into Q3, we're going to have a larger contribution from a couple of acquisitions, NKT and Interflow, who has good margins, but they're not up where Rig Technology margins are. So as the mix moves more in that direction in Q3 compared to Q2, that will offset some of the margin improvements that we're expecting in the other parts of the base NOV business and Rig Technology.","John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. That was actually what I was getting -- what I was actually getting at. I was just maybe if you could just kind of help us understand a little bit of how this mix is shifting? Of course, we're all looking back at the past for -- still looking towards the future and things are always changing with you guys in terms of your acquisitions and by the way, you don't have to justify your acquisitions with us. But in terms of us who are looking out there with these different components, it sounds like you've worked through that lower price backlog on the rig equipment and now the higher price backlog is coming through. Can you just help us understand so, I don't know, the next year or so, how you see that playing out and how margins start to uplift and what we should be expecting?","Clay C. Williams","I think margins are going to gradually improve here, but I'll stress gradually and maybe after moving sideways again for another couple of quarters. The factors driving this are, you cited a big one, we did get improved pricing on rig DEPs through 2011, mostly in the drillship end of things and semi end of things. But that improvement is going to be mitigated by a couple of things. One is these 2 acquisitions coming in with a little lower margins involved, a pick up in results coming from APL, the turret mooring business, again, good margins but not as strong as the base Rig Technology margins. Headwinds in the land business, particularly coming from our North American customers that I highlighted in my comments, and that affects all things from drilling rigs, to well servicing rigs, to frac spreads and pressure-pumping equipment. And so it's a couple of offsetting factors there. I'd also throw in the fact that with all the plant construction and the expansion that's going on around the world, we have a lot of start-up cost and just took on, with NKT, a very large plant in Brazil that's got some start-up cost that are going to -- its going to carry as well. So as opposed to where we were 3 months ago, 6 months ago, in terms of margin outlook, some negatives had popped up in the market. And also, we've added in these businesses. Great businesses, good long-term growth prospects, but they're going to be a little more limiting on the margin here in the short run.","Operator","Our next question is from Marshall Adkins of Raymond James.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I'll try to keep it relatively quick here. I think the biggest surprise for a lot of us was how well PS&S and distribution did. And particularly given the declining North American rig count that we've seen, I mean, I guess, I certainly think of it as if the U.S. rig count is falling in a meaningful way, and certainly, Canada falling seasonally, that sequentially, things are going to be pretty ugly but you're one of the guys that have -- you've put up pretty good numbers here so you did...","Clay C. Williams","Marshall, you can take as much time as you would like.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Well, I want a little more color on, you mentioned drill pipe was one of the reasons why that happened, but just give us a little more color on both those divisions, on why we didn't see the kind of the normal decline of business with the decline in rig count?","Clay C. Williams","Yes, Drill Pipe was the biggest single piece -- I'll focus on PS&S. Drill pipe is the biggest single piece. They just had a great quarter. There were some headwinds operational last quarter -- last couple of quarters, that they kind of worked their way through. And record level of production of Drill Pipe this quarter, they've never done as much. And also, it's more focused in North America, that's not without much contribution from our Chinese plants. And so just a super job by that group and that drove great incrementals and good margins there. The other 2 standouts in the quarter, I would add, would be our XL Systems business which we probably don't talk enough about. These are marine connectors offshore. They had a real solid quarter as well. And thirdly, just an outstanding performance by Fiberglass Pipe. They took on the Ameron acquisition late last year and this is a great little case study about some of the themes that I was speaking to earlier, in terms of how well we -- our guys can integrate businesses and make them profitable. They have just done a super job of rationalizing cost, of moving glass purchases over to lower-priced contracts, resin purchases over to lower-priced contracts to really get benefit of economies of scale, doing away with duplicative overhead structures, that sort of thing. And so they had a terrific quarter as well. And so I'd highlight those -- I'd say all of our business did really well, but I highlight those 3 in particular.","Merrill A. Miller","And I might add, Marshall, when you look at our PS&S business, and we've talked about this a lot, everybody knows our position in the drilling rigs, and everybody knows what we do on drillships and semisubmersibles. When you start talking about names like Tuboscope, and Brandt, and ReedHycalog, and our Downhole motors and our Fiberglass and all that, those are all market-leading names. And I think we have such good presence in the market that even though there are some softness with the declining rig count, those market-leading names are going to be the last business that people get rid of. They're going to get rid of some of the folks that are chasing those market-leading names, but not those, and that's one of the reasons where we've had success.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And you weren't getting any -- on addition, you said, you weren't getting any of the cost savings from Wilson blowing through yet, I mean, there's no way?","Clay C. Williams","Not much.","Merrill A. Miller","Not yet, not yet, but we'll get it. But again, we had -- predominantly, there weren't that much of Wilson in the distribution numbers. And our distribution guys continue just to do a phenomenal job of what I call rubbing the buffalo off the nickel. Those guys control -- they control their cost about as well as anybody. And I think, as we integrate quicker and quicker with the Wilson deal, you'll see the same sort of results coming out of that.","Operator","Our next question is from Jim Crandell of Dahlman Rose.","James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Clay, you mentioned a couple of times in your remarks about for prospective rig orders, that there was a fair amount going on in Brazil. Would that be for floaters built by Hyundai and Samsung, or would it be more orders for you out of yards in Brazil?","Clay C. Williams","Actually, we're seeing both. We're seeing a lot of interest on the Seche-Atlas project, that Petrobras has sponsored in Brazil, to be built in Brazil, but we're also seeing interest by drilling contractors who see an opportunity here to -- as I described it earlier, to fill the gap. It's going to be a while, it will be several years before those rigs start flowing out of the shipyards in Brazil. And so I think there's opportunities for drilling contractors to build rigs with Samsung and Hyundai and DSME and others in Asia, to potentially go to work in Brazil for 3, 4, 5, 6 years before those Brazilian rigs come on. So that, I think, is influencing demand in Asia as well.","James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And Pete, is there any short of any change in your view about how your traditional customers are approaching the new order market for drillships in harsh environments semis? It seems that as soon as they accept deliveries, they're ordering more. We're exercising options in placing new options, Ensco with 2 more today, do you see this thing keeping a barreling along in companies, and there'll be a number of drillships on the books for your traditional customers for 15 delivery in the next few months?","Merrill A. Miller","Yes. Jim, I think our outlook is really pretty consistent with what we've talked about in the last 6 months, and you're kind of seeing that happen. As some of these rigs come out, as they get contracted, people are ordering more. And if you look at the economics on it, the beauty of this, and I tell everybody, just look at what the day rates are getting and then you'd kind of back into what these things are selling for. And the economics are pretty darn compelling. I think the, number one, we've talked about this a lot, people need a newer rig fleet, they need the new technology that's out there. And if they are able to just kind of keep churning and bringing these things on every couple of years the way they are, I think that's going to repopulate the rig fleet. It's going to increase the deepwater fleet, which is what you need. And so we don't see any abatement in that. And we kind of like where our position in being able to provide those rigs to our customers. So I'm pretty bullish that this is going to continue for some time.","James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","And Pete, correct me if I'm wrong, but have you said in the past that if Hyundai and Samsung keep their prices flat more or less, you will probably keep your prices flat too, especially given that many customers sort of cite the, let's say, the lower cost of rig, that's one of the reasons that they're in there, ordering. Does that create any margin issues for you by sort of -- if that is in fact your strategy, keeping your prices flat in here?","Merrill A. Miller","Well, I think, Jim, our strategy, again, is going to be -- it's pretty simple. I mean, we watch what the drilling contractors are getting. And we kind of know if they're getting a certain level, that our pricing can adjust accordingly. And so that I think that's one of the things that we certainly are going to look at. If you start seeing rigs going out $700,000 a day, that indicates the maybe you ought to be raising your prices some. But at the same time, the real advantage to us is efficiency. And one of the things that when I was talking about my comments earlier, about the organic growth that we've had, one of the things we've done is invest and buy some companies in Korea, and that allows us to be able to reduce our cost. So as we're reducing our cost, and even if we keep the pricing flat, that's going to give us margin enhancement. And that's really the key to everything that we try to do because pricing, as I tell everybody, somewhat ephemeral, it can go up and it can go down, but efficiency gains stay with you. And if you can do that, that's going to help your margin. So we watch that pricing very, very closely and we'll adjust accordingly, based upon what we think the economics that could be handled by our customers.","James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And last question, Pete. What's been your experience recently in terms of deepwater rig orders from traditional customers, in terms of them ordering additional BOP stacks?","Merrill A. Miller","It's happening, Jim. I think a lot of them are taking a couple of stacks per rig. We're having some of our traditional customers that are coming in and are ordering one-off stacks now. I think everybody realizes the need for that and I think that's going to be a business that's going to continue to be very, very strong for ourselves in that arena.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Uhlmer of Global Hunter.","Brian Uhlmer - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","I have 2 specific questions. Number one, we're talking about the 5-year surveys and rigs coming back into the yard and also, I wanted to kind of address what potential upgrades and the opportunity per rig looks like? Are we talking about BOP control systems upgrades, pipe handling? What type of equipment and what do you think the opportunity per rig is on the 5 years? And then number 2, or hitting some 10 years from the previous cycle, do you think there's some major upgrade opportunities, like the diamond rigs where you have $100-plus million opportunity with those rigs?","Merrill A. Miller","Well, Brian, obviously, the older the rig, and especially a rig that's 10 years older is going to have a lot more of an opportunity. And probably the biggest reason is because a lot of the equipment that's out there has changed so dramatically in technology. You're going to want to -- you might even want to swap out a top drive and you might want to get a new age control system or a new age pipe handling system. And clearly, you'd want to look at the BOP and get the most recent mug system that you could have on in the control system. So the 10-year-old rig would be certainly, I think, a little bit more lucrative. The 5-year-old rig, what you're talking about there is probably going to be a lot more just refurbishment. And almost like taking your car in to get it tuned up and different things like that. And we're always reluctant to put a number, simply because there's differing levels of how our equipment's taken care of. And that's -- you might have one top drive but maybe the diligence on the maintenance wasn't quite as good as it should've been. And that could  -- a top drive overhaul could cost as much as $0.5 million. But another top drive may have had things going on continuously in a little bit better maintenance program. And so that overhaul might not be anywhere near as much, it might be $125,000, numbers like that. And so I will say this, there'll be good numbers but it's very difficult for us to give you something that says this is absolutely what we'd be looking at. Because if there's too many variables, it's kind of a set of quadratic equations, there's so many variables in there. But it is business and I think will be a very good for us in the long term.","Clay C. Williams","Yes, a lot of the sales we're making in these overhaul cycles too are dictated by EMP customers. The rig goes into the shipyard every 5 years -- 5, most people are aware of it but those that aren't, they'll get inspected for insurance certificates, for Coast Guard certificates and the like, in most rigs are on a 5-year cycle. While they're in, that's an opportunity for us to do this work. The customers that they're going to work for next, as they come out of the shipyards, will often specify equipment changes, upgrades and the like. And so that drives a lot of the equipment that we can sell into that project. And then another potential opportunity for us is what we were talking about just a moment ago. I think some of these rigs are probably going to be looking at adding a second BOP, and looking to see whether that's feasible and the like. And so that's the developing trend that may give this next round of 5-year overhauls a little different flavor too.","Brian Uhlmer - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Great. And for my second question. A little bit on artificial lift, You mentioned some delays there that had an impact on it, and you also mentioned, obviously, Mono on the power section business, that remains very high. I would imagine that's also true for the progressive cavity pumps. And kind of curious what product lines outside hydraulic lift and PCPs, if you're expanding artificial lift and how -- what order of magnitude that can grow to, as we look through the next back half of the year?","Clay C. Williams","Yes, that's mostly within our distribution business and so we're mostly selling items made by others there. But along the way, our Mono business, manufacturers, progressing cavity pumps and so that fits well. And we've, over the years, developed drive heads for those rod pumps, some other technologies along the way. So I think we're kind of gradually adding a few products here and there to expand our offering. But obviously, artificial lifts is a big market. We have a pretty interesting position in our distribution and channels to that market. And the specific names I was referring to in my comments were some -- we often sell into large projects overseas. And in this instance, we had 1 or 2 of those in Latin America that were delayed out of Q2 into Q3, so that's what's going on there.","Operator","And our last question is from Robin Shoemaker of Citi.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wanted to ask about Brazil. You had a rig order, a deepwater rig order. Was that a fully integrated package like the 7 that you booked last year?","Clay C. Williams","Yes.","Merrill A. Miller","Yes.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It was, okay. And so just in terms of timing of additional, we keep hearing about the 33 rigs that you're planning to build in Brazil, sounds like 7 plus 1, 8, have been awarded the rig equipment package. What is the timing on the remainder, to your knowledge?","Merrill A. Miller","Robert, if we could good answer that with clarity, we would be certainly clairvoyant. Our experience, and we have a lot of experience in Brazil, is you kind of work on their time. I would hope that probably, you'd see a lot of awards this year through the remainder of the year, but that is a hope and not a certainty. The certainty is the awards will be made, but whether they're made through the remainder of this year, first part of next year, you never -- time has a different meaning. And this isn't something that's -- and I don't mean to be critical, it's just the process down there, the way it works. The good news is rigs are going to be ordered and we like where we are. But the medium news is that to give you an exact timing would be pretty close to impossible.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, okay. And so, I guess, the 8 that you have in backlog now, do have like specific schedule delivery dates on all of those?","Merrill A. Miller","Absolutely. Yes, we have. Just like we do when we work with a shipyard in Korea, Robin. We've got milestones. I mean, we know exactly how we're going along. What we're going to be doing when certain things are going to be delivered. I mean, these projects are very, very complex. And we have milestones for both payments and deliveries of certain things. So we know exactly when these things should be delivered and how they're going to impact us. And that's one of the reasons when Clay talks about revenues out of backlog, we're able to figure that because we have so many projects and we just kind of backtrack through our milestone list to be able to give you those numbers.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So my other question then has to do with the North American market. Drill pipe sales are slowing down and so forth. Are you seeing evidences that drilling contractors or land drilling contractors are doing what they've done previously, which is to take equipment, drill pipe and other equipment off of idle rigs or so-called cannibalization phenomenon, as more rigs are laid down. Or do you think that is less likely to be a factor because when it does happen, it tends to kind of exacerbate the sales drop of certain drill pipe and other equipment more than really is the underlying demand, if you know what mean?","Merrill A. Miller","Robert, I think you're going to see less and less of that. Actually, I would say this, number one, drilling contractors have been very disciplined, especially when you look at other downturns, they've been able to maintain their day rates probably at a higher level than one would expect. But secondly, the real player over the last few years in the shales has been technology. And a lot of the rigs that you see that might get laid down, quite frankly, might not come back to work again because it's kind of the worst rig is the one that's going to be released. And even if one of the good rigs is drilling one of the wells that you want to stop on, you'd still move that good rig to another well and release one of the older rigs. So I don't think you'll see quite the same phenomenon. Now drill pipe is a little bit more fungible, you'll move drill pipe around, but I don't think you'll see it when it comes to the rest of the equipment. And if anything, I would argue that if there's a slowdown and then you come back up again, that bodes well for the equipment and manufacturers because they're want to bring out the best equipment they can get and that's where the technology factor comes in. You see things like the Rapid Rig, and the ideal rig that we do. You see all the different rigs like Helmerich & Payne, and Patterson, and neighbors all have out there. It's always the best rig wins. So we think that in the long run, that will probably bode well for us.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Miller for closing remarks.","Merrill A. Miller","Well, thank you, all very much for listening in and we look forward to talking to you at the end of our third quarter. So thank you very, very much.","Operator","Thank you.

My name is Dawn, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that the conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Loren Singletary, Vice President of Investor and Industry Relations. Mr. Singletary, you may begin.","Loren Singletary","Thanks Dawn, and welcome everyone to the National-Oilwell Varco fourth quarter and full-year 2012 earnings conference call. With me today is Pete Miller, Chairman and CEO of National Oilwell Varco, Clay Williams, President and Chief Operating Officer and Jeremy Thigpen, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin this discussion of National Oilwell Varco's financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, please note that some of the statements we make during this call may contain forecast, projections and estimates including but not limited to comments about our outlook for the company's business.

Further information regarding these as well as supplemental financial and operating information maybe found within our press release on our website at www.nov.com or in our filings with the SEC.","Later on this call, we will answer your questions which we ask you to limit to two, in order to permit more participation. Now, I will turn the call over to Pete for his opening comments.","Merrill Miller","Thanks Loren, and welcome everyone to our year-end 2012 earnings conference call. Earlier today we announced fourth quarter earnings of $1.56 per share on revenues of $5.7 billion. After excluding $51 million in transaction charges and $69 million tax benefit, earnings were $1.49 per share. For the year, we are in $5.91 per share excluding transaction charges and the tax benefit on revenues of $20 billion.","Our earnings per share in 2012 increased 24% from 2011. We are very pleased with these record revenues and profits and believe they are the direct result of our outstanding employees, delivering great products with exemplary execution. Jeremy and Clay will expand on these results in a moment.","Additionally, we announced new capital equipment orders for the quarter of $2.42 billion or 1.1:1 book to bill ratio. This equates to a quarter ending backlog of $11.9 billion, a record for us. This exceeds our prior record that we achieved in the third quarter of 2008. We will provide more color on this backlog later in the call.","I would like to thank all the wonderful employees of National-Oilwell Varco for producing these record-breaking results by all measures. Thanks for all you do. Now I will turn the call over to Clay.","Clay Williams","Thank you, Pete. As Pete mentioned, we did generate record earnings of $5.91 per share for 2012, up 24% year-over-year and up 17% from our prior feedback in 2008. A very strong result. We also generated record EBITDA of $4.3 billion in the year and record operating profit of $3.7 billion in the year, and as Pete mentioned, we finished the year with a rig technology backlog of a record level of $11.9 billion after having added $9.4 billion in orders through the year. NOV's results are accredited to the hard work and dedication over 60,000 terrific employees and I am grateful for the work that they do and congratulate them on a terrific year.","As we enter 2013, we see cross currents in the markets we serve. Demand for offshore floating rigs and equipment is strong and constructive, but markets for land equipment and services across North America remain hesitant. Underpinned by new build floating rig demand, Rig Technology's book-to-bill order ratio remained above one every quarter this year, successfully surpassing rising revenue out of backlog their total record $7.7 billion for the year.","Offshore drilling contractor steadily committed capital through 2012 to expand our deepwater fleets and we believe that this will continue through 2013. Our outlook for continued strong deepwater orders is a view that appears to be out of step with Wall Street's conventional wisdom, which seems likely to have convinced itself that deepwater rig ordering will slow. Candidly, we do not understand why. Why one unlevered after-tax returns are in the high teens for new rig construction projects. Why one delivery times are shrunk by year or more, bring the first dollar project revenue closure and enhancing IRRs. Why when recent payment terms offered by shipyards, particular Chinese yards entering the fray are extraordinarily attractive like 10%, down 90% upon delivery. Why when risk of cost overruns and late deliveries for established suppliers like NOV had diminished to near zero. Why when oilfield entrepreneurs are now pursuing new build rig opportunities. Why when Brazil has been steadily demonstrating its commitment to order and build rigs in country. Why when 2012 saw a record number of deepwater field discoveries announced and successful application of sub [sold] expiration techniques to West Africa. Why when utilization and day rates for scarce deepwater rig assets remain high, and with me IOCs and NOCs gradually migrating to development drilling falling very successful exploration efforts over the past decade.","A world's view that foresees deepwater orders going down against this backdrop apparently employ some calculus that I just don't get. We believe $100 plus brent and 50% success rates are sufficient to lower the industry into deepwater to discover and capture billions of dollars of petroleum well. We also believe this will take lot of deepwater rigs.","Nevertheless, our above consensus deepwater rig order view does not mean our Rig Technology segment is without challenges. Specifically, despite strong demand, new drilling equipment package pricing has been stubbornly stuck 8% to 10% below the levels of 2007-2008, as new competitors had joined the mix and as contractors proceed with less urgency than before.","Faster hull construction times out of half full Asian shipyards as tightened delivery schedules around NOV components diminishing manufacturing efficiency somewhat as deliveries of major components like drawworks, mud pumps and pipe handling equipment jumped 50% from 2011 levels. Additionally, we are incurring startup costs associated with strategic expansion.","Outside of deepwater, we also see softer demand. Jack-up orders have slowed and most recent interest arises from lower tier contractors. Our competition seem determined to offset NOV's considerable technical and operational advantages with price, sometimes partnering with Chinese shipyards to offer rigs at 10% to 20% discounts to establish yards.","On the land front, demand for rigs and pressure pumping equipment in North America is very weak as major drilling contractors and pressure pumpers has signaled substantial year-over-year reductions in CapEx. Demand will ultimately return high pressure around the clock frac jobs are very tough on pressure pumping equipment and E&P operators continue to push drillers to retool the rig fleets, but we expect 2013 to continue to be slows as we face significant price pressure.","International land markets are far more promising. Numerous tenders are at work for IPM projects throughout Latin America, the Middle East and the Far East, which will require new modern rigs and frac spreads. Interestingly, we see many international land markets finally burning through the rig overhang from the 1970s, and beginning to retool much like their North American counterparts did several years ago with horizontal well capable high-technology drilling assets.","Orders for FPSOs and other subsea development projects totaled over $150 million in the fourth quarter, heavily weighted towards flexible pipe, but as orders for turret mooring systems for FPSOs have remained a little sluggish. However, lately we have seen significant increases in bidding activity for turret mooring systems, which are complementary to the flexible pipe we sell. In fact, we have a couple of signed contracts waiting only for down payments. In the meantime, we are conducting an extraordinarily high number of feed studies on potential subsea FPSO developments while we migrate our business from a project organization to a product organization.","Turning to our petroleum services and supplies group. A strong start to 2012 gave way to sliding North American market conditions over the summer that have persisted through today. Slowing orders for petroleum services and supplies consumables have led to pricing pressure across several product lines that have resulted in lower sequential margins and the general reluctance by drilling and pressure pumping contractors to spend either CapEx or OpEx. Differentiated products and technologies like certain specialized downhole drilling tools have fared better in land markets while offshore markets have generally done well helped by, for example the U.S. Gulf of Mexico recovery.","Several product lines within PS&S enjoyed strong year in shipments but have seen slowing orders through the back half of 2012 and we are therefore braced for a more challenging 2013. For example, in our drill pipe business, we benefited from strong year-end shipments and orders for newbuild rigs while send simultaneously watching demand for high volume shale strings for North America slowed sharply.","Although we have heard others cite Canadian seasonal upturns in Q1, or E&P budget replenishment entering the New Year or potential uplifts in North American gas prices, and various other causes for hope in 2013, that rig activity will rebound, we don\u2019t yet see a rebound happening and we certainly don\u2019t see it soon and we are taking measures to reduce cost and improve efficiencies in the meantime.","As our segment is most heavily weighted to North America, our distribution and transmission group faces a similarly challenging year but our recent acquisitions of Wilson, CE Franklin and Ensco permit us more latitude to aggressively tackle costs and improve margins. The group is performing very well and it sees many of the same market trends as the other two, namely strong international prospects and soft North American demand in traditional upstream areas. Wilson brought more midstream and downstream exposure, strengthened these as partly offsetting sluggish drilling and production demand.","Although we face a difficult market in North America in the short run we remain absolutely committed to enhancing National Oilwell Varco for the long run. We have expanded our aftermarket footprint, our manufacturing capabilities for numerous products and our new plant and machinery. Likewise, we continue to invest in new technologies and products. As market leader, we recognize our commitment to the industry to continually push the bar higher to strive to grow and improve.","2012 was an extraordinarily busy year for acquisitions. We spent $2.9 billion on 17 transactions and we expect to close our previously announced acquisition of Robbins & Myers in just a few weeks. As a group these acquisitions bring us opportunities to affect efficiency gains in our operations, to add new geographic coverage, to complete product offerings, all good things for our customers, our employees and our shareholders, as they help build and grow our business for the long haul.","Despite near-term headwinds I could not be more excited about the future that lay before us, NOV is an equal organization made up of wonderful, dedicated professionals of whom I could not be more proud. Jeremy?","Jeremy Thigpen","Thanks, Clay. As Clay and Pete just mentioned, this was a record-breaking quarter and year. For the quarter National Oilwell Varco earned $668 million, or $1.56 per fully diluted share on $5.7 billion in revenue. Excluding the impact from $51 million in pretax transaction charges and a net $69 million tax benefit related to certain foreign tax credits, we earned net income of $638 million or $1.49 per fully diluted share.","Operating profit for the quarter was $903 million, up $14 million from the third quarter and up $55 million from the fourth quarter of last year on a GAAP basis. Excluding transaction charges from all periods, Q4 operating profit was $954 million, up 1% from the third quarter and up 11% from the fourth quarter of last year.","Operating margins on this basis were 16.8% in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to 17.8% in the third quarter and 20.2% in the fourth quarter of last year. Sequential operating flow-through or leverage was 2% on a 7% increase in sales which is lower than we typically see for three reasons.","The first and probably most important was product mix in our rig tech business. The second factor was, we referenced in Q3 conference call and Clay reinforced in his opening comments, was the degradation of pricing in a number of our PS&S businesses in the U.S. The final factor was the incremental expense associated with various growth initiatives that are underway throughout the organization, including the cost associated with integrating numerous acquisitions. I will provide more color on each of these areas as I recap the quarter and the year for each the segment.","Despite this lower than typical flow-through, Q4 marked a record finish to a record year for NOV. 2012 for National Oilwell Varco generate record net income of $2.5 billion on record revenues of $20 billion, which excluding transaction charges from both years, represented a 37% increase in year-over-year revenue at 13% operating leverage.","Turning to operations NOV's rig technology segment generated record revenues of $2,896 million in the fourth quarter, up 14% sequentially and up 25% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011.","Operating profit, which was also a record with $648 million, yielding operating margins for the group of 22.4%, a decline of 150 basis points from the third quarter and 360 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2011.","Incremental operating leverage was 11% of the sequential sales improvement of $349 million and incremental leverage was 8% from the fourth quarter 2011 on the $580 million revenue improvement. As previously referenced, the sequential flow through was less than we typically expect due to product mix and incremental expense to support several strategic growth initiatives.","In the fourth quarter, we posted strong revenue growth in coiled tubing units, wireline units and land rigs. Unfortunately, the growth in all three product lines was primarily driven by large end of year international projects that we secured at below average margin. Additionally, Q4 brought a double-digit percentage increase in our FPSO related revenues, which as we communicated on previous calls, is currently diluted to overall rig technology margins.","In addition to the unfavorable shipping mix, we also incurred considerable startup costs associated with the NOV Flexibles plant in Brazil and the opening of a new technical college in Korea. These long-term investments will detrimental the current operating margins are expected to benefit future operating results for many years to come. Finally since in 2013, we are scheduled to deliver twice as many offshore projects to the market than we delivered in 2012, we heightened our efforts to hire and train the additional installation and commissioning personnel required to manage this incremental workload. The combination of these factors negatively impacted our flow through however this segment still posted exceptional results.","Revenue out of backlog increased 16%, sequentially to $2,211 million. This march yet another record for our Rig Tech business and validate all those investment that we have made facility, training and continuous process improvement.","Our fourth quarter orders for Rig Technology were $2,417 million, and included three semis and for drillships, and before you ask, of those new seven floaters, we secured the BOP stacks and riser on six of those vessels. We also sold three spare BOP stacks in the quarter as offshore drillers continue to recognize the benefit in both, safety and operational efficiency of owning and maintaining a back-up stack.","On land, we continue to see demand for new rigs in the international arena. However, demand in North American land market was limited to individual pieces of equipment such as iron roughnecks and top drives as some of our larger contractors are ordering to enhance the performance and value of their existing rigs.","For the year, orders totaled the most $9,350 million giving us a year-end backlog of $11,862 million, which is up 2% from September 30th. Of that total, we expect about $7.4 billion to flow out as revenue during 2013, and the remaining $4.5 billion flow out in 2014 and beyond. As a final note on the backlog, at the end of the quarter the composition of our backlog was 91% offshore with 94% of that being destined for international markets.","As we look at potential order flow for 2013, we are hoping for a recovery in North America that will drive demand for new land rigs, coil tubing units, pressure pumping units and other frac-related equipment. However, as Clay said, we are yet to see it, therefore demand for us such new equipment will likely be limited to the international markets with only selected upgrade opportunities in North America, till we believe demand for pressure pumping equipment will ultimately return, land drillers will continue with their programs to retool and upgrade their fleet and the industry will continue to upgrade an aging jack-up fleet while simultaneously building out its worldwide deepwater and shale infrastructure.","Non-backlog revenue for the group improved 8%, sequentially to $685 million, driven by across the board increases in spare parts, service and repair. For the year, non-backlog revenue increased 17% to almost $2,455 million. And as we move into next year, we expect that our aftermarket revenues will continue to improve for three reasons. An ever-growing installed base, some of which is due for mandatory five-year surveys, a heightened focus around drilling safety and product lifecycle analysis and capacity additions such as the acquisition that we made in Q4 about Algoa to provide improved aftermarket support our customers in sub-Saharan Africa.","For the full year, Rig Tech generating $10,107 million in revenues and $2,380 million in operating profit, or 23.5% compared to $7,788 million in revenues and $2,070 million in operating profit at 26.6% in 2011.","While year-over-year operating margins were down due to product mix and the investments associated with various growth initiatives, the segment continued to produce exceptional results posting returns on capital of greater than 25%, and with a record backlog, strong and growing aftermarket sales, and a positive outlook for future offshore orders, we believe that Rig Technology is well-positioned for the future.","As we look into the first quarter of 2013, we expect Rig Technology revenues to be down in the 10% range following flush year-end shipment and virtually nonexistent demand for pressure pumping equipment, and we expect that margins could pick up slightly from Q4 '12. However pricing pressures in North America coupled with a continuing shift in product mix that includes a growing percentage of Brazil and FPSO related revenue were main challenges.","The petroleum services and supplies segment generated total sales of $1,770 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, up 3% from the third quarter and up 13% year-over-year. Operating profit was $355 million or 20.1% of sales. As expected margins fell from the 22.3% level that the segment recognized in the third quarter as pricing pressures across a number product in the North American land market coupled with a shift in product mix led to lower margins. Most notably the continued reduction of North American land activities with the pricing pressures and an overall reduction in volume for our downhole tools, our fiberglass pipe, our coil tubing and our fluid and expendables business.","While revenue declines in these products were offset by sequential growth our drill pipe XL systems and Tuboscope businesses, overall margins still declined. For the full year 2012, PS&S generated a record $6,967 million in revenue, up 23% from 2011. The segment generated $1,519 million in operating profit, representing 32% leverage on the year-over-year sales growth. Operating margins of 21.8% for the year were up 19.4% in 2011.","Looking into the first quarter of 2013, we expect PS&S segment sales to decline in the low to mid single-digit percentage range as several of our businesses have entered the year with diminished backlog and U.S. based drilling contractors and well service firms have been hesitant release new orders. Due to the expected reduction in volumes and the continued pressures on pricing, we believe that operating margins could tick down into the high teens in Q1.","Turning to distribution and transmission. For the quarter, the group generated $1,268 million in sales and $78 million in operating profit or 6.2% of sales. Compared to the third quarter, sales declined 4% with both the legacy distributions business and the transmission business contributing equally to the $47 million decline. For distribution, gains associated with the start of the winter drilling season in Canada were not enough to compensate for the significant declines in the U.S. and in the transmission business the Mono artificial lift and industrial pump business remained fairly strong. However, the decline in tubular demand in the U.S. coupled with a shift down of our wind towers business in Q4 lead to a sequential decline.","Despite the overall 4% reduction in D&T revenue, operating profit for this segment was essentially flat with Q3 as the group continued to recognize cost savings across several acquisitions. These fourth quarter results cap another strong year for this segment overall with a record $3,927 million in sales and a record $253 million in operating profit and 6.4% operating margins. Year-over-year, revenues were up 110% due primarily to the major acquisitions of Wilson and CE Franklin and flow-through was 6% for the year.","For the first quarter of 2013, we expect distribution and transmission revenues to be up in the low single-digit percentage range at slightly lower margins. So, overall, as you think about Q1 and the full year for 2013, we entered the year with a record backlog in rig tech with an estimated $7.4 billion expected to flow out over 2013. The outlook for new offshore rigs, floaters and even jackups is encouraging, as is the demand for FPSOs. However, we are facing some near-term headwinds in the North American land market that will significantly limit opportunities for land rigs as well as pressure pumping, coiled tubing and other frac related equipment.","Rig tech margins, while still best in class, will continue to be challenged by compressed delivery times of the shipyards, a shifting mix that includes a higher percentage of Brazil and FPSO related revenues and pricing pressures in North American land. Our PS&S businesses are excited about growth opportunities in international markets but we entered the year with depleted backlogs, declining demand in North America, which represented 63% of the segment's revenue in the first half of 2012 and pricing pressures across a number of products. Our D&T business will certainly benefit from a full year of Wilson and CE Franklin and the consolidation benefits that will continue to be realized throughout 2013, but it is important to remember that 84% of this segment's revenues are derived from the U.S. and Canada.","In short, we are excited about our backlog, the prospect for new orders, growth in international markets and the considerable benefits already recognized by the integration of Wilson and CE Franklin but we need activity in North America to pickup in order to meaningfully expand margins.","On the income statement, National Oilwell Varco's consolidated fourth quarter income statement saw SG&A decrease $9 million sequentially, as an increase in our incentive compensation accrual coupled with the addition of four new acquisitions in the quarter were more than offset by the reclassification of a portion of Wilson's SG&A expense to cost of goods sold to be more consistent with in our past practices. SG&A, as a percentage of sales, was 8% in the fourth quarter down from 8.7% in the third quarter and 10% from the fourth quarter of last year.","Transaction costs for the quarter were $51 million, driven primarily by integration efforts to consolidate facilities from recently acquired company. Equity income in our Voestalpine JV was $15 million, up considerably from the third quarter as there was a two-week shutdown in Q3 for mill maintenance that resulted in much lower Q3 volumes. We expect profitability from the JV to be down slightly in the first quarter of 2013 as demand for drill pipe in the U.S. continues to vain and therefore demand for green tube continues to vain.","Interest expense essentially doubled from Q3 to Q4 to $21 million as we issued 3 billion of senior notes in November. Other expense increased $14 million from the third quarter, primarily due to unfavorable FX moves. As you undoubtedly noticed, our fourth quarter tax rate was 23.3%, giving us an effective tax rate on the year 29.2%, which is far lower than our historic rate of 32%, 33%.","During the fourth quarter, the company recorded a net $69 million tax benefit resulting from a strategic work reorganization of certain foreign operations to more fully integrate recently acquired business groups. Excluding this impact, the effective tax rate for the quarter would have been 31.3% and the tax rate for the year would have been 31.6%. We expect the effective tax rate for 2013 to be at or near historic levels.","Unallocated expenses and eliminations on our supplemental segment schedule was $127 million in the fourth quarter, up $2 million from the third quarter. Depreciation and amortization was up $9 million from Q3 to $166 million. And for the fourth consecutive quarter, EBITDA excluding other cost, was a record at $1,109 million for the quarter and $4,332 million for the year.","To the balance sheet, National-Oilwell Varco's December 31, 2012 balance sheet employed working capital excluding cash and debt of $6.7 billion, or 29.5% of annualized sales, up $73 million from the third quarter with higher accounts receivable which were tied to revenue growth being substantially offset by reductions in inventory and accrued taxes and liabilities and higher accrued taxes and liabilities.","Total customer financing on projects in the form of prepayments and billings in excess of cost, less cost in excess of billings, was $569 million at December 31, down only $8 million from September 30.","Cash flow from operations was an impressively $800 million for the fourth quarter, CapEx increased $72 million sequentially in the quarter to $201 million, bringing full year capital expenditures to $583 million versus $483 million in 2011. We expect CapEx in 2013 to move up into the $600 million range as we pursue a number of expansion opportunities that we launched last year, including the completion of our new Flexibles [plant] in Brazil.","Cash spent on four acquisitions in the quarter totaled $575 million. For the year, cash spent on 17 acquisitions totaled $2,880 million. And for the year, NOV paid $209 million in dividend to our shareholders leaving us with the cash balance of $3,319 million at December 31, 2012. Of that balance, approximately 40% of the cash resides in the U.S. and will be used help fund the acquisition of Robbins & Myers.","Our total debt at the end of 2012 was $3,149 million, $3 billion of that related to the successful bond offering that I previously referenced. We are very proud that our effective yield on the $3 billion of bond issued was 2.92% with $500 million due in five years, $1.4 billion due in 10 years and $1.1 billion due in 30 years, a truly outstanding job by our treasury department in getting this done. Net of current long-term debt, cash at the end of the year was $170 million.","Now, let me turn it back to Pete.","Merrill Miller","Great. Thanks, Jeremy, and I would like to talk a little bit about some of the things that we've discussed in the past, because they all seem to remain intact right. And basically that's shales, deepwater, the best-in-class technology that we offer and our international presence. I think all of these things continue to dictate the strategy of the company. I think the shales in particular, when you to the oily shales, whether it's up in the Bakken or down in the Eagle Ford, I think they will continue to give us a great presence in especially with [PS and S-pipe] businesses in our distribution business that really can parlay good things in there.","More interestingly, I really do think you are going to see an escalation of shale drilling internationally. It's gone slow, I think a lot of people are of the opinion that maybe it's not going to ramp up as rapidly as you think, but I think that will change. I'd just give you an example. I was in China earlier this week visiting with some shipyards that have just committed on some semi and jack-ups to us, and at the same time the pollution in Beijing was just unbelievable. I mean, people couldn't even go to work. It's so bad.","China, as we all know will move very rapidly in fixing things and the quick fix on pollution like that is pretty simple. That is called natural gas, and the natural gas they have in the shales in China, I think you will start to see a real escalation of things like that in the international arena. The reality is that natural gas is very clean burning and that you are going to see more demand of that around the world and we are prepared to be able to help them there. I think that\u2019s going to really be situation for us.","As I talk about the international arena, we have referenced on this call, things like Russia. We are expanding very dramatically in Russia. We think that\u2019s going to be a great market over the next five or 10 years and we are also building a new facility there that will be able both rigs and our downhole tools. That\u2019s something that I am excited about. I think Russia really needs the technology that we have and this plays into a couple of things. It plays in international shales, and it also plays in to the best in class technology.","In China, I mentioned that earlier. I was there this past week to take a look at things. I think the Chinese shipyards are going to be much more active. I think they are going to really jump into this situation on deepwater and we are situated very, very well with them to be able to take advantage of the products that we service. It is really interesting because when you look at a shipyard, we are producing equipment all over the world and shipping it to China to be able to put it on the semisubmersibles that those guys are doing.","On Brazil, we mentioned that this quarter we did not have on the floaters that we have got. None of them were Brazil. We expect that to occur in the first quarter. We are excited about that. There is some real opportunity down there. I think Brazil will continue to be quite a nice place for us.","In the Middle East right now, it is improving for us on land rigs. We talked about the lack of land rig demand in North America but in other parts of the world it's picking up. I think you will see it pick up. I will come back to Russia and also you will see it pick up in the Middle East and we are situated very well to be able to take advantage of it right there.","Our backlog is off to a good start in the first quarter. We have had a lot of things come in to it already. We are excited about the prospects of what we are going to see when it comes in the more deepwater and more demand for our technologically advanced equipment.","Then finally, I would like to talk a little bit about technology. You know, that really is going to be the differentiation between us and any of the people that we work with. To give you a good example, I look at our 20,000 psi BOP that we are going to be coming out with very quickly. The neat thing though is that not only do we have a 20,000 psi BOP but we also, because of everything else that we manufacture, we are able to size the rig appropriately.","We are able to do things to the derrick. We are able to do things to the piping system. We are able to do things to the top drive to be able to handle the bigger and heavier BOPs that are associated with that. So when you buy from NOV and get our technology, you get the fully integrated products. That\u2019s going to really dictate well into the future of what the business is that we are going to be getting. So we feel very good about where we are. We are going to continue to invest heavily in training. We are going to continue to grow organically. We think while there are some near-term costs, there is going to be some great longer term returns based upon this type of thing and I am really excited about it.","Finally, I would just like to give a shot out to our distribution folks. They have done a phenomenal job this year on being able to integrate both Wilson and CE Franklin. You saw the margins here, about 6% after less than about six months of those companies being together. I am very excited about everything that those folks are doing.","So that\u2019s just some brief comments on what we are trying to do strategically and some things that we are seeing. Dawn, at this point, I would like to turn it over for any questions that our listeners might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Brain Uhlmer from Global Hunter. Please go ahead.","Brain Uhlmer - Global Hunter Securities","Hi, good morning, gentlemen. I have a whole list of questions and I will start with and one follow-up to that. First, Jeremy, I think a great job, your first time on this call, keeping up with Pete and Clay and your alacrity in providing those guidance details.","Jeremy Thigpen","Thank you. I appreciate that.","Brain Uhlmer - Global Hunter Securities","I wanted to start off with some thing that\u2019s material here to your comments on the RBN and your confidence in enclosing that acquisition in the next several weeks because the arm spread has definitely widened. I was curious, are there going to be any stipulations to that closing of that deal that will require you to sell any portions of RBN or what gives you that confidence it is going to close in a couple of weeks, as clearly, it looks like the market makes otherwise right now.","Merrill Miller","Well, Brian, we continue to provide answers to questions that the government might have and we continue to push to a close here in about two or three weeks. I think Robbins & Myers has issued a press release giving the date of the closing and we continue to push to that and believe that's what's going to occur.","Brain Uhlmer - Global Hunter Securities","And that there will be no, you are going to be in its entirety, correct?","Merrill Miller","That is where we are right now.","Brain Uhlmer - Global Hunter Securities","Beautiful. Thank you. And as my follow-up completely unrelated, you say that Rig Tech margins might tick up in Q1. I was curious maybe the progression as we go through the year and the statement might, does that have more to do with a mix issue or more to do with closing out the start-ups and getting everything done like you said in Brazil and Korea or there are some cost on that and what makes it unlike to it will and as that progress as we get through 2013?","Jeremy Thigpen","This is Jeremy. I think, the might is really related to all those things that we talked about on the call. There's a significant impact to all of our pressure pumping equipment, the coiled tubing unit, land rig in North America, that's going to weigh heavily on margins and then we do have a lot of startup cost associated with the Flexibles plan in Brazil. Again, the product mix with more FPSO-related revenues flowing in more reservoir-related revenues flowing in, we just think all of those are going to present some challenges for us and how those work through the system throughout the year kind of remains to be seen.","Merrill Miller","Yes. On the positive side, Brian, aftermarket in that space is doing terrific, particularly wrapped around offshore rigs coming in for the five-year surveys, and then we kind of cover these in our opening comments. There's lots of puts and takes here, but as Jeremy mentioned, lots of negatives and we are hopeful though that the offset will be the aftermarket side of that business, which is very accretive to the market.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Crandell from Dahlman Rose. Please go ahead.","Jim Crandell - Dahlman Rose","Pete, I know you like to look at your sort of order picture on a more than one quarter basis, and looking forward let's say 12 months out by the end of '13, do you think there is absolute chance that your of backlog could be higher than it is today and also could you address in a little bit more detail what you are seeing with sort of granularity in the FPSO market that makes you optimistic today.","Merrill Miller","Jim, we are very optimistic that 2013 is going to see a good order, and I think that obviously the way we do backlog as I told you many times we had to cut it off on a day-specific, but I would expect 2013 to really be an excellent year and I would certainly expect over 1 to 1 book-to-bill on it.","I think as we take a look at the FPSO market, we're getting pretty excited about it. It's not similar to, when you look at a lot of the people that are subsea production and they kind of keep moving out to the right and many of the same ways the FPSO business is moving a little bit to the right, but it's still something that is pretty exciting.","We are starting to see as Clay mentioned in his comments earlier, we've done a lot of the feed studies, but we are also starting to kind of see a lot of the stuff development orders. We have received some orders on some products in the first quarter that are not included in the backlog currently, but the fact of the matter is, if you kind of take a look at it, it's almost inescapable.","You look at all these deepwater rigs that we are putting out there and they are drilling and they are not drilling for practice. They are drilling to discover oil and gas and the approved solution when they discover that oil and gas, in most cases there's going to be the FPSOs, and we think with what we have with NKT and what we have with our APL business that we are going to be positioned to be able to take advantage of that. So, we are still pretty bullish on it and we think as you go more into this year, you will see a lot more materialization of orders.","Jim Crandell - Dahlman Rose","Okay. Thank you, Pete, and my follow-up is that, I guess, Clay, you addressed in your comment about the ultra deepwater market. I think one of the things that would maybe limit the ordering from the large U.S. or formerly U.S.-based contract is that the pressure, at least they feel to returning cash to shareholder, either making large dividend payments, MLPs and the like of that sort of slowing down their process. Do you see actually a difference at this point, Pete or Clay and the likelihood of the U.S. companies ordering more ultradeepwater rigs versus some of your European companies like Seadrill, Pacific, Ocean Rig, Odfjell and those kinds of companies?","Clay Williams","That, you know, Jim, it really varies by company. I know that many of them are wrestling with the decision of allocating capital in to new growth prospects versus returning to shareholders and they are all taking that question very, very seriously. I would also add, a lot of them have a lot of projects underway currently that they are very busy with. But I have got to tell you, as a group, the U.S. based, publicly traded companies are in as good a mood as I have ever seen them.","They see a lot of prospect out there in the marketplace, lots of opportunities to grow their businesses. And candidly, I think you go back five, six years ago the market demonstrated this, if they don\u2019t act on those opportunities, somebody will. You have recently seen a lot of entrepreneurs now getting back in this space as well.","So there are big returns to be had out there. Something like 300 deepwater fields that have been announced that haven\u2019t been developed. 2012 was a record year in terms of announcement of discoveries in the deepwater. As Pete said, there is a lot of drilling and FPSO development to come and that takes a lot of deepwater rigs. So I think whether or not it\u2019s the U.S. based organizations or their European counterparts or others around the globe getting into the fray, I think somebody is going to continue to build lot of deepwater rigs.","Jim Crandell - Dahlman Rose","Okay, and Pete, just as clarification, were you saying that based on your trip to China, you think now that will major contract drillers order ultradeepwater drillships from Chinese yards now going forward?","Merrill Miller","I think they are going to be in the mix, Jim. But I think that a lot of them will be some of the Chinese drillers. You are starting to see people like Cosul and some of the bigger Chinese folks try to be major players. I think you will see some of the Norwegian pipe companies that will be looking at the Chinese shipyards. But I think Chinese shipyards are clearly going to be a player. They are getting in the mix and I think they are getting better at what they do.","Jim Crandell - Dahlman Rose","So you think your customer mix in new ultradeepwater rig orders could change a fair amount going forward from what it has been over the last couple years?","Merrill Miller","You know, Jim, it has been a cyclical deal. If you go back to '06 and '07, you have a lot of what we were called speculators and we said at the time, they weren\u2019t speculators but they were people who were really going to develop in to quite good operations and you see people like Seadrill and Ocean Rig and Odfjell and Pacific today. Then we kind of went in to the more traditional folks, the Transoceans, then the Nobles and the Atwoods and the Rowans and then I think you start to have some other people coming back in to the marketplace today. So it is really kind of a shift in customer base but it is one that we are positioned with very well and we like where we are.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Will Herbert from Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.","Will Herbert - Simmons & Company","Thanks, good morning. Great, thank you. Continuing with the next question, Pete and Clay, with regard to the type of floaters that you are seeing from an increased standpoint. Is it still mostly drillships? Or are you getting more semisubmersibles in the mix?","Clay Williams","Bill, we are starting a few more semis come in the mix. I think as you take a look at it, a lot of the drillships are really exploratory and when you start going into exploitation of fields, the semisubmersibles offer a few advantages there but we are still a lot of drillships as well. But we are starting to pick up a lot on the semisubmersible and of course, we are in a great position either way. Our DEP, our drilling equipment package fits quite well on either way. So we kind of like where we are in that. But it\u2019s a little bit of a shifting mix in that.","Will Herbert - Simmons & Company","And when you talk about a book-to-bill meeting or exceeding one time this year, what's going to be the mix of the inbound on a year-over-year basis in terms of relative to 2012? Do you expect your deepwater DEPs to match the numbers in 2012? Call 24, 25 packages? Or is it a significant ramp in FPSOs? It sounds like North American capital equipment is going to be lower, international possibly higher in terms of onshore. How does that mix configure with regard to reaching both develop one times?","Clay Williams","Bill, you described it pretty well actually. I think you covered all the bases. Yes. What pressure North American land, obviously year-over-year, continued interest in deepwater as Pete said more, we got a high expectations for Brazil to contribute the more deepwater orders as well as broader ordering around the globe in deepwater, so kind of a broadly speaking a shift away from land towards more deepwater.","Will Herbert - Simmons & Company","Okay. And then last one for me, Jeremy, with regard to the roadmap for Rig Tech margins for the balance of the year. Sounds like fat to up in the first quarter, so let's call that, you know, whatever 23%, but how does that evolve over the course of 2013? Do we exit at a higher rate or do we kind of average sort of a sub-25% margins for the year and it's pretty flat for the balance of 2013?","Jeremy Thigpen","Yes. I think pretty flat for the balance of 2013.","Will Herbert - Simmons & Company","Okay. Great. Thank you very much, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ed Muztafago from Societe Generale. Please go ahead.","Ed Muztafago - Societe Generale","I was wondering if you maybe talk a little bit more about the FPSO dilution side and Rig Tech, and I guess what I am trying to understand there is that just an issue of restructuring of those businesses to get them up to the core Rig Tech margin, or is that business just somewhat price-challenged right now given the activity levels that are going on in order?","Merrill Miller","Yes. Actually, it's not actually price-challenged it's more volume-challenged at this point. We had a big downturn in surf equipment 2010 and 2011, and we've kind of been gradually trying to creep out of that I would say, but volume has been an issue, one number.","Number two, Jeremy spoke to this quite. His comments about fact that we're building a big plant for Flexibles pipe in Brazil, and so that's a specific project-driven drag with start-up costs in Brazil and those are going to continue for some time getting that going in our flexible pipe business, but the I think the main thing we need there are volumes to pick up, because the pricing we've been getting particularly for flexible pipe lately is really pretty good incremental margins on a project-by-project are pretty good, so it's much more kind of, we are I think well-positioned for in the market really comes on strong. And as Pete said a moment ago, we believe the market is going to come on strong","Ed Muztafago - Societe Generale","So, I mean, it sounds to me that absent any further pricing improvements, you can probably get there volume picks up, which you are sort of I guess predicting this year, but if we get a pretty upsurge in ordering then what do you think can happen there on pricing?","Merrill Miller","I think the outlook for pricing improvement obviously rises with demand and as volumes rise, those two things kind of go hand-in-hand and so we always try to be thoughtful about pricing and try to make sure we are getting paid for the good value that we deliver. So, certainly as those opportunities present themselves, we are going to act on them. But at this point, it's really more, right now, we need more loading in our infrastructure and our plans and that would help.","Ed Muztafago - Societe Generale","Okay. I guess, just as second question on the M&A side of the business. Can you guys talk to sort of what you are seeing in terms of the potential for more large scale M&A and really how that might sort of ducktail into what your use of cash might be post closing the RBN acquisition?","Merrill Miller","As you take a look at M&A, we've always been very opportunistic, Ed, and when especially means you are talking about large larger deals, it really is question of just time and patience, and yes we talk about this a lot. I mean, when you are doing those deals, the moon and stars kind of have to align appropriately, you have to make sure that the stock prices are there both, ours and theirs, talking some of the larger deals. So, we'll continue to be opportunistic and take a look at whatever is out there. There is a lot of things that strategically we still want to do, and so we are going to continue to be active in the market.","On the other side though, on especially on our some of the deals, it's always been our experience that it really is advantageous to be able to take advantage of that in down markets. There is a lot o folks that when things are good, they think they are never going to get bad, and they are bad, they think they are never going to get good. So, we like to kind of pounce and be able to do some things when we need to and when things are a little softer.","So, we will continue to be very aggressive in the M&A area and we will continue to look at a lot of different things that fit with our strategic plan that we have got and to fit into the things that we want to do.","Ed Muztafago - Societe Generale","Yes, sure. I mean $500 million in Q4 is not exactly a small amount. Okay, thanks a lot, guys. I really appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets","So you guys did a great job outlining the prospects and you guys are knowing better and tuned to the market than we guys are. I just want to dig a little bit further on the outlook here as you guys indicated for rig tech and rig tech orders. You identified some opportunity sets. Clay, you mentioned a number of entrepreneurs coming into the market. Last time the entrepreneurs were basically headquartered out of Norway. Where do you see this next rung of entrepreneurs emerging from?","Clay Williams","Some are in Norwegian, but Kurt, we have inbound inquiries from lots of places around the globe. So we are happy to work with whoever we find credit worthy and understands the value that NOV can provide to their new business opportunities. But suffice to say the strong returns that are possible in deepwater rig building haven't gone unnoticed by lots of entrepreneurs around the globe.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets","Then I want to follow-up too. Pete, you mentioned you were in China, I guess earlier in the week. You mentioned a number of Chinese yards getting very aggressive in trying to fill their business backlog. I am sure you are finding every way possible to help them in that process. A mutually beneficial operation, I am sure. But I know that there has been a number of questions over the years about the quality and the timeliness of what comes out of the Chinese yards. So what, in your mind Pete, what you think is changing, what has changed and what gives you the kind of confidence that you have that China is going to be able to improve on their quality and delivery times?","Merrill Miller","Kurt, that's a great question. I can answer it pretty simply and it's called the learning curve. As you take look and even if you go back to the Korean yards, it took the Korean yards a period of time to learn and figure out what's going on. If you go back to the mid-90s, there were some issues in all yards about getting this step done appropriately. I think in China, there is a couple of things that give me a little bit more confidence. I think some of the yards have changed management. They have brought different people in. They have brought people in from Korea. They have brought people from Singapore. They have brought folks in that understand the way to do things.","I like the professionalism that I am seeing out of these yards. In particular, I met with the chairman of a couple of yards while I was there this past weekend and I like what I am seeing. I am seeing very much of the western style of management, a very good understanding of safety, a very good understanding of quality and they also know that they need NOV to help them. That's what I like the most about them. And the fact of the matter is that they know that having us there, we can help them scale some of those challenges that they have.","So I feel pretty good, and again, from when I started it comes back to really the learning curve, and I think they have gotten on that learning curve and they are going to do better in the future.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets","Great and I don\u2019t want to leave Jeremy out of the mix. So I am going to bend the rule here a little bit. So Jeremy, you were kind enough to answer the question on the prospect for rig technology margins throughout the course of the year. So I am going to ask you about PSS. How do you see PSS margins evolving?","Jeremy Thigpen","I think at the start the year, we will probably see a slight dip as we have referenced earlier in the comments. Then, really it's going to be dependent on return of activity in North America. All those businesses in PS&S are heavily tied to North America land, and as that market goes, so goes the PS&S group in terms of margin.","There are companies out there who have speculated on their calls that rig counts will increase in Q1 and into Q2. We are not yet seeing that. But we are definitely looking for it. As you see those rig counts start to tick up and drilling contractors and well service firms start to work again, they will start buying products and services from us and so will our margins.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Marshall Adkins from Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Marshall Adkins - Raymond James","Good morning, guys. After Clay's diatribe, I feel like I really need to start my question with the word, why. So why are those PS&S margins holding up better than most of us saw? I mean you've seen a lot of the North American names really take a hit with a lower rig count last quarter, but you guys seem to be remarkably resilient. Is it the offshore side? Is it international? Help me understand what's going on there.","Merrill Miller","Sure. Offshore and international certainly helped, but the real issue is a lot of people don't understand that we do have backlog in the PS&S businesses. It's not backlog that we recognize when we report to you guys, but its backlog that's kind of two, three, four-month out. And when you see rig activity decline and you see the drilling contractors and well service firms start to slow down, we still have backlog that we are working off over the next three to four months and so you won't see it really impact us until three or four months after you see activity decline and that's kind of where we are hitting right now in Q1. And so, we've worked up these backlogs in Q4, we are now back kind of that in day-to-day business and now it's when you kind of start to expect, revenues to decline a little bit and margins to erode a little bit.","Marshall Adkins - Raymond James","Okay. Good helpful. On the Rig Tech side, again, very helpful guidance there, the pricing in the backlog, though, it seems like some of the other guys are starting to see the backlog price and they expect the pricing to move up over the course of the year and the flat margin that you foresee for Rig Tech, are we seeing better pricing in that and that being offset by other things out there or is it just flat pricing?","Merrill Miller","Bear in mind, our Rig Tech backlog is heavily dominated by long-term projects and so the margins moved slowly, but, Marshall, and I kind of touched on this in my comments. The pricing we are seeing out there selling rig equipment continues to bump up against ceilings and competitive forces and so forth and has never gotten back to where it was in '07 and '08, so I would say pricing is, it's good.","I don't want to give you a wrong impression. These were good pieces of work and good projects and we are excited about them, I don't think they are going to lead to the kind of margins that we saw a couple of years ago and that's the constraint that we are facing out there, so I would say here in the recent near-term, pricing has been pretty stable across most products in rig offshore, Lands is definitely under pressure. Frac fleets, well service rigs those sorts of things. Land rigs, definitely under pressure with the downturn in North America.","Jeremy Thigpen","I'll also add too, Marshall, that when you buy NOV, you are not buying necessarily on price either. We are selling quality and we are not going to equal the (Inaudible) then we tell all of our customers, if it's about the lowest bid then don't worry about us, because we are not going to be there. We are here to make money, but we are also here to provide outstanding products and that's what we do.","And so, I think that's why we continue to have, even though sometimes we have margin erosion we continue to still have pretty darn solid margins for manufacturing products, so we are going to continue to price aggressively, we have to keep our eye on the competition, but we think we provide value and that value has got some margin behind it.","Marshall Adkins - Raymond James","You mentioned the long lead times in that backlog. If you get more out of Brazil, does that stretch up lead times even longer?","Merrill Miller","Probably it will. I think, as you are taking a look at some of the Brazilian shipyards, that comes back to what I was just mentioning earlier on the Chinese that there is a learning curve there and our guess is the first couple of drillships that some of these yards do will take longer than what traditionally we've seen out of the Korean shipyards.","Marshall Adkins - Raymond James","Yes, makes sense. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Miller for closing comments.","Merrill Miller","Thank you all very much for listening in and we look forward to talking to you again on our first quarter 2013 conference call. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. A digital replay is available of this call today. You may dial 188-843-7419, or 1-630-652-3042.

My name is Dawn, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Loren Singletary, Vice President of Investor and Industry Relations. Mr. Singletary, you may begin.","Loren Singletary","Thank you, Dawn, and welcome, everyone to the National Oilwell Varco first quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. With me today is Pete Miller, Chairman, CEO and President of National Oilwell Varco; and Clay Williams, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin this discussion of National Oilwell Varco's financial results for its first quarter first quarter ended March 31, 2012, please note that some of the statements we make during this call may contain forecasts, projections and estimates, including but not limited to comments about our outlook for the company's business. These are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws based on limited information as of today, which is subject to change. They are subject to risks, uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. No one should assume that these forward-looking statements remain valid later in the quarter or later in the year.

Further information regarding these, as well as supplemental financial and operating information, may be found within our press release, on our website at www.nov.com or in our filings with the SEC. [Operator Instructions] ","Now I will turn the call over to Pete for his opening comments.","Merrill A. Miller","Thanks, Loren, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, National Oilwell Varco announced first quarter 2012 earnings of $606 million or $1.42 per fully diluted share on revenue of $4.3 billion. Excluding transaction cost, earnings were $1.44 per fully diluted share. This compares the year-earlier results of $0.96 per share on revenues of $3.15 billion. We are extremely pleased with these earnings and feel they are indicative of the great product offerings National Oilwell Varco offers to the industry, and the excellent execution of our outstanding employees. Thank you, all for your wonderful efforts. ","Additionally, we announced new capital orders of $1.91 billion for the quarter, a 15% increase from last quarter. Definitive proof of the demand for our market-leading highly technical equipment. Earlier backlog or ending backlog for the quarter was $10.4 billion. The first quarter is a nice start to 2012 and exemplifies the full cycle product offerings of NOV. At this time, I will ask Clay to provide color on these results and I'll return a little later to add a few operational comments. Clay?","Clay C. Williams","Thanks, Pete. National Oilwell Varco posted strong earnings for its first quarter of 2012, generating earnings for $1.44 per fully diluted share, up 44% from a year ago and a 5% from last year including transaction and devaluation charges from all periods. Revenues were a record $4.3 billion, up 37% from the year-earlier quarter and up slightly from the fourth quarter of 2011. Operating profit x transaction charges was $881 million and consolidating operating margins were 20.5%, both up sequentially and year-over-year. Operating leverage or flow-through was 48% on a small sequential revenue gain and 22% on the 37% year-over-year revenue gain. ","Our consolidated results show a shift in margins between 2 segments. Solid sequential margins gains within Petroleum Services & Supplies offset sequential declines in Rig Technology. Distribution & Transmission margins were down just slightly from a very strong level in Q4. Our businesses performed well in the first quarter, benefiting from high levels of activity in North America and abroad, as well as a great starting backlog of orders. Like others, we are watching closely the impact of low North American gas prices on activity, and we are shifting our operations from gassy basins to liquids-rich plays but we remain cautiously optimistic that rising oil rig activity will continue to offset falling demand for gas rigs across North America. Elsewhere around the globe, we foresee continued interest in Shale Gas Technologies onshore, and blossoming deepwater activity offshore.","We have made good progress in deploying capital to better position National Oilwell Varco to better serve our customers through investments in new plants in spare parts and repair inventory to support our installed base and in acquisitions. And this quarter's results reflect contributions from all 3. New facilities for downhole tools, drill pipe, Fiberglass Pipe, coil tubing units, pressure-pumping equipment, tubular inspection, encoding and pumps, plus capacity expansions for top drives, block preventers, coil tubing and aftermarket services are beginning to contribute. ","We've also been able to step up our acquisition space over the past 12 months, with Ameron and NKT Flexibles and several other smaller deals. We've announced the acquisition of Wilson Supply from Schlumberger, and we hope to close our acquisition of Interflow, a Canadian manufacturer of well stimulation equipment with over 600 employees within the next few days. All with a view to strengthen NOV's product and service offerings for the benefit of our customers and shareholders for decades to come as the oil and gas industry transitions to a world where energy needs are met by deepwater technology, by horizontal factory drilling and by hydraulic pressure stimulation, into which NOV is the leading technology provider.","Turning to our segment operating results, the Rig Technology group generated revenues of $2,259,000,000 in the first quarter, down 2% sequentially, but up 40% compared to the first quarter of 2011. Operating profit was $551 million, yielding operating margins for the group of 24.4%, down 160 basis points from the prior quarter and down 180 basis points from the first quarter last year. Decremental leverage was 91% on the modest sequential sales decline and compared to the first quarter of 2011, incremental leverage or flow-through was 20% on a 40% sales increase, due to gradual mix shift toward lower margin projects that we've discussed before. ","Inquiries and orders had been very strong and offshore drilling customers euphoric. The stars of $100 crude, high and rising day rates, hungry shipyards and open capital markets seem to be aligned. We believe whole prices are down 1% to 2% from mid-2011 peaks. And shipyards are eager to replace dwindling backlogs of dry bulk shipping and other conventional vessels. While the outlook for jack-ups is strong too, we would characterize it as less buoyant than the demand for floaters, with more second- and third-tier contractors, NOC's and startup interests for jack ups than we see in the floater area. While drillship demand dominated our orders last year, recent interest in semi-submersibles mostly for the North Sea has picked up, as has had increase for subsea construction vessel equipment like active heave cranes. ","First quarter bookings totaled $1,911,000,000, up 15% sequentially and included 4 floating rig packages, 1 floating well intervention vessel package and 2 jack-up packages. We shipped $1,711,000,000 out of backlog, down 4% sequentially, leaving a quarter-end level of $10,363,000,000, an improvement of about 2% from the start of the quarter.","At March 31, 2012, about 16% of the segment's backlog for capital equipment was for land, 84% for offshore and 14% was for domestic markets, 86% for international markets. Of orders in the backlog at quarter-end, we expect $5.2 billion to flow out as revenue through the remainder of the year, $2.9 billion to flow out in 2013 and the balance to convert to revenue thereafter. We delivered 5 floaters and 1 jack up during the first quarter, bringing our total to 132 offshore rigs supplied to the industry since 2005.","First quarter bookings did not include any additional rigs for Brazil, although we are working on new drilling equipment package contracts for that market related to indigenous new newbuild programs by Petrobras and its rig financing arm Sete. Our previously announced contract with EAS for 7 drillships is being converted from an SHI [ph] design to an LNG design, and we look forward to starting to cut the first iron for this program soon. ","On our March 31 balance sheet, you'll see that inventory increased $498 million during the first quarter on a consolidated basis. About half of this increase was in the Rig Technology segment due to, one, the acceleration of the rig construction process as compared to the 2006, 2010 cycle, which requires NOV drilling equipment package components to be manufactured at a faster pace; two, lower level of completed contracts revenues this quarter, down about $123 million sequentially; and three, our intentional investment in spare parts to support our customers. We've noted on past calls that the shipyards are shaped 10 months or more off the build schedules for drillships as our key-side resources have loosened. This requires accelerated component velocities to our plans to accommodate their new speedier schedules and our inventory levels reflect this. ","Demand for individuals subsea BOP stacks not associated with offshore newbuild rigs contributed to the strong Q1 order levels and we expect the same in Q2. As drilling contractors seek replacements for stacks unable to be certified, and for fleet spares. Forgings with these are long lead time items too, which further contributed to our inventory growth. Prompted by E&P operators, more and more newbuild floaters seem to be adding a second BOP stack. Consequently, we are adding a fifth and sixth rig-up pad to our plant in Houston to accommodate all this demand and presently training 170 students at 1 of our 5 technical colleges located around the globe.","Orders for turret mooring system or FPSOs remained light in Q1, with a couple of major FPSO owner\/operators struggling with cash flow issues but we believe we are nevertheless very close to signing up a couple of meaningful turret orders later this year and continue to remain busy remain busy with the quotations. We will also begin to see some contribution to our subsea production business in Q2, following the closing of our NKT Flexibles acquisition in early April, which brings National Oilwell Varco flexible piping solutions for subsea developments. ","Land drilling demand -- land rig -- land drilling rig demand grew slightly in the first quarter, which we view as temporary and perhaps budget-related after a strong fourth quarter. We see more tangible operator activism on pulling new technology into the marketplace, the AC-powered, electronically controlled, robotic pipe-handling 21st century rigs that we referred to on many previous calls. Although terms of appear to be shortening from 3 years, down to 1 or 2 years, term contracts at strong day rates being offered -- are being offered nonetheless to joint contractors to build new 21st century rigs even as old rigs sit idle offering pretty compelling evidence that operators prefer these new rigs. The land drilling industry also appears to be moving toward rig replacements and additions in larger quanta, bigger, more systematic build programs as opposed to onesies and twosies, which enables these operators to institutionalize crew training, operating procedures, equipment standardization. In short, bring industrially efficient methods to the systematic replacement of their increasing obsolete old rig fleets. ","Although less evolved in the North American market, we see a similar pool of 21st century rig technology into drilling markets in Latin America, the Far East, the Middle East and most recently, with our new CE ATEX-rated rig design, Eastern Europe. We expect this trend to accelerate as operators gain experience with these cool new rig toys. ","Perhaps contrary to conventional wisdom, orders for well intervention equipment and spares remain very strong in the first quarter, falling just slightly sequentially for pressure pumping equipment and coming in roughly even with high demand levels seen in the first quarter of last year. Coil tubing and pressure pumping equipment is largely sold out until early 2013. To the extent we see any incremental ordering weakness, we would characterize it as small independents and dry gas regions but nevertheless, we won orders from 2 more North Americans startup pressure pumpers just last week, and quoting activity still remains risque. ","Our window may not necessarily be representative since about 40% of well intervention equipment we sell goes overseas, with China and the Middle East particularly hungry for hydro rig coil tubing equipment and rolling on frac spreads these days. We also sell ASEP Elmar wire line units through this product line and have seen good demand and excellent margin performance for these in the first quarter. Sales of aftermarket spares and services improved 3% for the Rig Technology group sequentially, helped by strong demand for BOP and well interventions spares. Non-backlog capital sales declined sequentially. ","Looking forward into the second quarter of 2012, we expect a good quarter for orders for Rig Technology. Both offshore packages and complete land rig orders should be strong, but we see -- we may see pressure pumping equipment orders cooling. Second quarter revenues for the group are expected to be up in the mid-single-digit percentage range, but we expect operating margins to tick down slightly, owing to NKT flowing in at diluted margins, partly offset by rising margins in offshore drilling equipment. ","The Petroleum Services & Supplies segment posted a bang-up quarter, with revenues of $1,704,000,000, up 9% sequentially and up 35% year-over-year. Operating profit was $388 million and operating margins were a stout 22.8%, up 360 basis points sequentially. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, the $134 million revenue increase produced 65% operating leverage or flow-through, and year-over-year flow-through was 32%, both helped by higher volumes, improved pricing, cost reductions in some international areas and outstanding execution on integration of recent acquisitions within fiberglass systems and mission in particular. ","From a regional perspective, U.S. revenues grew 19% sequentially and totaled 54% of the segment's mix in the first quarter. Canada improved 16% and totaled 8% of the mix and International revenues declined 2% due mostly to weather issues in Europe and lower sales in the UAE, offset by gains in Brazil and Russia. ","Strong sequential performance was posted in several business units. National Oilwell Varco's Downhole Tools business had a tremendous quarter, benefiting from steady adoption of horizontal drilling and a high interest in drilling optimization. Capacity from our new Houston plant and lean manufacturing initiatives at existing plants enabled us to respond quickly to high demand and helped improve the utilization of our rental fleet. Latin America posted record results and margins in Europe moved up substantially. ","Demand for agitators and for our new thermal abrasion-resistant Helios spin technology also contributed to the strong results. Several new downhole technologies are in various stages of field trials, so our outlook is bright. Downhole tools, together with our IntelliServ joint venture with Schlumberger, achieved an important milestone this quarter. We transmitted high-speed, real-time downhole drilling mechanics measurements to control the surface machinery on the rig to optimize the drilling process. This is very, very exciting given that this is the first time to our knowledge that anyone in the industry has ever done this on a real well in the field, and the immediate impact on the drilling speed was remarkable. ","Fiberglass had a great quarter too. First quarter results included a full quarter of the composite pipe sales from Ameron, which we closed in October of last year. Solid demand and decisive execution of the integration plan lifted combined margins for the business nearly 500 basis points sequentially on strong volume gains, particularly for composite piping systems for FPSOs. The outlook is good as well as the group proceeds with product rationalization and operational improvements between the 2 heritage organization and as we hit our stride on a newly opened plant in Oman. ","Drill pipe volumes and margins improved sharply in the first quarter. After spiking last year, purchases of more expensive third-party green tubes subsided a bit this quarter, lifting margins considerably. Mix was essentially unchanged from Q4, with about 2\/3 of our sales consisting of premium pipe. Orders exceeded shipments, as offshore newbuild orders began to flow in, about 20 in the first quarter, lifting our average price per foot in our backlog and pushing backlog up nearly 60% above year ago levels. ","We continue to pursue drill pipe orders for more than 60 newbuild offshore rigs. Land drillers have moved towards using paper strings to limit demand for premium 4-inch XD pipe, a proprietary NOV offering, and maximize use of 5-inch API pipe, which they already have in abundance. So pricing leverage for drill pipe appears to be flattening. ","Our Mission pump and flow iron products also enjoyed great demand in the first quarter. Pumps for new build land rigs, 2 small acquisitions, and sharp sequential demand growth for reciprocating pumps contributed to double-digit sales growth increases, along with higher-pressure vessel sales and price increases pushed through last year. The group is developing some flow process products that will further augment NOV's product package for FPSOs, produce water, de-sanders and de-oilers, separators and transfer pumps, as well as innovating new flow iron products, for land based hydraulic frac jobs. ","The high domestic rig count, coupled with high drilling productivity has increased the velocity of casing and tubing through the system. As rigs move faster and steadily trend drilling days from wells, tubular consumption rises in the aggregate. Pipe mills add capacity and runs and our tubular scope, tubular inspection and coding operations are, as a result, full of pipe and busy. Our Houston Sheldon Road pipe yard complex, for example, unloaded nearly 19,000 truckloads of pipe during the first quarter. That's a load every 7 minutes, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, during the quarter. Our Houston tubular coating operation is largely booked through the year and our crew is operating inline QAQC services at external pipe mills and pipe processors across the country, inspected 90,000 more pieces in Q1 than the preceding quarter. ","Offshore operators are assembling the casing, tubing and conductor pipe they need along the Gulf Coast as the Gulf of Mexico returns to a more normal level of activity, which has led the rising backlogs for NOV's conductor pipe connections provided by XL Systems. This group will open a new plant in Q4 to help meet rising offshore demand. ","NOV's well site services saw strong demand for solids [ph] control equipment and generator rentals across North America during the first quarter, benefiting as well from improvements from the Gulf of Mexico. Despite transition costs arising for the migration of operations from gas basins like the Haynesville and Barnett into the oil regions of the Eagle Ford and Permian and Bakken, margins were very solid through the quarter. Party sales were down after a strong Q4 and project delays in Q1, but Mexico improved due in part to recent acquisition and Brazil remained strong. ","Our new coil tubing mill contributed to a nice quarter at Quality Tubing, which saw demand for coil tubing continue to climb as NOV steadily adds to the worldwide coil tubing unit fleet. We are constructing yet another new mill, which will be online in early 2013 and see continued strong demand for the next several years. ","Looking into the second quarter of 2012, we expect Petroleum Services & Supplies segment sales to be roughly flat with the first quarter but at lower margins. While we expect sequential growth in demand for certain products and services the segment offers, these will be partly offset by seasonal declines in Canada due to break up when authorities enact road bans on large loads during the spring fall to prevent damage. Canadian break up began a little early this year but we're hopeful it will be shorter than is typical. But it nevertheless hits our financial statements with very high operating leverage. We're also watching cost closely as freight and resin, and certain grades of steel are starting to rise perhaps following the price of oil.","Turning to our Distribution & Transmission segment, first quarter sales were $564 million, up 1% from the fourth quarter of 2011 and up 38% from the first quarter of 2011. Operating profit was $43 million and operating margins were a solid 7.6% of sales. Year-over-year, incremental flow-through or operating leverage was 10%. Mix for the group's first quarter was 72% North America, and 28% international. ","Distribution services is benefiting from the capacity additions in pressure pumping, which appears to be accelerating the completion of wells previously drilled. The hook-up of a liquids well, with its tank batteries and plumbing at $50,000 to $70,000, can easily be 10x out of a dry gas well hook-up for us. As horsepower tightness has eased in oil regions, completions appear to be accelerating, helping the unit achieve high single-digit sequential growth in North America. While top line growth was good, we saw margins drift lower due to reduced supplier discounts and rebates tied to annual purchase volumes in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter, as we restarted our purchase volume meters at the beginning of the year. ","The Distribution Services group rolled out a new consigned inventory business model for land rigs last month, which we are pretty excited about. The first container full of MRO drilling supplies went into service for a major land drilling contractor and, while we are working out the procedures around physical inventory counts and resupply, I'd say so far, so good and IOC has contracted for 5 of these units and we are excited about pioneering a new business model with their support. ","We are opening 6 DSCs in North American through the first half of 2012, shifting our base of support to better conform with the migration of rigs into liquids areas, and we're opening 2 DSCs internationally in Columbia and Sumatra. Industrial demand for Mono pumps was surprisingly strong in the U.S., China and Latin America for the group through the first quarter. We faced some supply chain issues out of Asia and Argentina, and we are beginning to see costs rise for some of the specialty steels we purchased, have taken steps to address these with our supply chain. Rig count-driven demand for power sections for drilling motors and our official lift products is very high, although a couple of large artificial lift products sales were delayed out of the first quarter. ","I mentioned earlier our agreement with Schlumberger to acquire their Wilson Supply business, and we are working to try to close that transaction sometime this summer. Wilson is an outstanding franchise that, like us, dates back to the early days in the oil field. It will bring new channels into new midstream and downstream markets to our considerable portfolio of NOV product and we are excited about the many new opportunities that lay ahead for our combined businesses and eager to welcome Wilson's 2,500 employees to NOV. Looking into the second quarter of 2012, we expect Distribution & Transmission group revenues and margins to decline slightly, primarily due to seasonal declines in Canada due to break up, partly offset by higher sequential sales from transmission and mono group efforts. ","Turning to National Oilwell Varco's consolidated first quarter income statement, SG&A decreased $37 million due to lower incentive compensation accruals and overhead reductions quarter-to-quarter associated with Ameron acquisition last year. SG&A as a percent of sales was 9.1% in the first quarter, down from 10% last quarter and down from 11.6% last year. Equity income at our Voest-Alpine joint venture was $17 million, up $5 million sequentially on much higher casing shipments into North America. We expect equity income to decline in the second quarter. ","Other expense was unchanged from the fourth quarter. The tax rate from the first quarter was lower than expected at 30.8%, which benefited from discrete FX movements in our European operations. We expect next quarter, our tax rate will return to the range of 33%. Unallocated expenses and eliminations on our supplemental segment schedule was $101 million in the first quarter, up $12 million sequentially due to higher intersegment sales eliminations, partly offset by sequentially improved or lower incentive compensation in other items. ","Depreciation and amortization was $148 million, up $6 million from the fourth quarter on acquisitions and high 2011 CapEx. EBITDA, excluding transaction charges, was a record $1,038,000,000, up $31 million sequentially to 24.1% of sales. National Oilwell Varco's March 31, 2012, balance sheet employed working capital excluding cash and debt of $4.4 billion or 25.3% of annualized sales, up $842 million from the fourth quarter due to several factors: Inventory accounted for about 60% of our working capital growth due in part to backlog requirements and Rig Technology that I discussed earlier and in part to new plants that we've been opening and new acquisitions that we've made across our other segments. Additionally, customer financing of our backlog to the net of prepayments and billings in excess of cost, less cost in excess of billings, declined $175 million sequentially and the payout of annual incentive compensation during the first quarter also increased working capital by reducing accrued liabilities. ","Cash flow used by operations was $64 million for the first quarter due primarily to the working capital items I just mentioned. CapEx declined sharply, down $53 million sequentially to $113 million, but we expect CapEx to pick back up in the second quarter and for the full year 2012 to be in the range of $650 million, as we continue to pursue a number of expansion opportunities. NOV's cash balance was $3.4 billion at March 31, 2012, and is presently about $2.7 billion following the NKT acquisition, with about 88% of it located overseas. ","Now I will turn it back to Pete.","Merrill A. Miller","Thanks, Clay. And I just want to make a few brief comments and kind of reiterate some of the things that Clay had talked about. ","We're really -- in the past few years, we've been expanding very rapidly in a lot of the international arenas and we're also doing a lot of capacity expansion and capacity changes here in the United States. We think these things are going to bode very well for the future. We're starting to see that in some of the numbers that we're even talking about today but just this past quarter, we opened up our new facility in Abu Dhabi, in which we have pipe inspection, pipe coating, drill pipe manufacturing and downhole tool manufacturing, and that's really kind of support the entire Middle East. ","But we have things like this going on all over the world. We have expansions going on in Russia right now. We hope to be able to build rigs there very soon, we're doing Downhole Tools, we're doing wire line units, we're doing some of the frac-ing systems. We have a lot of things going on and if you take a look at the shales, which we always mention on these calls in China, Australia, Latin America, we really are positioning ourselves to be able to take advantage of this. We're doing things in the United States at our pressure-controlled facility in West Little York here in Houston; our Hydra Rig facilities up in Fort Worth; our facilities on Orange, California, in which we're expanding our top drive production capabilities. ","And then even though even though we know there's a good chance for softness in the second half of the year in North America especially in natural gas, now is the time to do these things because we're a true believer in long term of what you're seeing here. And as you push out to the long term, shale gas, the things that we can do in the United States with natural gas, whether, let's put it, export it with LNG plays very, very well to what we're doing. So we're excited and now's the time to strike and make sure that we're positioned those things are going to be happening in 2015, '16 and beyond. ","One of the things I'm most excited about is we're building a new test rig facility in Conroe, North of Houston. This is really going to be a state-of-the-art facility. It's really going to allow us to test everything that we do in this company from drill pipe to Downhole Tools, to mud, to all the rig equipment that we have. It will be better than anything the industry has seen and I think it really is going to enhance the new product offerings that we're going to be able to make for this industry. ","We're excited about it and we're actually going to be drilling a well. I'll advise you though that we are not going to become E&P people. We are watching that very closely. If we do discover oil and gas though, I'll be very excited. But it gives us an opportunity to really test things out before they go into the field and to make sure that we're taking care of our customers in a way that they need and we're staying on the edge of making sure that we have the best equipment in the industry. ","Having said that, next week is the offshore technology conference. And you've heard me say before the lifeblood of any company are new products. And we're going to be doing a lot of exciting things and showing exciting things at OTC. In particular, and probably one of things I'm most excited about, and Clay mentioned this in his comments, is our National Oilwell Varco automation suite, or what we call NOVA. This is a unique system in which we have a equipment suite called Novas [ph] that's on the surface, and we have a subsurface suite called Nemesis [ph]. These 2 tie together and allows things that go on downhole to be able to talk to the equipment on the surface and things like mud pumps. If you say, I got to have more volumes; or I've got to pick up the strokes on my mud pump, all these things are going to be happening automatically. The thing that's neat about Nemesis [ph] downhole is it's going to be an open architecture. So you'll be able to put just about anybody's tools on there, but I'd recommend our tools, they're the best ones. ","So the fact of the matter is, I think this has an opportunity to really change the way things are controlled on a drilling rig and we're the natural provider of this. We're the world's largest provider of drilling rigs and equipment and now we want to make this NOVA suite of equipment and put it out there. ","Another thing that we're excited about, you'll be able to see a little bit of here is our BOP monitoring system, and we will actually be able to monitor subsea BOPs from land and be able to see that on a realtime basis. We'll be able to put the things on things like iPads and iPhones and you'll be able to monitor this equipment. And I also say NOVA will actually have some apps that you'll be able to use on iPads and iPhones. So we've got some people working on some cool things. One additional thing is our 30,000-psi BOP that was made by our Texas oil tool folks. This is really a kind of a unique wireline BOP, first one that's 30,000-psi, been used in the field already. I'm very excited and if you're around OTC, I really recommend you to take a look at that. And the other thing that we have there will be a full array of our FPSO offerings and the things that we're providing and what I call now the kind of the post-cycle. So we've got the full cycle of early-, mid- and late-type equipment and now you've got the post-cycle, which is going to be the production equipment, and the FPSOs that we're very excited about. ","And having said that, I'd like to welcome all of our folks from NKT into the company. We closed that this quarter and will now be known as NOV Flexibles. And especially the majority of the employees in Denmark, welcome to the NOV family. ","So at that point on, I'd like to turn it over for any questions that our callers and listeners might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jim Crandell from Dahlman Rose.","James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Pete, in the past few weeks, we've seen some big ultra-deepwater discoveries, higher day rates for ultra-deepwater rigs and Seadrill in particular stepping in and ordering more floaters. How has this, just in the past few weeks, change the psychology toward ordering more ultra-deepwater rigs out there?","Merrill A. Miller","Jim, it's changed the psychology to be very positive. I think you've heard me say before, Seadrill is kind of a harbinger of what's going on in the industry there. They're clearly very progressive. And when you take a look at the economics that are out there today, and some of these day rates of these deepwater rigs are getting, then you tie that back to what the shipyards are charging for these rigs today in conjunction with our DEP or drilling equipment packages, and then I think the other third part of it that's really cool that Clay mentioned is, is cutting almost a year off the delivery time. Those economics, the discoveries that you're talking about, really show that the world needs more of these deepwater rigs. We think it's going to be a very positive ordering environment over the next few quarters, and we're excited about what we're seeing out there in the industry. And again, it's a pretty compelling financial argument when you look at it and you see the payback for these drilling contractors, it's a very good ROI.","James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","The second question I had is, is there any way that you and Clay could try to quantify for me, the ordering of additional BOP stacks by contract drillers for deepwater? To what extent are they ordering additional stacks for their rigs? To what extent are they ordering additional stacks for a number of rigs and I guess what kind of increment should we build on our assumptions for new blowout preventer orders in addition to just the number of rigs being ordered?","Clay C. Williams","Jim, it's been slowly rising. Obviously, interest in BOP equipment has been slowly rising ever since the summer 2010, and this quarter it really showed up in the form of several loose BOPs, as we call them, BOPs that aren't necessarily associated with a newbuild rig, but rather subsea stacks that are either to support a fleet of rigs out there in case a stack were to get dropped or they need a change out of a stack or to support even an individual rig. We hear that the E&P community is more and more expressing an interest in each rig having a second redundant stack to speed operations and be available to be run on riser quickly. And then the kind of the third is the level of maintenance that must go on with offshore equipment. As you know, offshore rigs need to come into the shipyard every 5 years and all of the components go through a major overhaul. And so having spare stacks available to support that effort just speeds that up and ultimately makes the fleet more efficient. So we're seeing this quarter solid demand from a couple of drilling contractors going into their fleets and then also we see that to recur in Q2 as well with good orders.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robin Shoemaker from Citi.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, so wanted to ask about rig tech margin in the quarter. You mentioned there was an impact from the addition of NKT on the rig tech margin. But I'm also thinking that first quarter of '12 kind of roughly corresponds to the low point in the rig ordering cycle and probably pricing cycle in the first half of '10. So what -- now you mentioned that second quarter rig tech margin I think would be slightly lower. So apart from NKT, would the first quarter of '12 be the low point reflecting the first half of '10 pricing dynamics?","Clay C. Williams","That's -- I think the first half of '10 pricing dynamics contributed to the margin this quarter, Robin, but it's not that -- it's not as one-for-one as you might otherwise think, because we sell lots of different pieces of equipment and kit that flow out at different times. So it's really a compilation of pricing probably dating back to even 2009 all the way up through, items that were sold in late 2011. So it's more of an aggregation of all the pricing through that period that came out during the first quarter. I do want to correct one thing. We did not close NKT until the first week of April. And so there is no NKT flexibles contribution to the P&L results that you're seeing here for the first quarter. That's something though that we do expect to start contributing nearly a full quarter's performance in the second quarter of 2012. So we'll get not quite 90 days, but pretty close to 90 days from NKT, and that'll bring the margins down again. Just right now, our forecast calls margin to move down just a little bit more in Q2, so we're 24.4% operating margins for this quarter and down in probably the 24% range in Q2. And although I didn't explore it in much detail in my earlier comments, it's probably worth reiterating the basis for that margin decline, which has been pretty steady over the past 2 years, really comes out of the orders that were won by NOV in 2007, 2008, that were delivered 2 years later, early 2010 in a more deflationary environment. So we benefited from really a lot less inflation than we had forecast. Actually lower cost, we were executing rigs in early 2010, less overtime and probably most important was the fact that we had, by that time, delivered a lot of offshore rigs and skill learning curve and we're seeing the learning curve effects in our operations in early 2010. So that led to much higher margins than we had expected. And so the first half of 2010, we're a little bit over 30%, and since then, we've been guiding folks towards margin declines. So this quarter, the downturn in margins, 160 basis points, really reflects the continuation of that trend and although we may not be quite at bottom yet, we're pretty close.","Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And 26% I think you said in the past is kind of like a normalized margin for rig tech?","Clay C. Williams","Yes. I think so. I think we can work our way back up. We did get improving pricing in Rig Technology through 2011. And in fact, here in the last quarter or two, I think we probably picked up another 1% or 2% on -- in pricing for DEPs that we're selling. And so we think there's a little bit of expansion ahead. But also, too, I'll caution you, we've added NKT to the mix, which is going to be dilutive. APL as well our turret mooring systems are going to be a little bit dilutive. And so -- but I would characterize it as something in the mid-20s is probably what's more normal for this group. And also point out as well that manufacturing business producing 24%, 25%, 26% operating margins makes an extraordinarily high return on capital. In fact, last quarter, the quarter that you're looking at here, first quarter 2012, if you annualize the results from Rig Technology on a notepad basis, tax effect to operating profit divided by the capital employed in that business, we did about 31% return on booked capital and I think 64%, 65% return on tangible book capital. So very, very strong returns that go along with the 20% margins.","Operator","Our next call comes from Scott Gruber from Bernstein.","Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Clay, you mentioned your hope for a few FPSO orders before year end. I may be reading too much into several comments you've made in the past. But is that an increase from previous expectations?","Clay C. Williams","Yes, we -- what I was referring to there is our turret mooring business we acquired late 2010, a business called APL. And 2011, like a lot of the providers of surf equipment and subsea equipment, orders were pretty slow. And I think we agree with the prevailing view out there, that 2012 should be stronger. We have said over the past couple of quarters that we've seen rising levels of inquiries, quotations have been very, very busy and a lot of people are interested in subsea developments. And so we're quoting equipment into that. In fact, the management of APL tells us that the level of quotations is at record levels. We're learning along the way though that these projects have a tendency to push out to the right a little bit, and they're tough to bring to fruition. So we still feel pretty good about orders for the year. We just hadn't seen a lot through the first quarter within APL.","Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Correct me if I'm wrong. Previously, I think the hope was for at least one, but now you're suggesting it could be more before year-end?","Clay C. Williams","Oh, yes. We've got a number, lots of projects we're quoting equipment into. And specifically, what I'm referring to here are the turret mooring systems or FPSOs that we provide through our APL unit. That's in addition to cranes mooring systems, hose reel systems, riser pull systems, fiberglass piping systems and also I referenced some flow fluid processing equipment as well. So we can sell a lot more than those into FPSOs and I'll add that we have sold a lot of that more ancillary equipment along the way, as well as some, turret-related equipment in 2011. But in terms of big high-dollar, needle-moving type orders, those have been a little slow in coming through 2011. 2012 though, our outlook is a lot brighter.","Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then just turning to Brazil, there's significant movement between Sete and the yards with placing additional orders recently. How are you thinking about how the equipment orders flow from here? Are those going to be primarily driven by the yards such that we'll see several tranches of orders, equipment orders placed over the next 12 months or so?","Merrill A. Miller","Yes, that's -- essentially, it is driven by the yards. What happens is Sete picks the yard and then we sell the DEP or the drilling equipment package to the yard and then they pretty well drive the timing of that. But also, remember, it's -- it is Brazil and things kind of move in a different timeframe. But it's really no different than a lot of the things that we do in Korea. For instance, when we're selling DEP's, we sell them to the -- to Samsung, Hyundai, Daewoo, folks like that. The operator or the contractor who is going to own the rig, pretty well identifies what they want. And here, obviously Petrobras knows who we are, knows what our equipment is, we're technically qualified and in the shipyards pick it up from there. But I think you'll see movement on that through the remainder of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Uhlmer from Global Hunter.","Brian Uhlmer - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes, I wanted to talk about interflow a little bit here and the rationale for that acquisition, whether it's a consolidating move or whether it's to gain new customer base up in Canada. And kind of along those lines, also following up on the cash component of your cash that's based in the U.S. if that number is going to be adjusted after you make this interflow and how should we look at cash component and further acquisitions in the United States?","Clay C. Williams","What we think about the interflow acquisition being in Canada is that we get to use our international cash. And so it certainly makes it a lot easier to do that transaction. Brian, as you're aware, most of our cash is overseas. Currently, about 88% of our cash balance is located overseas. To bring that back to the U.S. we would incur a tax haircut. And so it just to make it easier for us to do acquisitions internationally, plus our outlook for international markets is very, very bright. And so for lots of reasons that made our NKT acquisition and the interflow acquisition very attractive. But all that notwithstanding, financing notwithstanding, Wilson, which is U.S.-based, will be a U.S. use of cash, is a business that we think is terrific. It's going to be a great fit with our distribution services operation. And so we will use our revolver partially to -- to fund that acquisition but are confident that with our strong cash flow in the U.S., we're going to be able to pay that down quickly. On the interflow acquisition, that's a great business, a great franchise, locations both in the U.S. and Canada. And they've got excellent technology and it's very complementary, I think, to what we are already sell to pressure pumpers and well stimulation operations. And like us, they're seeing rising demand from international markets. And we think that's going to continue well into the future as shale plays take hold on other continents and international markets. And so this is just another way to sort of strengthen what we do and make our combined operation more efficient and open up opportunities for us. So very excited about it, and hopefully, we'll have it closed here in a few days.","Brian Uhlmer - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","So you view it more as an expansionary versus consolidation move?","Clay C. Williams","Yes, I think it's going to create a lot of opportunities. As always is the case, there'll be some efficiencies to come out of this. We'll be able to -- we'll have a little more purchasing leverage, for instance, and economies of scale. So but we're very, very pleased to -- anxious to get this done.","Merrill A. Miller","And Brian, we always are looking for opportunities to add more arrows to our quiver and I think this is a good example of that. While there are some duplicated products, it really is additive to what we can put into the marketplace. And we're excited about the worldwide shales, and we think this plays very, very well to be able to support that.","Brian Uhlmer - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Outstanding, and following up on that, on the coil tubing, since we're in the Well Servicing segment, on the coil tubing units, the new mill is strictly tubing. How is the demand for tubing units itself? And is that -- are we targeting more international markets with that as well aside from the massive growth that we're seeing in North America in '12?","Clay C. Williams","Yes, yes, we've seen strong demand in both. Actually North America demand for coil tubing has been very high but a lot of other countries, in particular China, in particular the Middle East, have seen strong demand for coil tubing as well. So those 2 go together, they're complementary products and, as you know, we make both the units as well as the coil tubing itself and we've been expanding our capacity in both. So this is -- it's terrific. Technology is kind of the arthroscopic surgery of the oilfield and lets you go in and do some things you can't otherwise do in a well. And so year-by-year, just we seem to tap into more and more demand.","Merrill A. Miller","And I'll say on a macro basis, Brian, really, shales have brought the maturation of coil tubing and coil tubing units to the fore. I mean, the shales were really made for the coil tubing concept. I mean, you talk about coil tubing for many years and we have, and it's always had good opportunities. But the shales give it a whole another level of opportunity. And I think we're excited about our expansion opportunities. Our coil tubing facility that makes coil tubing here in Houston, as Clay mentioned earlier, we're up to 4, 5 lines out there. We're expanding up in Fort Worth with our Hydra Rig outfit. So we think this is really going to be a great business over the next 4, 5 years.","Brian Uhlmer - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","In the international side, are still going to be I guess what we term the Bocus [ph] and where you're more differentiated with the bigger units that are a little bit less competitive marketplace in terms of the new equipment, is that correct?","Merrill A. Miller","Yes, actually, it is. I mean I think you'll see a lot of international opportunity. I mean, we're actually selling some of this equipment into China today and because the Chinese need the best equipment possible and China is a wonderful shale play today.","Clay C. Williams","Yes, Russia is another good market. We make equipment in Belarus to support that market or expanding into to Russia. So a lot of interests overseas.","Operator","Our next question comes from Marshall Adkins from Raymond James.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","You gave us some pretty good detail, Clay, on the PSS division, why it was so strong, downhole tools, drill pipe, and other pipe-related stuff. Notwithstanding the seasonal downturn coming up next quarter, can we get back to the robust margins we have right now in Q3 and 4, and help us understand kind of product lines we need to watch there going forward, either on the positive or negative side?","Clay C. Williams","Yes, the short answer is yes, Q2 will have a seasonal impact from Canada but Q3, barring a rig count meltdown in North America, like everybody on the call, we're anxiously watching the gas rig count in the U.S. We know that's going to come under pressure. The real question is how much the oil rigs replace that. Barring a meltdown across that scenario, yes, I think, 22% margins are repeatable. The sector has done north of 23% and north of 24%. You go back to 2006, I think is when we first got up in the 23% range. And in 2007 and 2008, on a pro forma basis, pushed up into the mid-24% margins range. So we expected this segment to gradually move up into that range given sustained high levels of activity and sustained pricing leverage and it's outperformed in terms of getting there faster than we thought that it would. So 22%, nearly 23% operating margin this quarter beat our time, expected timeframe probably a year or so. And just speaks to the good execution that we have out there. We've done great acquisitions and we had good execution of integration of those acquisitions within the segment. We've got good pricing leverage. I would say that, Marshall, pricing leverage within Petroleum Services & Supplies appears to be flattening out. The rig counts kind of flattening out here as you go through this big migration in North America. And although we're getting a few price increases here and there, I would say by and large, it feels like it's a lot going across a lot of groups. So we're going to watch that closely. We probably need another uptick on rigs working to get back to a little more pricing leverage. We feel pretty good the back half of the year on had pretty stout margins of PS&S.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Any product lines we should watch over the next year, positive or negative?","Clay C. Williams","Yes, the largest single piece of Petroleum Services & Supplies is our Downhole Tools business, which provides ReedHycalog Bits, downhole drilling motors and a variety of other equipment; jars and shock tools and other things. And so that moves the needle more than most, and the sequential improvement that you saw from Q4 to Q1 was mostly driven by Downhole Tools. But as you know, there's a bunch of different products and services in there. The second largest is our Well Site Services Group which were in solid control equipment, and in drill pipe products and Tuboscope are roughly tied for third. And so I would characterize all those businesses as, the common thread is they're all driven by rig count. So as rig count rises and falls, that's going to ultimately dictate the fortunes of those businesses which will be allowed to drive the fortunes of the segment. And so that's probably what we're going to watch most closely and then I'll also finish up by saying that it's mostly North American rig count where we get pricing leverage and we get good operating flow-throughs from those businesses. So that's kind of what drives those things.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Right. One last quick one for Pete, what oil -- what Brandt price should we get worried about on offshore newbuilds? I mean, how well would Brandt have to fall before we start to get worried about newbuild orders?","Merrill A. Miller","Marshall, that's a great question. All I know is the answer I'll give you will be wrong. But let me work on it anyway. I think as you kind of take a look at -- everybody is looking out. When you're building these newbuild rigs, you're making an assumption about something 2.5, 3 years down the pipe. And I mean, we were delivering those things, you start ordering it, it takes about 6 months to get your engineering done and you order it, we're delivering it in 2 years. You do see Charles [ph] ready to rip. So the fact of the matter is it really is the assumption on what the world economy is going to do, what the tightness is on oil. I think if you started going much below $75, you would probably have people say, \"Hey, this is -- what's -- how long are we going to keep in the $75 range?\", and \"Is this really something we want to be investing for in the long term?\" I think anything north of that makes all the sense in the world. South of that, you start getting into a more problematical area. And now having said that, then it also means that if it goes down below that, then you have to make the assumption how long is that going to last? Because traditionally, in this industry, just like with natural gas, we're rapidly self-correcting. And so if you stop drilling and people don't like the $75, it moves up. But really, the worldwide economy and the demand for that oil is really going to be the kicker on it. So we think it's probably in good shape right now, but if it went below that, you'd have to ask some questions.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A lot of margin fare between here and $75.","Merrill A. Miller","Absolutely, absolutely.","Operator","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Pete Miller for closing remarks.","Merrill A. Miller","Thank you, all.

With me today is Clay Williams, President and Chief Executive Officer of National Oilwell Varco; and Jeremy Thigpen, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin this discussion of National Oilwell Varco\u2019s financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2014, please note that some of the statements we make during this call may contain forecasts, projections, estimates, including, but not limited to, comments about our outlook for the Company\u2019s business","These are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws based on limited information as of today, which is subject to change.

No one should assume that these forward-looking statements remain valid later in the quarter or later in the year.

Later on this call, we will answer your questions, which we ask you to limit to two in order to permit more participation.","Now, let me turn the call over to Clay.","Clay C. Williams","Thank you, Loren, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, National Oilwell Varco announced that it earned $1.37 for fully diluted share and excluding transaction related charges, $1.40 for fully diluted share for its first quarter of 2014. Earnings improved 9% from the first quarter of 2013, but declined 10% sequentially from our strong fourth quarter results in 2013, excluding charges from all quarters.","Revenues were $5.8 billion in the quarter, but 9% from the prior year, and down 6% sequentially. Generally, our largest two segments saw a surge in product shipments late last year which did not repeat in the first quarter leading to slightly lower sequential results as we expected.","Overall, the company made steady progress on several fronts through the first quarter, including moving closer to the spin out of our distribution services group, which we will speak to more in a moment.","We are very pleased with another strong quarter for orders for drilling capital equipment. Rig Technology posted over $2.3 billion in orders, which exceeded our revenue out of backlog by about 5%. This led to a record $16.3 billion backlog for Rig technology. Offshore demand remained very strong. We won drilling equipment packages for three floaters and 17 jackup newbuilds during the first quarter.","Land demand also increased materially, mostly internationally, and we are encouraged by rising demand for drilling, workover, and well stimulation equipment for the resurgence U.S. land market. Our $2.3 billion of first quarter orders for Rig Technology were comprised of $1.2 billion, or 52% for packages for newbuild offshore rigs. We expect the second quarter to continue to be strong for offshore newbuild demand as well. But we expect demand for new offshore rigs to slow during the second half of the year as offshore day rates have come under pressure.","We do expect to win some offshore newbuilds orders in the second half, as our shipyard partners are continuing to quote to entrepreneurs targeting specific markets in Latin America and the North Sea, along with a few established drillers considering rigs for specific purposes like 20K. The 48% balance of first quarter orders, included land rigs, workover rigs, pressure pumping equipment, FPSO equipment, and assorted individual components for various rigs and vessels.","This other half of our order stream is carrying good momentum into 2014, and we expect it to partly offset offshore newbuild declines later in the year. Specifically, we are now seeing North American drillers resume buying equipment, while we continue to sell land rigs into the Middle East, Russia, and Latin America. Drillers the world over continue to retool the land rig fleet to newer, more modern levels of capability. While orders for AC power, quick move electronic control land rigs ebb and flow a bit, the direction is clear. These are the workhorses that make our industry steadily safer and more efficient and enable profitable unconventional resource production, and land drilling contractors appear to be increasingly convinced of their superior economic returns.","We\u2019re also encouraged by recent orders for stimulation and pressure pumping equipment in North America. Frac spreads continue to be pushed order, pumping larger fracs into more stages at higher pressures, and many are now being run at 24-hours a day, consuming these fleets at a faster pace.","Our book-to-bill for pressure pumping, coiled tubing, and wireline products all handily exceeded one in the first quarter. Demand for floating production products, kit for FPSOs and flexible pipe mainly dipped this quarter, but we believe this is simply a function of timing and that FPSO demand will increase as we move through the year given our strong bidding activity.","So to summarize our order outlook for the remainder of 2014, we believe the second quarter will be in a range of one to one book-to-bill. And at the third and fourth quarters, we will gradually drift down leaving us with an ending backlog probably in the low teens, but probably our second highest year-ending backlog ever.","Backlogs at or near record levels throughout most of the year should continue to drive strong financial performance for the next several quarters. Our long-term outlook continues to be very robust. We have previously cited four major trends driving our prospects. One, the buildout of a fleet of deepwater rigs, two, the buildout of floating production systems to produce deepwater discoveries, three, the retooling and replacement of the jackup fleet, and four, the continued proliferation of unconventional shale technologies driving demand for a wide variety of NOV equipment products and services.","In our view, the energy needs of the 21st century will be satisfied by a combination of growing production from; one, deepwater frontiers, which had gone from effectively zero to about 9% of worldwide oil production in 20 years, and two, unconventional shale technologies, which have gone from effectively 0% to about 3% of worldwide liquids productions in six years. Although these two incremental sources of oil to-date comprise only one in eight barrels of supply, most of the other seven barrels are from conventional fields found in prior areas, which will decline.","And with most of the easy oil already discovered, future conventional sources will continue to become increasingly challenging to find. As economic growth steadily drives oil demand, we believe that growing production from; one, deepwater technology, which opened up vast horizontal expanses of the planet to production, and two, shale technology, which opened up vast vertical sections of the stratigraphic column to production will supply this demand, both oil and NGLs in greater and greater proportion through the 21st century.","Since the earliest days of the oil industry, companies have battled ferociously to emerge as the lowest marginal cost source, or at least not be the highest marginal cost source of the last incremental barrel. The high-cost barrel is the most disadvantage position on this battlefield. When economic cycles diminish demand, as they do from time to time, oil prices drop and the highest marginal cost position suffers the most.","Our winning and market forces continually test to resolve high marginal cost producers. The battle lines constantly ebb and flow as various combinations of innovation and geology lead winners to relative advantage and sometimes brief periods of respite from harsh market forces, at least until their fields decline or some other competitor finds better rocks and technology.","NOV is a unique supplier of critical components to the combatants on this battlefield. We understand that our success rests on the success of our customers, meaning lowering their marginal cost per barrel, either capital or capital or lifting cost or both. Both major new sources of incremental oil supply, deepwater and unconventionals require new toolkits, specialized deepwater rigs, floating production systems, subsea production systems, Tier 1 AC land rigs, drilling motors, premium drill pipe bits and hydrologic stimulation tools. Our products win demand in the marketplace by conferring lower cost and higher value to their users. That\u2019s why we must continue to invest in promising technologies and ideas.","Unconventionals in particular are unique in a rate in which they consume iron. Long horizontal laterals were out fixed cutter bit, downhole motors and premium drill pipe far faster than vertical drilling, and they require specialty tools NOV provides, such as fluid hammers and agitators. Similarly, high-pressure massive 24 hour frac jobs were out frac leads and associated consumables like fluid ends, liners and pistons far faster than stimulation jobs like yesterday.","NOV is unique in our leading supply position into both of these major trends, and the trends themselves are unique in that they are more consumptive of specialized equipment as compared to sources of supply of yesterday. And we saw good evidence in the first quarter that the industry has largely burned through a success inventory or pressure pumping consumables, and we believe new capital orders are not far behind. History features as the new innovation cost and we changed this battle field sometimes in surprising ways.","History teaches us that new innovations constantly change battlefield sometimes in surprising ways. Who among us would\u2019ve predicted that the U.S. would enjoy such a revival, becoming, once again, the fastest growing producer of oil for marginally productive shales, no less. Pad drilling, downspacing, new rig technologies and bigger frac jobs have an enabled shale producers to steadily improve their marginal cost positions and further improvements are to be expected. Likewise, while deepwater producers have struggled lately with project execution challenges and rising costs, these are certain to be remedied by time and innovation.","The deepwater drilling space faces startup challenges, which we believe are transient. A lot of new deepwater rigs have been launched recently with new crews, and these are operating under tighter operational requirements post Macondo. Crews will certainly give more experience and more efficient overtime. At NOV, we are helping by opening new technical training colleges to train both our own, as well as our customers\u2019, personnel. We supply simulators to let drillers practice safe, efficient operations off-line.","We are investing heavily to ramp aftermarket spares and service capacity in proportion to our growing installed base to improve uptime, and we are preparing for further challenges the industry will face as the new rig fleet undergoes five-year SPS surveys.","A couple of years ago, NOV deployed capital in the floating production technologies used to produce deepwater fields, recognizing that FPSO construction projects are notoriously problematic to deliver on-time on budget. A recent industry study cited a sampling of nine FPSOs with cost on average 38% more than budget and were delivered an average of 14 months late.","We believe our success in transforming the deepwater rig fabrication supply chain and our experience working with shipyards uniquely positioned NOV to undertake the challenges of driving cost and risk down to these complex projects. We further believe the recent introspection of deepwater producers signals their explicit recognition of the structural shortcomings of the status quo.","NOV aspires to be an advocate of change, because we think we can pioneer a better way. Participants in both camps, shales and deepwater, are smart and adaptive, and the world needs oil supply from both camps to offset the relentless drum beat of production declines. Within this battle, NOV\u2019s mission is to offer new and better ways of doing things to lower the marginal cost of barrels, to improve economic returns of our customers\u2019 projects, reduce environmental impact and to improve the safety and efficiency of operations.","To this end, we announced our plans to reorganize our business along with customer-centric taxis, concurrent with the spin out of our new DistributionNow Company. Our new organization will enable us to focus more tightly on specific customer initiatives.","Beginning in the second quarter, we will begin reporting our result in four new segments. First our new rig system segment, which will primarily support offshore and land drillers, with consistent of land and offshore rig equipment, offshore packages, complete land rigs, replacement and upgrade rig capital components. We believe that the industry\u2019s need to build out a new deepwater infrastructure, replacing an aging jackup fleet and upgrade a global land rig fleet will create tremendous growth opportunity for this segment.","Second, our new rig aftermarket segment, which will be closely tied to our rig system segment, will separately report sales of spare parts, repair services, training and other sales opportunities, focused on the maintenance of our substantial install base of drilling rigs worldwide. These two segments were jointly supply and maintain sophisticated modern drilling tools.","Third, our new wellbore technology segment will report products and services NOV provides which enhance drilling performance and reduce the environmental impact of drilling operations. This group will include bits, reamers, downhole drilling motors, premium drill pipe, solids control and waste management technologies, drilling fluids, tubular inspection and tubular coating services, drilling instrumentation and dynamic drilling systems.","Fourth and finally, our new completions and production solutions segment will report sales of well stimulation equipment and consumables, as well as composite flow-line products, flexible subsea pipe, conductor pipe, pumps and artificial lift products and floating production solutions. We will also include certain non-oilfield industrial products within this segment.","Within the next few weeks, we plan to publicly announce our historical financial results for the preceding five years within this new segment framework on a pro forma basis. This is designed to lend our investors long-term perspectives into NOV post the spin out of our distribution services group. We will also change how we report backlog including recasting our historical backlog through this historical period to conform to our new segments. I believe the new segment structural will lend greater transparency to the trends affecting our business and enable the investing public the better see our execution of our strategic plans.","We also believe this new structure will highlight the diverse portfolio of products, equipment and services NOV delivers. Finally, with regards to the spinout of DistributionNow, or NOW Inc., we filed our Form 10 last week and believe we are nearing the completion of the spinout, which we hope to affect in late May.","The new company, which will initially be debt free, has security commitment for $750 million revolving line of credit. We would encourage our investors to review our filings for this exciting new company including its risk factors, which are available on our website at www.nov.com. As a standalone company, DistributionNow will be uniquely positioned to prosecute supply chain services initiatives and selective acquisitions from a focused public company platform to better serve its global upstream and midstream customer base.","I am excited about the opportunities for this organization under the able leadership of CEO Robert Workman, CFO Dan Molinero, Chief Accounting Officer Dave Cherechinsky, and General Counsel Raymond Chang. It will also have an outstanding executive chairman, a guy named Pete Miller, who has a pretty good track record of building successful companies. Pete will step down as executive chairman of NOV at the time of the spin, so I want to take this opportunity to say thank you to an extraordinary business leader, mentor and friend. Very, very few CEOs have achieved Pete\u2019s remarkable track record of success and Pete, we are grateful to you for your vision for this organization and for the industry reserve. So, on behalf of our 65,000 employees, congratulations and thank you, and very best wishes to you and all of our friends within Distribution now.","At this point, let me turn it Jeremy to provide more color on our first quarter results.","Jeremy Thigpen","Thanks, Clay. As Clay already mentioned, National Oilwell Varco generated earnings $1.37 for fully diluted share in its first quarter of 2014, on $5.8 billion in revenues. Excluding $19 million in pretax transaction charges, first quarter 2014 earnings were $1.40 per fully diluted share, down $0.16 per share, or 10% from the fourth quarter of 2013, but up $0.11 per share, or 9% from the first quarter of 2013.","Sales of $5.8 billion declined 6% sequentially, but on a year-over-year basis, revenues were up 9% despite the fact that the worldwide rig count only increased 2% over the same time period. Excluding transaction charges from all periods, operating profit for the quarter was $880 million, down 10% sequentially, but up 8% from the first quarter of last year.","Operating margins on this basis were 15.2% for the first quarter of 2014 compared to 15.8% for the fourth quarter of 2013 and 15.4% for the first quarter of last year. Sequentially, decremental leverage on the 6% decline in revenues was 24%. On a year-over-year basis, operating profit flowed through our leverage was 14% on the 9% increase in revenue.","Now, let\u2019s turn to our segment operating results. The Rig Technology segment generated revenues of $3 billion in the first quarter, down 9% sequentially with as expected, almost the entire shortfall being driven by reductions in revenues from our land rig and well stimulation equipment businesses, which both benefited from large project shipments in the fourth quarter that did not recur in the first quarter.","Compared to the first quarter of 2013, rig tech revenues were up almost 15%, as capacity additions enabled us to convert 12% more revenue out of backlog as our ever growing installed based coupled with our recent investments in our aftermarket infrastructure enabled us to generate 25% more in aftermarket sales and as our floating production and subsea flexible strategies have produced strong year-over-year gains.","Operating profit for the segment was $635 million and operating margins were 21.1%, which were flat with the prior quarter despite the 9% decline in revenue. While pleased with this result, we continue to face the same margin challenges that we\u2019ve discussed in the past, which include working through lower price backlog, more aggressive delivery schedules from our shipyard customers, new drill floor layouts coupled with new installation and commissioning personnel, unfavorable product mix and continued investments in long terms strategic growth initiatives and capacity expansions that are not yet fully operational, such as the flexibles plant in Brazil. Still we are confident that we are moving in a right direction on all front, and I would just like to take a moment to address each.","Regarding lower price backlog, beginning in the second quarter of last year, we assumed a more assertive position of orders for offshore equipment components and complete packages. And while I would describe the improvement as modest, we are already seeing the impact of this change manifest itself in higher-margin backlog and a favorable shift in customer financing. On the aggressive delivery schedules, over the past couple of years we\u2019ve added manufacturing capacity to release some of the stress on our supply chain and over the same time frame we\u2019ve significantly increased our installation and commissioning workforce.","As we become more comfortable and efficient with this new capacity as our new I&C teams come up the learning curve on these new drill floor layouts, we will realize efficiency gains. With respect to product mix, as we move through 2014 and into 2015, we should begin to see a more favorable product mix as demand returns for pressure pumping equipment and coiled tubing units, even more importantly, we continue to see mid teens percentage growth in our aftermarket revenues. While these gains will partially be offset by continued growth in our floating production business, as well as the conversion of Brazilian backlog, we\u2019re still confident that the net result will be positive.","And finally, when talking about long-term strategic growth initiatives, the flexibles plant in Brazil, which is the single largest CapEx project in the history of NOV, has finally started commercial production, and we will begin generating revenues sometime in the second quarter.","So as stated on the fourth quarter conference call, we believe that we are taking the actions required to expand margins in the old Rig Tech segment as we move through 2014 and 2015, but again it will be a slow process.","Now, let\u2019s transition the capital equipment orders for the first quarter of 2014 and our resulting backlog. As Clay already stated, for the quarter, we booked two semis and one drill ship, as well as 17 jackup packages. And we are pleased to once again win a majority of BOP work within these packages.","In addition to the strong orders offshore, we were specially pleased and encouraged to see continuing demand for new land rigs in Latin America and Middle East market and particularly pleased to see strengthening demand for new land rigs in the U.S.","In the quarter, we booked several complete land rigs for each of those three markets, as well as multiple equipment packages for other newbuilds. We also secured orders for new coiled tubing units destined for international markets and we\u2019re starting to see some demand for new pressure pumping equipment in the U.S. again there, which is obviously very welcomed.","All of these new orders, which totaled $2.3 billion in the quarter, were mostly offset by revenues out of backlog of $2.2 billion resulting in a book-to-bill of just over one-times, and another record quarter ending backlog of $16.3 billion. Of the total backlog, approximately 92% is offshore and 94% is destined for international markets.","So overall, the quarter for Rig Technology turned out almost exactly as expected with revenue declining in a high single-digit percentage range, margins flat, and a book-to-bill slightly above one-times.","Looking into the second quarter of 2014, we expect orders for new offshore drilling equipment packages and land rig equipment packages to remain fairly steady. And while it might not happen in the second quarter, we believe that we could soon benefit from a resurgence in orders for well stimulation equipment in the U.S. We also believe that we could see a higher volume of orders for our floating and subsea related production equipment.","Overall, we think that the total order intake in the second quarter is going to once again approach one-to-one book-to-bill. And while this will certainly be an odd quarter as we transition to our new organizational structure and reporting segments, I can tell you that I think the revenues for the old Rig Tech segment on an apples-to-apples basis could improve in the mid single-digit percentage range sequentially, and that margins would likely continue to be challenged to expand, but might see a slight uptick on the incremental revenue.","The Petroleum Services & Supplies segment posted revenue of $1.8 billion, down 7% sequentially, but up 5% from the previous year. Sequentially, the decline in segment revenues was driven exclusively by the non-recurrence of some large year-end projects that were shipped in the fourth quarter of 2013.","On a year-over-year basis, we benefited from both a full quarter of Robbins & Myers and the fact that our customers had finally worked through the excess inventory that they carried into 2013. Operating profit for the quarter was $326 million, or 18.2% of sales, down 80 basis points sequentially and essentially flat down 10 basis points year-over-year.","On a sequential basis, the decremental flow-through was just under 30%, which is fairly consistent with the historical performance of this segment. As with Rig Technology, the quarter for the PS&S segment turned out almost exactly as expected, with revenue declining in the mid single-digit percentage range and margins contracting on the volume.","As we enter the second quarter of 2014, we believe that revenues for most of the products and services in our old Petroleum Services & Supplies segment could improve in the mid single-digit percentage range as seasonal declines in Canadian drilling activity should be more than offset by strength in the U.S. market and continued growth in our international businesses.","In the U.S. demand for our downhole technologies, including bps, downhole motors, and agitators is clearly on the rise, as this demand for fluid and expendables for both drilling and well service applications. We\u2019re also starting to see incremental demand for coiled tubing, composite pipe, and even four-inch and five-inch drill pipe into the U.S. land market, which is very encouraging.","And while we expect margins to expand with the incremental volume, we believe that our flow-through on the incremental revenue could be somewhat challenged as we battle a few different issues, including ERP implementations in multiple businesses, underabsorbed facilities and underutilized assets in Canada due to breakup, slightly unfavorable product mix, and some continued pricing pressures in certain products.","The Distribution & Transmission segment posted revenues of $1.3 billion, up 2% sequentially and up 4% compared to the first quarter of 2013. The majority of the sequential growth for this segment was driven by a strengthening U.S. market, but the segment also enjoyed strong project sales in the Middle East. On the $1.3 billion in revenue, D&T generated $68 million in operating profit, or 5.3% in operating margin, which represented a 50 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter 2013, or 29% flow-through leverage on the 2% increase in revenue. On a year-over-year basis, operating margins were flat.","For Distribution & Transmission the quarter actually turned out a little better than expected. While we expected the low single-digit percentage growth, we are pleasantly surprised by the expansion in margin. With the implementation of SAP across the enterprise and a work associated with the spin, w thought that margins would be challenged. But as a direct result of the focus, hard work, and dedication of the entire D&T team, they have once again managed to overcome distractions and challenges to produce a solid result.","Looking into the second quarter of 2014, under our old segment reporting, we would expect Distribution & Transmission group revenues to remain relatively flat as the seasonal reduction in Canadian drilling activity as well as the absence of the large Middle East projects should be offset by strengthening U.S. market, and we think that margins could contract slightly sequentially, as we fully expect to both complete the rollout of SAP and finalize the spin both of which have the potential to be somewhat distracting and disruptive.","While on the topic of the spin, I would like to provide a brief update on some of the organizational changes that are currently underway with the National Oilwell Varco, before moving on to discuss some of the remaining income statement and balance sheet items. As previously mentioned, we hope to consummate the spinoff of our distribution business in late May.","Shortly following the spin, we will be filing two separate 8-Ks. The first 8-K will be related to the discontinued operations of the distribution business. The second will include five years of historical financial statements for the new reporting segment and will include the first quarter of 2014 financial statements.","A few weeks following the second 8-K, we will plan to file a revised 10-K for NOV remain Co\u2019s 2013 and a revised 10-Q for NOV remain Co for the first quarter of 2014. While the spinoff of our distribution business and the subsequent restructuring have required a great deal of work. The entire organization is excited about the realignment of our businesses into Rig Systems, Rig aftermarket, Wellbore Technologies, and Completion & Production Solutions.","With these new segments, we believe that we will be much easier to understand and access, which should benefit all of National Oilwell Varco stakeholders. For suppliers and customers, the new segments will make it easier to navigate our organization to find the people, products, services and support that they require.","For employees, the new segment should help each employee to more eagerly and obviously connect his or her specific job to be overwriting objectives of NOV, which we expect to lead to improve the awareness and engagement. For investors, the new segment should provide more visibility to more of the market leading products and services that we provide, while also giving more clarity to the way in which we participate in each of the markets that we support.","It should also help investors to better understand the interrelatedness of our various businesses and the value that this brings to our customers and to National Oilwell Varco. In addition to being much easier to understand and access, we also believe that the reorganization will ultimately help drive improved operational and financial performance.","While we\u2019ve always done a good job of working across businesses and segments to both recognize efficiencies where possible and to offer complete and integrated solutions to our customers, we believe that the realignment of our businesses will, in time better enable us to drive incremental improvements in both areas.","Now, let\u2019s turn to National Oilwell Varco\u2019s consolidated first quarter 2014 income statement. Gross margins only declined 10 basis points sequentially to 24.2% despite a 6% reduction in revenues. SG&A declined $7 million sequentially and represented 9% of Q1 revenues.","Transaction costs, primarily related to the Robbins & Myers acquisition and a distribution spinoff totaled $19 million in the quarter. Interest expense declined $1 million sequentially to $26 million and interest income was flat at $4 million.","Equity income in our Voest-Alpine JV was $14.5 million, which was consistent with the previous quarter. However, in the quarter, we booked $4 million loss attributable to a pair of joint ventures that we acquired with Ameron transaction. For the second quarter, we do not expect to incur such losses from the Ameron JVs, but we do expect for equity income from Voest-Alpine JV to decline slightly.","Other expense for the quarter was zero, which represented a $17 million delta sequentially as we benefited from favorable movements in currencies and we also recognized a gain on the sale of assets.","The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 30.6%, which was higher than the 29.2% rate that we posted in the fourth of 2013, but it is more consistent with the historical trends. Unallocated expenses and eliminations on our supplemental segment schedule was $149 million in the first quarter down $1 million sequentially. Depreciation and amortization was $195 million down $5 million from the fourth quarter. And EBITDA, excluding transaction charges was $1.1 billion or 18.9% of sales.","Turing to the balance sheet, National Oilwell Varco\u2019s March 31, 2014 balance sheet employed working capital excluding cash and debt of $6.4 billion up $115 million from the previous quarter, but down $582 million from the previous year. In the quarter, inventory increased $56 million or 1% as all our PS&S businesses modestly added to their inventories to support heightening demand in the U.S. market.","Accounts receivable increased $414 million, or 8% sequentially despite the sequential decline in revenue. This build can be directly tied to our distribution business where the implementation of SAP has led to some slight delay in our collections process and our rig technologies segment where we have some payment delays from some of our larger, more established customers. In short, the growth is simply an issue of timing.","Fortunately, a large portion of this growth was offset by continued improvements in customer financing where prepayments and milestone invoicing on major projects outpaced cost incurred by $379 million.","In addition to the increase in working capital, we spent a $132 million on capital expenditures, made cash tax payment of $301 million, paid dividends totaling $111 million and cut bonus check based on 2013 performance. As a result, the company generated free cash flow of $252 million in the first quarter, resulting in a quarter ending cash balance of $3.7 billion and a net cash position of $539 million. Of the $3.7 billion in cash 12% of the balance was in the U.S. at March 31.","Now let me turn it back to Clay.","Clay C. Williams","Thank you, Jeremy. Before we open it up our questions, I want to say thank you to all our employees out there, we have a lot of terrific employees around the globe who have been work very, very hard to affect the spin of our distribution services business, which we are very excited about, as well is take care of all of our good customers around the globe and just I just want to say, once again, how grateful Jeremy, Loren and I are for the hard work that you do. That completes the e prepared remarks this morning, so at this point, we are prepared to open up for questions. Adriana?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital Market. Go ahead sir.","Kurt Hallead \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","","Thank you, hey good morning.","Clay C. Williams","Good morning, Kurt","Kurt Hallead \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks for all that color and detail. Much appreciated. One follow-up I would have, or point of clarity I would ask for, would the your views on backlog ending the year. Your comment, I think, was in the low teens and, once again, just wanted to understand the semantics or definition of low teens. The way I would think about low teens would be $12 billion or $13 billion. $1 billion, that would appear to me to be way too slow, predicated on the other commentary about slightly declining order book as the year goes on. If you provide a little more clarity on that, that would be very, very helpful. Thanks?","","Clay C. Williams","","First, as you well know, our visibility to position around orders is always limited, Pert. Looking out into the second half of the year, we\u2019re coming off at March 31, balance of $60.3 billion dollars. If we fall sort of the one-to-one book-to-bill for Q3 and Q4 a little bit. It certainly would be expected to drift down a little bit we were the low teens anything sells of 15. And right now that\u2019s kind of our outlook. I\u2019ll stress though, that we\u2019re very encourage to see land orders picking up, stimulation equipment picking up. We are encouraged for improvement in our FPSO orders later in the year and so there is a lot of moving pieces here, but we are just trying to provide a little more color, I think 12 or 13 would will be lower than we would expected at this point. I think you\u2019re probably looking at something in $14 billion, $15 billion range.","Kurt Hallead \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, Great. Thanks. Appreciate that. The follow-up I would have would be -- what\u2019s your take on the situation in Russia? There were sanctions, obviously, announced this morning. Might be a little bit too early for you to make that assessment, but it looks like Rosneft was one of the companies that was -- that sanctions were put on. I know you have a facility that\u2019s being manufactured in Russia. Just trying to get a handle on how to risk assess that from that standpoint?","Clay C. Williams","I think we do. We\u2019ve been investing in Russia and are building a facility to actually rig up plant rigs in that country. And that\u2019s obviously quickly evolving situations there. So we\u2019ve been watching it very, very closely. We have lots of customers in Russia, including Western companies that operate there. So, we will to see what the sanction, specifics around the sanctions in terms of the impact on our business. But, we\u2019ve been a supplier of equipment into the Russian market for many, many years and have a pretty diverse customer base there.","Kurt Hallead \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","","Okay, thanks. Appreciate that.","Clay C. Williams","","Yes. Thank you.","","Operator","","And our next question comes from Jim Crandell from Cowen. Go ahead Clar","","Jim D. Crandell \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC","","Good morning guys.","Clay C. Williams","","Good morning","","Jeremy Thigpen","Good morning, Jim.","Jim D. Crandell \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC","First, I would just like to second your comments, Clay, that you made about Pete and the outstanding job he\u2019s done over the past dozen or so years as CEO. I have questions about the order outlook for three distinct areas, Clay, and I will just lay them out here and let you answer. One is, FPSOs and if you expect a better order picture there and how quickly you see that segment improving. Secondly is Russia, particularly in light of you building this new plant, we might see in terms of an improvement in land rig orders there. Then thirdly, well stimulation. If you could answer well stimulation in the context of how big was that last time, and how meaningful could that be to Nation in the next cycle?","Clay C. Williams","You bet, Jim. Last year, with regards to FPSOs, we ahead over $1 billion an FPSO related orders primarily turret mooring systems for vessels, along with flexible pipe that flex into those turret mooring systems. And in addition to those two major products, we also sell a lot of composite piping systems into FPSO vessels. Very strong year for orders and improving P&L results coming out of those orders so we\u2019re very encouraged.","As I mentioned in my prepared comments, Q1 orders for FPSOs dipped down a little bit, but we do think that\u2019s just a function of timing, we think both for flexible pipe as well as for vessels, our Q2 and Q3 are looking much better, and so we\u2019re encouraged by that.","With regards to Russia as I just mentioned, we are investing in another facility there. We have manufacturing operations for many years in Belarus, which primarily supplies for Russian market. A couple of years ago, we opened another facility in Nizhnevartovsk. And so it\u2019s a market that has a lot of potential. There are something on the order of 800 rigs operating in Russia and most of those are older technology and there is a growing recognition, I think most Russian oil companies for the need for new technology, much like their counterparts in North America and elsewhere around the globe.","And so, our idea is to expand our footprint in Russia, and in particular our aftermarket support of that fleet. Under our current plans, that particular facility was slated to open up and start producing revenue probably the second quarter of 2015, and very encouraged about the progress on the plant, sanctions notwithstanding, obviously we\u2019re keeping a close eye on that as I just mentioned.","Finally, the well intervention and stimulation business as we mentioned, we are very encouraged there. We saw orders slow way down. Through 2013, we continued to deliver our backlog, and so the P&L for that business has been coming down. But last quarter, our Q4 2013 and then Q1 the quarter we just finished, we saw orders begin to pickup and are really encouraged for new capital equipment and also a lot of consumables that we see in that business. So that\u2019s kind of what we are seeing across those landscapes here.","Jim D. Crandell \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And Clay just there a brief follow-up, on your FPSO answer, are you seeing any progress with the customers in order willingness to try to order a standardized package?","Clay C. Williams","I would prefer to use the term configurable package Jim. What we\u2019re trying to do standardized interfaces between modules and make the vessels overall more configurable. And yes, what we are running into at the senior level amongst many of our customers is this recognition that their prior projects haven\u2019t gone particularly well economically. And it\u2019s a combination of vessels running over their original AFP amounts plus the late first oil because of late delivery of those projects.","And arguably I think the project can be challenged, and so we are gaining an audience at the highest levels of a couple of the oil companies and are encouraged with a couple of specific two in particular specific projects that we\u2019re bidding this concept into, and we think there will be more to come.","So it\u2019s very early days, and we know from our drilling rig, transformation, experience, changing the status quo in this industry is a long-term effort to generate success. But we do think we have a better way and we actually think the recent concern that world companies are expressing publicly about their economic returns on these projects provides a good backdrop to go in and have those kind of conversations.","Jim D. Crandell \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thank you, Clay.","Clay C. Williams","Thanks, Jim.","Operator","And our next question comes from Marshall Adkins from Raymond James. Please go ahead, sir.","Marshall Adkins \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","Good morning, gentlemen.","Clay C. Williams","Good morning.","Jeremy Thigpen","Good morning, Marshall.","Marshall Adkins \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","Clay, you guys have a more than a pristine balance sheet and you\u2019ve got a pretty substantial free cash flow. So I will go ahead and ask the question I\u2019ve been getting on, any \u2013 what\u2019s your latest in terms of thoughts about what we do with that cash here in the next year or two?","Clay C. Williams","","Well, Marshall, historically we paid the dividend and we began paying a dividend in 2009, both a special on a regular. We doubled that dividend last year. So I would tell you in the past, our preferred method of returning cash to shareholders and I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re talking to, has been around the dividend, we agree we have a very strong level of cash flow. And in our meetings with our board upcoming in May, we plan on discussing a level of dividend with them and as well as other alternatives, including share buybacks or some other use of cash. And so we\u2019ll see how that color turns out. But I would say that we\u2019re looking hard at meaningful increase in the dividend again in that.","Jeremy Thigpen","","But the other thing I would add to that Marshall, we intentionally took a pause from acquisitions following the Robbins & Myers acquisition in February of last year. We had \u2013 we consummated about 20 deals and about a 16 months, 17 months span, and needed some time to digest what we\u2019d require. I said we\u2019ve done that now. We gone through the integration of work, we\u2019re just about done with the spin, which is consuming a lot of resources, but I think you\u2019ll see us get a little more active in that market again. And deals are looking pretty good right now. I would say we got a pretty full pipeline most of them are smaller in nature. Most of them are internationally based, which is good, 88% of our cash at the end of the quarter is overseas.","So we will continue to look there as well and we still have a couple of fairly significant CapEx projects, including the Russian facility, we\u2019re doing some work in Saudi, certainly some more work in Latin America primarily Brazil that will consumes some cash.","Marshall Adkins \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","All right. And the follow-up there, Jeremy, you mentioned you\u2019re putting in an ERP system and SAP. A lot of times that creates some short-term disruption as it\u2019s going in. Tell me how that\u2019s progressing and where you stand on all that?","Jeremy Thigpen","Yes. We don\u2019t have a common ERP platform across all of NOV. The Distribution & Transmission segment functioned on SAP prior to the acquisitions of Wilson and D Franklin. So they\u2019re just going to the conversion process now to upgrade their SAP platform and then bring over the Wilson and Franklin businesses, that\u2019s going extremely well. Obviously these are always somewhat disruptive, but we\u2019ve had SAP in our business since 2000, I believe maybe it was 1999. So, we\u2019ve got some strong subject matter exports around the world in that area.","In some of our PS&S segments \u2013 current PS&S segments, it\u2019s not that we are implementing a common ERP across that whole segment, it\u2019s each individual business within that segment who are kind of converting over to something \u2013 something a little more robust now that we are far more global and much larger and more complex. So I don\u2019t expect any major disruption Marshall, certainly they\u2019re going to be some little hiccups here, and but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be anything material.","Marshall Adkins \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","It sounds good guys. Thank you.","Jeremy Thigpen","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Brad Handler from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Brad Handler \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Thanks. Good morning.","Clay C. Williams","Good morning, Brad.","Brad Handler \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","So I think you\u2019ve outlined in some previous calls that your pace of delivery of offshore rigs is running right around the 50 plus mark, I guess it did last year, it is this year. It is into 2015, if I recall correctly?","Clay C. Williams","That is correct.","Brad Handler \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","That\u2019s correct? Okay, good. Can you \u2013 what you have done so far, what you are in the process of tying together in terms of workforce addition, capacity addition from a plant standpoint, is that enough or should we expect continued initiatives along that vein as you kind of live with what choices you\u2019ve made?","Clay C. Williams","I think we are building up to a level of capacity that\u2019s fits kind of that level. If you look, back, Brad, over the last couple of years, orders began flowing in, in earnest late 2011, 2012, we rebuilt our backlog up to new record levels here more recently. We began to experience supply chain challenges in the first components that go into rigs, which are typically mud pumps. And the as we can\u2019t work through those again those we get better of that, the next kind of way that we saw was rig floor equipments, derricks, finally BOPs last year with the source of some challenges. And then more lately it\u2019s been IMC.","And so what you\u2019ve seen is that as that \u2013 as the pigs kind of move through the snake, it\u2019s tracked the equipment that has had to be delivered into this extraordinarily high-level of rigs that we are delivering. And why we are so confident, we know where is going to get a lot better, is that piece by piece is successfully challenged our supply chain issues and work through those short term challenges as we ramped up our capacity. We are addressing that, and we are fell like we are kind of in the last phases of it, a record level of installation commissioning work going on in shipyards right to accommodate a level of rig deliveries, which is effectively doubled our prior peak cut back in 2008 and 2009 and dealing with shorter deliver times and the like and we are making a little progress on a quarter-by-quarter.","So that\u2019s the progression of things, which regards that last piece of the fabrication puzzle, the installation and commissioning. We now have six technical colleges around the globe, and are going to eight shortly to train our service technicians who both perform installation commissioning work on new build rigs as well as repair older rigs. It\u2019s a virtual skill set, when we look out over the next four or five year we see a tremendous number of offshore rigs having to comeback in for their five year surveys. And so this is a workforce that we are training to handle the IMC work on new orders and we foresee a few years out then a portion of those will be redeployed into kind of next pressing challenge, which is to handle lot of rigs coming back into the shipyards to be sea overhauls and upgrades of the equipments that\u2019s on those rigs. This is a workforce that we see a lot even pretty busy for the next several years.","Brad Handler \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Make sense. Sure","Jeremy Thigpen","","One thing to add to that would just be as you look at the capacity additions on a go forward what I think you might see is more regionally specific capacity edition, where you see places really strong in growing markets, Saudi Arabia where they push for more and more local content requirement. This is also obviously happened in Brazil and having in Russia you\u2019ve seen in Argentina, it would be in Mexico. So I think if you see capacity additions on a go forward they will be smaller scale that nearly requiring same level of CapEx and far less disruptive, but it will be to capture new end growing markets. In that market support","Brad Handler \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Makes sense, makes sense. So really to follow-up, and maybe it is going to be certainly broader than just that part of rig tech or the legacy rig tech. But in general, what you\u2019ve just described is sort of leveraging what you have put into place, appreciating some smaller editions. Obviously, you have a lot of optimism around some improving mix over the course of time as some of the well stimulation equipment comes back. You get a little bit better pricing in backlog, as you described.","All things are sort of pointing to what you have described for us in the past, as an improving trend. But I guess is there any change to that thought, if we start to think about margins in rig tech over the course of the next couple of years, is there any acceleration to getting back to that mid-20s level, for example? Do see any signs that, that might, maybe because of the U.S. land market, that, that might happen a little bit more quickly than you have suggested to us in the past?","Do you see any signs of that might \u2013 because of the U.S.-led market that that might happen a little bit more quickly than you have suggested to us in the past?","Clay C. Williams","That\u2019s certainly encouraging as we see other parts of Rig Tech business pickup and that will help us on that front. the main driver here though is just it\u2019s continuing to gain experience on these new rig floor layouts we talked in previous calls without new class specifications for the crop of deepwater rigs that have been ordered recently before rig floor layouts. so we\u2019ve again negated some of the learning curve effects from the 2008 cycle and we know from history across all of our businesses, once we\u2019re making the second copy and the fifth copy and the tenth copy of something, we always get better at it, costs always come down and we\u2019re moving into that phase for this new crop of rigs, too. so I would say that\u2019s the main engine and the other improvements in other parts of our business are additive to that.","Brad Handler \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Great. Okay, got it. thanks guys, appreciate that color.","Clay C. Williams","Operator","This will be our last question in our Q&A session. Our last question comes from Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Michael Kirk Lamotte \u2013 Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hey, guys.","Clay C. Williams","Hi, Michael.","Michael Kirk Lamotte \u2013 Guggenheim Securities LLC","Clay, did I hear the words share repurchases come from your \u2013 come forth from those lips?","Clay C. Williams","Michael, to be fair, we\u2019ve always considered the share repurchases along with dividends and we\u2019ll continue to look that, and so yes, and I\u2019ll also do as a reminder, at Varco, prior to the merger, we had a share repurchase program. So we were pretty familiar with the math and the concept.","Michael Kirk Lamotte \u2013 Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yes.","Clay C. Williams","","But to be fair, we have a track record in our paying dividend, and I think our recent thinking around the subject with our boards counsel has been more along the lines of dividends.","Michael Kirk Lamotte \u2013 Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it, understood. Just wanted to make sure, there wasn\u2019t a change there. I\u2019m struck by looking at the Rig Tech business and thinking about how, in an up cycle, you are focused on making sure that your pricing is running ahead of your inflationary pressures, so that you can grow margin. And when you are sort of on the downside of working the rat through the snake, you are really focused on efficiency and delivery as the emphasis on margin. I\u2019m wondering, as the volume scales back from 50 floaters a year delivery to something less than that, how do you manage the absorption issue, in terms of potential margin pressure?","Clay C. Williams","Thank you. That\u2019s a great question. first point of clarification, 50 rigs as a year, that\u2019s jackups plus floaters.","Michael Kirk Lamotte \u2013 Guggenheim Securities LLC","","Right.","Clay C. Williams","But certainly cyclicality in our business is not news to us. and historically, this business has been up and down. And so we, I think are very, very good at managing both the ups and downs. the good news, for us, again is the fact that the five-year SPS cycle for these rigs kicks in, in earnest. and in fact in the year 2016, 2017 really ramps hard.","So even if the new build infrastructure slows down, we\u2019re going to be very busy in the shipyards with rigs coming in a lot, and by the way, to provide further clarification around this, the vessels have to come in for whole inspections, for insurance, for Coast Guard certificate purposes and the like, every five years. And as part of that downtime in a shipyard, they will do a lot of work on the drilling equipment packages at the same time, because of the opportunity cost of being out of service for a month or two is so high.","So that drives a lot of work for us in surveying those rigs and repairing that equipment, and replacing and frequently upgrading equipment as part of those rigs. and so we see that our install based driving very bright prospects over the next few years. And so that will do a lot to help keep our folks very busy. So I think the aftermarket portion of our business, there is a lot to bring stability to \u2013 and otherwise work cyclical business.","","Jeremy Thigpen","Another thought on that Michael is, when we made the decision to add capacity in our Rig Tech segment, we were operating at three ships, outsourcing way too much expedited freight, we added the capacity with the hope that we could bring down to a more balanced level of capacity in our plant, maybe two ships, not outsourcing as much, not expediting. And then we had a record level of orders last year. so we\u2019re still operating at three ships.","Michael Kirk Lamotte \u2013 Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yes.","Jeremy Thigpen","We produced our outsourcing, certainly and certainly reduce the expediting in freight, but we\u2019re not at optimal levels at this point of time. so a slight slowdown wouldn\u2019t be the worst thing in the world from a margin standpoint and efficiency standpoint.","Michael Kirk Lamotte \u2013 Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay, great. So really two \u2013 if I can summarize, just two real sources of leverage. One, the efficiency, Jeremy, and two, utilization doesn\u2019t fall off necessarily with the volume, because of aftermarket coming back in.","Clay C. Williams","That\u2019s right.","Michael Kirk Lamotte \u2013 Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great, thanks guys.","Clay C. Williams","Michael.","Michael Kirk Lamotte \u2013 Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yes.","Clay C. Williams","That subject to let me throw in and very optimistic about the land rig opportunity before us, and both in North America and elsewhere and this business shares a lot of resources between land and offshore as well. so this is particular area of strategic focus going forward. The need to continue to upgrade the land rig fleet, and so I think that will help provide additional source of work going forward.","Michael Kirk Lamotte \u2013 Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay, great. thanks, Clay.","Clay C. Williams","Yes. thanks, Michael.","Loren Singletary","","I want to thank all of you for joining us this morning. we look forward to speaking you about our second quarter results in July, when, is another reminder, we will be reporting along our new segment reporting lines. so thanks very much and have a great week.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at the appropriate time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Loren Singletary, Vice President, Investor & Industry Relations. You may begin your conference.","Loren Singletary - Vice President-Investor & Industry Relations","Thank you, Nicholas, and welcome, everyone, to the National Oilwell Varco First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. With me today is Clay Williams, President, CEO and Chairman of National Oilwell Varco; and Jose Bayardo, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin this discussion of National Oilwell Varco's financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2016, please note that some of the statements we make during this call may contain forecasts, projections, and estimates, including but not limited to comments about our outlook for the company's business. These are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, based on limited information as of today, which is subject to change. They are subject to risk and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially.","No one should assume that these forward-looking statements remain valid later in the quarter or later in the year. I refer you to the latest forms 10-K and 10-Q National Oilwell Varco has on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a more detailed discussion of the major risk factors affecting our business. Further information regarding these as well as supplemental financial and operating information may be found within our press release, on our website at www.nov.com, or in our filings with the SEC.","Additionally, you likely noticed that we made a few changes in the presentation of our results which were published this morning, including the incorporation of adjusted EBITDA. Please be aware that the use of the term adjusted EBITDA throughout the call this morning will correspond with the term adjusted EBITDA as defined in our press release.","Later, on this call we will answer your questions, which we ask you to limit to two in order to permit more participation. Now let me turn the call over to Clay.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Loren. National Oilwell Varco's first quarter 2016 financial results reflect the painful financial stress that our oil and gas customers are operating under. As WTI prices march steadily downward to bottom at $26 per barrel in mid-February, customers simply stopped spending and oilfield activity plummeted further. Consequently our first quarter revenues fell 20% sequentially to $2.2 billion and are down 62% from the fourth quarter of 2014 when the current down cycle started.","The company posted a $0.06 per fully diluted share loss for the first quarter of 2016, excluding severance, restructuring and other items totaling $0.26 per fully diluted share. EBITDA was $127 million for the quarter, or 5.8% of revenue and operating loss was $48 million or negative 2.2% of revenue, excluding restructuring and other items from both.","Sequential EBITDA decremental leverage was 37% on the 20% revenue decline and year-over-year EBITDA decremental leverage was 29% on the 55% revenue decline excluding restructuring and other items from all quarters. In a moment, Jose will take you through a more detailed discussion of operating results.","Our restructuring efforts accelerated during the quarter as we continued to aggressively manage cost downward we have closed or are closing 200 facilities since the downturn began and we reduced our workforce by nearly 6,000 employees during the first quarter of 2016. SG&A expenses declined $31 million in the quarter sequentially and is down $180 million or 34% from late 2014.","Importantly, while we downsize we were also maintaining our investment in the future. Including $110 million invested in the first quarter on engineering, research and development into emerging technologies and products which will further reduce production costs, increase access to reserves, improve safety and reduce the impact on the environment for our customers.","We closed four small acquisitions in the quarter which collectively bring new technology to our portfolio, specifically surface rig instrumentation, downhole measurement while drilling technologies and drill pipe asset tracking utilizing RFID chip technology. Each of these acquisitions complement our own internal organic investments that advance our long-term strategic plans.","I would like to take a moment this morning and share with you just how we see our future unfolding and how these investments in our long-term strategic plan articulate with that future.","First, horizontal drilling and geosteering are key enabling technologies of the shale revolution, 90% of U.S. land rigs drilling today are drilling horizontally or at least directionally, a share which has actually increased from 79% since the downturn began in the fourth quarter of 2014. Horizontal drilling, which opens up much more of the reservoir to the wellbore, will expand globally and be applied more widely in the inevitable upturn. Therefore, NOV has developed a new low-cost rotary steerable tool which will be run commercially in our customer's hole for the first time next week. This new product complements our comprehensive bottom hole assembly or BHA offering to the directional drilling industry.","Our Tektonic family of abrasion resistant fixed cutter bits are gaining market share as is our new ERT downhole drilling motor and we added new NWD products through an acquisition in the first quarter as well. These tools work with our jars, shock subs, drill collars and premium drill pipe, engineered to withstand the considerable rigors of horizontal drilling.","Our long-term strategic plan in this area is built on our view that the next up cycle will see even greater demand for drilling tools for horizontal drilling, which will be provided by a directional drilling service industry that NOV will continue to equip.","Second, North American shale plays endured lengthy gestation periods before they evolved to profitability as the E&Ps experimented with drilling techniques to arrive at the most cost-effective methods to drive marginal cost per barrel sufficiently low to be a financially attractive investment. In the next up cycle, NOV can help short-circuit that empirical technique, using our closed loop automated drilling service, which has proven it can materially reduce drilling costs by making microsecond level adjustments to the drilling rig through our proprietary rig control system and software. We are bidding or executing over a dozen closed-loop automated drilling projects currently, utilizing our proprietary IntelliServ wired drill pipe.","We are also seeing more interest from drilling contractors wishing to differentiate their rigs by outfitting them with IntelliServ wired drill pipe. In fact, we know of an idled rig that was recently put back to work solely because it was outfitted with IntelliServ pipe, a big win for its owner.","Our long-term strategic plan is built on the view that E&P companies will prospect new shale plays globally using rigs capable of closed-loop automated drilling, tier 1 AC rigs, wired IntelliServ drill pipe, bottom hole assembly components and Novo (8:00) software, all of which NOV can provide today.","During the first quarter NOV was awarded a major five year project in North Africa for a real-time technology center to track drilling rig operations, and we are currently bidding other similar projects. NOV has provided real-time remote monitoring of equipment for many years. A few weeks ago we announced the industry's first predictive capabilities for monitoring BOP components through our RIGSENTRY remote condition-based monitoring services.","We believe that condition-based remote monitoring of oilfield equipment and predictive data analytics will grow in importance in the next upturn as the industry increasingly employs more sophisticated equipment in more demanding environments. The Internet of Things is coming to the oilfield and NOV will continue to lead the way, and will benefit from the largest installed base of drilling equipment and drilling control systems in the world.","Hydraulic fracture simulation is another enabling technology with proven value to the industry. We are investing in new technologies which we believe can reduce the capital equipment onsite, the number of truckloads required, the power requirements and the operating costs of conventional frac fleets. Our long-term strategic plan has us investing in better ways to hydraulically stimulate reservoirs, again, the next upturn will see more widespread application of fracture stimulation and we plan to provide the next generation of tools.","The oil and gas industry has invested billions in deepwater exploration, chalking up more than 400 undeveloped discoveries and our strategic plan targets improving floating production technologies to lower the development cost of these reserves.","We are targeting a new fully costed (9.41) production solution to offer to owners of marginal deepwater fields by early 2017. Preliminary discussions with IOCs around our new innovative concepts have been met with high levels of enthusiasm. Specifically, these are smaller standardized units which can operate efficiently across a broader range of production, which utilize standardized disconnectable turrets to increase asset utilization and efficiency.","On the sea floor we are expanding our offering in flexible pipe, connectors and other hardware along with seawater treatment technologies for subsea seawater injection, which increases the ultimate recovery from reservoirs through pressure maintenance, ultimately lowering cost per barrel.","We are continuing to expand our offering of composite materials into both offshore and land markets, partly through an acquisition we closed in the fourth quarter. Composite materials offer superior corrosion resistance in the flowlines we supply and lighter weights, which drive down offshore vessel construction costs.","Our long-term plan continues to advance these technologies which will see increased uptake in a recovery. As the largest provider of fiberglass and composite tubulars to the oilfield in the world, NOV is well positioned to continue to drive corrosion resistant solutions.","Onshore we are focused on other technologies which help our customers reduce their cost of production. The U.S. is really a 60 million barrel per day water industry that produces 9 million barrels a day of oil as a byproduct. Our WaterWolf technology offers superior oil-water separation and complements our proprietary sand separation technologies and extensive production pump business. Our long-term plan also invests strategically in key productive regions like Saudi Arabia and Russia where we began fabricating our first land rig and downhole tools at a new plant we opened in the first quarter.","NOV is an innovative, entrepreneurial organization resolutely focused on improving the cost per barrel position of our customers through technology, improved supply chain, standardization and industrialization. Our experience is that business models such as these, built on sound fundamentals that focus on our customers' needs are long-term winners. They are in contrast to new business models which seem to arise during downturns which focus on either providing our customers with increasingly valuable capital they cannot access elsewhere or business models wherein we shoulder more of our customers' risks.","Price cycles have demonstrated that these models frequently do not turn out so well. As we approach the bottom of this sharp down cycle, our customers are struggling to make money right now and the oilfield services industry is being radically disassembled to cope with commodity prices far below levels required to return to production growth. This is not sustainable and will change. Investors are understandably focused on optionality of enterprises in an eventual recovery.","The handful of strategic plans I just outlined rest on specific promising technologies our customers can apply across the globe. They will continue to evolve the industry to higher levels of efficiency and safety and lower cost of production. NOV is positioning itself to capitalize on the inevitable upturn and I am excited about the optionality embedded in our initiatives and, more so the creativity and ingenuity that our teammates here at NOV continue to apply to our customers' challenges.","While we are not planning for a recovery in 2016, we are encouraged by reports from some customers that they are beginning to think about a potential upturn in the second half of the year as oil production has finally begun to rollover and demand continues to march upward.","We will continue to manage cost to the reality of the marketplace in the short-term which is becoming more challenging as very low volumes present rising absorption challenges for us. Even with a rebound in oil prices, it will take time for our customers to repair balance sheets, to complete their drilled but uncompleted wells, to work down oil inventories and access capital to resume drilling but the industry will navigate these challenges and NOV will be here with an enhanced offering and greater levels of efficiency.","I'm grateful to be part of such an entrepreneurial, smart organization with deep financial resources and diverse business models and bright opportunities in our future. This has always been a deeply cyclical industry and our leaders have been through many downturns before and they will again lead us through the present storm.","Oilfield services is not much fun right now and I want to let all of our employees know that Jose, Lauren and I appreciate you suiting up every day and fighting the good fight, hang in there, better days lie ahead. Jose?","Jose A. Bayardo - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","As Clay mentioned, NOV posted a $0.06 per share loss for the quarter, excluding severance, restructuring and other items which totaled $147 million pre-tax or $0.26 per share after-tax. Consolidated revenues were $2.2 billion for the first quarter of 2016, down 20% from the fourth quarter of 2015 and 55% year-over-year. The sharp decline during the quarter was a result of significant E&P spending curtailment as oil prices reached new lows.","The average U.S. land rig count fell 27% sequentially, exiting the quarter at 450, the lowest count since the 1940s. And the average international rig count fell 8%, hitting a decade low at 985 rigs with declines being across all major regions of the globe. All of NOV's business units and global regions were negatively impacted and all reporting segments saw revenue declines during the quarter. EBITDA decreased to $127 million or 5.8% of sales resulting in sequential EBITDA decremental leverage of 37% and year-over-year decremental leverage of 29%. Operating loss excluding other items was $48 million.","Looking at some of the other line items of the P&L, SG&A decreased by $31 million or 8% sequentially and by $138 million or 28% year-over-year as we continue to execute cost control measures necessary to size our business for the current market environment.","Interest and other financial cost decreased $2 million sequentially and $1 million year-over-year, primarily due to lower banking fees associated with the reduction of letters of credit outstanding. We reported a $3 million higher loss sequentially in unconsolidated affiliates related our Voest-Alpine joint venture where demand for OCTG or green tubing remains exceedingly low given the dearth of drill pipe demand. Other expenses for the quarter increased $4 million sequentially driven primarily by a greater loss on disposals of fixed assets.","Our GAAP effective tax rate was 50% for the quarter. The unusually high rate was the result of combining losses in higher tax jurisdictions, namely the U.S., with income from lower rate international jurisdictions. Additionally, we received a tax benefit associated with reversing reserves for tax audits which concluded with favorable outcomes. With the relatively low levels of pre-tax income and losses that we are currently experiencing, relatively small changes in the split between domestic and international results can have a disproportionate impact on our effective tax rate. Notwithstanding this uncertainty and anticipated volatility, or current estimate for the effective tax rate is 35% for the remainder of the year.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, working capital decreased $528 million from the fourth quarter of 2015 to $4.9 billion at March 31, 2016. The decrease of working capital is primarily the result of a $714 million reduction in accounts receivable, $144 million reduction in inventory levels and an $84 million decrease in customer financing, which is the net of prepayment and billings in excess of cost against cost in excess of billings.","The reductions in working capital were partially offset by decreases in accrued liabilities and accounts payable. Our focus on collections yielded strong results during the quarter, although inventory is not liquidating as quickly as we would like, reflecting lower current levels of demand. We anticipate working capital will continue to be a source of cash as our revenues move lower, but we expect the pace of cash flow generation to slow relative to the past two quarters.","The reduction in working capital helped contribute to an exceptional quarter of cash flow generation relative to the current market environment. NOV generated $621 million in cash flow from operations during the first quarter. After paying $173 million in dividends, $84 million for non-acquisition related capital expenditure investments, and $21 million for acquisitions and adding a foreign exchange benefit and other items totaling $20 million, we netted $363 million in free cash flow.","Additionally, we successfully repatriated another $637 million in cash from overseas at a very low cost, allowing us to reduce our commercial paper balances by $683 million to a quarter end balance of $210 million. This pay down of debt was partially offset by a capital lease associated with a large new facility which came on to our books during the quarter. The building will allow us to consolidate approximately 1,600 personnel from 12 existing NOV facilities, of which 10 will be fully vacated after we finish moving into this new facility. At March 31, we had cash balance of $1.8 billion, total debt of $3.4 billion and our debt-to-capitalization was 17.1% down from 19.2% at year-end.","As Loren mentioned in his introductory remarks, we made a few changes to the presentation of certain information in our release this morning which we hope will enhance our readers' ability to understand NOV and its financial performance.","One of the changes relates to presentation of our segment results. In order to provide a clear measurement of all reporting segments, we are no longer allocating certain corporate overhead cost to our segment results and we are now capturing these costs in the line item, eliminations and corporate costs. We have revised prior period amounts to make the segment performance comparable and when we speak to segment results this morning we will be referring to the reclassified results presented in our earnings release. In today's release, we also provided the specific amounts now deemed corporate cost for each period presented, however, we do not anticipate breaking these costs out in the future.","Our Rig Systems segment generated first quarter revenue of $926 million, down 9% from the $1 billion earned last quarter. For the first quarter, the split between offshore and land related revenue was 75% and 25% respectively. New construction of offshore rigs accounted for $431 million in revenues or 20% of NOV's consolidated revenues.","First quarter EBITDA for the Rig Systems segment was $137 million. After four quarters of exceptional decremental \u2013 margin management, our Rig Systems segment saw a significant decline in margins in the first quarter. Margins fell 630 basis points, 14.8% of sales representing 87% decrementals on 9% lower sequential revenues. Operating profit was $119 million or 12.8% of sales.","Lower margins arose from the much sharper than anticipated fall in spare part sales in our Aftermarket business, meaningfully impacting absorption within Rig Systems segment's facilities that manufacture those products. Additionally, while cost reductions are underway, their pace simply can't always keep up with sharp volume declines, particularly when you are trying to be thoughtful in your actions while treating people as well as you reasonably can during this difficult time.","Bottom line is that the lower anticipated margins were the result of lower throughput in our manufacturing facilities combined with a slowdown in cost reduction efforts relative to the falloff in volumes.","On a year-over-year basis, first-quarter revenue was down 63% at only 25% decremental margins. The solid year-over-year decrementals in the face of a nearly two-thirds revenue decline have been accomplished by significant insourcing from our external supply chain but these opportunities are diminishing.","New orders were $97 million in the first quarter representing a book-to-bill of only 13% when compared to the $770 million shipped out of backlog. Q1 bookings were composed entirely of discrete capital equipment including cranes, pressure control and jacking systems. For the second straight quarter we received no new rig orders.","As we note in our press release, effective March 31, 2016, we have deducted the backlog we previously disclosed for rigs being constructed in Brazil to reflect SETE's shareholder approval to file for bankruptcy protection last week, along with other orders for which we have not been paid in over a year totaling approximately $2.1 billion.","Although our contracts with the three yards remain in place and are enforceable, work on all of these projects has been suspended pending payment and will remain so until customers make funds available to advance the projects, leading us to report backlog more conservatively. Therefore, ending backlog was $3.3 billion for Rig Systems and we expect $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of this backlog to be converted to revenue through the remainder of 2016 for a full-year revenue from backlog number of about $2 billion to $2.1 billion.","Looking at the second quarter, we anticipate a much sharper, up to 30% falloff in revenue as we continue to work off backlog on existing projects. We anticipate much improved decremental margins, approximately 30%, as savings for our latest cost-cutting efforts are fully realized but are more than offset by declining volumes.","Our Rig Aftermarket segment generated $391 million of revenue during the first quarter of 2016, down 31% from the $569 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and down 46% from the $719 million in the first quarter of 2015.","Revenue declines were anticipated in the first quarter due to deteriorating market conditions and the normal falloff of year-end service and repair work, however, sharper falloff in activity levels versus expectations amplified the decline and further eroded demand for spare parts as our drilling contracting customers, offshore in particular, cut their expenditures on repairs, services and spare parts dramatically across the board.","EBITDA was $82 million, down 43% sequentially and down 62% from the prior year. Decrementals were 35%, driving EBITDA margins down to 21%. While a mix shift from spares to service and repair and some pricing pressure contributed to the profitability decline, the largest driver was reduced volumes, which resulted in lower absorption in our facilities and lower utilization of our service and repair personnel.","Operating profit was $77 million or 19.7% of sales. Special periodic survey work continues but we are seeing significant reductions in the scope on these surveys and other long-plan SPS projects are being canceled lately in view of grim prospects for these offshore rigs winning contracts anytime soon. Additionally, we are seeing pricing pressures continue to mount.","Looking forward, we expect revenues to come down in the mid-single digit percentage point range with sequential EBITDA decrementals in line with Q1's results. Thinking longer-term, we believe Rig Aftermarket will be an early beneficiary of activity recovery as we work with our customers to provide the necessary parts, service, repair and maintenance required to put their rigs back to work. Additionally, we believe new U.S. offshore BOP regulations will drive additional demand for condition-based monitoring services, which we have provided for over five years.","Our Wellbore Technologies segment generated revenues of $631 million during the first quarter of 2016, down 17% sequentially from $757 million and down 46% from the $1.2 billion posted in the first quarter of 2015. Revenue mix by destination was 46% North America and 54% international. 70% of the segment's decline came from international markets, which declined 22% sequentially, most acutely in Asia and Latin America. The U.S. declined 16% sequentially, better than the 26% decline in the U.S. rig count, indicating that despite intense pricing pressures, the group's revenue per rig improved on market share gains.","EBITDA for the segment was $43 million or 6.8% of sales, down 44% from the previous quarter and 82% from the prior year. Sequentially, EBITDA decremental leverage was limited to 27% on the $126 million revenue decline, as the group experienced the full benefits of cost reductions made last quarter and continues to eliminate substantial portions of its cost structure, including the closure of more than 20 facilities during the first quarter of 2016. Operating loss for the segment was $53 million.","Quotation activity from the Downhole Tools segment is increasing and we believe that even a leveling of activity will bring more work as customers are depleting their stocks of equipment and tools coming in from jobs not being repaired. We therefore expect repair work and motor relines to begin to rise through the year as customers run out of tools. We began manufacturing downhole tools in new plants in Saudi Arabia and Russia during the first quarter. Drill pipe demand remains very low and we have mothballed much of our capacity as a result but Q2 benefited from a high mix of large diameter premium threaded drill pipe.","Our Tuboscope unit saw pipe mill and processor activity fall owing to 12 months of OCTG inventory on the ground in North America, five months to six months is the normalized average. However, we are beginning to see some interest in completion and workover activity which may drive demand for coating and inspection work in the back half of the year, along with higher demand for sucker rod services for artificial lift. Wellsite Services saw a significant decline in revenues tied to lower rig counts but aggressive cost control enabled the group to post higher EBITDA sequentially.","We noted a number of wins in our press release and in Clay's remarks but I'd like to further highlight some of the recent successes and market share gains particularly related to our downhole tools and drilling and optimization businesses. Our drill bit designs continue to set new performance records globally. Most recently in Oman, where an operator set three new field records using our Tektonic bit to drill 8,000 plus feet in a single run. Since their introduction in October 2015, Tektonic bits have logged 22 field records in 10 countries around the globe.","Additionally our Dynamic Drilling Solutions business continues to gain traction with eVolve optimization and closed-loop drilling automation services. In our release, we highlighted the completion of an 18 month project in the Norwegian North Sea with a major integrated oil company developing a field and consisting of an oil reservoir and several deeper structurally complex high-pressure gas and condensate reservoirs.","Wells drilled in this field have a narrow pressure picture window that requires a comprehensive understanding of the conditions in the formation and that leaves little room for error in order to optimize economics associated with the development of the field.","Our suite of tools provided the customer with high-speed streaming downhole data used to accurately analyze wellbore conditions, which enabled the customer to have the data required to justify extending laterals well beyond originally planned by design. By extending the wellbore the customer significantly increased production from the well drilled, therefore eliminating the need for the final well included in the original project plan.","Given the cost of drilling in the North Sea, you can appreciate how our technologies reduced the customer's development cost substantially. Additionally, we were recently awarded a contract for downhole drilling automation with an independent E&P customer in Western Canada and as Clay mentioned, we were awarded a five year project by a national oil company in North Africa for real-time data acquisition, visualization and optimization.","The traction we continue to gain with new technologies indicate our customers' persistent desire to seek new and better ways to drill and we have positioned ourselves as the leading independent provider to help them achieve those goals.","Notwithstanding the many positive ongoing developments occurring within our Wellbore Technologies segment, our business is primarily driven by drilling related activities. With Q2 global activity already sharply lower than the Q1 average, we anticipate second quarter revenues will be down approximately 15%.","Additionally, while we continue to reduce our cost structure, we do not believe we will replicate the success we had in the first quarter managing our decremental margin and anticipate the segment to be at or near breakeven EBITDA.","The Completion and Production Solutions segment generated revenues of $585 million (sic) [$558 million] (31:35) for the first quarter of 2016, down 25% sequentially and 41% compared to the first quarter of 2015. While all businesses experienced fewer sales, revenue declines were the sharpest within our offshore production related groups, which were coming off record or near record years in 2015. Revenue out of backlog was $330 million, down 28% sequentially.","EBITDA for the segment was $48 million or 8.6% of sales, down from 11.9% in Q4 and 18.2% in Q1 of 2015. The segment was able to hold decremental EBITDA leverage to 22% as cost savings realized and facility consolidations and head count reductions helped soften the impact of declining revenues. Operating loss for the segment was $4 million. Revenues for intervention, stimulation and wireline equipment continue to decline particularly across North America, while the Middle East has remained comparatively strong.","Aftermarket spares and services for stimulation equipment are facing considerable headwinds as customers aggressively cannibalize fleets, including acquiring auction spreads going for $0.20 on the dollar to part out. However, we are encouraged by a recent pickup in quotations for possible orders in the second half of 2016 when some customers believe completion activity will pick up and by sequentially stronger order bookings.","Our floating production group posted lower revenues as well but had excellent decrementals due to aggressive downsizing. We continue to advance a half dozen FEED studies for FPSO related projects, but final investment decisions have been non-existent as customers recycle designs and concepts to reduce cost.","Our flexible pipe business fell sharply as our plant in Brazil ran out of orders in December, however the group landed significant orders which will lead to revenue growth in Q2 and should load the plant through the remainder of the year.","Our composite pipe business unit fell during the first quarter but again, aggressive cost control led to an improvement in EBITDA in the first quarter and orders improved.","Process and Flow Technologies also posted higher EBITDA on flat revenues owing to significant restructuring that went on last year and favorable mix as the group won record levels of orders for production chokes. New orders were $328 million, up $56 million or 26% resulting in a 99% book-to-bill in the first quarter. The segment ended the quarter with a backlog balance of $994 million.","While we experienced a sharp quarterly decline and industry activity levels continue to fall, we believe achieving a book-to-bill approaching 100% is an indicator the C&PS segment is rapidly approaching a bottom but as those orders don't immediately convert to revenue, we expect segment revenue to decrease in the mid to upper single-digit percentage range in the second quarter.","Cost savings which positively impacted Q1 results are expected to continue but not to the same magnitude on decremental margins as we experienced in the first quarter, which should lead to decrementals in the mid-30% range. Visibility on new order intake remains cloudy, particularly in the offshore space as the industry continues its deepwater cost recalibration. That said, we optimistically anticipate that new orders will see a slight tick up during the second quarter.","In summary, our first quarter results reflect the fact that we are in an extremely challenging market environment. Despite current conditions we continue to generate substantial amounts of free cash flow even while we make meaningful investments in our ability to continue delivering better technologies and solutions for our customers in the oil and gas space. We expect the near-term environment to remain difficult, however, we are growing more optimistic that we are nearing the bottom of the cycle and we are excited about the future value that the hard-working and innovative people of NOV will deliver to our customers and our shareholders as the recovery takes hold.","With that, we'd like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from the line of Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, thanks and congrats, Clay, on the generating free cash flow it what's undoubtedly one of the toughest environments I think any of us have ever experienced.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Ole.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","When thinking about National Oilwell, there's still a division between the thought around your rig construction and that of your shorter cycle opportunity and I kind of remember back in the mid, late-1990s and Grant Prideco and how it surprised all of us with its kind of operating leverage and even National Oilwell before Varco all its motors and downhole tools, et cetera and the early cycle characteristics of that. I wonder whether you could just share your high-level thoughts on kind of the early cycle component of National Oilwell, how it's changed from those days, your philosophy and how you're building it out?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thank you, Ole. A lot of \u2013 it's been a systematic, steady application of capital over the years to very attractive businesses like Grant Prideco's drill pipe business. I think as you're aware 97% of the acquisition capital we've deployed through the last decade plus have been in areas outside of rigs. We have a great franchise in building rigs and very proud of that, have done a great job. But looking forward, I think as the cycle recovers, we're going to benefit from investments like that.","Drill pipe demand comes back, that drives high, very high operating leverage and high levels of profitability, particularly for our offering which is \u2013 which rests on a lot of premium technology in specialized drill pipe used to drill more complex well pads for instance. As we noted in our comments we expect to see rising demand in downhole tools and we have been developing internally as well as through acquisition new offerings in that arena and as recovery comes back I think we'll see response there.","As Jose mentioned, our Rig Aftermarket business, our customers really have cut spending to bare bones and are relying on cannibalization of many of the fleets that are out there. That can't last forever and so recovery, I think, we'll in Rig Aftermarket.","And finally, Completion and Production Solutions, through the last decade we've added new products there to help our customers improve economics in the deepwater, so things like torqueing (37:56) systems, flexible pipe that we referenced, built out our offering of composite offerings. So now we are the largest provider of flexible composite piping, for instance, in flow lines. And so, all these businesses we expect in an upturn to benefit pretty early and so we're well poised and positioned I think as activity starts to come back and our customers start to invest more again to take advantage of that.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, if we sort of go into a period where we have a recovery, but let's say it takes a few years before we get any deepwater or offshore rigs ordered again. What do you think the drag will be from your facilities cost and your other cost associated with an underutilized offshore rig construction business? How well can you utilize or take down the capacity cost?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's a great question, Ole. We are downsizing in response to what we anticipate will be lower demand for at least the next few years and possibly beyond. But to clarify, our Rig Systems business is composed of manufacturing operations that make drilling components that support both land and offshore as well as spare parts to support the Rig Aftermarket business.","And the reality is that although we break it out to enhance our disclosure to the investing public, the Rig Aftermarket and the Rig Systems segments in many ways really constitute one big global business and they support all aspects of drilling, from offshore rigs to land rigs to the spare parts, maintenance, special-purpose survey projects and repair that's out there.","So we are moving our cost structure down, retrenching. As you know, in the past we relied on a balanced mix between internal manufacturing as well as outsourcing and so kind of the first actions we took through 2015 was to minimize our outsourcing and bring more in-house. We are continuing to do that, but also looking at continuing to kind of reduce our footprint to cope with lower volumes.","What I would tell you is, although orders are very, very slow now, business is obviously down to sort of subsistence levels, looking out in coming quarters we expect to see a resumption of land rig projects. We have a number of conversations underway around the globe. We expect to see drilling contractors continuing to upgrade their equipment and make their rigs more competitive in a market that's a little tougher on them.","We expect to see and we're investing in some new products, I don't think we mentioned on the call, but some new products to upgrade those rigs that we're pretty excited about. So, we will retrench down to fit the volume that we foresee out there for the next few years as well as continuing to invest in our other two segments that have a lot of very bright prospects in a recovery.","Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for that.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet. Thanks, Ole.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Waqar Syed with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Just following up on the discussion. So the change in accounting that you have, in terms of allocating the G&A cost into individual segments, are you strategically thinking of a different way of running these businesses as well in the future with more centralized control over most of the segments? Is that also part of the thinking, or it's just a basic accounting change?","Jose A. Bayardo - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning, Waqar. It's Jose. It's really just a simple accounting change. So operationally and reporting-wise, things remain exactly the same. We just felt that it was appropriate to take out what we felt are truly corporate overhead costs from \u2013 take that out of the segment results, so very simple change.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then just on the M&A side, could you highlight \u2013 this is something that you've talked about for a while, there were some small acquisitions. Are there any opportunities for some meaningful M&A as well?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, we've had conversations kind of continually with potential attractive organizations that are kind of larger than we did in Q1 and continue to kind of work those conversations. But as the oilfield activity has gone down every single quarter for the last five or six quarters, I think all parties are kind of seeing how all this plays out and we are as well.","We do think it's steadily become more of a buyer's market, frankly, through the past year and half, and so we're trying to be very selective, very disciplined in our application of capital, and so we're looking at opportunities but nothing to report yet.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Given the market environment and your liquidity and cash position, what is kind of the maximum enterprise value type transaction that you could do?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think it certainly depends on financing. We are fortunate in that we have a lot of liquidity and access to capital presently, but I think we would view an all-cash acquisition differently than one which may involve equity, but suffice to say we're looking at \u2013 this is the kind of market that produces opportunity and so we're looking hard at potential things that we can deploy capital into opportunistically in a downturn like this.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Jose A. Bayardo - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your questions.","William Herbert - Simmons & Co. International","Thanks. Good morning. Jose, forgive me for asking this question because you went through it, but it was hard to keep up with regard to the writing. So on Rig tech, did you say that for the second quarter revenues down 30% quarter-on-quarter, and sequential decrementals of 30%?","Jose A. Bayardo - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","On Rig Systems?","William Herbert - Simmons & Co. International","On Rig Systems \u2013 sorry about that, yes.","Jose A. Bayardo - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. That's correct.","William Herbert - Simmons & Co. International","Okay. So that's \u2013 just kind of doing this on the fly here, that seems like it's what, like about an 8% margin or something like that for the second quarter? A couple questions on (44:50). One, Clay, it sounds like you're increasingly cautiously optimistic about the second half of the year with regard to the visibility that you're seeing.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","William Herbert - Simmons & Co. International","And so is it a reasonable premise to assume that Q2 margins for Rig Systems are likely to trough? And then, secondly, given the mix shift in your business and prior, call it, mid-cycle operating margins, not EBITDA margins, of call it 25% \u2013 20% to 25%, not peak, but sustainably strong margins, how should we think about mid-cycle margins for this business going forward, given the mix shift in your business?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, first, with regards to Rig Systems, I'm not prepared to call bottom on margins where \u2013 as we kind of touched on a little earlier in the call, that business is, frankly, just more challenged as construction projects continue to wind down past Q2.","William Herbert - Simmons & Co. International","Okay.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And we're managing what we can, which are costs, right, to respond to where we land. So, what I would say, though, is in terms of a second half recovery, my comments were more directed to Wellbore Technologies and Completion and Production Services specifically, where we're getting very, very anecdotal, but a few customers really talking explicitly about a second half recovery and quotation volumes around that potential scenario starting to go up. I'll stress, Bill, these are quotations, not POs.","William Herbert - Simmons & Co. International","Okay.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So we'll see how that plays out. But we're encouraged by that. In terms of sort of mid-cycle, peak cycle kind of EBITDA margins, we've always been attracted to sort of high operating leverage businesses, and we have a lot of that in our mix, one.","Two, there has been an awful lot of cost reductions underway both in our enterprise and around the industry. And the really great thing about the recoveries when they come, is it doesn't take much incremental volume to flow in and you really have become sort of hyper efficient at generating profitability out of that. We've seen that in prior up cycles.","And so when a turn comes, you have a lean, mean fighting force out there executing very skillfully, very efficiently. And then when the volume comes beyond that, you start to get a little more pricing leverage. So you can start to undo some of the discounting that happened in the prior downturn. So the earnings power of these businesses on an upslope into a recovery are extraordinary and...","William Herbert - Simmons & Co. International","But the mix shift from offshore to sort of predominantly onshore, that doesn't necessarily change what the margin profile is over the course of a recovery or is it just purely kind of revenue delta operating incremental...?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","If you're talking about the land rig business...","William Herbert - Simmons & Co. International","Yeah.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","...it's a little \u2013 in the past, it's been a little more challenged because it's more competitive.","William Herbert - Simmons & Co. International","Yeah.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's in the old days of blacksmithed iron (48:05).","William Herbert - Simmons & Co. International","Okay.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Looking forward, look, Tier-1 AC powered rigs with sophisticated control systems are going to inherit the future.","William Herbert - Simmons & Co. International","Okay.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I would submit, that's a probably more attractive set of prospects in that space. And so I think that will help. And then with regards to that \u2013 to the other parts of these portfolios, it varies a lot business by business. But generally, I think, we've demonstrated pretty good operating leverage and an awareness of pricing leverage when those opportunities arise that we'll certainly capitalize on. And so that's \u2013 I think that \u2013 again, that will fuel, I think, pretty strong earnings power in the recovery.","William Herbert - Simmons & Co. International","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet.","Jose A. Bayardo - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Darren Gacicia with KLR Group. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.","Darren Gacicia - KLR Group LLC","Hey. Thanks for taking my question. There is a lot of talk on this call kind of shifting attention towards more consumable-oriented businesses, short cycle businesses, with focus on wellbore and completions. What I was trying to get a sense of if you kind of break it down product-by-product a little bit, is what are the conversations with clients across those product lines and when you think about lead times to delivery, if you were actually going to see an improvement in the commodity market and see an improvement in activity, when would you have to kind of, start to seeing that \u2013 those discussions you'd have to be able to supply that activity if you think about those two segments?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we have an abundance of capacity, so as soon as a purchase order comes in, I think we can respond pretty quickly. From a macro perspective though, I do think commodity prices have to go up and they have to stay there a while before you really see activity and purchasing follow that as customers repair balance sheets and basically get comfortable that commodity prices are going to stay high for a while and so kind of the activity recovery will lag the commodity price recovery, I believe. But when the activity recovery comes though, we are very encouraged and anxious to move forward with a lot of the new ideas that we outlined in the call.","And again, we think these are going to be very impactful ideas, new and innovative ways to reduce marginal cost of production from all sources of production is going to create a lot of opportunity for NOV. So we're looking forward to that day and ready to go. And right now, they're just conversations, not purchase orders but the conversations with customers around applying innovation, increasing efficiency are encouraging.","Darren Gacicia - KLR Group LLC","Got it. If I could follow-up, just thinking about Rig Aftermarket, when you need to put rigs back to work, I'm assuming that they are going to have to \u2013 a lot of these companies \u2013 a lot of the rig operators will have to contact you first \u2013 whether it's land or offshore, to do some work given the kind of underspend that's been reflected and what's happened in Rig Systems and Aftermarket. When \u2013 have those \u2013 any of \u2013 it sounds like there was some commentary earlier that some of those conversations at least have started to happen, can you give a little color on that and kind of how you would expect that to proceed kind of in front of activity recovery?","Jose A. Bayardo - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hey, Darren. I think as we mentioned, the inbound inquiries regarding \u2013 from customers thinking about the second half of the year and beyond trying to just make sure that they are prepared as possible for their \u2013 to respond to their customer needs are starting to pick up as commodity prices have picked up a little bit and as just the sentiment has been a little bit more optimistic regarding a second half recovery. So we're certainly seeing more inbound calls from people who have numerous rigs stacked in their yard, who are thinking about what's going to be necessary in order to put those rigs back to work and also related to the timing, just to ensure that those parts and service capacity is in place to help them out.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And in a world that has more rigs than it needs, right now, too, they're thinking through how do I differentiate my rigs? And so a lot of \u2013 in terms of the color of these conversations, a lot of this is around can I add a new control system, can I add a new capability to my rig and so it's more \u2013 it's trying to differentiate their rigs in kind of a crowded marketplace. Most of the kind of the second half recovery inbound calls that we \u2013 that I'm referring to \u2013 although we've had some in Rig Aftermarket, I would say Wellbore Technologies and Completion and Production Solutions are...","Darren Gacicia - KLR Group LLC","Yeah. If I can just squeeze just one more in, for the Brazil backlog adjustments, and talks about reducing your overhead, have the overhead adjustments already taken place in Brazil or is that been sort of a drag that may go away given the fact it's accounted a bit differently?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","They've been coming down over time. We've been responding I mean \u2013 and I think we've disclosed quarter-by-quarter our Brazilian revenue has been slowing dramatically as project-by-project we've been either requested by our shipyard customers or due to lack of payments have slowed work. So that's come down.","But also I'd point out Brazil is still the second-largest deepwater drilling market in the world right now and we still have significant business in Brazil. So we made investments down there to support the program. Our expectation is we're going to sort of shift those to more support ongoing drilling activity in the future. But we've been trimming the cost position there along the way.","Darren Gacicia - KLR Group LLC","Thank you very much.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Byron Pope with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Just one quick question, Clay, NOV is the dominant independent provider of downhole tools to the directional drilling industry and so as I think about the acquisition of Tolteq and you guys about to run your first low-cost rotary steerable tool in the hole for a customer next week, could you just speak to some of the trends that you see evolving in that business and are we moving to an environment where rotary steerables are going to start to compete with more conventional methods of directional drilling? Just curious to how you see that business evolving over time?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, there's \u2013 using rotary steerable technology I think makes for more accurate geosteering, makes for smoother wellbores. And so you avoid production problems with for instance ponding and pooling of produced water in the low spots in the lateral, stuff like that.","So it's fundamentally better technology and \u2013 but it's a previously \u2013 it has been a very expensive technology over the years and so I do think it makes sense that since it's a better way it will to continue to move forward and so we're pretty excited about the prospects.","Byron K.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, today's conference maybe recorded.","I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Loren Singletary, Vice President of Investor and Industry Relations. Sir, please go ahead.","Loren Singletary - Vice President-Investor & Industry Relations","Thank you, Michelle, and welcome, everyone to the National Oilwell Varco second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With me today is Clay Williams, President, CEO, and Chairman of National Oilwell Varco, and Jose Bayardo, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin this discussion of National Oilwell Varco's financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2016, please note that some of the statements we make during this call may contain forecasts, projections, and estimates, including, but not limited to, comments about our outlook for the company's business. These are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws based on limited information as of today, which is subject to change. They are subject to risk and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially.","No one should assume that these forward-looking statements remain valid later in the quarter or later in the year. I refer you to the latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q National Oilwell Varco filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a more detailed discussion of the major risk factors affecting our business. Further information regarding these, as well as supplemental financial and operating information, may be found within our press release on our website at www.nov.com or in our filings with the SEC.","Please be aware that our use of the term EBITDA throughout the call this morning will correspond with the term adjusted EBITDA as defined in our press release. We also use other non-GAAP measures as described in our press release. On a U.S. GAAP basis for the second quarter of 2016, National Oilwell Varco reported revenues of $1.72 billion and a net loss of $217 million or $0.58 per share.","Now, let me turn the call over to Clay.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Loren. In the second quarter of 2016, National Oilwell Varco did post revenues of $1.7 billion, down 21% from the first quarter and down 56% from the second quarter of 2015. Revenues declined more than expected, due mostly to offshore drilling contractors further delaying acceptance of new builds. The $26 crude oil prices we saw in February inflicted new agony on the oil field, sending second quarter expenditures further downward and driving U.S. rig counts to record lows going back seven decades.","NOV generated a loss of $0.30 per fully diluted share excluding severance, facility closure costs, and other items, totaling $0.28 per fully diluted share in the second quarter. EBITDA was $25 million for the quarter and operating loss was $153 million, excluding $117 million in other items from both. Operating cash flow was $128 million for the quarter.","Our managers continued to aggressively downsize our business to match the available market, enabling NOV to manage to decremental EBITDA leverage, ex other items, of only 22% sequentially. Our workforce was reduced 10%, and SG&A declined 16% during the quarter, solid cost reduction results in the face of continuing pricing and absorption pain.","EBITDA leverage ex other items has been 30% on the 70% revenue decline since the present cyclical downturn began. We continue to manage costs aggressively, but we're also maintaining our investment in promising new opportunities we see for our business when prosperity returns. New technology and lower costs will lead to higher incremental roles and margins for NOV in the eventual recovery, and I will speak to our efforts in both areas.","First on cost, our team is resolute in our commitment to improve efficiencies, reduce capacity, and generate higher profitability. During the second quarter, we detailed additional cost reduction steps that totaled over $400 million in annualized savings that will flow in over the next few quarters. Plans developed and actions taken during the second quarter are on top of considerable work performed already, having reduced our annual personnel cost well over $2 billion from peak levels.","Since the downturn began, we have closed or are closing over 250 facilities to reduce capacity in view of lower demand. We have also insourced work being previously outsourced to retain as many of our employees as possible and to help with absorption. Importantly, we do not believe we have sacrificed our ability to ramp up and respond to the eventual recovery.","In a moment, Jose will take you through our detailed operating results by segment, but overall we expect these specific actions to lead to modestly higher EBITDA in the third quarter on a modest decline in revenues, with more savings driving even higher EBITDA in the fourth quarter on roughly flattish sequential revenues.","Like others in our space, we believe we are seeing some isolated green shoots of activity, and we are encouraged that the North American rig counts have begun to increase. We have seen demand rise in recent weeks for certain products and services for North America: rod guides for artificial lift, solids control jobs in West Texas, drilling motor rentals, and other items.","On the other hand, our rig equipment business in many international markets continued to decline. At or near the bottom of the cycle, we see considerable crosscurrents, price pressure, and shifting mix within our business. And, frankly, we're not ready to call bottom yet.","Our near-term outlook calls for modest revenue improvements in the wellbore technologies and completion and production solutions segments, offset by another quarter of declines in our rig systems segment, which we expect to flatten thereafter. We expect rig aftermarket third quarter to be down only slightly from the second quarter.","Laser focus on efficiency is part of our DNA, and cost savings measure evolve continuously with our market outlook. Jose, Loren, and I are grateful to serve with experienced, competent business leaders, who roll up their sleeves and do the tough, grim work of downsizing when this industry demands it. Better days lie ahead for NOV, and this team will help us navigate the present storm. When it passes, we will emerge lean and tough.","The old industry has been decimated by a generational down cycle, but record low levels of rig activity will inevitably lead to production declines, higher oil prices, and higher activity. In the meantime, we plan for this to be a slow grind, and we still have a lot of swamp to traverse until we get to full recovery.","When the market turns, NOV will have used the present downturn to improve its efficiency and importantly advanced promising new initiatives for the industry we serve. This company has a diverse, robust portfolio of critical technologies the industry needs to drive better efficiencies in a low oil price world, a portfolio which we improve day by day as we continue to invest in our optionality to recovery.","We believe recovery will drive higher demand for completion tools and hydraulic fracture stimulation and pressure pumping equipment where NOV occupies market-leading positions.","Our outlook for technology proven by the share revolution is robust. Shale technologies will migrate to new basins on new continents, requiring new sophisticated Tier 1 land rigs, bits, downhole tools, and new drill pipe designs. Again, NOV occupies formidable positions in these markets.","Rising drilling efficiencies enabled by NOV's technologies will increase well counts, vis-a-vis rig counts, with fewer days of drilling required to create each new wellbore. This will spur incremental demand for well count-driven products and services like the production chokes, sand separation, and oil separation equipment, markets where NOV also occupies leading positions. And high rates of drilling per day will equal high rates of consumption of bits, tools, drill pipe, and rigs that we make per day.","We acquired Trican's completion tools business into our Completion and Production Solutions segment a couple of weeks ago, which brings promising new sliding sleeve and coil tubing frack technologies to our mix. The business plan here is simple. We can manufacture completion tools in our existing, under-absorbed facilities. We can expand sales through the 67 countries we already operate in with our existing infrastructure.","We see opportunities to add other completions technologies to our mix through M&A and organic investment. We expect application of hydraulic fracture stimulation to continue to grow in an upturn, and the acquisition enhances NOV's exposure to this trend. Drillers and service companies will bring more attention to efficient management of their assets in the upturn.","So within the Wellbore Technologies segment, we are advancing our new Track ID lifecycle management system which utilizes RFID technology to provide customers with a complete life history, including hours in service of drill pipe, BHA components, and drilling risers. Over 40,000 of these chips are in service globally, but the unpenetrated market is literally millions of components.","The system tracks, manufacturing and inspection history of each drill stream component through our inventory management system. We can install TracID RFID chips at our drill pipe and downhole tools factories or in the field. And once installed the system can automatically tally streams on every trip when used with instruments mounted in the rotary table. This makes for more efficient drilling operations, in addition to more efficient lifecycle management of assets for our customers","Operators will continue to push longer laterals and smooth the profiles, tightly geosteered within the sweet spots of the shale stratigraphy. In the first quarter, we acquired Tolteq, which brought us a mud pulse MWD system, which fits well with our BlackStar electromagnetic wave MWD system that we have offered for many years.","We are now investing to add resistivity measurements and to combine mud pulse and electromagnetic wave propagation capabilities into the same tool, thereby positioning NOV to offer a unique, low-cost MWD tool that can be used together with our new low-cost rotary steerable system that we developed and introduced earlier this year. Together, this combination will enable our directional drilling service customers to provide cost effective geosteering on longer horizontal wells.","We will be introducing a new rotating control device for managed pressure drilling in the second half of 2016, and we are investing in rental kits for the launch currently. We see more and more customers interested in rigs that are NPD ready to drill more efficiently and safely, and NOV is developing the kit to fulfill this need.","In the first quarter, we acquired a unique remote unmanned gas analysis unit that provides high speed ratio measurements up to C-5. The geo gas analyzer product transmits critical geologic data in real time, which enables operators to reduce wellsite personnel to lower costs. This fits well with the rig instrumentation business that we had been engaged in for decades.","Today we have three eVolve closed-loop automated drilling jobs under way, and we expect to spud two more jobs soon, with dozens more operators interested in this emerging technology. Our eVolve closed-loop drilling automation service has proven the ability to reduce spud to TD times by a third or more. Drilling programs in new basins experience learning curve effects well by well. Closed-loop automated drilling accelerates this process.","Recovery will see new green drilling crews going back to work, and our new closed-loop automated drilling service illuminates the drilling mechanics downhole and enables computers to control to surface equipment on a microsecond basis to optimize drilling performance.","The service works with our new NOVOS rig operating system, which we introduced this quarter and won our first upgrade order, and also works with our proprietary IntelliServ wired drill pipe to provide high-speed data link with downhole real-time drilling instrumentation.","NOV is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this exciting technology, given that we have the world's largest installed base of drilling equipment, the most proven stable capable rig operating system, the wire drill pipe, and experience of already having drilled hundreds of thousands of feet under our belt. Our rig of the future is here today and operating in the field with high efficiency.","Our installed base of drilling equipment also uniquely positions NOV to capitalize on big data in the oil field. We have monitored hundreds of rigs in real time around the globe for over a decade through our eHawk system. This year we launched our enhanced RIGSENTRY system, and we saw a significant increase in revenues for our subsea RIGSENTRY BOP monitoring service in the second quarter.","You may recall that we announced last quarter our success in predictive analytics. We successfully forecasted certain component failures weeks in advance based on our analysis of years of operating data. Condition-based monitoring and big data will provide step change improvements in reliability and maintenance practices for sophisticated oil field equipment, and NOV is positioned to lead the way. We are pursuing additional opportunities to host real-time remote monitoring centers in the Middle East, which will enable customers to reduce costs by permitting their experts to simultaneously monitor drilling progress across multiple rigs in real time.","Our second quarter saw rig system orders decline further, and we expect orders to remain depressed for the foreseeable future. With no new offshore rig builds on the horizon, we are investing in new products to enhance efficiency and safety of existing rigs, products that will enable drilling contractors to differentiate their rigs in a crowded marketplace.","For instance, we expect to introduce a new ROV retrievable BOP pod this year for subsea stacks, which would enable drilling contractors to replace pods on the seafloor, avoiding an expensive and time-consuming roundtrip of the stack. Drilling contractors can retrofit their stacks with this.","On land, we are set to introduce a lower guide arm product, which will work in conjunction with our existing STV racking arm on land rigs to bring further mechanization and potentially automation of pipe tripping activities. We are developing ways to improve the efficiency of contractors' existing operations by, for example, exploring opportunities to reduce SPS costs and disruptions by using condition-based monitoring. We are working with the major classification agencies to develop a way to continuously certify drilling equipment in the field, using condition-based monitoring. It is early days, but this new model could significantly reduce drilling contractor costs and interruptions.","We were pleased to announce a few weeks ago a cooperation agreement with GE within our completion and production solutions segment to work jointly to improve costs and speed of execution on FPSO topsides projects. We are in detailed development work around integrating GE's market-leading power generation and compression capabilities with our own offering of turret mooring systems, swivel stacks, seawater piping systems, pumps, fluid processing, treatment, cranes, and deck machinery.","By reducing the number of complex interfaces between multiple vendors, NOV and GE are vastly simplifying the supply chain, jointly engineering and costing FPSO topside modules across varying sizes and capabilities, which we will offer to the marketplace by early 2017. Final designs can be refined quickly to fit specific customer field needs, reducing time to first oil, reducing complexity, and reducing costs.","NOV is unique in our considerable experience and successful execution of complex vessel construction in dozens of projects with every major shipyard around the globe. While deepwater development projects remain challenged from a returns perspective, the opportunity to pioneer new, efficient vessel construction model, together with initiatives being advanced by deepwater wellhead companies, together with subsea processing and boosting advancements, including our own Seabox technology, can materially improve the economics of developing the vast resources that have been discovered in the deepwater. Our initial plans focus on smaller FPSO vessels, targeting marginal discoveries in mature basins.","In short, NOV continues to pivot into promising technologies that will disproportionately benefit in the upturn, even as we shrink our productive capacities and reduce costs. Hydraulic fracture stimulation, completion tools, remote operations, big data, deepwater advancements, and horizontal drilling will all play key roles in supplying an energy hungry world in the 21st century.","NOV is investing both organically and through M&A in each of these areas. Brighter days lie ahead, and NOV will be there to lead the way.","To our team at NOV, let me tell you, I know these are difficult times, and I appreciate your resolve and your professionalism. We are laying the groundwork for future prosperity of the great company that you and I are blessed to be a part of. You have my heartfelt thanks. Jose?","Jose A. Bayardo - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Clay. To quickly recap our consolidated results, revenues for the second quarter of 2016 were $1.7 billion, down 21% from the first quarter and in line with the 19% sequential decline in global rig counts.","Revenues declined 23% in North America and 20% internationally as the North American and international rig counts fell 35% and 7%, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA was $25 million, down $102 million from the first quarter of 2016.","Sequential decremental EBITDA leverage was limited to 22% as efforts to resize the business and reduce our cost structure had their intended effect. Operating loss, excluding other items, was $153 million.","Looking at select other line items of the P&L, SG&A decreased by $56 million or 16% sequentially and by $125 million or 30% year-over-year. SG&A is now down $944 million on an annualized basis since the fourth quarter of 2014. Interest and other financial costs expense increased $5 million sequentially, mostly driven by incremental interest costs of approximately $2.5 million, attributable to a large capital lease we booked in late Q1, as well as other charges we do not expect to repeat next quarter. Therefore, we anticipate interest expense to be between $27 million and $28 million for Q3.","Other expense for the quarter increased $13 million sequentially, driven primarily by a greater loss on disposals and fixed assets. Our GAAP effective tax rate was 35.8% for the quarter, and our rate, excluding other items, was 41.5%. As a reminder, in the current environment, relatively small changes in the split between domestic and international results can have a disproportionate impact on our tax rates. In the third quarter, we anticipate the tax rate to be approximately 38%.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, working capital decreased $253 million from the first quarter of 2016. A decrease in working capital was primarily the result of a $247 million reduction in inventory levels, a $190 million reduction in customer financings, which is the decrease in cost in excess of billings, netted against the decrease in billings in excess of costs and customer prepayments, and a $168 million reduction in accounts receivable. The reductions in working capital were partially offset by decreases in accrued liabilities and accounts payable.","While working capital decreased by over $250 million, we continue to carry more working capital than required to support the business at today's activity levels as converting inventory and receivables to cash remains challenging in the current environment.","Cash flow from operations totaled $128 million. After deducting $77 million in capital expenditures, $19 million in dividend payments, $15 million for acquisitions, and $14 million in other items, we were essentially breakeven from a cash flow perspective for the quarter. Therefore, net debt remained mostly unchanged at approximately $1.6 billion.","During the quarter, we paid down our commercial paper by $100 million, leaving us with a balance of approximately $110 million. At June 30, 2016, we had a cash balance of $1.7 billion, $3.3 billion in total debt, and our debt-to-capitalization was 16.8%.","Our Rig System segment generated revenues of $564 million during the second quarter of 2016, down 39% sequentially from $926 million and down 71% from the $1.9 billion posted in the second quarter of 2015.","Sharp revenue declines were anticipated in the second quarter due to reduced backlogs and more projects approaching completion. However, the falloff in revenue was stronger than expected as customers who lack contracts or face pressures from operators to delay projects do what they can to defer deliveries.","Second quarter EBITDA for Rig System segment was $49 million. Efforts to resize the rig systems business and reduce the cost structure to mitigate the effects of the falloff in revenues had the intended result leading to decremental margins of only 24%. EBITDA margins fell 610 basis points to 8.7% of sales. Operating profit, excluding other items, was $30 million or 5.3% of sales.","For the second quarter, the split between offshore and land-related revenue was roughly two-thirds onshore and one-third land. New construction of offshore rigs accounted for $213 million in revenues or 12% of NOV's consolidated revenue.","New orders were down $31 million sequentially to $66 million in the second quarter, representing a 10-year low. Book-to-bill was 15% when new orders are compared to the 44 \u2013 compared to the $441 million shipped out of backlog during the quarter. Q1 bookings primarily consisted of pressure control systems and other replacement equipment.","For the third straight quarter, we received no new rig orders. Near-term demand for offshore remains almost nonexistent outside of replacement equipment. Discussions continue regarding midterm opportunities, which include one-off specialized 20-K drill ships and speculative mid-water semi-submersibles. However, we do not anticipate these orders materializing in 2016.","The land markets appear much more promising as conversations with customers in North America, the Middle East, and certain other international markets are increasing regarding equipment upgrades and new field opportunities. More and more, operators are demanding modern, pad optimal, Tier 1 AC rigs for potential upcoming projects, and contractors are seeking to upgrade and expand their capabilities in order to position themselves to capture incremental market opportunities.","While offshore opportunities will remain limited for the foreseeable future, we believe our land business will bottom in Q3 and begin to recover as we enter 2017. We continue to work diligently on restructuring and resizing the business for anticipated future volumes.","Our focus is on standardizing processes, optimizing structures, and eliminating all redundancies in our global operations. This focus is designed to ensure the flexibility and agility needed to respond to recovery of significantly reduced costs in lead times.","We anticipate revenue out of backlog will fall another $81 million in the third quarter to $360 million and anticipate an 18% to 20% falloff in total segment revenue, as we continue to work off our backlog on existing projects.","Decremental margins should be in the low 20% range as we expect normal decrementals to be partially offset by $15 million in cost savings, resulting from more efforts to cut costs and improve efficiencies as we restructure the business.","Our Rig Aftermarket segment generated $643 million in revenue during the second quarter of 2016, down 7% from $391 million in Q1 of 2016 and down 45% from $657 million in the second quarter of 2015.","EBITDA for the segment was $73 million or 20.1% of sales, down 11% sequentially and down 55% from the prior year. EBITDA decremental leverage was limited to 33% as cost controls were able to partially offset the decline in total revenue and an unfavorable mix shift as sales of spare parts continue to decline, while lower margin service and repair work began to improve.","Operating profit, excluding other items, was $67 million or 18.4% of sales. Spare parts sales continued to decline during the second quarter; however, bookings on spares began to solidify as we entered the third quarter. Customers have depleted existing inventories and are now getting to the point to where they must order new parts in order to support their existing operations.","Service and repair work rebounded during the second quarter as reactivations in the U.S. began to take place and the number of special periodic survey projects increased by 30%. While the number of projects and associated revenue are increasing, strained customers continue to reduce the scope of projects and associated purchases as much as possible.","Our condition-based monitoring services continue to gain traction and deliver value for our customers. Our RIGSENTRY service, which was introduced last quarter, identified potential failures of subsea BOPs before they occurred on four separate occasions, potentially saving our customers millions of dollars in unplanned downtime.","Operational success is driving commercial success as our monitoring service revenues increased by over 50% during the quarter. We expect the pace of stacking offshore rigs will continue to accelerate, a difficult process which will ultimately help rebalance an oversupplied market.","In the current environment, rig aftermarket remains focused on providing industry-leading OEM parts, service, and support that we have delivered over the years to take care of our customers' operating needs anywhere in the world. We also continue to partner with our customers to develop innovative solutions for their most pressing needs.","Today, our customers cannot afford extra downtime and need to be optimally positioned to capitalize on any new opportunities. As previously noted, we are seeing strong demand for our condition-based monitoring solutions, which allow contractors to predict failures and address problems before they occur.","We are also seeing growing demand for other recently introduced offerings designed to address the stress our customers are under in the current environment. Some of these offerings include in-field certification services, for which we travel to rigs anywhere in the world to provide required certifications on active locations, resulting in substantially reduced downtime, rig performance services in which we assess and review a customer's equipment to identify opportunities for improving operational efficiencies and minimizing downtime, and storage preservation and reactivation services, which lowers the cost of stacking equipment and enables faster reactivation of rigs, creating a competitive advantage for contractors in securing new contracts.","Notwithstanding the remaining challenges in the offshore space, conversations with our customers leave us cautiously optimistic that we are at or near a bottom for our rig aftermarket business. While we anticipate a tepid near-term recovery, driven by reactivation-related business in the U.S. and pent-up demand for offshore parts, service, and repair work, we could still see revenue decline in the third quarter by a couple hundred basis points. We also anticipate realizing roughly $5 million in cost savings during the third quarter, which should more than offset decrementals associated with the revenue decline.","Our Wellbore Technologies segment generated $511 million in revenue during the second quarter, down 19% sequentially from $631 million and down 47% sequentially from the $956 million in the second quarter of 2015. Revenue mix by destination was 43% North America and 57% international.","North America revenue declined 24% compared to the 35% decline in rig count, and international revenue fell 13%, exceeding the decline in the international rig count as drilling activity in the Middle East registered its sharpest decline since this down cycle began. EBITDA was $1 million, down $42 million from the previous quarter and $156 million from the prior year. Sequential EBITDA decrementals were 35%. The segment reported an operating loss, excluding other items, of $96 million for the quarter","Throughout this cycle, we have been intensely focused on what we can control. We aggressively pursued the declining number of business opportunities that were available and continued to invest in and drive innovation with our customers' interests at heart, meaning our focus is on improving oil field efficiencies by reducing time and costs while improving well productivity.","We have also been relentlessly focused on resizing the organization, lowering our cost structure, and optimizing our processes. Additionally, we have repositioned our people and operations to focus on the customers and basins around the world which we believe will be the most active throughout the next cycle. These actions have taken place across all four of our operating segments and all 15 business units. But today I will highlight a few representative examples from within our Wellbore Technologies segment.","In our dynamic drilling solutions business, we have streamlined our operations, enhanced relationships with old and new customers, and we continue to execute well with our legacy offerings. We recently displaced a primary competitor across the fleet of one of the largest private rig contractors in North America with our data acquisition and information management systems.","Additionally, we have continued investing in delivering innovative solutions to better serve the current needs of our customers, including, one, building out capabilities and executing revenue generating contracts associated with real-time drilling data acquisition, visualization, and optimization technologies; two, delivering substantial drilling improvements for customers with our eVolve optimization and closed-loop drilling automation services; three, introducing a new MWD tool; and, four, introducing our geo gas analyzer, the first patented Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, specifically designed to provide real-time gas ratio analysis for formation hydrocarbon identification.","In our drilling and intervention business, in addition to launching a number of literally groundbreaking technologies such as our rotary steerable tool, and multiple innovative new drill bits and motors, we have substantially improved our product development and manufacturing capabilities.","Investments made in streamlining processes, leading edge manufacturing equipment, and repositioning operations have us well positioned for the future. Changes implemented in our drill bit business have reduced the time it takes to take a new drill bit design from concept to finished product down to six weeks from over 16 weeks as recently as a year ago. These changes will also allow us to reach prior peak volumes with a 25% lower head count and will allow us to maintain substantially lower inventory levels, reducing working capital and the potential for obsolescence.","In our field service-related operations, we have numerous examples of how we have repositioned our assets and our personnel to become much more intimate with our customers, focused on regions that will be the most active in the future. Our Wellsite Services Business has added to the capabilities in Argentina, which positions us well for the anticipated long-term ramp in activity within the Vaca Muerta field.","Here recently an operator utilized our Wellsite Service Business Unit's PETROS fluid system and solids control services in addition to a myriad of other NOV products and equipment to drill the deepest horizontal well yet in the Loma Campana block of the Vaca Muerta field.","Circling back to our drilling and intervention business, we have reduced the average turnaround time for repairing bits and redressing motors in certain key basins around the world, including the Permian, from three weeks to one week, by expanding our field service and repair facilities. This type of improvement significantly enhances our ability to take care of our customers and reduces inventory requirements. As you can tell, we haven't simply reacted to a sharply deteriorating market over the past six quarters. We have and will continue to play offense.","In May, the U.S. land rig count was down 80% from the prior peak, and the past two quarters have had successive declines of approximately 20%, but it appears things have begun to stabilize, at least within the North American marketplace. While there is cautious optimism about rigs getting back to work, the extent of declines have induced a level of trauma that likely delays a meaningful recovery until next year.","For the third quarter, we expect our Wellbore Technologies segment's top line to increase a couple hundred basis points with mid-30% incremental EBITDA margins. We also expect to realize an additional $15 million benefit in Q3 due to our ongoing cost-cutting and operational efficiency initiatives.","Our Completion and Production Solutions segment generated $538 million in revenue during the second quarter, down 4% sequentially from $558 million, and down 38% from $873 million recognized in the second quarter of 2015. EBITDA was $57 million or 10.6% of sales, an increase of $9 million from the previous quarter, but down $91 million from the prior year. The segment reported operating profit, excluding other items, of $5 million for the quarter.","EBITDA improved on lower revenue, due to cost-cutting initiatives, operational efficiencies, and strong improvements in our subsea business as the operation benefited from high absorption in both of its manufacturing facilities and executed well on existing orders. We took in $269 million of new orders, down $59 million sequentially, and shipped $333 million in revenue from backlog, resulting in an 81% book-to-bill. The segment ended the quarter with a backlog balance of $947 million, $47 million lower than the prior period.","While our subsea business had strong levels of activity this quarter and our plants should remain busy through at least year-end, the outlook for offshore-related projects remains challenging and pricing pressures persist. These challenges extend into other offshore-oriented businesses, including our floating production operations, where there is limited visibility into additional projects outside of our existing backlog for the remainder of the year.","We do, however, remain optimistic regarding midterm prospects as we continue to have strong dialogue regarding FPSO opportunities with customers. And our new relationship with GE is contributing towards rapidly advancing our efforts to engineer and offer integrated topside solutions with standardized interfaces, which should materially improve the economics of deepwater production development.","With the average price for WTI still hovering below $50 a barrel during the quarter, new order intake remains soft. While certain operators have slightly increased activity related to working down the inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells in the U.S., it has not yet translated into an increase in activity for our well intervention and stimulation business and other completion-related offerings. But conversations regarding the plans to step up activity have increased.","Additionally, we are seeing slight increases in production and infrastructure-related offerings, something we see as a good indication operators are preparing to get back to work as they cannot complete wells without having the production infrastructure in place.","For the third quarter, we expect revenue to increase around 10% as we execute on certain large projects booked earlier in the year and see continued improvement in our production-related businesses. We should see 30% incrementals on the increase in revenue, and we expect to realize an additional $10 million benefit from the ongoing cost savings and efficiency enhancing initiatives which are occurring across the segment.","While market conditions have proved challenging through the first half of 2016, we have been able to generate cash flow from operations of approximately $750 million, more than twice the amount produced during the first half of 2015. With a current cash balance of $1.7 billion and an undrawn capacity on our credit facility of $4.4 billion, we have total liquidity in excess of $6 billion. So from a financial standpoint, NOV is very well-positioned.","We hope our commentary this morning also provided you with insights into how well NOV is positioned from an operational and strategic standpoint. We are working hard to continue our long history of pioneering the critical technologies which drive the oil and gas industry, and the entire team at NOV remains laser focused on reducing our cost structure and fine-tuning our ability to execute more efficiently, regardless of the market environment.","And with that, Michelle, we'll open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, good morning.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Kurt. Good morning.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So I wanted to focus a little bit more on the rig aftermarket. You mentioned that you are starting to see some pickup in inquiries. And I just wanted to make sure I heard you correctly. Was most of the inquiries coming from the land business or is there some mix of land and offshore?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think we're really seeing a mix of both, Kurt. It's certainly active dialogue and action related to reactivations and re-mobilizations in the U.S. land market, as well as more dialogue and more action related to service and repair-related activities offshore, as well as some reactivations that have been taken place in the Gulf.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Great. And then I was also wondering, as you guys are always very active in potential M&A, do you feel like we are at an inflection point where deals could start to get done and bid-ask spreads have kind of narrowed?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we do, Kurt. In 2015, we had a lot of conversations underway, but not many closings as valuations continued to move downward. I think as we entered 2016 we're starting to see, I think, counterparties that are really coming to grips with the very, very tough market we all find ourselves in. And so that's helped in driving bids and asks together.","And so I am actually very encouraged with the number of conversations that we have underway. We had about, I don't know, seven or eight closings, I think, so far this year, and lots of other conversations that are under way. And, as you've seen, many that we referred to in our comments on this call and in the preceding call, a lot of really interesting technologies that I think will have a lot of leverage in an up cycle.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. And then one more follow-up, maybe for you, Clay, is a lot of discussion in the marketplace, given the \u2013 it looks like the dearth of offshore drilling orders that are going to take place over potentially a multi-year period, that there's some viewpoint out in the marketplace that NOV is going to feel pressured to do a deal to kind of offset that business segment and potentially get into something a little bit different than just the manufacturing element.","I was wondering if you might be able to provide some insights on how you're thinking about the longer-term review and whether or not NOV needs to get involved in something else other than manufacturing?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, first, I would say that we don't disagree. I mean, you go back to our comments and we're kind of hunkering down for a much lower level of building in the offshore. And certainly that's been a big business for NOV over the preceding 12-plus years.","And but that's also nothing new. That narrative has been out there for a year and a half, and frankly we, since the downturn began, have been kind of preparing for a near term future that looks that way. And in view of that, we haven't jumped out there and done a great big deal. What I would tell you is I think we can get more impact from our capital by continuing to knock out these sort of bolt-on transactions that are little bit smaller.","When we examine the portfolio of acquisitions that we 've made over the preceding 20 years, we find consistently that the smaller transactions carry higher returns and lower risk. The specific examples that we've done here in the last six months have been really interesting technologies, have brought on really, really good people. The Trican team, for instance, who came in with the completion tools business, is very experienced in that space and can help us grow and build the business.","If you look back at our history over the preceding 20 years, we've done a couple of large deals, but the business units that we have today, that are mostly market leaders around the globe, were really built kind of transaction by transaction, smaller acquisitions bringing in really high quality businesses and products and technology and management teams and kind of brick by brick. And to me that's a more efficient, more workmanlike and more effective way to kind of build out global leading franchises.","And so if we see a terrific opportunity that's much larger, certainly we'll act on it. But realistically I think we can do and will do a lot of good by continuing to deploy capital through the down cycle and a lot of smaller, interesting, high-value acquisition targets.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's great color. Thanks, Clay.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Sean.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So Clay, I was hoping that maybe you could talk a little bit more about the GE partnership. There's just \u2013 seems like a lot of potential there. Is there any way you can help us size some of that potential? Maybe just a couple of different ways to think about it could be you're starting with brownfield opportunities, which makes sense, but what the cost savings could look like for the customer or time savings to first oil, things that can really drive the value on greenfield projects. And what's the potential for you all?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Sean, we \u2013 a few years ago when we sort of began to invest in the FPSO opportunity, we did a little study or actually had an industry expert do a study around the FPSO construction results for the industry. And they looked at, I want to say, a dozen or more vessels. And on average they're 35% or more over budget and more than a year late. And when you talk about delaying production that much, when we talk about those sorts of cost overrun, that's a huge inefficiency in the space.","And so in terms of the savings that this may carry, I think, realistically bring a more industrialized sort of supply chain, standardization in the design, kind of the partnership that we're forging with GE. I think, it's going to materially move the needle. Though the size of each individual project for the two of us is going to vary a lot, given the size and capabilities of the FPSO. But it can easily range well over $200 million per vessel for the larger FPSOs and beyond. And so that is exciting.","But more specifically, in terms of the near-term opportunities, the brownfield focuses, the idea here is that we can develop families of small FPSOs that really target one, two, four, five wells and make those smaller accumulations more economic. What's interesting is, you look statistically across deepwater basins, there's a lot more smaller fields than there are giant fields. And so it's a larger opportunity set, a way that a new technology, new sort of industrialized system that enables the many, many, many more smaller fields to be produced will enable GE and NOV and our shipyard partners to get up the learning curve on making these vessels. And so it seems that it will sort of grow on itself, and so we're pretty excited about that.","The other kind of element to the strategy I would also point out, is that a lot of these larger fields, some of the inefficiencies around FPSO construction stem from the fact that the view of the field changes over time. And so the forecast on production profiles and the like changes over time. So part of our idea is if we can take one of our small FPSOs and put it in a larger field and put that field under production for a year or two, the owner of that field gets a lot smarter. And it enables all parties to sort of optimize the design of the larger FPSO that might come in later and produce the field through many more wells.","So on the whole very excited about the partnership. I think GE is going to be a great partner and bring a lot to the mix.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you for all that detail. And then I guess I wanted to touch on rig systems also. Throughput has been coming in generally below expectations. Of course then that just pushes right into the right, but can you give us some more detail on what's driving that confidence stabilization exiting 2016?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sean, so yeah. We're seeing \u2013 it's obviously a very challenging environment today. There is a lot of stress and strain on the systems. We're continuing to progress all of these contracts forward and are maintaining really good relationships with both the shipyards and the drilling contractors as well. But there's certainly a tremendous amount of tension between the drilling contractors and the shipyards, and to some degree we're helping facilitate those discussions.","And so while those pressures are in place, things tend to \u2013 customers tend to want to put off acceptance of rigs, particularly for the rigs that don't have contracts in place. We still feel really good about the overall position, but, as you know, we are very cautious about making sure that we don't get over the tips of our skis in terms of the balance of sort of where we are in terms of progress payments and the amount that we have at risk. So trying to keep the overall portfolio in a positive position, and that's how we're managing the business.","Loren Singletary - Vice President-Investor & Industry Relations","Yeah. We also see, I think, as you move into 2017, I think \u2013 and Jose had this in his prepared remarks \u2013 our outlook for the land side of the business is improving, and so \u2013 and the number of conversations we have under way. Part of what we saw in the second quarter were reactivations of land rigs in North America. And we've got others, drilling contractors interested in not pulling the trigger yet on purchase orders, but interested in talking about new rigs. And then in many international markets around the globe also. So I think you're going to see our mix shift in the future \u2013 in the coming quarters a little more towards land.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. Yes. Thank you very much for the time.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Marshall Adkins with Raymond James. Your line is open please go ahead.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Morning, guys, a lot of great detail there. Appreciate that. A couple of just conflicting things, and you probably reconciled them but I just missed it. Clay, you started out saying you're not really willing to call a bottom yet, but it sounds like in a lot of your businesses you are at a bottom, probably saw it in Q2. So I just want to get a little more color. That we all know the offshore rig systems is going to be challenged for a while, but outside of that you said you were at or near bottom of rig aftermarket. Wellbore tech and completions seem like they're there, too. Am I missing something?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Marshall, I'll stress what was also in my opening remarks, which is we are seeing businesses within those segments continuing to decline, and we're seeing pricing pressures continuing to mount, particularly overseas generally. And so, again, kind of at or near bottom, a lot of crosscurrents, a lot of moving pieces. What I can tell you with a great deal of certainty, though, is that we are definitely taking costs out of these businesses, continuing to do that. And so, yeah, I hope you're right. I hope we are at bottom and maybe even have bottom in the rearview mirror on the company's business units, but not ready to jump out there and say that emphatically.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Unrelated follow-up, clearly you have capacity to expand in upturn, which we're looking for. What are going to be the bottlenecks on the way up? Is labor going to be an issue, or is there something else? I know you guys have spent a lot of time thinking about this. Is there something else we should be watching in terms of bottlenecks on the way back up?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I would say our external supply chain, which we have talked a lot about insourcing over the last year and a half and have done a lot of that, when I think back to the ramp up from 2006 onward, a lot of time and effort went into qualifying our vendors and kind of developing a supply chain that supports our operations. And, honestly, in terms of cost cutting in 2015 that was kind of the first actions that we took, was to insource more and try to keep our factories loaded. So kind of building out our supply chain once again will be challenging.","Labor will be a challenge certainly. Obviously a very painful time for this industry and for this company to lose so many talented people, and attracting those folks back or folks that can come in and kind of grow with us is going to be challenged.","But look, this is nothing new in the oil field. This is a cyclical business, and I think we've said in prior calls, one of the critical skill sets you got to have the ability to both reduce quickly in markets like this, but also the ability to grow quickly when it goes the other way. And so, frankly, we're looking forward to solving the challenges that the upturn are going to bring to us.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Pretty sure we're all looking forward to that. Thanks.","Loren Singletary - Vice President-Investor & Industry Relations","Amen.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tom Curran with FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Tom P. Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Good morning, guys.","Loren Singletary - Vice President-Investor & Industry Relations","Hey, Tom.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Tom P. Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","When it comes to the continued uptrend, the secular uptrend in completion demand intensity, the focus, understandably, tends to be on the implications for hydraulic fracturing, horsepower, and proppant consumption, primarily sand. And yet on Dover's Q2 call, they rightly reminded us that it has implications for other offerings, such as rod lift and the amount of rod consumption you'll see as average lateral lengths continue to increase. Could you give us an update on all those different offerings for you, or maybe just highlight a few where you're seeing the greatest impact of the continued uptrend in demand intensity?","Jose A. Bayardo - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure, Tom. Hey, it's Jose. I will start off on this, and then Clay can take you back. But it's a good question and I think there's \u2013 people sometimes have some misperceptions about our portfolio and product offering. But really as we see the trend that is moving forward across not just North America but all markets, that trend is related to more product-consumptive wells, more service intensive and product-consumptive wells. It's not just impacting specifically completion, what you think of as traditionally completion-related items. It really impacts the entire well construction process. So even though we are drilling much more efficiently and the rate of penetration is much, much higher, on a per footage basis the amount of tubing, bits, motors, et cetera, that you consume is remaining essentially the same on a per foot basis.","Additionally, when you are putting in the volumes of sand and proppant and all these other items, you think about the flow-back type operations, you think about production chokes and things of that nature, that's an area where we're seeing a lot of demand for our products. And I think earlier Clay touched on rod lift and the rods, where we are seeing a lot of demand and attention put on that product offering. So across our Wellbore Technologies segment, as well as some large components of our Completion Solutions segment, we're going to see a good impact from the trends that are taking place.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Specific on artificial lift, we did see a pick-up in the second quarter on rod guide application, and we did a little bit of that. Robbins & Myers brought a lot more to our Tuboscope unit within Wellbore Technologies, and we saw a pick-up in the second quarter. A lot of these shale wells are going on rod lift pretty quickly. And those products are in addition to downhole progressing cavity pumps, rotating heads, other artificial lift products that we have. And those are in addition to, as Jose just mentioned, production chokes, our dynamic oil recovery system for produced water. We have a lot of production and a growing portfolio of production equipment and processing and treatment equipment, centrifugal pumps, LACT units, those sorts of things.","So NOV, we've been quietly investing more in that area and kind of growing out that portfolio. And we would absolutely echo Dover's comments that it's not just the horsepower. It's everything else that goes with that that will benefit.","Tom P. Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","All right. Thank you for that, guys. Returning to the M&A line of questioning, if you were to consider a more sizable transaction, given your current expectations with regard to the timing and the strength of the recovery, what is the highest you would be willing to take your leverage exiting that transaction?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I am actually going to beg off answering that specifically. We have looked at larger transactions. I think my earlier answer kind of gave you a feel that it would have to be very, very compelling, and I think we would have to look at the actual opportunity and the proximity to the upturn to make the call on kind of what we would think would be an appropriate balance sheet profile going into that. So that is all very, very speculative.","But, just to state it more bluntly, I think we are mostly interested today, as we look out across a big and growing portfolio of potential M&A opportunities, in pursuing a lot of smaller critical technologies, bolt-on sort of adds that we really think are going to create the most shareholder value for our shareholders in the upturn. And again, I can't stress this enough. This is sort of how we really did build the business over the last 20-plus years, and having now moved into much more of a buyer's market, that sort of roll up your sleeves and get out there in a lot of conversations and look for opportunities to add on smaller acquisitions, I think, is the best application of capital. Conversely, to go out there and to make one larger bet on one larger transaction and sort of say, well, that's it, it's just far less appealing.","Tom P. Curran - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","All right. I appreciate the thoughts, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question will come from the line of Byron Pope with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Loren Singletary - Vice President-Investor & Industry Relations","Hi, Byron.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","I had a question about Completion and Production Solutions, and with regard to the Q3 guidance and top line being up sequentially. I would think that that would be elements of well intervention and onshore production that would lead the way, but I was just wondering, maybe Jose, if you can provide some color on what's driving that? And if you spoke to it earlier, I apologize.","Jose A. Bayardo - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No problem, Byron. It's a combination of factors. One of the items driving it is a large anticipated shipment from \u2013 related to an order in our well intervention and stimulation business. But as we also talked a little bit about, we're seeing some pretty good orders coming in and discussions related to more production-oriented equipment. So that's the primary factor associated with the pickup in revenue.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We've also seen pretty good demand on flexible pipe for Brazil as well.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, Clay, one question for you, just sticking with completion and production solutions, it seemed as though, I guess, when you all had your Analyst Day, it seems as though one of the long-term goals for that segment was this notion of integration. And it seemed as though E&P operators weren't necessarily standardizing on surface production and processing equipment. Is it your sense that during this downturn and maybe coming out of this downturn, more appropriately, E&P reception to that more standardized integrated model on the surface production side might be gaining some traction?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. If you're talking about FPSOs certainly, and I think our customers recognize their model is broken, and so there's a lot of receptivity to doing things differently there. With regards to onshore, it remains fairly fragmented. Volumes are down and so our customers, I think, are more open to buying \u2013 assembling their own packages. However, there are benefits to our customers through acquiring a little broader package of equipment when it comes to putting in processing equipment for land wells as well.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.","Jose A. Bayardo - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Byron.","Byron K.

My name is Kevin and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session with instructions given at that time.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Loren Singletary, Vice President, Investor & Industry Relations. Mr. Singletary, you may begin.","Loren Singletary - Vice President-Investor & Industry Relations","Thank you, Kevin, and welcome everyone to the National Oilwell Varco Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. With me today is Clay Williams, President, CEO, and Chairman of National Oilwell Varco; and Jose Bayardo, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin this discussion of National Oilwell Varco's financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, please note that some of the statements we make during this call may contain forecasts, projections, and estimates, including but not limited to comments about our outlook for the company's business. These are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws, based on limited information as of today, which is subject to change. They are subject to risk and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially.","No one should assume that these forward-looking statements remain valid later in the quarter or later in the year. I refer you to the latest forms 10-K and 10-Q National Oilwell Varco has on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission for more detailed discussions of the major risk factors affecting our business. Further information regarding these as well as supplemental financial and operating information may be found within our press release, on our website at www.nov.com, or in our filings with the SEC.","Later, on this call we will answer your questions, which we ask you to limit to two in order to permit more participation. Now let me turn the call over to Clay.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Loren. National Oilwell Varco faced deteriorating market conditions during the fourth quarter to cap off a very challenging year. The company reported fourth quarter net income of $85 million or $0.23 per fully diluted share, excluding other items, down from $0.61 per fully diluted share in the third quarter of 2015 on a comparable basis.","Other items included pre-tax charges of $1.6 billion in goodwill and intangible asset impairments; $139 million in restructuring inventory write-downs, severance, and facilities closures; and $7 million in FX losses in Argentina.","GAAP net loss for the quarter was $1.5 billion or $4.06 per fully diluted share.","Fourth quarter 2015 revenues were $2.7 billion, down 18% from the third quarter of 2015. Operating profit for the quarter was $141 million or 5.2% of sales. And EBITDA was $308 million or 11.3% of sales, excluding other items from both. Decremental operating leverage was 35% from the third quarter to the fourth.","Our management teams across our business units are responding quickly to lower revenues, which fell further than we expected in the fourth quarter, by reducing costs and accelerating restructuring plans, which enabled us to hold decremental leverage to 35%, ex-charges, despite the sharp volume decline and renewed intense pricing pressure we are seeing.","As we have stated for the past few quarters, our focus is to manage what we can, namely costs, while continuing to advance our longer-term strategic goals. It nevertheless remains a very challenging time for everyone in the oil and gas industry, and our visibility remains limited.","For its full year 2015 National Oilwell Varco posted a GAAP loss of $1.99 per fully diluted share, including restructuring, asset impairments, facility closure costs, and other charges of $2 billion pre-tax. Excluding these items earnings were $2.80 per fully diluted share, down 54% from $6.07 per fully diluted share earned in 2014.","Operating profit was $1.6 billion or 11.1% of revenue. And EBITDA was $2.3 billion or 15.5% of revenue for the full year, excluding charges. Decremental operating leverage was 32% from 2014 to 2015, excluding charges from both years, a commendable result in view of the severe downturn and pricing pressures we faced throughout the year. Cash flow from operations for 2015 totaled $1.3 billion with $614 million of that coming in the fourth quarter with improving working capital liquidation.","We continued to invest in our future, closing seven acquisitions through the year, which, among other benefits, enhanced our presence in Saudi Arabia, our WellSite Services offering in Asia, and brought in new composites technology. We continued developing new products with our new test rig, which we spudded at the beginning of the year. We also continued investments in the world's most promising regions, adding new facilities in Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Russia, and West Texas.","We returned $2.9 billion to shareholders in 2015 through dividends and share repurchases.","With regards to costs we were able to manage the good decremental operating leverage on our 31% decline in revenues, ex-charges, by close attention to costs and efficiency. We in-sourced tens of thousands of hours from outside suppliers to our own workforce to preserve our team wherever possible. Nevertheless our global workforce, including contract labor, declined 21% through the year. And we closed 75 facilities since mid-2014 to retrench to a smaller, more efficient footprint.","We expect restructuring will continue through the first half of 2016, perhaps longer, in view of the challenging market.","A second major decline in oil prices last year deepened and intensified late during the fourth quarter and continued throughout January, when oil traded into the high $20 range, levels not seen since 2003. This, combined with hedges rolling off for E&Ps and term contracts expiring for drilling contractors, ratcheted up financial stress on our customers and increased pricing pressure on NOV.","We believe the present level of activity is insufficient to supply the longer-term demand for oil. And note that unlike the three most recent downturns through the past 20 years, OPEC has not curtailed production to defend pricing. This has made the present downturn far more severe, but will perhaps lead to a sharper eventual recovery.","With producers pumping furiously to maximize their cash flow, the relentless march of depletion, the deferral of 68 projects representing 3 million barrels of oil per day of planned future production, and the unfolding of severe capital austerity will help bring supply and demand into balance.","But we are not planning for a recovery in 2016. Instead we will continue to manage costs to the reality of the marketplace in the short term.","Even with a rebound in oil prices it will take time for our customers to repair balance sheets, reactivate crews, and to ramp up the activity that drives our business. Each day that passes means we are a day closer to the inevitable rebound. Our plan is to emerge with new products, new business models, and new efficiencies.","Our Completion & Production Solutions segment fell 7% sequentially in the fourth quarter and posted 56% sequential decremental operating leverage, excluding restructuring and other items. Orders declined from 99% book-to-bill in the third quarter to 59% in the fourth, which led backlog down to $969 million at year end.","Strong sequential improvements in our XL Systems conductor pipe connections unit in the fourth quarter capped off a solid year for this unit with higher year-over-year margins. However, these failed to fully offset sequential double digit declines in our other products within the segment.","In North America customers delayed picking up well-stimulation equipment previously ordered. And some are now buying frac spreads at distressed pricing to use for spare parts, which further reduced sales but will ultimately help erode the equipment overhang. In North America sales of spares and consumables like coiled tubing declined with reduced activity. But the FSU in the Middle East remained comparatively strong.","Sales of composite oil field pipe declined, as the costs of competing steel flowlines have plummeted 35% or more. And our sales into the marine construction market slowed. Our value proposition for the composite pipe that we manufacture is much lower lifetime costs due to its corrosion resistance. But E&Ps under duress are opting for the lowest investment option to bring on wells and their associated cash flow.","About 20% of the segment's mix is in production equipment, pump separators and artificial lift, which also fell in the quarter as distributors slowed purchases. We have six major facility consolidations underway within this business unit, which will drive better efficiency going forward.","Within our offshore production related businesses we saw rising pricing pressure on flexible pipe, but were pleased to post a 111% book to bill, as we landed some significant orders for pre-salt applications in Brazil.","Our floating production vessel unit continues to pioneer new business models we launched a few years ago that leverage NOV's unique vessel construction capabilities to improve construction costs and reduce risks. Out new vessel concepts, which seek to accelerate production from certain types of deep-water fields, are being met with high enthusiasm from our customers so far. We are encouraged by new designs that are steadily whittling costs. But operators remain slow to sanction major deep water projects. It is nevertheless a promising target with 400 discoveries in the offshore.","Our wellbore technology segment revenues fell 9% sequentially in the fourth quarter and posted 69% sequential decremental operating leverage, which resulted in a negative 4.1% operating margin, excluding restructuring and other items. EBITDA margins were 9% for the segment, ex other items.","Two-thirds of the sequential decline in revenue came from North America, where operators stacked major drilling programs, intensifying pricing pressures and reducing volumes. Rentals of solids control equipment, rig instrumentation, and downhole equipment declined at high variable margins. Nevertheless we were able to increase share in our bits business, owing to new tectonic designs, which we are successfully packaging with our ERT drilling motors.","In the FSU we expect to begin production in our downhole tools facility at our new Kostroma plant within a few weeks to supply the local market, which along with Asia posted higher sequential revenues in the fourth quarter. Latin America saw a significant decline for the segment across Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina.","Our Tuboscope pipe coating business held up well through the quarter on drill pipe strength in China, but pipe mill inspection activity in North America declined with nine months of casing on the ground, the highest level of inventory seen since the 1980s. Rising activity around tubing, pipeline, and line pipe helped offset this somewhat. But we are even seeing work-over activity fall in West Texas, which is unusual. Prior downturns have seen work-over activity hold up better owing to quick paybacks.","Drill pipe sales increased modestly from the third quarter into the fourth quarter but still remain low and under price pressure. Growing operator interest in closed-loop automated drilling technology drove higher revenues for our IntelliServ Wired Drill Pipe unit in the fourth quarter to produce solid year-over-year improvements for the group. This innovative service grew six-fold in 2015 as compared to 2014. And we have lots of interests from E&Ps, as well as drilling contractors eager to differentiate their rigs by enabling high speed data transmission from the bottom of the hole through their drill pipe.","Our Rig Aftermarket segment posted flat sequential revenues, but margins fell due to mix. A decline in spare parts sales was offset by higher repair revenues, which came in at lower margins partly due to rising discounts to win repair work. As rigs come down, particularly onshore, they're being cannibalized for parts, impacting our spares business for the quarter.","SPS activity on offshore rigs rolled over in the fourth quarter but remains active nonetheless. The Rig Aftermarket segment is actively working on about 40 projects, either underway or in the bidding stage. But these are fluid, as drilling contractors are curtailing scope or in some instances electing not to proceed with an SPS without a clear line of sight on a contract for the rig.","Service and repair work in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico improved sequentially for Rig Aftermarket. And BOP repair work in the Middle East remained strong.","Rig Systems revenues fell 32% at 24% decrementals in the fourth quarter, driven by sharply lower shipments out of backlog. Customers are delaying acceptance of uncontracted new builds to avoid stacking costs and to slow their CapEx, as they face falling day rates and utilization as their contracts roll off.","Revenues from new offshore rig construction fell to about 20% of our consolidated revenue mix in the fourth quarter. We are working closely with our shipyard customers to navigate challenges and requests for delays and to improve our collections. But these situations remain fluid. At this point we expect revenues out of backlog for all of 2016 to total about $2.1 billion or $2.2 billion. Rig Systems saw a 76% decline in new orders in the fourth quarter, which fell to $89 million and totaled $1 billion for the full year.","Quoting activity plummeted late in the year. And while we still see interest for new land rigs for the Middle East and some other selected markets, we expect orders to again be very low for the first quarter. Importantly we expect the land rig market to eventually resume its efforts to retool to more efficient AC technology. But the fourth quarter downturn in day rates for Tier 1 rigs will certainly delay that trend.","As we disclosed in December we reached a confidential settlement with one of our shipyard customers in Brazil to cancel seven floating rigs being constructed there, which reduced our backlog by nearly $1.2 billion and led to a year-end backlog of $6.1 billion for all of Rig Solutions segment. At year end that backlog includes $1.75 billion for the remaining 15 rigs across three shipyards in Brazil. I would stress that the situation in Brazil with regards to these remains uncertain and continues to evolve, owing to the failure of our shipyard customer to secure long-term financing for these projects. We suspended work within two of these remaining three shipyards early last year. And we are in discussions with all three yards regarding the resolution of their programs. We recognized only $10 million in revenues from the remaining new build rigs in Brazil during the fourth quarter of 2015.","As we wrap up a challenging year in 2015, we recognize we are facing increasing headwinds in 2016. But we also recognize that extraordinary opportunities will arise as a result of the stress our industry is under.","I'm pleased with the execution of our experienced leaders, who are cutting costs and improving efficiency, but also continuing to advance our long-term strategic initiatives, like closed-loop automated drilling opportunities, which we expect to grow in 2016; new FPSO business models and designs to improve deep-water economics; and new products to improve drilling operations, completion techniques, and more profitable production.","Our E&P customers' business models simply don't work in this low oil price environment. And therein lies the opportunity for NOV to once again pioneer new, more efficient ways of extracting oil and gas to reduce their cost.","Importantly NOV represents a diverse portfolio of market leaders that participate in every major oilfield market around the globe.","If we examine the major global sources of oil, which make up the 90-plus million barrels of oil per day global industry, we see 10 million barrels of oil per day coming out of \u2013 each of Saudi Arabia and Russia, both areas where we have invested heavily through the past few years, with our investments continuing to support relatively high levels of activity.","Another 10 million barrels of oil per day comes from the Gulf states, where again we are expanding our presence. And the oilfield remains comparatively busy.","Nearly 10 million barrels per day has been achieved from deep-water production, where we have benefited disproportionately from the deep-water and offshore rigs we had built and expect to pioneer better methods of production in the future.","Another 10 million barrels per day roughly comes from North America, which is dominated by shale production techniques.","Each of these major productive areas has been enabled by NOV technology. And we continue to help our customers adapt to lower oil prices across them all. NOV remains well-positioned globally for when the eventual recovery comes, wherever it shows up first.","Our leading market positions have been assembled through a combination of organic investments and acquisitions. And we're actively pursuing several targets now. It has been challenging and sometimes frustrating to reach agreement with potential sellers. But as the downturn lengthens, everybody in this space is becoming a lot more realistic. We remain patient and disciplined on values and realistic in our outlook, as the option value of our capital flexibility steadily rises.","I am pleased that NOV has the balance sheet and financial resources to pursue these. But I am more pleased that we have tough, capable, experienced managers who can skillfully integrate acquisitions and execute our business plans.","To all the NOV employees I congratulate you for navigating such a challenging year in 2015. And I thank you for your contributions in building such a strong enterprise. We have a tough road ahead. But we are laying the groundwork for our future success. Jose?","Jose A. Bayardo - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Clay. I'll next provide some additional detail on our segment operating results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015 and provide some commentary on the near-term outlook.","Our Rig Systems segment generated revenue of $1.0 billion, down 32% from the $1.5 billion earned last quarter and down 60% from the $2.6 billion generated in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the fourth quarter the split between offshore and land-related revenue was 73% and 27% respectively.","Revenue out of backlog was $843 million, down 35% sequentially. As Clay indicated sliding delivery schedules and limited new order intake have contributed to the decline in revenue. You may recall that in the first quarter of 2015 we announced we were negotiating certain customer requested delivery delays for offshore new build rigs. Although not our first choice, modifying delivery schedules allowed us to better manage our cost structure and level-loading across our operations, as we began sizing our business to support reduced levels of demand.","The success of our cost management measures are seen in our decremental operating profit margins, which were 23.9% on a 32% sequential revenue decline and which were 22.7% on a 60% year-over-year revenue decline.","Fourth quarter operating profit for the Rig Systems segment was $160 million, yielding operating margins of 15.8%, down 260 basis points from Q3. EBITDA was $184 million or 18.1% of sales. And EBITDA margins decreased 200 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2015.","During the fourth quarter we received $89 million in new orders, resulting in a book-to-bill of 10%. Q4 bookings were composed entirely of discrete pieces of capital equipment, as we received no new rig orders in the quarter.","Bookings included top drives and blowout preventers for international land rigs, and cranes for offshore construction vessels. We ended the quarter with a backlog of $6.1 billion, down 24% sequentially, of which approximately 89% is for the offshore market and 92% is destined for international markets.","As Clay mentioned in his commentary, our customers are under increasing pressures related to falling day rates and utilization associated with the cyclical downturn. Our global portfolio of offshore rig equipment contracts typically incorporate a significant down payment and progress payments, which minimize our working capital investments throughout the life of the agreement.","While we do not expect meaningful charges from potential future breaches of contracts, cancellations, or other similar issues, the impact would vary, dependent upon the specific contract, timing of the event, and other circumstances.","For full year 2015 Rig Systems generated revenue up $7 billion, down 29% in comparison to 2014 as slowing project progressed and declining orders drove revenue out of backlog down $2.6 billion from the $8.7 billion earned in 2014.","With a resolute focus on execution and a commitment to continued cost reductions, Rig Systems generated $1.4 billion in full year EBITDA and maintained EBITDA margins just over 20%, despite revenues declining almost 30% over the same period. Full year 2015 operating profit was $1.3 billion or 18.9% of revenue, down 140 basis points from the previous year, representing decremental leverage at 23.5%.","As we move into the first quarter of 2016 at this point we expect Rig Systems revenue decline in the high single digit percentage range and revenue out of backlog to decrease to around $775 million. But I'll stress that our visibility remains limited. We plan to deliver on our current backlog, while continuing to resize the business aggressively to meet a much lower level of demand. We are actively scaling facilities to single shifts, consolidating locations, and implementing other cost-control initiatives. Despite these efforts reduced volumes will work against us. And we anticipate some margin erosion on lower activity levels and continued delays in the range of 200 basis points to 300 basis points.","Declining energy prices will negatively impact our order book for the foreseeable future. And we expect new orders for large equipment packages, both on- and off-shore, to remain low. We continue to win in the marketplace due to our commitment to technology, capacity, and operational service and support. But orders are scarce. As such we do not expect this quarter's bookings to improve materially from the fourth quarter.","Our Rig Aftermarket segment generated $569 million of revenue during the fourth quarter of 2015, roughly flat sequentially and down 33% year over year from a record $850 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Customers curtailed spending, as rig utilization declined in both land and offshore markets. Land-related sales were approximately 21% of total segment revenue, down slightly from 22% in Q3, but up on a percentage basis from 18% in the fourth quarter of 2014.","EBITDA for the segment was $135 million or 23.7% of sales. And operating profit was $127 million or 22.3% of sales, down 330 basis points from last quarter on higher proportion of lower margin service and repair work, as well as incremental pricing pressure on repair and selected spare parts.","Overall, 2015 results reflected an increasingly uncertain environment, in which our drilling contractor customers reduced spending in an effort to preserve liquidity. Throughout the year our customers chose to deplete existing spares inventories, rather than pursue new. And did de minimis repair work and maintenance on their rig fleets, deferring more expansive work except where absolutely necessary.","For the full year Rig Aftermarket generated revenue of $2.5 billion, down 22% from a record in 2014. For full year EBITDA was $647 million or 25.7% of revenue, down 250 basis points from 2014. And 2015 operating profit was $617 million or 24.5% of sales, down 290 basis points from the prior year.","Looking into the first quarter of 2016 we expect Rig Aftermarket will see revenues decline in the mid to upper teens percent range.","Due to the seasonal nature of the Aftermarket business we typically expect lower activity with a better mix of spares to service and repair work in the first quarter than in the fourth. However, we anticipate a steeper than usual decline in Q1, reflecting current market conditions. Although reducing costs will be at the forefront of our response efforts, pricing pressure may push margins around 100 basis points lower in the first quarter.","Longer term we believe our Rig Aftermarket segment will be a strong early cycle beneficiary of the eventual recovery. We believe drillers will rush to return to suboptimally maintained, stacked, and partially cannibalized rigs to proper operating condition, once they gain confidence that the market has reached a bottom, and they see early indications of a recovery.","For the fourth quarter of 2015 the Wellbore Technologies segment generated revenues of $757 million, down 9% sequentially from $834 million and down 50% from a record $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014. Reduced drilling activity negatively impacted all of our businesses within this segment. Average rig counts declined by 13% sequentially in the U.S., 9% in Canada, and 2% internationally. And segment revenue by geography closely mirrored the sequential fall in rig count.","Pricing pressure continued into the fourth quarter across most all product lines. For the fourth quarter of 2015 EBITDA was $68 million or 9% of revenue, down 530 basis points from last quarter. And the segment posted an operating loss of $31 million.","For the full year 2015 Wellbore Technologies generated revenue of $3.7 billion, down 35% in comparison to 2014, consistent with the year over year average decline in global rig count. 2015 EBITDA for the segment was $562 million or 15.1% of revenue, down from 26% in 2014. And operating profit was $162 million for 2015 or 4.4% of sales, as the speed of activity and revenue decline outpaced our reduction efforts.","Like our Rig Aftermarket business, we expect our Wellbore Technologies segment to be an early cycle beneficiary of the eventual recovery. However, near term we have limited visibility and the activity driven nature of the business contributes to variability. Just four weeks into 2016 U.S. rig count is down 18% from the average in Q4 of 2015. So we expect revenues to fall 8% to 10% with decremental margins in the 40% range.","We continue our efforts to optimize our Wellbore Technologies segment, resizing our business to meet lower levels of demand, improving our manufacturing processes to become more efficient on a lower cost base, and shortening our commercialization processes to bring new value-adding technologies to market.","Our Completion & Production Solutions segment generated revenues of $746 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, down 7% sequentially and 44% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Businesses related to onshore completion and production were some of the most negatively impacted, with customers delaying receipt of finished orders, as operators' inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells rose in response to commodity price declines.","EBITDA for the segment was $86 million or 11.5% of sales. And operating profit for the segment was $34 million, resulting in operating margins of 4.6%, down 330 basis points sequentially and 1,160 basis points year over year, as a result of lower volumes and pricing pressure.","During the quarter Completion & Production Solutions received orders of $272 million, down $194 million or 42% sequentially, as a substantial flexible pipe order won in the third quarter did not repeat. We recognized $460 million of revenue out of backlog, resulting in a book-to-bill of 59%. Segment ended the quarter with a backlog balance of $969 million, of which approximately 75% is offshore and 87% is destined for international markets.","For full year 2015 the segment generated revenue of $3.4 billion, down 28% in comparison to 2014, as revenue out of backlog declined $501 million or 20% and non-backlog revenue decreased 37% from 2014 to $1.3 billion. Full year EBITDA was $507 million or 15.1% of revenue, down 480 basis points from 2014. Operating profit was $286 million or 8.5% of revenue in comparison to $700 million and 15.1% in 2014, representing decremental leverage of 32.3%.","Record or near record margin in some of our offshore production-related businesses, including flexibles and large-diameter XL Systems conductor pipe connections, were overshadowed by lower year-over-year contributions from our higher-margin intervention and stimulation equipment businesses, given reduced demand for hydraulic stimulation, oil tubing, and wireline capital equipment and consumables.","With oil at 12-year lows orders for new capital equipment will remain challenged, as we move into the first quarter of 2016. Opportunities that do emerge will face continued pricing pressure. As a result we anticipate revenues will decrease by approximately 15%, and expect revenue out of backlog to fall to the $350 million to $370 million range. We anticipate decremental operating leverage in the 30% to 35% range.","Now let's discuss some additional detail regarding our consolidated financial results. Working down the consolidated statement of income for the fourth quarter of 2015, gross margin declined 210 basis points to 19.1%. SG&A increased $25 million or 7% sequentially, due in large part to increases in bad debt and other year-end related items, which more than offset overhead reductions.","Despite the slight sequential increase we reduced SG&A 28% year over year, which translates into an annualized cost savings of approximately $600 million. Other items for the quarter equaled $1.8 billion and resulted primarily from goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset write-downs of $1.6 billion, and restructuring and other charges of $139 million.","EBITDA was $308 million or 11.3% of sales. Net interest expense remained flat with the third quarter. And equity income was a loss of $3 million, as demand for OCTGs or Green Tubing associated with our Voestalpine joint venture remains muted, given the low demand for new drill pipe.","Other expense for the quarter decreased $3 million sequentially to $17 million. And the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of other items, was 18.7%, affected by a taxable loss in the U.S. and taxable income in foreign jurisdictions, among other things.","Net income, excluding other items, was $85 million or $0.23 per fully-diluted share. Working capital, excluding cash and debt, totaled $5.5 billion at December 31, 2015, down $422 million from the prior quarter. And we generated a total of $614 million in cash flow from operations.","After dividend payments of $173 million, investments in our business of $136 million, and FX impact on our cash balances and other items totaling $18 million, we were able to decrease our net debt position by $287 million during the quarter.","We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.1 billion, $4 billion in debt, and our net debt to capitalization was 11.2%. We also have $3.6 billion of undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facility.","Overall 2015 was a challenging year under the backdrop of market uncertainty, falling energy prices, declining drilling activity, and reduced customer spending. In spite of these conditions NOV generated $1.3 billion in cash flow from operations, bought back $2.2 billion in our shares, paid out cash dividends of $710 million to our shareholders, invested over $450 million in organic growth opportunities, and completed seven acquisitions for approximately $85 million, all while preserving a very strong balance sheet.","2016 will prove to be another challenging year. However, the actions we took during 2015 have positioned us well to weather the storm and capitalize on opportunities we identified during this down cycle.","Now let me turn it back to Clay.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Jose. I think at this point we're ready to open it up to questions, Kevin.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We're now beginning the question-and-answer session. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Our first question comes from Marshall Adkins with Raymond James.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Morning, guys. Thanks, Clay. Obviously the industry, these oil prices coming to a screeching halt. I'm curious. How do you balance the massive cost cutting that you seem to be doing with the ability to meet a recovering market in 2017 and 2018? How much cutting is too much?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And I guess the corollary to that is, I presume we should expect margins to continue to decrease through the year. At what point in time do we stabilize?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's a great question, Marshall. We were hoping to find stability early 2016. And then oil headed down another $10. And all the E&Ps are coming out with sharply lower CapEx forecasts than we had been planning for. So things remain fluid.","But to your original question, what's the right balance? I got to tell you, one of the really necessary skill sets in oilfield services for those of us that have been in it a while is the ability to flex up sharply when called upon and flex down sharply when called upon.","And the good news for NOV is we have a very experienced management team running our business units around the globe. They know how to do this. We've been called on in the past to double and triple and quadruple production over a short period of time. And we successfully navigated that very well and maximized the profitability and returns through that.","This is the flip side of that. As orders fall away, as spending comes to the screeching halt, we have to cut costs in lock step. So I have an abundance of confidence in the capabilities of this team to do both, to respond to this market that's slowing down dramatically, as well as speed up and flex upwards when we're eventually called upon to do that.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. One unrelated follow-up. Obviously M&A is a focus here with things coming back. That's always been your strength. How is that market looking? And what geographic areas \u2013 I mean generically. I don't want you to give away anything.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","But where are you going to focus acquisitions?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well we're in an enviable position I think of going into such a sharp downturn with a very strong balance sheet. To recap some of the liquidity items that Jose mentioned just a moment ago, a $2.1 billion cash balance; a $5.5 billion of working capital, which has begun liquidating; a $3.6 billion revolving line of credit. So we have a lot of capital flexibility. We stepped up our efforts, as we talked about on prior calls, to be very vigorous in looking for opportunities that \u2013 to deploy capital in what we see as becoming more of a buyer's market. And so we're pretty excited about that and have a lot of flexibility to pursue those.","As you know we really fundamentally pursue competitive advantage and really fundamentally pursue evolving trends that we see in the oilfield as attractive areas to deploy capital.","So specifically I think in my comments just a moment ago, I mentioned places like Saudi Arabia, which is committed to increasing activity. And they want more local content. We talked a lot in the past about areas like the FSU, where we've done more organic investment than acquisitions. But that's an area of interest.","Argentina, the excitement around the Vaca Muerta Shale, which was down in the Q4. But longer term we're pretty excited about the potential there. Those are the sorts of things that we look to, to be potentially interesting when it comes to potential M&A targets.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That's helpful. Thanks, guys.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thank you, Marshall.","Jose A. Bayardo - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Sanchez with Howard Weil.","William Sanchez - Scotia Howard Weil","Thanks. Good morning.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Bill.","Jose A. Bayardo - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning, Bill.","William Sanchez - Scotia Howard Weil","Clay, I was curious \u2013 or perhaps, Jose, just given what appears to be kind of I guess accelerating deferrals here of Rig Systems orders, I get \u2013 both offshore and onshore. You've laid out a revenue range out of backlog for 2016. I know you fell short of your view in 4Q. Well just your level of confidence, Clay, right now, given what seems like the further deterioration in terms of being able to recognize that level of backlog revenue if you will.","And if you have pretty high confidence on that and given the cost reductions you've continued to make in Rig Systems, do you have any visibility in terms of when possibly a margin trough level could occur? And at what level that could be?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Bill, I'm hesitant to give guidance beyond what we just did, given that the situation is pretty fluid like we mentioned in our comments. We were disappointed in the fourth quarter that the revenue out of backlog fell so sharply. It fell about $460 million sequentially out of Rig Systems, a couple hundred million short of what our expectations were for the fourth quarter. And that's due precisely to what you highlighted with regards to drilling contractors really getting more aggressive on trying to delay acceptance of rigs and pushing back.","As you know the food chain that we work within, drilling contractors sign up for the construction of these new rigs. The shipyards are their customers. And then we work for the shipyards.","We've been very diligent over the years about demanding very strong contracts, very strong down payments, progress billings, and the like. But given our focus on monetizing the profit in that backlog, we have slowed our progress on revenue out of backlog to sort of match \u2013 better match payments and to minimize our working capital exposure in those programs. So that's kind of what you saw in the fourth quarter, is we slowed down that revenue recognition out of backlog. But on the \u2013 ultimately it's really caused by a lot of drillers trying to delay acceptance of rigs. A couple of situations I think have been made public, and a couple of situations are \u2013 remain a little tense.","Contributing to that was the one shipyard we continued working for in Brazil also slowed in the fourth quarter. I mentioned in my call that we only did $10 million in revenue out of Brazil. And so progress on that particular program slowed as well. So really across the board things have slowed down. It remains fluid. We've haircut our guidance for revenue out of backlog into Q1. And are working to respond to the market kind of week by week as we see things unfolding.","William Sanchez - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay. Thanks for that. Just curious on Rig Aftermarket, Clay. You had a very resilient 4Q on the top line. And I know we've got a pretty significant guide down for 1Q in terms of revenue expectations. Just where do we go from here in that business? I guess and what's a bogey you would tell us to kind of use to think about overall top lines when we think 2016 versus 2015 potential declines? Is there something we should be looking at that could help us gauge where that could go? And is there something in 1Q that would suggest, just given the significant decline, that 2Q actually could stabilize a bit from 1Q? Or how do we think about that?","Jose A. Bayardo - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I...","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well...","Jose A. Bayardo - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I can jump in first.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Jose A. Bayardo - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Bill, on the guidance regarding Q1. Basically as we talked about on the last conference call, and I think has been mentioned before, Q4 often sees an uptick, a meaningful uptick in service and repair related revenue. And we certainly saw that during the year \u2013 during the quarter, offset by a continued decline in orders for higher margin spare parts.","As we go into Q1, essentially during the course of Q4 we saw obviously a quick deterioration in a number of the product offerings, spare parts included. And so we're expecting a good fall off, not only in that sort of seasonal associated service and repair work, but also a continuing fall off in spares.","As I mentioned in my commentary this is a business that we're certainly excited about for the future, as it is tightly tied to the front end of the cycle. And we really do believe that once there are some glimmers of hope out there, things stabilize a little bit, our customers can call bottom, and start seeing any sort of optimism to gain some confidence. There will be a rush to deliver new orders, and which will result in a nice pickup for us.","The exact timing of that is really difficult to say. We're obviously in an environment where there's very little near-term visibility. But again we are confident about the prospects for that business when things rebound.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Bill, worth pointing out too. You've seen probably three or four steady quarters of drillers beating estimates, land and offshore, and pointing to lower costs. And they consistently have lower costs in guidance.","Well their lower costs equal our lower Rig Aftermarket revenues. They slow down spare parts purchases. They're, as we talked about before, cannibalizing. They're deferring maintenance wherever possible. I think it's safe to say that no piece of capital equipment across the oilfield globally is being well maintained right now.","And what that sets up for the future is when activity does turn, when we find bottom and then it starts to go up, is a lot of work for our Rig Aftermarket folks to repair, to maintain, to replenish spare parts. And so the deeper this goes and the longer this goes, I think the sharper the rebound and the more positive the rebound.","William Sanchez - Scotia Howard Weil","So, Clay, given that is there any reason that we should expect discounts to rise further from here?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would say this isn't just Rig Aftermarket but across the board. The level of price pressure on all of our businesses rose to sort of new levels of intensity if you will. We saw that particularly late in the fourth quarter and certainly continuing into January. It's almost \u2013 in a lot of ways it almost felt like a second shoe dropped in the fourth quarter.","I think you had hedges rolling off E&Ps. I think you had some term contracts expiring on rigs out there that were priced in a much \u2013 much higher day rates. I think you had sort of a new round of fiscal \u2013 or for financial pressure on our customers that came to bear in the fourth quarter. And it's just a \u2013 it's we sort of hit a whole new level of pain.","William Sanchez - Scotia Howard Weil","I appreciate the time. I'll turn it back.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Bill.","Operator","Our next question comes from Byron Pope with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Morning.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Clay, trying to get a feel for any potential structural changes in the businesses as we progress through this downturn. And as I think about Wellbore Technologies, it seemed as though some of that work might be shifting from sales toward rentals. And so as I think about downhole tools, bits, are there any shift there in terms of how you think about the structural nature of that? And are you relatively agnostic between sales and rentals within that segment? Just curious as to your thoughts there.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Rentals carry a higher operating margin. And as I mentioned in my call, late in the quarter we had a lot of rental equipment returned, not just in downhole tools but in other rental businesses within Wellbore Technologies.","With respect to our downhole tools business we've seen a steady progression in our business over the last few years of working more closely with the E&Ps. And across North America is mostly where I'm talking about, but also elsewhere around the globe, where they're more interested in being involved in the selection of the bottom hole assemblies that go into their complex directional drilling. And so our mix is sort of \u2013 our mix of customers let's say has shifted to work more directly with the exploration and production companies to help them sort of optimize their well pads. But that's been sort of a steady progression. I'm not sure we've seen a big change here lately that would \u2013 that changes the trend of that.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just a question as it relates to Completion & Production Solutions. Given that you touch essentially all the equipment on the well side as it relates to frac spreads. And I guess I can infer this from the book \u2013 Q4 book-to-bill ratio. But it certainly feels like the anecdotal data points about insuring our (48:50) frac spreads, it feels like you guys are seeing it with regard to \u2013 like in your orders. But at some point that turned. So I'm just curious as to the anecdotal data points that you all are seeing with regard to \u2013 at some point there's a call on the equipment in \u2013 on the frac side.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Yeah. I'm not sure I can tell you the day or wrap numbers around this. But I would tell you anecdotally, nobody is really maintaining their fleets very well. And in fact as I said I think in my comments, there's a lot of equipment auctions under way where you can pick up fleets at pennies on the dollar. And that becomes a source of spare parts. And that's how it affects our business. Rather than buying consumables, fluid ends, things from us, those are being purchased at auction.","So I think the cannibalization of the existing fleet, sort of the erosion of the equipment overhang is well under way in that space. And when it does turn again, NOV's going to be called upon to step up and boost production to satisfy future demand.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thanks. I appreciate it.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Byron.","Operator","The next question comes from David Anderson with Barclays.","J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, Clay, your balance sheet remains one of the best in the sector with a really healthy cash position, which really stands out in this downturn. Can you talk a bit about \u2013 obviously you're navigating through a pretty severe downturn, one of the worst we've seen. But can you talk about your priorities in terms of that? And maybe remind us in terms of capital allocation? And also remind us what types of leverage ratios you're comfortable of getting up to.","Jose A. Bayardo - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hey, David. It's Jose. I'll jump in on that one. Now we're obviously very pleased to have the balance sheet that we have today. As Clay mentioned earlier, having optionality in the capital structure in this current environment is becoming more and more valuable day by day. And we're also seeing a narrowing of the nash (50:54) spreads on some compelling acquisition opportunities coming forward.","So as we think about capital allocation, for us it's really all about ultimately driving maximum value to the shareholders.","So obviously historically organic investment has been a very good use of capital that \u2013 current environment over-capacitized. M&A tends to be front and center in our minds. And everything is going to be opportunity specific, outlook dependent in terms of how we think about using the capital structure related to M&A and our other capital requirements. So I don't want to get into any sort of specifics on ratios, et cetera. But I think the company has historically maintained a fairly conservative balance sheet. And we intend to keep it that way. But again it really depends on the specific opportunity, cash flow it brings into the organization, as well as exactly where we feel we are in the cycle and the outlook for the combined businesses.","J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Jose. And I heard all your guidance, and we have to kind of digest it off of the first quarter. But as I think about kind of decrementals for the full year, and if I use 2015 as a starting point, is there any kind of guide you can help us out with? Kind of say maybe which segments may be a little better, a little worse?","Obviously with less revenue coming out of backlog and Rig Systems I'd have to think maybe decrementals look a little worse. On the other hand C&P and Wellbore I think have a pretty high level of amortization in there, so maybe that gets a little bit better. Can you just help us out with some of the trends that you're kind of thinking, kind of from a full-year basis on the decremental side?","Jose A. Bayardo - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, yeah. This is Jose. (52:37) It's a really challenging question, David. And I think we gave \u2013 there are ebbs and flows. Every business has its own unique components, and things don't always cycle perfectly. And as an example, last quarter we saw decrementals that were sort of in the 18%, 20% range. This quarter we're at 35%. And so the costs and revenues unfortunately don't always sort of go hand in hand.","But I think we gave some pretty detailed thoughts that will take some time I'm sure to digest regarding the first quarter. And beyond that visibility really is pretty murky, so...","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Jose A. Bayardo - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","...I hesitate to give any specifics on that.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'd say -you got to add it gets a little tougher from here. As backlog kind of dwindles down, absorption becomes a little more challenging. And we're managing cost in response to that as closely as we can. But our backlog driven businesses that are mostly manufacturing, certainly their decrementals will be affected by that picture.","On the other hand we do have a number of businesses that are exposed directly to the drill bit. So you finally find bottom on rig count and maybe have just a little bit of help on the \u2013 on rig count, we will immediately for instance get WellSite Services jobs. We will immediately see a turnaround on our downhole tools and bits business. We'll immediately see rig instrumentation work pick up. And those are three rental businesses that I mentioned earlier that come at high sort of variable margins. So just a little bit of activity help I think would help put up much better decrementals for Wellbore Technologies.","J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Clay.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet. Thanks, David.","Operator","Our next question comes from James West with Evercore ISI.","James West - Evercore ISI","Hey, good morning, guys.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, James.","Jose A. Bayardo - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Morning.","James West - Evercore ISI","Clay, as you think about \u2013 just another question on M&A. The \u2013 I guess the obligatory M&A question, or for Clay or Jose. Are there certain areas or product lines that you're looking at, maybe to diversify away from your core competencies where you dominate businesses, so you can become a more full cycle type player?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. James, as you know, we operate through 15 business units. Two of those 15 build new rigs, one for land...","James West - Evercore ISI","Right.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","... one for offshore. But 13 of our business units do other things. So we do a lot across the oil field, probably more than we get credit for. And already have more sort of diverse exposure.","What I would say is the thinking here with regards to M&A and corporate development, which I think the company has a lot of that in its DNA, really is focused on identifying opportunities to make money. What are the trends in the oil field? Where can we drive better industry structure? Where can we offer a better package of products and services for our customers? And it's really a little more granular than trying to globally arrive at some sort of diversified portfolio mix. I think we've ended up at a very diversified portfolio mix already.","James West - Evercore ISI","Okay.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But at the end of the day this is a \u2013 business is about making money. Right? So where can we put capital in into an opportunity, get that capital back as quickly as possible, i.e., get a quick payback and a good return. And really do something different to drive higher capital returns in an industry where we've all spent our careers and I think have a lot of insight into, which is global oil field services at large.","So that's kind of our approach to M&A. And looking for those sorts of opportunities. And honestly Jose and Loren and I wish we could tell you more this morning. But as you understand these things are never a deal until they're a deal.","James West - Evercore ISI","Of course, yeah. Yeah.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We are enthusiastic about what we're starting to see out there. And again great to have a lot of balance sheet flexibility and capacity. And I think there's a lot of optionality right now embedded in NOV.","James West - Evercore ISI","And has there been a significant change in kind of the sellers' asking prices here, as we've taken this I guess third dip down in oil prices?","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. There's a lot of shell shock out there.","James West - Evercore ISI","Yeah.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We're not the only one seeing this.","James West - Evercore ISI","Sure.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I would tell you on the \u2013 on down \u2013 in down cycles, having been through a few, it's really hard to get the bid and the ask to converge on the way down.","James West - Evercore ISI","Right.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Because the seller is looking backwards and seeing, hey, a quarter ago, two quarters ago, a year ago, we did much better financially. And as a buyer you're looking forward into a deteriorating P&L, wondering where's bottom and trying to discount appropriate.","So the bid and the ask tend to widen early in a down cycle. I think if we're \u2013 I don't know. I'm not calling bottom. I don't know if we're there yet.","James West - Evercore ISI","Sure.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But as you start to get closer to bottom, time passes, reality sets in, folks recognize this may go \u2013 be lower for longer. And I think that's kind of where the industry is coming to now. I think it brings a much more sober, realistic outlook on the part of potential sellers. And I think we're starting to approach that kind of world.","James West - Evercore ISI","Good. Good. Okay. We'll look forward to your next move. Thanks, Clay.","Clay C. Williams - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, James.","Jose A.

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Loren Singletary, Chief Investor and Industry Relations Officer. Sir, you may begin.","Loren Singletary - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Welcome, everyone, to National Oilwell Varco's fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings conference call. With me today are Clay Williams, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jose Bayardo, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of today's comments are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. They involve risk and uncertainty, and actual results may differ materially. No one should assume that these forward-looking statements remain valid later in the quarter or later in the year. For a more detailed discussion of the major risk factors affecting our business, please refer to our latest 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Our comments also include non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measures are in our earnings release available on our website. On a U.S. GAAP basis for the fourth quarter of 2017, NOV reported revenues of $1.97 billion and a net loss of $14 million or $0.04 per share. For the full year 2017, NOV reported revenues of $7.3 billion and a net loss of $237 million or $0.63 per share. Our use of the term EBITDA throughout this morning's call corresponds with the term adjusted EBITDA as defined in our earnings release.","Later in the call, we will host a question-and-answer session. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up to permit more participation.","Now let me turn the call over to Clay.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Thank you, Loren. In the fourth quarter of 2017, NOV generated $1.97 billion in revenue, an increase of 7% sequentially and 16% year-over-year. EBITDA of $197 million improved $30 million sequentially and roughly doubled from the fourth quarter 2016 to the fourth quarter 2017, which marked our sixth quarter in a row of rising EBITDA and rising EBITDA margins as we continue to pivot to land and unconventional shale technologies and benefit from cost reductions.","After three extraordinarily difficult years, it feels to us that the market is nearing an inflection point. Oil inventories are rapidly approaching normal levels, pushing oil prices up and facilitating the return, in our view, of a geopolitical risk premium. Industry surveys are pointing towards a modest increase in upstream CapEx, the second such year following a cumulative two-year drop that nearly halved global upstream CapEx. This all sets the stage for a brighter outlook for 2018.","Here's what we're seeing in the marketplace as we start the New Year. Number one, it's not clear that oil companies believe higher oil prices, at least not yet. The E&P industry is under tremendous pressure to generate higher ROICs, and all projects appear to look to West Texas shale as the benchmark. I believe the consensus view is that unconventional oil from the Permian bases carries a roughly $45 breakeven, and there persist fears that the oil price could revisit that level. Therefore, we think E&P price decks against which projects around the world are being judged, including the offshore, are closer to $45 a barrel than the spot price of Brent which is about $70 a barrel.","Number two, our customers are struggling to get bank financing. Banks and the regulators all want to reduce exposure to the oil and gas industry. One critical function of commodity prices is to signal producers whether to produce more or less. If the industry, at the behest of Wall Street and due to the lack of bank financing, fails to respond to the commodity price signal by failing to produce more, well then the commodity price will just continue to rise until somebody grows production. In short, the newfound fidelity to capital discipline and lack of bank financing will likely, in my view, result in higher oil prices on down the road.","Number three, the last three years have witnessed a succession of bad breaks. OPEC relinquished its traditional role of swing supplier, at least for a while. Libya and Iraq grew production meaningfully. Other large long-term projects came online. Iranian oil returned to the market. And finally, U.S. shale production continue to grow well into 2015. These all contributed to an oversupply picture that got progressively worse through the first two years of the downturn but has since turned the corner and is rapidly improving.","Number four, unconventional shales continue to score well on marginal cost of supply and continue to attract a disproportionate share of incremental capital. Over the past year, the rig count in Midland has risen dramatically while the offshore rig count has fallen. 2018 will see the U.S. break production records dating back to 1970 due to the application of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracture stimulation to profitably unlock oil and gas from very poor quality reservoir rocks, shales, and enhance profitability from conventional reservoirs. Within a decade, this unconventional shale technology has grown to account for five of six wells spudded in the United States, and we're confident unconventional shale technology will be adopted elsewhere around the world too.","In the meantime, it is against this backdrop that we're executing our strategy to pivot our portfolio of businesses to gain more exposure to unconventional shale technologies while enhancing our considerable offshore offering.","Let me explain our strategic framework or why this is an attractive way to deploy capital. Most but not all of our businesses provide equipment that enables other oilfield service companies, drillers, well servicing companies, wireline operators, directional drillers, et cetera, to execute the well construction plans of E&P companies. These are highly technical, capital-intensive, equipment-consumptive enterprises. Our role as the leading worldwide designer and manufacturer of oilfield equipment boasts several important attributes with respect to long-term returns on capital for our shareholders.","First, in contrast to our customers, our own business model is capital-light, with low fixed asset intensity. Our factories require low investment and maintenance CapEx as compared to the sales that they generate. Second, our broad portfolio of products enables us to redeploy factories and employees and other resources to areas where we see the highest demand, enabling greater efficiency. Third, our market leadership and global footprint affords us additional economies of scale in procurement, manufacturing, and marketing. Fourth, market leadership provides us with cumulative experience within a particular product area that exceeds our competitors, meaning that we're more likely to have faced and successfully navigated challenges and that we are the low-risk purchasing decision for our customers.","Fifth, we serve markets that tend to fragment. The oilfield is entrepreneurial, and we enable our customers to launch new enterprises that, in turn, provide new and better services to the continually evolving E&P industry. In particular, we believe the drive toward local content by many national oil companies will prompt more local startups, thereby expanding the market for equipment that NOV provides. As a consequence, we avoid excessive customer concentration. Sixth, our customers generally benefit from fleet standardization to improve their own performance, reliability, and logistics. They're far more likely to standardize on equipment from the market leader, NOV, than from smaller competitors.","Seventh, as market leader we can better leverage resources and experience to introduce breakthrough technologies to address evolving industry needs. We constantly enhance our technology portfolio through a combination of internal R&D efforts and targeted M&A. Eighth, as the largest equipment OEM in the oilfield, we have available to us unique opportunities to provide aftermarket support of the industry's largest installed base of equipment, a marketplace where switching costs are high and risky. Finally, ninth, our leading market position offers a platform through which we can introduce new digital products, control systems, and predictive analytics and maintenance models based on big data that further enhance our returns.","Importantly, during the downturn such as the present, we take a view on which oilfield technologies will benefit disproportionately in the next upturn. We think the next upturn will see more widespread application of shale technologies to new rocks both here and abroad, hence our focus on this area through the past three years. One such area is our ReedHycalog business unit within NOV's Wellbore Technologies segment, which accounts for about 20% of the segment's revenue or about 7% of consolidated revenue.","ReedHycalog is the leading independent provider of downhole tools that enable horizontal drilling required for successful shale programs. It is also at the forefront of providing optimization services based on the industry's only high-speed data telemetry system, IntelliServ Wired Drill Pipe, that unlocks the benefits of closed-loop automated drilling. With a legacy of producing drilling bits dating back to the early 20th century, ReedHycalog's breakthrough contributions such as our patented fixed cutter leaching process is used in virtually every PDC bit manufactured today, and PDC bits are used to drill virtually every horizontal lateral drill today. Without this technology, cutters would fail prematurely in the punishing drilling conditions of long laterals, undercutting the economics of shale programs. More recently, our industry-leading ION cutter is setting new records in complex horizontal drilling programs.","NOV ReedHycalog is also the leading provider of other technologies that enable directional drilling service providers to deliver precisely placed low tortuosity wellbores, another key attribute of successful shale programs, including rotary steerables and MWD tools that let smaller directional drillers compete effectively with larger players. Importantly, we do not provide directional drilling services. Rather, we provide a toolbox our customers employ to build their businesses without fear of having to potentially compete with NOV in the service space. We're a safe supplier and partner that brings the advantages of scale, scope, and staying power to these scrappy independent customers.","NOV ReedHycalog works closely with NOV's other units, including our drilling motor business and drill pipe business, to fine-tune the system performance of NOV bottom hole assemblies. NOV ReedHycalog also works in concert with our Rig Technologies segment to permit high-speed data from the bottom of the borehole to control the rig via automated software, the essence of closed-loop automated drilling. Most importantly, this is a great example of how we steadily deploy capital within the strategic framework I described earlier to cultivate competitive advantage and drive returns over the cycle.","Turning to NOV's Completion & Production Solutions segment, I'm going to shift gears and focus on a different kind of product that represents a different strategy, one focused on improving the economics of offshore E&P operators who are the direct customers of our subsea production systems unit. It is one of three offshore-focused business units within the Completion & Production Solutions segment, and it accounts for about 15% of the segment's revenue currently or about 5% of consolidated NOV revenue. It develops, designs, and manufactures flexible pipe and water treatment systems for subsea production applications and enjoys considerable technical leadership and advantages, having delivered over 7,000 processed miles of flexible pipe.","Flexible pipes are highly-engineered, complex multi-layer structures helically wound and comprise of unbonded layers of steel and composites, which enables them to withstand the demanding pressures and tensile loads required in deepwater production while remaining resistant to the fatigue induced by wave and tidal action. Flexible pipes are quick and easy to lay, even in congested environments, because they're spooled directly off a reel, which cuts the installation time to a fraction of the time required to install conventional rigid pipe. This offers a key advantage to E&P operators because construction vessel time is very expensive. Further, project schedules can be affected by weather and other unplanned events, so reducing installation time required reduces overall project risk. With all of their oil and gas flowing through a flexible pipe, there's a lot riding on the performance of this technology, so our E&P customers' qualification hurdles are very strict and demanding. NOV's subsea production systems unit benefits from years of R&D investment and field experience, something very difficult for new potential entrants to replicate.","While new deepwater field developments are an important end market for flexible pipe, we also sell into tiebacks and brownfield projects. The technology opens up the profitable development of deepwater fields because they can be tied back to regional hub facilities, leveraging an oil company's existing investment. And as subsea separation and pumping technologies continue to advance, we expect these to drive further demand for flexible pipe.","NOV continues to extend its technical leads in this area, including our proprietary actively heated flexible pipe and our OptiFlex condition monitoring system. This quarter, the subsea production system unit executed a contract to install our first proprietary subsea sea water treatment system, the Seabox, which prepares sea water for injection. This breakthrough technology will help E&P customers achieve higher oil recoveries from deepwater fields through better reservoir pressure maintenance while eliminating the need for expensive heavy topside equipment.","The strategic framework I described earlier applies to most, but not all, of NOV's portfolio, and our subsea production systems is an example of a product offering that falls into a somewhat different framework. Unlike NOV's equipment sold to service companies who do well construction work, this business sells its products directly to E&P operators, and it benefits from unique set of market dynamics and competitive advantage. Importantly, the unit has performed well through the downturn and offer significant optionality through a recovery in the offshore, which would be enhanced by tightness in construction vessel availability and further enhanced by continued advancements in subsea pumping and fluid separation. While we believe a robust recovery in the offshore is still some distance out, NOV is uniquely positioned to support a resumption of activity, with market-leading technologies that enhance economics for our customers and enhance optionality for our investors.","Finally, before I hand it over to Jose to take you through our financial results, I'd like to take a minute to thank our employees for your excellent performance in 2017. There is no better team in the industry. We have weathered a great deal together, and your talent and perseverance and grit have got us to a better place. Thank you for all your hard work and for your continued dedication to taking care of each other and our customers. Jose?","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Thank you, Clay. For the fourth quarter of 2017, NOV consolidated revenue was $1.97 billion, an increase of 7% or $134 million sequentially. Demand was strong for our short cycle consumable product offerings and customers that deferred taking delivery of capital equipment in Q3 due to oil prices that dipped into the low $40 per barrel range, came back to take deliveries. Those customers, while still cautious, reinitiated inquiries and placed orders for additional capital equipment, providing us with our highest level of bookings since the third quarter of 2015. EBITDA improved $30 million to $197 million.","Looking at select line items of the P&L, SG&A decreased $14 million sequentially due primarily to lower insurance, bad debt and incentive compensation expense. In the first quarter, we expect SG&A expense to increase about $7 million due to the non-recurrence of certain Q4 credits. Note that most of these changes in SG&A are reflected in the eliminations and corporate costs line item within our segment reconciliation tables.","Interest expense decreased slightly due primarily to the retirement of our $500 million, 1.35% Senior Note in December. Going forward, we expect interest expense to decrease another $1 million per quarter from fourth quarter levels. Interest income decreased in line with expectations and other expense increased $8 million primarily due to greater FX losses.","We reported a GAAP loss before income taxes of $145 million and a tax benefit of $130 million for the quarter, which includes the impact of tax reform. The recent tax reform legislation will be a meaningful long-term benefit to NOV. In addition to enhancing our ability to move cash around the world, we expect the reduction in the U.S. rate from 35% to 21% will lower our overall long-term effective tax rate from approximately 30% to the low- to mid-20% range.","In the fourth quarter, cash flow from operations was very strong, totaling $321 million and after deducting $65 million in capital expenditures, we netted $256 million in free cash flow. NOV continues to be a leader in free cash flow due to our market position, focus on returns and capital-light business model.","For the full year, cash flow from operations was $832 million and capital expenditures were $192 million, providing us with $640 million free cash flow. Our ratio of free cash flow to sales was 8.8%, best-in-class for the large cap OFS&E space in 2017. After retiring our $500 million note, total debt fell to $2.7 billion. At year-end, net debt was $1.275 billion, debt-to-cap was 16.1%, and our net debt to annualized Q4 EBITDA was 1.6 times.","One of our goals through this downturn has been to preserve credit metrics that support our investment grade credit rating. This is important for us to access low cost capital to opportunistically pursue attractive opportunities and to ensure customers do trust us with purchase commitments in the tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars built over multiple years, and retain confidence in their counterparty.","In short, strong credit ratings are critical to our business model and strategy and we have been successful defending our ratings by aggressively managing our cost structure and by generating solid free cash flow through the downturn. We expect free cash flow in Q1 will decline due in part to the first meaningful incentive compensation payments we will have made in three years and by slightly higher capital expenditures which will increase to the $250 million range for the year.","However, we believe we will continue to yield strong free cash flow later in the year which we expect will be enhanced by improved working capital efficiency. While we made progress in Q4, our working capital levels have remained frustratingly high through this downturn as a lack of cash and liquidity among our customers has made it challenging to turn inventory and accounts receivable into cash.","Consequently, we are heightening operational focus in this area in 2018 by further tying incentive compensation to improve capital efficiency and working capital performance. As our cash repatriation flexibility improves with new tax law changes and our free cash flow grows with our business and our heightened efforts around working capital, we will be focused intently on optimizing capital allocation throughout 2018.","As we think about allocation of capital, we, first and foremost, seek compelling organic investment opportunities which will always provide us with the greatest risk-weighted returns if we can appropriately leverage our installed base of equipment, existing manufacturing capacity, global distribution infrastructure, digital platforms, and world-class R&D facilities.","Next on the list of prioritization is M&A, where we employ an extremely disciplined returns-focused process. We typically utilize M&A as an opportunistic yet proactive means to accelerate already defined organic growth initiatives. This means that we are always in position to have an alternate way to achieve set initiatives, significantly reducing the likelihood that we overpay for a transaction. Excess capital for which we do not have attractive reinvestment opportunities should always be considered for return to shareholders. Increasing our current dividend is one such path and reinitiating a share repurchase program is another.","With a modest increase in capital expenditures in 2018 and a constructive M&A environment, we are not quite ready to increase return of capital to our shareholders right now. But depending on how our M&A initiatives play out, such actions may make sense later this year. We will continue to monitor this closely in consultation with our board as the year unfolds.","Turning back to results of operations. For the fourth quarter of 2017, our Wellbore Technologies segment generated $715 million in revenue, an increase of $22 million. EBITDA increased $13 million to $107 million or 15% of sales. Sequential EBITDA leverage was a very strong 59%, as was year-over-year leverage at 47%. Increasing sales drove better absorption and the depletion of NOV products and customer inventories created pricing power, both of which more than offset the cost of ramping up our operations and the wage inflation that is taking place across the industry.","Our belief that the segment can continue to outpace global activity levels with strong incremental margins remains intact. The segment's 3% growth outperformed the declining global rig count during the quarter and growth in much \u2013 most every product line more than offset 9% sequential decline in revenue from our Grant Prideco drill pipe business. After a 17% sequential improvement from the second to the third quarter, a less favorable mix and lower volumes of drill pipe contributed to the decline in the fourth quarter. Notwithstanding the falloff in Q4 revenue, bookings were better than anticipated and we continue to see significant improvements in drill pipe supply and demand fundamentals.","Current drill pipe bookings are not yet sufficient to overcome the pace of declining stocks of inventories but customers remain capital constrained and cautious. However, improving activity levels and day rates are helping our customers' cash flow and balance sheets while pent-up demand continues to build. Market dynamics and our introduction of new Delta premium connection set this business up for a stronger second half of 2018 and a potentially much more exciting 2019.","Our shorter cycle consumables business, which makes up the bulk of Wellbore Technologies segment are seeing steadily improving demand. For instance, our drilling motors business realized a 14% sequential improvement from Q3 to Q4 after posting 24% growth from the second quarter to the third. Rapid adoption of our ERT power sections, which provide up to twice the power of conventional motors, is contributing to the strong performance, as is pricing for our drilling motors which has nearly returned to 2014 levels.","We're also seeing increased demand for other leading edge technologies, including our automation and optimization services. As highlighted in the press release, momentum continues to build for our eVolve services with several new jobs secured during the quarter. We also view the purchase of two strings of IntelliServ Wired Drill Pipe by a major North American drilling company as validation that U.S. operators are increasingly realizing the value offered by our comprehensive suite of high-speed telemetry data and optimization solutions.","Demand around the world for our other offerings within the segment also remains healthy. In our WellSite Services business unit, we received over $30 million in contracts for drilling fluids in Argentina, where we can continue to gain share in this growing market. We also saw an increase in demand for capital equipment produced by this unit, receiving orders for seven mud tank systems in North America and a large order of MD Totco RigSense systems for an operator in North Africa.","The RigSense rigsite information system uses NOV's leading sensor, computer and data acquisition technologies to provide customers with fast, accurate rig information for drilling operations.","A work environment in which customers drive to implement better physical and digital solutions, drill ever-increasing lateral links more quickly at lower costs, and place gun barrel straight wellbores more precisely and accurately sets the stage for compelling business opportunities within this segment.","Looking at Q1, we anticipate flattish activity levels around the world as operators begin 2018 with conservative budgets. In this environment, we expect to realize 200 basis points to 400 basis points of sequential top line growth with strong incrementals. We expect stronger top line growth will accelerate later in the year, assuming oil prices hold at current levels or better, given the segment's compelling offering of short cycle projects and technology.","Our Completion & Production Solutions segment generated $690 million in revenue during the fourth quarter, an increase of $8 million sequentially. EBITDA margin decreased by 350 basis points to 10.7%. This was a good news\/bad news kind of quarter for the segment. Performance of our subsea and process flow technologies (sic) [Process and Flow Technologies] (24:37) business units were a little disappointing, however, the segment delivered strong bookings of more than $500 million for the quarter. We entered 2018 with a total backlog in excess of $1 billion and \u2013 a level we haven't seen since the third quarter of 2015.","Our Intervention and Stimulation Equipment business continued to experience strong growth as the pace of deliveries of new pressure pumping equipment accelerated into Q4, allowing the unit to notch an 11% sequential improvement in its top line. As anticipated, the pull-forward effect we experienced earlier in 2017 associated with Tier 4 emission standards dampened demand for new pressure pumping equipment in Q4. However, we were very pleased to book $84 million in new orders that were heavily weighted towards coiled tubing.","Headlining the order book were seven new coil tubing units, 10 injector heads, and a myriad of coiled tubing support equipment. We also saw a growing demand for wireline equipment with one customer in the Middle East placing an order for 32 sets of wireline pressure control equipment.","Our Process and Flow Technologies business booked close to $100 million of orders, most of which came in near the end of the quarter. While demand improved for our backlog-oriented wellstream processing project line, the timing of those bookings coupled with softer than anticipated demand for booking turn (25:48) products in our production in midstream and industrial pump mixer businesses resulted in the sequential decline in Q4 revenue with large decremental margins.","Our Fiber Glass Systems business unit delivered another strong quarter of growth. Revenue increased 8%, bookings exceeded $100 million. The order book included a sizable order for a large diameter pipe to be used for a large saltwater gathering system in West Texas and additional Fiberspar pipe orders for the Middle East.","Customer appreciation continues to grow for the corrosion-proof, lightweight, easy-to-install composite pipe solution this business unit offers. Our fiber glass operation could be the poster child for the crosscurrents we've been talking about over the past several quarters. We're seeing strong growing demand from land markets but almost non-existent demand from the offshore, which has our marine and offshore backlog at record low levels.","As previously announced, we encountered challenges associated with manufacturing a new product within our subsea business unit. The issue related to a build-up of torsional stress that occurred during extended length extrusion runs, and therefore, was not caught during shorter initial test runs. The issue resulted in a shortfall in revenue and excess cost in the fourth quarter and will also impact Q1. However, we are confident we have a solution that will get us back on track later this month.","While we've had challenges related to our offshore businesses, there is some cause for optimism that were at\/or very near a bottoming activity. We have seen a notable increase in inquiries, and to a lesser extent, orders, in our subsea, floating production and XL Systems businesses. Each of the three offshore business units posted greater than 100% book-to-bill's, albeit off of low levels. And all have seen a pickup in discussions surrounding tiebacks, enhanced oil recovery, and to a lesser extent, greenfield developments. Included in our orders was an award to supply several major topside package components for an FPSO redeployment in Malaysia. The project scope of work requires an integrated approach to refurbish and construct components for the FPSO.","We'll do all the fabrication at our facility in Batam, Indonesia and service a one-stop shop for an export gas metering skid, inlet separator module, dehydration module, export gas compressor BOP module, triethylene glycol regeneration flash gas compressor module, high-pressure flare knockout drum skid and all the interconnecting piping.","Our FPSO strategy has always been about selling equipment. We knew the technology we developed as we invested in our capabilities would be useful for offshore production opportunities beyond building new FPSOs. It is through these investments that we were able to secure this projects and it is through this project that we will have our best opportunity to-date to demonstrate how NOV can provide better FPSO solutions. While more optimism appears to be creeping into the system and we expect 2018 to see more offshore FIDs, we remain very cautious in our outlook for the offshore.","Major operators do not yet seem to have the conviction necessary to commit large amounts of long-term capital to offshore reserves when they can make smaller, short-term bets on unconventional resources in North America. We believe near-term FIDs will be smaller in scope than typical projects launched 5 or 10 years ago. Therefore, for the first quarter, we anticipate modest improvements in most businesses, offset by challenges that will persist through mid-Q1 in our subsea business unit, limiting sequential top line growth to 2% to 3% with a 100 basis point improvement in margin.","As we announced in our January 19 press release, we combined our legacy Rig Systems and Rig Aftermarket reporting segments into a single segment called Rig Technologies. During the fourth quarter, our new Rig Technologies segment generated $614 million in revenue, an increase of $104 million or 20% sequentially.","EBITDA increased by $30 million to $70 million or 11.4% of sales. For those who want to compare our Q4 results to the guidance provided last quarter, we estimate that under the prior structure, we would have reported Rig Systems revenue increased $88 million to $419 million, and EBITDA increased $16 million to $44 million. Rig Aftermarket revenue increased $24 million to $336 million, and EBITDA increased by $20 million to $89 million.","In our aftermarket operations, we experienced our typical albeit stronger than anticipated seasonal Q4 improvement in service and repair work. Spare part sales decreased slightly but bookings increased by 3.5% sequentially. As noted in our press release, we were awarded additional contracts for condition-based monitoring of BOPs and risers during the fourth quarter. We continue to expand our suite of condition-based maintenance capabilities and more customers are beginning to recognize the value offered by such services.","On the capital equipment side of the business, deliveries that were deferred by customers in Q3 due to the dip in commodities in late Q2 and into early Q3 shift in the fourth quarter, with customers having a renewed sense of urgency in taking delivery of capital equipment. Deliveries included two ideal land rigs for a North American drilling contractor. Several well service rigs, a jacking system for an offshore wind farm support vessel, and a variety of other capital equipment.","In addition to strong sequential improvement in the P&L, bookings also increased considerably to $169 million from $84 million in Q3, partially due to bookings that we expected in the third quarter materializing in Q4. Book-to-bill was 59%, the highest ratio posted since the second quarter of 2014.","Significant bookings included a subsea BOP stack and meaningful orders across our Marine & Construction and heavy lift product offerings. We were also awarded two FEED studies including one for a new platform project. Over the next few quarters, we anticipate seeing more FEED studies to evaluate the economics and feasibility of new projects as major operators appear to be more seriously evaluating new offshore developments. However, we still see very few opportunities for new-builds outside of potential \u2013 outside of the potential for new mid-water harsh environments semis.","Dialogue with our offshore customers continues to focus on upgrades which include motion compensation systems, enhanced pipe handling and increased hook load capabilities. In the North American land market, capital constraints among customers and day rates below $25,000 are inhibiting new-build orders. However, opportunity to assist customers in upgrading rigs to achieve Tier 1 super spec criteria continue.","Many contractors have worked through their rigs that are easy to upgrade to such specifications and we're NOW seeing opportunities to convert and upgrade high-quality DC rigs which present a larger per unit revenue opportunity for NOV. As we've noted before, we believe day rates north of $25,000 per day in contrast of longer duration will be required before we see broad-based resumption of new land rig orders in North America, conditions which could arrive as early \u2013 as late in 2018.","In the international markets, tenders continue to push out. However, we could see one awarded as soon as late Q1 or early Q2. While fundamentals are improving and customers are increasingly more optimistic, market conditions for Rig Technologies will remain challenging near-term. For the first quarter, we anticipate segment revenue will decline 10% to 12% from very strong fourth quarter results with a 100-basis-point to 300-basis-point decrease in margin.","Overall, we're expecting first quarter results to be flat to slightly down relative to the fourth quarter of 2017 as crosscurrents around the world persist. Nevertheless, with oil prices at their highest levels in three years, we are growing increasingly optimistic about the remainder of 2018, particularly the second half. We expect our short cycle land business to continue to outpace drilling activity growth in North America. We are finally seeing more signs of activity returning to international and offshore markets that set the stage for modest improvements in these areas later in the year.","Our oilfield service customers remain capital constrained and cautious and our oil and gas operator customers are demonstrating fiscal discipline and restraint. Understandable, given the commodity price; and then secondly effects (34:02) we've all witnessed through this downturn. But the dissipation of oil inventory overhang and the lack of oilfield investment through the downturn placed this latest oil price move on firmer footing and if sustained will bring significant healing to this battered industry in the form strong cash flows and higher activity levels as the year progresses.","Like Clay said in his initial comment, it feels to us the market is nearing an inflection point. The many talented and dedicated people at NOV have worked extraordinarily hard over the past few years to best position this organization for that inflection, and we are ready for the opportunity.","With that, we'll open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Jose. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now open for questions. Our first question comes from the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company. Your line is now open.","William Herbert - Simmons & Company International","Good morning. Thank you. Jose and Clay, I guess, with regard to \u2013 well, first of all, with regard to Q1 on Rig Technologies, Jose, the composition of the revenue decline between revenue out of backlog and non-capital revenue, if you kind of equally split in terms of the magnitude of the decline. And then secondly, what would be your expectations for revenue out of backlog for 2018?","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Sure. So, as it relates to revenue out of backlog, Q4, that number was $288 million. As we're looking at Q1, we believe that number will be in the $240 million range. And for the full year 2018, we're anticipating that number will be approximately $800 million.","William Herbert - Simmons & Company International","$800 million, got it. And \u2013 okay, and so that answers my question, I think. My sort of follow-up subject, as it were, as opposed to question was is there any expectation at all over the course of 2018 that Rig Tech witnesses a book-to-bill north of 1 times?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","That's a great question, Bill. And I think it's a possibility. I would stop short of saying it's a probability. We're most encouraged by what we're seeing and hearing from our North American land drilling contractor customers, that day rates are on the move. Recent report says that they're in the low $20,000 per day range. We think sort of the magic day rate required to prompt new rig buying activity by land rollers in North America is probably $25,000, $26,000 a day. And so we're inching a little bit closer. So that gives us cause for optimism.","In international markets, there have been a number of land tenders that we've spoken to off and on over the last couple of years. They slowed down last year with oil price pressures and OPEC cuts. Some of those appear to be kind of restarting and so we see some of those hit later in 2018, that could drive incremental demand for land rigs.","In the offshore, as Jose mentioned, I think, in his prepared comments, we're seeing some interest in upgrades around hook loads, motion compensation, and so forth, not big. But also really surprisingly strong demand in the fourth quarter around construction, vessel pipe lay, wind-farm type of opportunities as well. So, we're seeing some cause for hope here, but I'm going to stop short of telling you, that's going to drive book-to-bill over 1 times in 2018.","William Herbert - Simmons & Company International","Okay. Thank you.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","You bet. Thanks, Bill.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is now open.","J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, Clay. I was wondering on international land, so we've been hearing kind of a lot of chatter about kind of market share award kind of developing amongst integrated service providers on the pricing side. I was wondering, if you \u2013 capital equipments, of course, are very different, can you just kind of give us some, kind of, lay of the land as you see the international land market. Are you seeing some of these same pricing pressures? Obviously, it's a very different market.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yeah, it is. And I would say the international markets, broadly speaking, have been slower to recover on pricing than we've seen in North America. And Wellbore Technologies, in particular, has seen some pretty good pricing traction in a couple of its key product categories but overseas, it's been a little more competitive battle thus far.","What's most encouraging to me about those international markets is that I think they're a sort of growing recognition amongst NOCs and overseas oilfield service companies in the importance of technology, how it really sort of radically transformed the oilfield here in North America. And so, I'm encouraged by conversations we've been having along the way in respect to putting more of those technologies to work in overseas oilfields.","J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And you touched on last quarter about you were building out some new capacity in Saudi. I think it's going to take a little while to build that out. Can you talk about your capacity (39:27) country as it relates to the neighbors in Rowan, plans for new-builds over there, when do see those orders starting to come through? Are you building up for that or is this \u2013 what you're building out, is that completely different because of \u2013 more of kind of a consumable downhole equipment you're building out?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Well, we \u2013 it is a little bit all of the above. We announced a joint venture with Saudi Aramco to manufacture drilling equipment in the Kingdom and we're very excited about that. It's not quite complete, but we're very, very close and we expect to be sanctioning that officially and breaking ground a little bit later in 2018, but we're looking to really all the customers in the Kingdom to supply their needs as well as regionally around rigs.","In addition to making drilling equipment, there's a number of other products that we already manufacture there in Saudi Arabia including a lot of downhole tools and bits and are looking at other things we can make closer to the end markets for those products.","J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, Clay.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","You bet. Thanks, David.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Marshall Adkins with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Clay, a quick one for you. You guys like \u2013 you make everything, frac spreads, wireline, coiled tubing, rig parts, pipe, whatever, mud motors. What \u2013 I'm curious as to the top three tightest products that you see out there right now? In other words, where are you seeing incremental demand greatest? And then just kind of narrow it down to maybe to the top three or so, if you could for us.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yeah. Downhole drilling motors where we've seen them \u2013 the greatest pricing gains and, in fact, we're really back \u2013 pretty close to 2014 pricing for those. And that's helped by the fact we've introduced some new technologies for drilling motors that really do well on performance. I would add to that bits, we're seeing some pretty good demand for some of our ION cutter ReedHycalog bits. That's really driving a strong, strong demand and I'm looking at Jose, probably in the frac arena certain offerings that we have there.","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yeah. I would say that sometimes there \u2013 it's almost surprising from quarter-to-quarter where we see those positive demand. Obviously, things have been pretty stable on the pressure pumping front, notwithstanding the little bit of a lull that we anticipated in Q4 on the bookings side related to Tier 2 to Tier 4 emissions changes. But, really, prior to this quarter, we saw the big pickup in demand for frac equipment and early in the recovery, we saw much better than anticipated demand for wireline use as well. In this quarter, the story within our \u2013 Completion's capital equipment business (42:26) land was on the coiled tubing side. So, that's been a strong performer, certainly this quarter.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","And if I could throw in a fourth, it's small but a really, really interesting one with good growth lately, it's IntelliServ Wired Drill Pipe, where we're talking to more and more customers, it's going to work on more and more projects around the world. And as we mentioned in our press release, we had a drilling contractor by two strings in the fourth quarter.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Right, right that's \u2013 so it sounds like pretty broad-based. (43:00)","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","...also add. High-spec well servicing rigs. There's been a good appetite for that and still incremental demand in the market that we're seeing.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Exactly (43:09)","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","For any customers listening, get your orders in now.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. Let me shift gears here real quick, Jose. It's hard for us to kind of parse through the impact of tax reform on \u2013 every comment is going to be different. Give me kind of your overview of how big of a deal is that for NOV? And obviously, hit on the repatriation issue as well, is that relevant, is that meaningful to you?","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yeah, good question, Marshall. I think the most impactful element of the change in tax reform is related to our long-term tax rate, which ultimately translates into cash taxes, right? And if you sort of go back to healthier times in the industry, you'll see that NOV was a pretty high effective tax rate company and a fairly high cash tax company with our average tax rate being right in the range of 30%.","So, as we sort of look at sort of the \u2013 where our income is generated around the world, where we expect it to be generated around the world, from the international market standpoint, the average there has historically been and expected to continue to be at around a 24% range. And so, as that blend with 35%, that has really made us a high tax payer related to U.S. tax rate. So, blend the two together now, 21%, 24%, you're in sort of that low- to mid-20s range. So that can be a significant contributor to the future cash that we get to retain as an organization.","From a repatriation standpoint, quite frankly, I'll brag about our tax department a little bit here \u2013 is we've been able to navigate things pretty darn effectively. And so, repatriation has not been a huge issue for us. Obviously, the new rigs, while there are still some friction in the system, I think it will alleviate more long-term friction and make it \u2013 just make it easier for us to move cash around the world. But right now, we're really well-positioned. We have plenty of cash domestically to pay down our $500 million note during the quarter, and still have about $450 million in cash sitting in the U.S. at quarter end before the tax reform legislation came into effect.","J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great guys. Thank you all.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","You bet. Thank you, Marshall.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, good morning.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Hi, Sean.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So, Clay, thinking about the optimism that you're expressing for the second half, could you maybe just give us a little more detail, I guess, is that optimism geared around orders? And therefore, the impact to your P&Ls is really more of a 2019 event, or are there opportunities for a meaningful inflection in your EBITDA generation later in 2018?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","I think it will help later in 2018, Sean. But the basis for that optimism really stems from the oil price moves that we've seen here lately. And it kind of goes back to what we were saying in our prepared remarks, that inventories appear to be going in the right way. That's lifted oil prices $65 WTI is \u2013 puts our oil and gas customers in a much, much better mood. And frankly, that's where it all starts. They need to be \u2013 feel more optimistic about the future to believe that, to move forward with greater levels of activity.","And so, our expectation is that that'll drive greater levels of activity as 2018 progresses, if the oil price holds, and so we continue \u2013 we would expect to see continued growth in our activity-driven businesses. And then our longer cycle businesses within Completion & Production Solutions, Drill Pipe business and Wellbore Technologies and our Rig business then would see benefit of higher orders later in the year, and then that translating to revenue and EBITDA in 2019. That's, from this point, that's kind of the way we see things progressing. Again, if the commodity price holds.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. Thank you for that clarification. And then I really appreciate the comments earlier on capital allocation. It all makes a lot of sense. We talked a little about repatriation here and we talked a little bit about the impact of the higher oil price. Can you maybe just give us a sense of what those two variables do with respect to the M&A opportunity, inorganic opportunities that we are looking at for 2018?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yeah. We still see crosscurrents. Despite the basic optimism I described earlier that's fueled by commodity prices, different markets are sort of looking at different prospects. And so our view is, I mean, we're still seeing really interesting opportunities out there. We closed eight acquisitions in 2017. That brings us up to a couple of dozen or more I think through the downturn. And we have a number of \u2013 couple of million dollars of letters of intent that are out there in place now. And so this has been a very long, painful downturn for lots of folks. And I think the market for M&A has done nothing but get better kind of year-by-year, and so we're still actively pursuing those. Obviously, a big spike in oil prices and a resumption of activity probably will dampen those prospects a little bit. But here in the short-term, we still see really interesting good opportunities.","The other thing I would tell you, Sean, is I think the style of the kinds of acquisitions that we've been making through the downturn has evolved a bit. Generally, they'd been more focused on technologies and opportunities to add and supplement our portfolio with products that makes sense and fit. And what we offer to those sellers is really opportunity to put those products through NOV's 66-country infrastructure and sort of accelerate growth and acceptance of those technologies broadly speaking.","And so, obviously, market outlook and oil price matters in that dynamic but maybe matters a little bit less given that kind of style, that kind of opportunity that's kind of good for the seller and good for NOV to pursue. And so I think that means we're going to continue to be active and engaged on the M&A front irrespective of the kind of market that we're in because there are I think good opportunities to enhance what we do by accessing technologies and products through our M&A team.","Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Very good. Thanks for that feedback.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Byron Pope with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is now open.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Hi, Byron.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Just one question, Clay, in hearing you talk about some of the offshore businesses. It struck me that you guys have done a great job over the years in terms of getting closer to the E&P operator. And it seems as though for some of your offshore products, you're selling more directly to the E&P operators as opposed to service companies. At a high level, can you frame where you guys are today in terms of your product service portfolio that you sell directly to E&Ps versus service companies?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","That's a great question. I think most of that activity is probably within the Completion & Production Solutions segment. So in broad brushstrokes, Byron, the CAPS segment minus the well intervention and stimulation equipment portion of that is a pretty good proxy for what's going to the E&P world.","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","And I would say also it's a mix because you also have within our Wellbore Technologies segment, oftentimes the E&P that's calling the shots, particularly as it relates to some of the tools that are being run downhole, the consumable elements, so there's a good mix. I don't have a number pinned down exactly how much is to the operator. But ultimately the sales strategy for all of our technologies is \u2013 I can't really think of any exception. It's important for us for both the service company or the contractor as well as the \u2013 and the operator to be aware of the latest technologies and the capabilities of those technologies so that they can put those to work in the most effective way possible.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","That's a great point. I'm glad you brought it up because frequently, the customers that we've signed a contract with isn't necessarily specifying our equipment, and that's true across lots of things that we sell in Wellbore Technologies. It was also true in Rig technologies when our customers were shipyards but they were really being told by drilling contractors what to buy.","Byron K. Pope - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Pretty helpful. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","You bet. Thanks. Byron.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Igor Levi with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Igor Levi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Morning, Igor.","Igor Levi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So free cash flow excellence has been one of NOV's key differentiators, and in the last few years working capital has been a tailwind. You've highlighted your ability to decrease this lately. It's now I think below 50%, and you've mentioned that you see further upside. So how much lower could working capital decline by the end of 2018, and is 30% of revenue still a valid target because that could be $0.5 billion to $1 billion of incremental free cash flow just from that?","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for the question, Igor. Look, yeah, as we've mentioned before and as we've talked about a little bit in the prepared remarks, we are intently focused on sort of rightsizing the working capital of the organization. It's obviously been a very challenging market in which to do that, but we continue to be very diligent and we'll probably double down on our efforts over the next year or two. So in terms of our end goal related to our working capital metrics, as you pointed out we often think about total working capital as a percentage of revenue run rate, and historically that's sort of been in the, call it, 30% to 35% range, and that's where we intend to get back to.","That's not a quick target to reach due to the constraint that we have in our current markets, particularly with the challenges that will continue in the offshore space, but we intend to continue making good progress. This quarter, we reduced that metric from 51% down to about 43.5%, and that's down from about 58% a year ago, so we've made substantial progress. Expect that to continue through the remainder of 2018 and frankly well into 2019 as well.","As it relates to sort of cash flow freed up from that endeavor, you sort of have opposing forces there to some extent. We're anticipating continued growth into 2018 on the top line, which sort of counteracts some of our efforts from a cash flow standpoint. But net-net, we still anticipate a decent amount of cash flow coming out of working capital through the course of 2018.","Igor Levi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, that's very helpful. And then on the technology \u2013 from a technology standpoint, I mean, you've had quite a few technology-related initiatives during the downturn, and it looks like this innovation is starting to pay off with some particularly strong awards in the most recent quarter. Is there a large margin upside from this technology uplift? Is this something that you could potentially quantify? And when would you expect to begin to benefit and see this flow through the income statement?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Another great question, Igor, and thanks for asking. Yeah, we have had great strides and success across a number of areas. Unfortunately, introduce new products and new technology, and inevitably they're going to be a negative margin for a while until they get traction in the marketplace. And so depending on what specific products we're talking about and kind of where they are in their launch process, those may or may not be contributing meaningfully yet. But what's interesting to me is sort of this portfolio now that NOV brings to the oilfield, trying to look to see where the puck is going and positioning ourselves to provide the technologies to get there. And so I'm really excited about kind of the trajectory that we're on and the success that we've had so far. To be fair, not a big contributor of EBITDA so far, but really laying the foundation for what NOV looks like in the future. And to me, that's very, very exciting.","Igor Levi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. I'll turn it back.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Waqar Syed with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you for taking my question. I just want to follow-up on a question regarding the split of revenues between services and E&Ps. But more precisely, I wanted to find out like what proportion maybe comes in from the big four companies, the global large cap service companies, because it feels that they are kind of more keeping the CapEx budgets relatively unchanged going forward while the rest of the industry may be increasing in the near-term. Could you maybe provide some color on that?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Waqar, I got to tell you, I think NOV probably has the most diverse customer base of anybody in the oilfield services. There's almost no one out there that we don't sell to. So very pleased to support the operations of the big four, but we also sell to just about every land drilling contractor, every oilfield service company, every offshore drilling contractor, along with a whole host of E&P companies. And \u2013 but I would also add too, and we kind of referenced this in our opening comments, there's higher optimism out there but not necessarily translating to tremendous growth in budgets at the first part of 2018. And so what you described in terms of budgeting for the upcoming year by the big four, yeah, that's probably a fair comment all around the oilfield. Most participants I think remain cautious after a couple of oil price head fakes in the past. But so far so good as we get into 2018 here with where oil prices are.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So if you think about the oilfield services component, would the big four kind of represent maybe 50% of that net revenue opportunity for you guys? No?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","No.","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Waqar, it's much, much than that. I think I'd be surprised if any one individually was over about 2j5%, 3%.","Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay, good. Thank you very much. That's very helpful.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","You bet","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning. Hey, good morning (58:48)","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","No problem.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Always a great summary. So I think what I'm trying to understand a little bit more here is in the past you talk about a decrease in the amount of drill pipe inventories in stock, the prospect of that business to pick up. I was wondering if I missed some of this that you might've mentioned a little bit earlier, I apologize, you guys do go through this stuff pretty quickly, but can you just mention drill pipe and then maybe elaborate a little bit more on what's going on with the intelligent drill pipe?","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yeah. I think we talked about it a little bit without a whole lot of specificity in our prepared remarks, Kurt, and maybe we'll try to slow down or speech in subsequent calls. But the drawdown continues. And per my recollection, last quarter I think we gave a specific number that basically we're down 17% on the customer-owned inventory piece within the U.S. market, and we now estimate that...","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","(59:57)","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yes, that we have.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Right.","Jose A. Bayardo - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","We now estimate that that's down by about 22%. So those draws continue to come fast and furious, and that led to \u2013 leads to our optimism for a good back half of the year and really good 2019 and beyond.","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","Yeah. We also introduced a new premium thread connection in 2017 called the Delta connection which is really specifically focused on land drilling contractors and has a lower total cost of ownership and is a little more durable for land operations, and that's starting to get really good traction and I think that will help fuel demand. And then finally, I think you asked about Wired Drill Pipe and that's \u2013 the ability \u2013 traditionally, MWD mud pulse systems operate at 5 or 10 or maybe 15 bits per second; Wired Drill Pipe operates at 55,000 bits per second, and so it is truly a much, much, much greater bandwidth. And what oil and gas customers are realizing is that the ability to get a lot more data from the bottom of the hole, which IntelliServ offers them, is opening up new sorts of drilling techniques and better insight into downhole conditions and enables them to avoid lots of trouble, costs, and to drill faster and to evaluate formations on the fly much better. So it's just all the way around a really, really promising technology. And the good news for us, I think we've got enough experience in our belt where it's fairly, fairly bulletproof operationally. It's reliable and does a great job, and we're sort of seeing this blossoming of data measurements downhole that utilize that bandwidth and to improve operations. And so that's what's driving demand for the IntelliServ Drill Pipe.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And do you think, Clay, you're at a point now where you're going to see much more mass adoption?","Clay C. Williams - National Oilwell Varco, Inc.","I think so. It's still single-digit number of jobs that we have going on simultaneously out there, but double digits numbers of customers that are expressing interest, and really not just kicking tires but kind of getting in line to put it to work. So what's also interesting to me, it's not one sort of one operational challenge or one issue that this is being employed to fix. It's a broad, a pretty wide number of downhole measurements that are being made and downhole conditions and challenges that it's being applied to and applied to successfully. So I'm really pretty jazzed about where this is going. And it's not hard for me to imagine some number of years out where this becomes a much more standard piece of kit on a lot of drilling operations around the world.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference Mr. Blake McCarthy, Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Blake McCarthy","Welcome everyone to National Oilwell Varco's fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With me today are Clay Williams, our Chairman, President, and CEO; and Jose Bayardo, our Senior Vice President and CFO.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of today\u2019s comments are forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the federal securities laws. They involve risks and uncertainty, and actual results may differ materially. No one should assume these forward-looking statements remain valid later in the quarter, or later in the year. For a more detailed discussion of the major risk factors affecting our business, please refer to the latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our comments also include non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measures are in our earnings release available on our website.","On a U.S. GAAP basis, for the fourth quarter 2019, NOV reported revenues of $2.28 billion and a net loss of $385 million or $1.01 per share. Our use of the term EBITDA throughout this morning\u2019s call corresponds with the term adjusted EBITDA, as defined in our earnings release. Later in the call, we will host a question-and-answer session. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up to permit more participation.","Now, let me turn the call over to Clay.","Clay Williams","Thank you, Blake. NOV's results continued to improve sequentially during the fourth quarter of 2019, as revenue increased 7% from the third quarter and EBITDA increased to $288 million or 12.6% of revenue. Despite continued deterioration of the North American market, all three of our segments increased EBITDA sequentially.","On a year-over-year basis, NOV was able to post an increase in EBITDA during the fourth quarter of 2019, despite revenue being down more than $100 million from the fourth quarter of 2018. Aggressive cost reductions and facility downsizing contributed significantly to NOV's improving financial performance. And Jose and I will speak more to this in just a moment.","Revenues for the full year 2019 were $8.48 billion, a 0.3% improvement from the prior year. Full year EBITDA of $885 million declined 3% from the prior year. 2019 was a pivotal year for the energy industry. We entered 2019 with commodity and equity markets signaling strongly to market participants that growth for growth's sake, without commensurate returns to capital providers, would no longer be tolerated.","Sources of all forms of capital to the industry; public equity, private equity, bank debt, public debt became scarce and expensive as evidenced, for example, by the collapse in trading multiples of oilfield public equities in early 2019. At the time, we interpreted this as the evaporation of a widely held narrative, gauzy conventional wisdom that a commodity price spike would someday soon lead us back to a more prosperous oilfield and save us all.","Through the first four years of the downturn, 2015 to 2018, this narrative was responsible, we think, for a significant structural option value component in equities and asset values in the oilfield. This makes sense to me, because the oil and gas industry has a 160-year history of extreme volatility and sophisticated investors recognize the corresponding option value that goes with this volatility. As the leading provider of capital-intensive capital equipment to oilfield service companies, we tend to watch such trends.","Our customers frequently rely on external capital to buy the equipment that we provide them. And by the beginning of 2019 providers of external capital to oil and gas producers and service companies were exhausted. Tired of waiting patiently for recovery that felt like it continued to slip over the horizon. So they choke back on the capital that they were previously pumping into the operations of our customers.","Now capital is to oil and gas what oxygen is to the rest of us. Petroleum is arguably the most capital-intensive undertaking of all industrial enterprises and oilfield services is probably second. Operators react quickly when you choke off their air supply. They pulled back hard on CapEx budgets, particularly in the U.S. unconventional plays, resulting in a peak to trough decline of 27% in the U.S. land rig count over the course of the year. While international and offshore projects with favorable return characteristics continue to receive FID green lights.","The industry as a whole particularly in the U.S., finally seem to be resigning self to the fact that commodity price spike is not going to save the day. And the old way of doing business is not going to cut it. It will unfortunately be lower for longer and that's the new conventional wisdom that emerged at the beginning of 2019.","I wanted to step through this perspective with you this morning, because I believe it has important implications for our company and our industry over the next few years. And this perspective has guided our strategic decisions through 2019. First, with respect to the elusive recovery through this year of capital austerity, some might say capital starvation, I've been struck by the number of conversations I have had with other oil patch old timers, where we agree that this lack of capital is as bad as any time we saw during 1980s or 1990s.","They're in light of seeds of a return to prosperity, because the new grim view that has taken hold is now driving the industry to reduce its structural overcapacity. Taking actions that will return this industry to health.","Asset retirements, facility closures, regional withdrawals, exits from businesses and consolidations got underway in earnest in 2019. While individually none of these will heal the space. Collectively they inevitably lead the industry to better discipline pricing and shareholder returns.","NOV share the task began materially back in 2015, when we started reducing our overcapacity, facilities footprint and SG&A, but our efforts were accelerated sharply beginning in 2019 as a reality of the new market normal became apparent. Our team has undertaken many difficult decisions, including pulling back from unprofitable markets and closing numerous facilities around the world, some of which had been NOV mainstays for decades.","Since 2015, we have closed 483 facilities to shrink our own internal capacity to better fit market demand. We've adopted a more efficient shared services model in many regions. And through the hard work of our team through this past year, we've established a clear and tangible path to at least $230 million in annual cost savings as compared to the first quarter of 2019.","Thus far, we have obtained approximately $170 million in annualized savings up about $82 million sequentially in the fourth quarter, and we continue to evaluate every opportunity to increase that number. Second, every product line no matter how well established has fallen under the microscope of an in-depth returns analysis. Those that do not currently meet our internal threshold have either developed a tangible plan for near-term, improvement or had been slated for divestiture or closure. Ultimately 2019 was a year about building and solidifying our state power. Operationally, we're leaner, more efficient and more agile to react to the shifts in the market.","Third, from a balance sheet perspective, we continue to increase the strength of our capital structure in order to maintain the flexibility to act opportunistically. During the fourth quarter, we called $1 billion in debt due in 2022. We're paying a portion with cash and a portion with longer tenor notes in a new issue that is due 2029.","Fourth, we tailored our strategy to fit a world, where oilfield services customers have limited access to capital.","Commercially, NOV won much of this raise during the period from 2006 to 2014, when we won a significant portion of the largest build-out of oilfield service equipment the industry has seen in the generation. We delivered 379 offshore new build drilling packages since 2006 for instance. So today, we benefit from having the largest installed base of oilfield equipment in the world. This enormous installed base gives rise to new attractive business opportunities that are unique to NOV.","Aftermarket spares and services support, software system enhancements, the application of big data-driven predictive analytics products to drive efficiencies, the evolution of mechanization to automation of produces in the oilfield for instance. We are creating differentiated digital offerings built-on over three decades of gathering big data in the oilfield through our M\/D Totco products and eHawk service offerings among others.","Due to our installed base of equipment that touches nearly every well site in the world. We're uniquely positioned as perhaps the only common thread between hundreds of unique equipment suppliers with thousands of non-standardized sensor tags.","Our new product development with capital scarce and oilfield equipment oversupply it makes it less sense for oilfield service contractors to spend millions of dollars on new units rather we see the next attractive opportunities as being smaller dollar investments that our customers can make and bigger impact enhancements that will enable them to differentiate their equipment in a crowded marketplace.","While there will be certain large new build project opportunities that arise even in this tough market, we will remain disciplined and we'll choose not to follow our competitors and doing the stupid stuff that desperate competitors inevitably do. A strong balance sheet and a large installed base of equipment requiring ongoing OEM support is the best way to write out an industry downturn.","The good news for NOV is that we have both. New product development has zeroed in on bolt-on products that carry a price our customers can afford, with value-added efficiency, or use life improving profile that they can justify to their shareholders. Think in terms of track ID tags for drill pipe monitoring and auto tally\u2019s on rigs.","NOVOS operating system enhancements that our customers can charge their oil company customers for. New directional drilling tools like SelectShift, which have no similar peer in the marketplace. PowerBlade energy management systems, which reduced diesel consumption and carbon footprint for offshore drillers. Affordable products, which can be used to retrofit existing capacity to improve its attractiveness in the marketplace.","Lastly with respect to our outlook for the year, we're prepared to endure continued levels of reduced activity in North America, with a meaningful market recovery unlikely to take hold before 2021. The kind of market that suits affordable fit for market solutions. International activity continues to be a bright spot as we enter 2020 for NOV as customers in the Middle East and other regions around the world look to harness the technologies that enable the U.S. unconventional revolution. Where our rig technology segment is experiencing limited demand for new equipment in North America, we're scheduled to deliver multiple new rigs and rig upgrade packages this year to the Middle East to several countries in the region seek to upgrade their fleets.","We are pleased with our progress on our Saudi joint venture and expect to begin delivering the first of 50 modern highly efficient super-spec rigs to the Kingdom in 2021. Offshore drilling and production continues to grow at a measured pace. Our Wellstream Processing business, an industry leader in production processing technologies, including monoethylene glycol regeneration units is tendering at twice the pace that it was at this time last year, indicative of greater activity in the offshore.","As the world continues to learn more about the coronavirus outbreak, we're hopeful first that authorities around the globe were able to ease the suffering that is causing so many. We also hope that its impact on the world's economy broadly in the oil and gas industry, specifically, is short-lived. But we're realistic in acknowledging that globalization leaves us exposed to market uncertainty as it does for other industries. We expect that our scale and global footprint will help us mitigate any direct supply chain repercussions but the situation nevertheless remains fluid in early 2020. ","Finally before I hand it over to Jose, I'd like to finish where I began. If I've learned anything from business it's to be skeptical of conventional wisdom, because collectively we are all well frequently wrong. I would be surprised to see a robust global recovery emerge in the oilfield in 2020 or even 2021. So we are managing the business accordingly.","However, I do think a recovery will emerge when no one is predicting it. The only fact I know for certain is that the oil industry has seen global growth in demand for almost every single one of its 160 years. And that the industry has always been highly cyclical. The current time feels an awful lot like the 1990s, went in as now, capital providers to oil and gas were fatigued and frustrated, another period of capital starvation. And then as now, the industry responded by trimming overcapacity.","History doesn't repeat itself but it does rim and I'm encouraged that here in the sixth year of the downturn, the oil and gas industry is serious about reducing its structural oversupply. There is a parallel narrative embedded in conventional wisdom about a looming energy transition, one that fully displaces fossil fuels and therefore one that likely further diminishes the option value of oilfield assets at least in the minds of some investors.","While I'm confident will transition to better forms of energy in the future, the shape and pace of that transition are probably going to surprise us all. In the near term oil and gas remain critical fuels that play a key role in for instance, air travel and feeding the planet. So they will be part of the energy mix for many years, perhaps generations to come.","Nevertheless, an energy transition is emerging as potentially the most valuable and interesting business opportunity of the 21st century. So there is one more small but important element to our strategy which is figuring out how NOV can capitalize on this and how we can make money by facilitating it. We quietly launched this initiative a few years ago to play offense rather than defense against this emerging backdrop. We're not spending much money in this area but I have been very encouraged by what our teams are developing and I hope to be able to share more with you on future calls about the opportunities emerging for NOV in this space.","To our employees listening around the world. Thank you for all that you do. Your resiliency, your dedication, your hard work made a tough year, a great year for NOV. And Jose and I could not be more thankful to have you on our team.","With that I'll turn it over to Jose.","Jose Bayardo","Thank you, Clay. NOV's consolidated revenues increased $155 million to $2.28 billion or 7% sequentially. As the continued momentum in international and offshore markets helped drive a 15% sequential improvement in international revenues more than offsetting the impact of a rapid decline in North American activity levels during the fourth quarter.","EBITDA increased $26 million sequentially to $288 million, driven by strong operational performance and continued progress on cost savings initiatives, partially offset by favorable project closeout variances from Q3, not repeating and a less favorable product sales mix in our Completion & Production Solutions and Rig Technologies segments.","As Clay mentioned, we continue to make progress on efforts to rightsize our business and improve efficiencies across the organization and expect to realize another $24 million in annualized cost savings in the first quarter or a $6 million improvement in Q1 over Q4. We've also been reducing the working capital intensity of our business. We converted $246 million of working capital to cash in the fourth quarter and generated $473 million in cash flow from operations. After deducting $67 million of capital expenditures, free cash flow for the quarter was $406 million, bringing our second half 2019 free cash flow to $689 million, significantly exceeding our target. Despite our expectation, the capital expenditures for NOV will increase to around $325 million in 2020 as we ramp spending on our new rig manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia, we believe we will increase free cash flow by at least $100 million year-over-year and that working capital will be a source of cash for NOV in 2020.","During the fourth quarter, we took measures to further strengthen our balance sheet by redeeming $1 billion of senior notes due December 2022 and issuing $500 million of new senior unsecured notes due 2029. These transactions extended the maturity of $500 million of existing debt by seven years, and reduced our debt by approximately $500 million leaving us with $1.989 billion in gross debt as of December 31.","Cash flow generated in Q4 allowed us to reduce net debt to $818 million at year-end. Our actions demonstrate what we've long said, that defending the balance sheet is our top capital allocation priority. Our actions are designed to ensure NOV can successfully manage tumultuous market conditions and provide the flexibility to be opportunistic with compelling high-return investments that we may identify.","As you know, NOV has a share buyback authorization that is contingent on the company achieving gross debt to annualized EBITDA of less than two times. If 2020 continues to unfold as we expect, we will likely begin stock buybacks later in the year.","A few housekeeping items before we dive into our segment level results. During the fourth quarter, we took $537 million in mostly non-cash impairment and other charges due to the further deterioration in North American market conditions and our ongoing restructuring efforts. Lower intercompany sales from cross-segment projects resulted in a $3 million sequential decrease in revenue eliminations.","In the first quarter of 2020, we expect intercompany sales to remain in line with the fourth quarter of 2019. Other expenses increased $44 million sequentially and included $26 million in expenses associated with the retirement of $1 billion of our 2022 notes and a $14 million increase in foreign exchange losses. And finally, while our effective tax rate may continue to be volatile over the near future we expect our tax rate will average approximately 35% for 2020.","Moving to results from operations. Our Wellbore Technologies segment generated $764 million in revenue in the fourth quarter, a decrease of $29 million or 4% sequentially. Revenues from North America declined 13% slightly more than the fall off in drilling activity, while revenues from the segment's international operations increased 7%. Despite the decline in revenue, EBITDA for the segment increased by $10 million sequentially to $143 million primarily due to the successful implementation of cost savings initiatives and structural improvements to operational efficiency across the business units in this segment.","Our ReedHycalog drill business posted a less than 1% decline in revenue due to continued weakness in the North American market that was mostly offset by growth in most international markets, and continued market share gains in the U.S. Our high-performing bits are allowing us to gain share and preserve pricing in a competitive market.","Revenues in our Downhole business unit fell 12% as reduced demand and increased pricing pressures in North America were partially offset by higher revenues in most Eastern hemisphere markets. Despite the challenges in the North American market, we continue to see healthy demand for our lead edge motor, elastomer and other technologies including our SelectShift adjustable motors, which are enabling customers to complete single-run wells with greater consistency and reliability.","During the fourth quarter, we helped to customer in the Marcellus Basin drill a record-setting 19,132 foot single run well. Our M\/D Totco business unit realized a slight increase in revenue as the contribution from our growing number of drilling automation projects in the Norwegian North Sea more than offset a decline in revenue for M\/D Totco's business in North America.","Our Tuboscope business unit saw revenues fall 5% sequentially. Revenue from the business unit coating operations were down slightly and inspection service revenues fell 6%, as lower drilling activity levels in the U.S. and holidays reduced output from mills and outside processors.","Revenues in our WellSite Services business unit declined 12% sequentially on fewer U.S. fluids jobs, but the unit's core solids control business only experienced a 5% sequential decrease in revenues. Its U.S. operations performed in line with the 11% fall off in drilling activity, but was partially offset by growing opportunities in international and offshore markets. We're encouraged to have begun working on several projects in the Gulf of Mexico recently, in addition, to seeing rising demand overseas.","Our Grant Prideco drill pipe business realized a sharp increase in revenues in the fourth quarter, as we shipped large volumes of high-spec drill pipe for international markets. Additionally, as was the case in the third quarter, more than 50% of the business unit's revenues were derived from offshore products.","While orders for drill pipe in the U.S. have been sparse over the past few quarters, customers drill pipe inventories that we hold in the U.S. are at the lowest levels in recent history. We believe any material increase in drilling activity will require a healthy increase in orders. Meanwhile, as international customers restock diminish inventories, we continue to see rising demand for our Delta drill-pipe connection technology.","Looking to Q1 for the Wellbore Technologies segment, the coronavirus, oil prices, seasonality and evolving E&P budgeting practices all remain wildcards. But at this time, we expect revenues for our Wellbore Technologies segment will decline between 6% to 12%, with decremental margins in the mid-30% range.","Our Completion & Production Solutions segment generated $799 million in revenue in the fourth quarter, an increase of $71 million or 10% sequentially. Growing demand from offshore and international markets was partially offset by lower demand for completion equipment in U. S. land markets.","EBITDA increased $14 million sequentially to $96 million, or 12% of sales. Incremental margins were limited to 20% as modestly higher sequential cost savings were offset by favorable credits related to the close-out projects in Q3 that did not repeat in the fourth quarter.","Segment began realizing a considerable increase in orders during late 2018, largely driven by offshore and international projects. This trend continued through the fourth quarter, resulting in orders of $502 million in its fifth straight quarter with a book-to-bill in excess of 100%. While the project pipeline remains robust for 2020, at this point, we expect lower orders in the first quarter due to the timing of specific projects.","Our Fiber Glass Systems business unit posted an 8% sequential improvement in revenues, achieving the highest levels of revenue in its history. Increased deliveries of spoolable pipe from our new manufacturing plant in Dammam, Saudi Arabia and marine scrubber system components needed to retrofit vessels for IMO 2020 compliance drove the sequential growth, but was partially offset by rapidly contracting demand in North America, where orders decreased 15% sequentially.","We expect the need for additional scrubber systems to remain robust, with experts estimating that owners of shipping vessels can achieve paybacks on their investments in less than a year, based on current price spreads between low sulfur and traditional bunker fuel.","Our Intervention and Stimulation Equipment business realized a 3% sequential increase in revenue on strong year-end shipments of coiled tubing and wireline units. However, margins decreased roughly a 100 basis points on a less favorable product mix, as revenues from pressure pumping aftermarkets parts and services declined to a level that is less than half of its recent highs. Results from this business unit remained depressed due to the structural overcapacity of the North American completions market. However, the business continues to advance its technological leadership by assisting our customers and finding new less capital-intensive ways to improve profitability for themselves and their end customers.","Our FracMaxx, Big Bore, QuickLatch and frac hose products or examples that are lower cost solutions for improving operational efficiencies and safety in a cash-constrained environment. Business is also focused on pursuing opportunities in other markets, such as the Middle East, Latin America and China, where the development of tight and unconventional natural gas formations is driving equipment needs that mirror what is used in North America.","In the fourth quarter, we booked and delivered a large package of high-pressure equipment to an operator in Northwestern China, where there has been a rapid increase in the amount of hydraulic fracturing activities, and therefore experiencing a corresponding increase in demand for high-pressure Flowline equipment in the Chongqing and Jiangyin gas fields.","Our Process and Flow Technologies business unit realized revenue growth in each of the unit's major product lines. The unit's production midstream product offerings saw a sequential decrease in demand in North America that was more than offset by large shipments of pump packages to India and an uptick in sales of production chokes, including the first batch of chokes built in our new manufacturing facility in Dammam, Saudi Arabia.","Business unit also realized its third straight quarter of improved results from its offshore market-focused Wellstream Processing and APL mooring product offerings primarily driven by growing LNG-related activity. Headlining the order book was a monoethylene glycol regeneration and reclamation unit for an LNG project in Mozambique and in order for our newly developed electrostatic coalescer technology EPACK that will be installed at the Equinor, Johan Sverdrup.","Tendering activity for the offshore market remains the strongest in recent memory, which is reflected in the business' ability to post a book-to-bill in excess of 150% and which should begin to allow for incremental pricing improvements during the year. Our subsea flexible pipe business posted a 15% sequential increase in revenues, but at low flow through as the market for flexible pipe remains very price competitive.","Bookings improved from the third quarter generating a book-to-bill of 134% and included more than 56 miles of flexible pipeline systems for a project in the North Sea. Our team continues to use as technology advantages to focus on higher value-add projects.","For the first quarter of 2020, we expect revenues from our Completion & Production Solutions segment declined 10% to 15% sequentially with decremental EBITDA margins in the upper 20% to lower 30% range. Our Rig Technologies segment generated $759 million in revenue in the fourth quarter, an increase of $110 million. A sharp increase in land rig equipment sales, including sales of older inventory at low margins and improved progress on offshore projects drove the 17% sequential improvement in revenue.","However, an unfavorable shift in product mix together with old inventory, we've moved at a discount were only partially offset by cost savings, which limited incremental margins and resulted in a $7 million increase in EBITDA to $112 million or 14.8% of sales.","Orders declined $10 million or 5% to $211 million in the fourth quarter and the total segment backlog at year-end was $2.99 billion. Sharp improvement in land revenues resulted from a significant increase in year-end equipment deliveries and better progress on land rig projects.","During the fourth quarter, we booked orders for six land rigs destined for multiple customers in the Middle East with three of the rig orders specifying our NOVOS control system. We are seeing NOCs more frequently pushing their contractors to provide high-spec land drilling rigs that can meaningfully improve performance and operator returns. The growing number of international operators pursuing development of tight gas formations is accelerating the demand for this equipment.","And similar to what we're seeing in our Intervention and Stimulation Equipment business unit, the equipment these customers are seeking is beginning to look like the high-spec equipment found in West Texas. We've seen this in Argentina for several years and are now seeing customers across the Middle East and Asia pursue 1,500 horsepower rig packages with three gensets that are almost identical to what we're selling into the U.S.","During the fourth quarter, we also realized a substantial increase in revenues from deliveries of offshore capital equipment and from improved progress on our offshore wind construction vessel projects. We continue to see gradual improvement in offshore markets, with steady demand for rig equipment and technology upgrades, as well as a growing opportunity set for our marine construction business, including replacement cranes for FPSOs, equipment for pipelay vessels and additional offshore wind construction vessels.","NOV continues to leverage our core competencies to assist in the development of solutions that help our customers reduce their environmental footprint, while also improving operational efficiencies. In the fourth quarter, we introduced our PowerBlade Hybrid system that is currently being installed on a rig in the Norwegian Continental Shelf.","PowerBlade allows drilling contractors to reduce their carbon footprint and fuel costs by recycling the captured energy back into the rig. We estimate that the PowerBlade system will allow the drilling contractor to reduce diesel consumptions by 771,000 gallons per year, saving them $1.75 million in cash, reducing 110 tons of NOx emissions per year and reducing their carbon footprint or CO2 emissions by 6,200 tons per year.","Revenues from our rig aftermarket operations were flat sequentially, due to a decrease in spare part sales that resulted from budget exhaustion that sit in with our customers near the end of the year. Additionally, the significant increase in the number of rigs enrolled in our total cost of ownership programs moderates the Q4 uplift we've historically seen in our service and repair operations. We've increased the number of offshore rigs in our programs to 83 at year-end and an increase of over 2.4 times since the end of 2018.","In the first quarter of 2020, we expect lower deliveries of capital equipment to be partially offset by a slight increase in aftermarket sales, resulting in a 10% to 15% sequential decrease in revenues and a 100 to 300 basis point reduction in EBITDA margins. While we know there is much more work to be done in 2020.","We were pleased with the strong finish to 2019 and the progress the organization made on key initiatives throughout the year. Actions taken by the talented hard-working employees of NOV allowed us to balance our efforts to reduce costs and improve operational efficiencies with advancing our technologies and supporting our customers with cost-effective solutions. Those actions have NOV well positioned for the future.","With that, we'll now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please stand-by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from Byron Pope with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company. Your line is now open.","Byron Pope","Good morning, guys.","Clay Williams","Good morning, Byron.","Jose Bayardo","Hi, Byron.","Byron Pope","By recognizing the extra uncertainty injected into the market by the recent pullback in Brent prices, could you just frame for us at a high level how you think about the international growth drivers among the three business segments again just at a high level?","Clay Williams","Yes, we're -- big picture, North America, we expect to -- I think, like everyone else, to endure a slowdown -- continued slowdown in activity and we're preparing for that. But we're much more encouraged overseas and in offshore markets in particular. So that continues to move higher and what we're hearing from our customers is that they're moving forward with a lot of projects that they've been working on reducing costs and engineering in over the last several years. And so, excited about that for 2020.","And then, the Middle East has continued to remain very active. And as you're well aware, we've increased our presence in those markets and are encouraged by the needs that our customers have there for equipment and technologies that NOV provides. So, generally, North America, drifting down in offshore and international moving up. Current oil price volatility notwithstanding, Byron.","Byron Pope","Thanks. And then, my second question, just, again, in qualitative terms, could you \u2013 as you think back on the five incremental NOV growth drivers, growth opportunities that you guys laid out back at the 2018 Analyst Day. Just from your perspective, how things are progressing, again, notwithstanding the near-term North America headwinds, but just how those have played out relative to your expectations?","Clay Williams","Well, the main thing I'm most proud of is our continued investment in technologies and products through the downturn. And we certainly highlighted that in our Analyst Day, which was well over a year ago and in a very different sort of commodity price environment.","But I look back on the progress we've made, really since the downturn started, I think, NOV's probably introduced more new products and new technologies than any of our peers out there. We launched our NOVOS, sort of test rig at the very end of 2014 and that's been responsible for dozens of products and technologies. We've come out with very impactful digital solutions through this time period. Predictive analytics for BOPs, for example, our NOVOS operating system, our GoConnect digital products, things like that.","And so, I think, we've balance the cost-cutting and the retrenchment that has been necessary with continuing to invest in the long-term future of the company and the technologies that are going to make that happen. And so, I'm very proud of our organization in terms of progress on these things. And, I think, in a lot of ways through the downturn, we've been focused on, in addition to efficiencies and getting better at working capital management, on really laying the foundation for what the next up-cycle looks like.","Byron Pope","Thanks, Clay. Appreciate it.","Clay Williams","You bet. Thank you, Byron.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens Inc. Your line is now open.","Tommy Moll","Good morning and thanks for taking my questions.","Clay Williams","Good morning, Tommy.","Tommy Moll","So wanted to touch on the portfolio review that you've been undertaking for some time now. It's clear, it's a returns-driven analysis that you're running through. And so my question is, as you're evaluating, what to keep and what to prune. How many years forward are you willing to look for a business line or a unit to hit the kind of returns that you'd like to see to keep it in the portfolio? And the reason I'm asking is, clearly, offshore and international have some momentum, but we need to play that forward for some reasonable time horizon to get comfortable to where you're willing to underwrite. So anything you could do to help us frame that up would be helpful? ","Clay Williams","Yes, that's a great question. I'm going to let Blake chime in here in a minute, because he's heading up this effort. But, I would say, it depends on the potential to achieve what we always aim at in the application of capital, which is a defensible business that has a demonstrable competitive advantage over the long haul is the ultimate goal. And so when we look at these different businesses and kind of the current state of affairs and the current state of their markets and so forth. We take a view necessarily on what's the likelihood probability that we'll get to that state that defensible competitive advantage in a reasonable period of time. And so I would say, our patience level is somewhat dependent upon the potential payoff and attractiveness of that particular business opportunity, but it's really kind of opportunity by opportunity that we evaluate this.","Jose Bayardo","Yes Tommy, I think we touched on this last quarter but this is not just a quantitative exercise but also qualitative. And so we just take a step back and say like, oh, if this business is below the return threshold but it's been nothing along the bottom of the down cycle and we could see a clear tangible path to hey the orders have completely pivoted on this one-and-done a full 180. We're not going to sell at the bottom of its earnings potential.","Now I will say, we have (inaudible) upon our patience level for a lot of these that did all below the threshold, we were able to implement some discrete action plans that are in process right now that we will reevaluate. And most of these action plans only take about three to nine months. So it's just more self-help, which is part of our job is managing these businesses. And those that we find are to be unfixable, those will be evaluated for divestiture or just pure exit.","Clay Williams","Yes that's our first inclination is around \u2013 we're paying to fix these things and run these things. And so are there steps we can take first. So that's probably where our default is for businesses that fall below the threshold initially.","Tommy Moll","Very helpful. Thank you both. And as a follow-up I wanted to double back on the international and offshore outlook. Again looks like we'll be up for 2020 versus the prior year just in terms of the addressable market there. Are there any particular aspects where you think NOV could maybe outperform the broader market business lines or parts of the world where you're most excited that you would call out for us?","Clay Williams","Yes. Probably what we're certainly well-known for drilling equipment offshore rigs all things drilling was probably less well known by investors on Wall Street is the fact that we've sort of quietly assembled a really interesting portfolio of products that are more focused on production going into FPSOs fixed platforms processes around production in terms of sand separation, oil water separation, monoethylene glycol regeneration units things like that.","And so I'm really. really proud of that portfolio. And I think there's really interesting opportunities that are going to continue to emerge in the offshore where NOV is likely to play maybe a little larger role than we would have in a prior upturn.","Tommy Moll","Thank you. That\u2019s all for me. And I\u2019ll turn it back","Clay Williams","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Chase Mulvehill","Hey, good morning. So I guess Clay you talked a bit about kind of energy transition. And so I'm just kind of curious, if you can kind of flush it out a little bit more here and kind to talk about your strategy towards energy transition and maybe organically what you're doing? And then also maybe on the M&A side?","Clay Williams","Yes. First I'd say that we have a presence in this space going back many years and in fact many decades with respect to geothermal for instance where you probably be hard-pressed to find a geothermal well that doesn't have NOV technology involved with it anywhere in the globe.","And then secondly, I think last year we had a couple of announcements around offshore wind installation vessels, which is a space that NOV has a very -- has a market leading position in terms of the technologies and vessels install offshore wind turbines. And so we've been in renewables for going back a long time.","My comments in the prepared remarks though really are just to let you know that we're thinking about other ways to participate in this and viewing it as potentially a terrific business opportunity. When I think about energy, energy really is all about infrastructure, about capital deployment, historically pivoting from one form of energy to another is a decade long process, but involves enormous amounts of capital involves project execution, it involves application of technology, it involves creative ideas. NOV has a lot of those in abundance.","And so I do think there's a role here that we can play and help me make that happen. But what I want to stress is we're aiming at capital returns coming out of that at the opportunity to develop technologies and services and methods that help in that transition, but also earn excellent returns for our shareholders. And so that's how I'm framing this. I don't have a lot more to add to that other than what I said earlier some ideas in the space that we think are unique that potentially can turn into a really interesting and profitable businesses, and -- but we -- I generally don't -- won't get into the details until we're earning -- making revenue with these things.","Chase Mulvehill","Okay, great. Thanks Clay. I guess, if we kind of come to the supply chain a little bit and think about the coronavirus. You mentioned it a little bit there's, obviously, a direct impact and maybe some direct -- indirect impact as we think about the supply chain being so interconnected. Is there a certain segment that we should look at and try to understand better about the impact from what's going on over in China? And then help us understand how much of that is actually in your guide on their Blake?","Jose Bayardo","Hi, Chase. It\u2019s Jose. I'll fill this and Clay can chime in. But no it is a situation that is evolving rapidly and it's something that we're monitoring very closely. So I think our base exposure to this is more from a supply chain standpoint than it is from a customer revenue opportunity set. But as we did talk about in some of the prepared remarks, China is an emerging and growing market for our end products, in which we're having more and more success with our differentiated technology offerings.","We do have a very global and diversified supply chain. But as we sit here today and we're looking at an extended shutdown of the China New Year holiday system that is impacting our ability to produce certain products to a certain degree. At this point, we still have a lot of latitude to make up lost ground. But if this were to extend much longer, there are areas for instance within our fiberglass business where we have limitations in terms of the amount of resin that's on the ground at our manufacturing plants right now.","So there's some risk there but so far so good. Similar type of exposure related to drill pipe manufacturing, other businesses to a lesser extent, but so far, we think our team is managing through it pretty effectively. But still a lot of uncertainty related to the extent to which this will impact operations.","Clay Williams","Yes, yes. And those are sort of first order impacts, I'm equally concerned about second quarter impacts, which is the impact that this has on global demand for oil, what it's done in the commodity price markets. And go to the point kind of what it does to the psychology of oil and gas producers as they think about, how much to drill in 2020. So, it's \u2013 as we said, the situation remains very fluid.","Chase Mulvehill","Okay. Understood. All right. I will turn back over. Thanks.","Clay Williams","Thanks, ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. ","Scott Gruber","Yes, good morning.","Clay Williams","Hi, Scott.","Jose Bayardo","Hi, Scott.","Scott Gruber","Turning to C&P, how should we think about the C&P margin profile over the course of 2020 I'm just thinking about the interplay between the mix shift in the revenue stream towards more international and offshore, but also the cost-out program. I know, you don't want to provide too many specifics beyond one quarter out, but just any general color on how that margin profile should progress given that interplay?","Jose Bayardo","Yes, Scott, it's Jose. I'll start-off on this one. So, we're not going to really deviate from the typical way we describe in terms of thinking about margin progression for the Cap segment, which is really think of it in terms of incremental margins, basically dollar dropping between $0.25 to $0.35 down to the EBITDA line. And obviously that is dependent on the mix of the business and really what you're getting at is with the decline that we're seeing in demand for equipment in the North American market, and the solid growth that we're seeing overseas, particularly for offshore markets.","Typically, some of those offshore projects in the early phases of recovery have been slightly more challenged from a margin perspective. But as Clay alluded to, and I think we touched on a couple of times during our prepared remarks with the amount of tendering activity, we think we're starting to now see more opportunities for pricing improvements. But here as we stand today, you also need to think about the latency time associated with some of these offshore projects, where they sort of reside in our backlog, a bit longer than the short-cycle North American-centric product offering.","So what's going through converting to revenue right now is to a large degree stuff that was booked nine, 12 months ago. And so as we start capturing better pricing, we should see the incremental margin profile improve, along with being further supported by the cost-cutting initiative efforts that we have underway.","Scott Gruber","Got you. But overall, for the year do you think that we should be thinking about that are lighter than normal margins? Or given some of the pricing trends you end up doing closer to the normal incremental for the year?","Jose Bayardo","I think on a blended basis, it's more \u2013 there's a lot of puts and takes here.","Clay Williams","A lot of parts and pieces. So I would assume fairly normal.","Scott Gruber","Okay. And then maybe, if you could just give us a quick update on the rental initiative that you guys really push forward a couple of years ago particularly on the drilling tools side of the business but even more broadly just an update on the rental model initiative particularly as the international markets pick up further in 2020?","Clay Williams","Sure. Scott, you're talking about our drilling tools business, the rental -- we have a couple of general business around over, I think you're talking about the investment we've made in directional drilling technologies, rotary steerables and SelectShift. And we\u2019d tell you that we're continuing to gain traction in that. We've got three different rotary steerable tools in the marketplace including what we think is the lowest cost, a very highly differentiated rotary steerable tool.","Our SelectShift motor that we introduced last year, which is the adjustable bent-housing motor that could be adjusted downhole. A very large operator in the U.S. is testing that this week. We've had a lot of excitement around that. MWD tools also that we have in the space. So we're continuing to make progress in here, but that strategy was built on the recognition that unconventional drilling -- unconventional shales really rely on geosteering on horizontal drilling and it is a kind of enabling and key technology for unconventional technologies -- or unconventional shales that NOV has an opportunity here to be a larger provider of technology into that space.","Jose Bayardo","And maybe one thing I'd just add just so there's no confusion about it. So, as Clay mentioned, there's a number of areas where we do provide rentals of equipment. The space that we're talking about is a combination of both rentals and sales, but just want to make it clear, we're somewhat agnostic on that. But what we do want to make clear is that this is not a service that we are providing. We are enabling those directional drilling service companies out there.","Clay Williams","Yes.","Scott Gruber","Got it. Appreciate the color.","Clay Williams","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Kurt Hallead","Hey, good morning everybody.","Clay Williams","Hi, Kurt.","Kurt Hallead","Hey, Clay, thanks for that historical perspective resonates with me, that's for sure. So in the context of what you guys see going forward? And Clay, yes, NOV's always been at the forefront of evolving on the technology front and creating some value propositions that ultimately oil companies and service companies find useful. You threw out that teaser about some things that you're working on in the hopper. Can you maybe elaborate a little bit, maybe give us a little bit more of a teaser as to what kind of value propositions you may be looking at for the next leg of growth for NOV?","Clay Williams","On renewables, I'm going to defer on that. On the -- are you talking about renewals, you're talking about a traditional oilfield curve, Kurt?","Kurt Hallead","Well, yes, I'll go wherever you want to take it, Clay. So if you want to dimmer on renewables, that's fine. ","Clay Williams","Well, matter of fact, we like we much prefer to talk about things that are in the marketplace that are starting to get traction. And so in terms of what I'm most excited about really the predictive analytics products that we introduced a few years ago continue to gain traction. I think Jose referenced the growing number of rigs in our programs. We're monitoring equipment and able to predict in advance operational challenges before those happen.","NOVOS operating system for drilling rigs both land and offshore is gaining a lot of traction and really beginning to contribute meaningfully. Our wired drill pipe IntelliServ data transmission, downhole data transmission technology combined with machine learning and artificial intelligence is improving results for operators. In fact there's a great article in this month's Journal of Petroleum Technology about what we've done for a U.S. driller in space. And so I again, just to reiterate could not be more proud of sort of the enhancements that we have going on. And those are actually just a few of many, many things that NOV has introduced through the downturn.","Kurt Hallead","Got it. And then just a follow-up in the context. I appreciate that color by the way. In the context of the capital allocation you indicated that if all goes well you could be potentially in a position to kind of restart a share repo program. Just kind of curious as to the decision framework between the say the share repo versus maybe bumping the dividend a bit. Any insights would be appreciated on that front?","Clay Williams","Well, thank you. Yes with respect to where our stock has been trading, we think there's good value in that and have gone through that in a great deal detail with our board. We'll continue to look at it by the way. But we're -- I think the way we view that right now is that share repurchase is preferred but the key thing is that our capital priorities remain unchanged in all of our -- you look back to 2019 all of our actions were really geared towards continuing to improve.","We implement a lot of cost savings that are driving better EBITDA. We refinanced and paid down a lot of our debt. And so we're continuing to work towards being in achieving the credit metrics that we talked about that will pave the way for a greater level of capital return to shareholders.","Kurt Hallead","Okay. Thanks. Appreciate that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Sean Meakim","Thank you. Good morning.","Clay Williams","Good morning, Sean.","Sean Meakim","Maybe I'll try to ask the prior question just with the different angle. So in terms of the free cash guide for 2020 and uses of that cash. So we noted buybacks could be coming earlier this year. Obviously dividend is well covered. CapEx may be a bit elevated this year but that's discrete very specific.","You've also in effect supplemented some of your CapEx spend with technology, bolt-ons over time has been a big part of the strategy this cycle in particular, is something like $200 million a good run rate for bolt-ons. Just I'm trying to capture other uses of cash that could come before the buybacks in 2020?","Clay Williams","Yes. That's a great point. Sean, we're always looking at opportunities in the M&A space. And I think you've been pretty transparent about that. And so what I'd say is in 2019 and this sort of fits with my prepared comments around the fact that oilfield assets and equities have gotten a lot cheaper in the current environment. And so we're always looking at kind of what's the next best application of NOV's shareholders' capital and to the \u2013 and that M&A outlook changes from time to time as we kind of work through the year.","Blake McCarthy","Yes, Sean, this is Blake here. I'd just like to add that we both Clay and our Board gives us the flexibility like we don't have a run rate on like a target for acquisitions for a year. Every acquisition is an individual investment decision that we raised that we also compare relative to the investment in our own stock.","So at this point like I think there's a lot of opportunities out there. It's a very crowded field of sellers right now and a very limited set of buyers. So we think that there could be some attractive valuations out there but we're going to be very, very patient.","Sean Meakim","Got it. That's helpful feedback. And then \u2013 so well done to see all the efforts on working capital start to come through and convert the cash and that's been a top priority especially for Jose. So with the 4Q results and your expectation that working capital will be a source of cash again in 2020, just curious to get any updated thoughts on seasonality as we go through the year in terms of working capital?","And then just how you're targeting working capital efficiency by the end of 2020 or 2021, maybe any updated thoughts around working capital to sales or DSOs inventory turns DPOs et cetera?","Jose Bayardo","Yes. I don't think we'll get super granular in terms of specifying the targets. But what I would like to spend just a moment talking about is that we are seeing is a lot of good progress and a lot of good momentum by a lot of hard-working people across the organization. We've been at it a while but obviously the results really started to come through in the second half of 2019. And we have a lot more work to do, but with the momentum that we have and opportunities that we've identified, we're confident and our ability to harvest more cash from our working capital and just become a lot more capital efficient as we progress through 2020.","So we finished 2019 with that working capital to revenue run rate just a tiny bit over 30%, which was a good outcome for us. Now what we're really going to be focused on during 2020 and you asked the question related to seasonality. It's really going to be more focused on the average level of working capital intensity really throughout the life of the organization.","So a lot of progress through the course of the year, but if you look at the average for 2019, average the starting balance sheet and ending balance sheet apply the total annual revenue to it that was 37%. So we're trending in the right direction. But we certainly want that average to come way down during the course of 2020 and that would put us at a Q4 run rate that will be better than where we finish this year.","Sean Meakim","Fair enough. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you.","Clay Williams","You bet.","Jose Bayardo","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vebs Vaishnav with Scotiabank. Your line is now open.","Jose Bayardo","Hi, Vebs.","Clay Williams","Hi, Vebs","Vebs Vaishnav","Hey, good morning and a very good quarter. I guess just a clarification. You guys talked about $230 million of cost savings is I guess I just want to confirm that that's comparable to the $200 million number earlier that you had guys guided to?","Jose Bayardo","Yes. Yes, we found another $30 million in annualized. Both those numbers are annualized cost savings as compared to our structure in the first quarter of 2019.","Vebs Vaishnav","Got it. Okay. C&P orders, you talked about it could be somewhat lower in 1Q. Can you just talk about what kind of visibility do you have beyond that and that's both for C&P orders and Rig Tech orders? Can we sustain what we saw by in the first Q? Can we sustain what we saw in 2019?","Jose Bayardo","Well, Q4 was I think our fifth quarter in a row of book-to-bill north of one for completion and production solutions. A lot of these orders particularly for offshore projects, we have a lot of lead time into because there's a lot of work that goes into them, sometimes there's Feed studies behind them things like that. And so a lot of the near-term, the downturn that we expect in Q1 in orders in Completion & Production Solutions, it's really just the timing of how those things fall.","And -- but that, notwithstanding, what I'm most encouraged about is the fact that our tendering activity across the portions of Completion & Production solutions that are focused on the offshore remains very strong. I think we mentioned that our PFT Group, for instance, the pipeline there is twice what it was a year ago. And so it feels to us like the offshore infrastructure is continuing to move forward and that's a really good backdrop I think to move into 2020 with respect to orders for Completion & Production Solutions.","Vebs Vaishnav","Great. And maybe just one last question for me. And on the guidance for Wellbore. So, it seems like yes you guys did like only down revenues 4% versus guidance of 5% to 7% so like not very different from the guidance. You talked about North America only declined 11%. So, never spectacular in 4Q.","I was a little surprised by the guidance of down 6% to 12% for 1Q. I think like you talked about China and could have an impact. Could you just elaborate like what is guiding that I like -- and how should we think about North America versus international in the guidance?","Jose Bayardo","Yes, part of the overachievement in Q4 was higher drill pipe sales than we had expected going into the quarter. Part of our expectation for Q1 is that turns around. That's a little lumpier than some of the other businesses within Wellbore Technologies.","Clay Williams","Yes. And I'd also add you look at the guidance across the Board related to the sequential decline from Q4 to Q1. We do look back the last couple of years in terms of the fall off that we've had from Q4 to Q1. Feels like that the E&P budgeting process both within North America and the international markets is getting a little bit more prolonged and get -- certainly gets amplified when you add in a pullback in commodity prices and the fears related to the coronavirus. So, that is certainly factored in to an extent into the Q1 guidance.","Jose Bayardo","Yes, one more thing. We like a lot of business for instance has seasonality exposure in Russia and the Rockies and places like that. So, it's just -- our expectation is that that will -- those will all contribute to Wellbore Technologies moving down in Q1.","Vebs Vaishnav","Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you for taking my call.","Clay Williams","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","That concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Clay Williams for any further remarks.","Clay Williams","I want to thank everyone for joining today. And in particular I want to take the opportunity once again to thank any employees that might be listening frankly to thank you for the great job that you're doing so. Have -- hope everyone has a great weekend. Thank you.","Jose Bayardo","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

Mr. Singletary, you may begin.","Loren Singletary","Thank you, Larissa, and welcome, everyone, to the National Oilwell Varco Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. With me today is Pete Miller, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Clay Williams, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Jeremy Thigpen, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin this discussion of National Oilwell Varco's financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2013, please note that some of the statements we make during this call may contain forecasts, projections and estimates, including, but not limited to, comments about our outlook for the company's business.

Further information regarding these, as well as supplemental financial and operating information, may be found within our press release on our website at www.nov.com or in our filings with the SEC. [Operator Instructions]","Now let me turn the call over to Pete.","Merrill A. Miller","Thank you, Loren, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, National Oilwell Varco announced second quarter 2013 earnings of $1.24 per share or $531 million. Excluding onetime charges of $57 million, our earnings were $568 million or $1.33 per fully diluted share on revenues of $5.6 billion. Jeremy and Clay will provide more color on these results in just a moment.","We also announced today an intake of new capital equipment orders of $3.15 billion, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 1.5. This brings our total backlog to a record of $13.95 billion and continues to demonstrate the preference for NOV products and services worldwide. I believe these results are the product of the continued outstanding performance of all of our employees around the world.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Clay for more perspective on our operations. Clay?","Clay C. Williams","Thank you, Pete. We saw 4 positive developments at NOV for the second quarter of 2013. First, very strong order flow continued for new offshore rigs, both floaters and jackups. FPSO production equipment orders also surged. In fact, the largest turret mooring system order ever for APL contributed to its record for the quarter. Overall, Rig Technology orders of $3.1 billion, our second highest quarter ever, drove the segment's backlog to a new record level of $13.9 billion. And we expect orders for FPSOs and rigs, again, to both be very strong in the third quarter.","Second, we made excellent progress on our Robbins & Myers integration, which is being consolidated into 6 different product lines within NOV. And also good progress on Fiberspar, Wilson and CE Franklin consolidations as well. These are all complex that our folks excel at integrating, having done dozens of acquisitions over the years. Each of these acquisitions strengthened NOV's market leadership position in a particular product or market. Market leadership provides scale economies and first-mover advantages to our enterprise, providing a foundation for future growth. Jeremy will talk more about this in just a moment.","Third, we made good progress on several organic expansion initiatives underway including, and get ready because this is a really long list, a Houston facility to consolidate several locations in our Distribution Services group; construction of a new tubular inspection and coating facility to service the growing deepwater Gulf of Mexico market; expansion of our BOP manufacturing plant, which will double production this year; construction of several facilities in Brazil, including a new flagship flexible pipe manufacturing operation set to start production this quarter; expansion of our Quality Tubing, coiled tubing manufacturing operation; expansion of several aftermarket support centers for Rig Technology; construction of a new manufacturing plant in Russia; expansion of our Mission facilities -- Mission products facility in the Middle East; completion of our new XL Systems conductor plant in Nigeria; expansion of a new drill pipe weld line in Navasota, Texas; completion of a new tube plant in Tulsa; expansion of a composite piping plant in Malaysia to support FPSO rig and other marine construction; and numerous other investments and improvements.","Fourth, we have made continued sustained investments in new products and technologies to make oil and gas extraction safer and more efficient. We are developing automated pipe-handling products, like the STV for land rigs that can replace the derrickman and a new Tier 1 rig design for pad drilling. We are developing new subsea BOPs with ROV retrievable components to conduct maintenance and repair without tripping. We're testing new fit-for-purpose hydraulic pump drives for smaller rigs. We are launching new managed pressure drilling products, new downhole drilling tools and bits and continue to test new methods of optimizing rig performance, utilizing high-speed data telemetry from downhole measurements through wire drill pipe. We are testing new drill cuttings waste and water management technologies, building a new 20,000-psi BOP and pursuing dozens of other new technologies.","In a broader context, our deployment of capital into these opportunities are tailored to a world that is dramatically shifting where and how it produces oil and gas. NOV's mission is to make that extraction process safer, more efficient and less environmentally impactful. The offshore drilling industry is systematically building a fleet to satisfy growing E&P demand for rig assets to probe the 2\/3 of the planet covered by deepwater. To this end, we sold another 8 floating rig packages in the second quarter after selling 8 in the first quarter and we believe we can sell a comparable number again this quarter.","We expect success for deepwater drilling programs that will drive demand for FPSO systems to produce the volumes discovered. The second quarter saw strong order intake for subsea production products, lifting our backlog for these to over $800 million. We expect similarly strong FPSO order levels in the third quarter, following numerous FEED studies that we have underway.","In shallow waters, we have seen a sustained global effort to upgrade jackup rig fleets that resulted in 17 jackup packages in the first quarter and another 12 in the second quarter and we expect double-digit number of jackups again this quarter, in the third quarter. And particularly, 2013 will mark the eighth year out of the past 9 where NOV will sell a dozen or more offshore rig packages between jackups and floaters.","Sales of land rigs and pressure pumping equipment were very slow during the second quarter, particularly across North America. Oversupply of frac spreads and slow bleed-down of domestic rig counts and a particularly cruel Canadian breakup season have put the brakes on most land drillers' and pressure pumpers' spending plans. Internationally, we see higher demand, particularly for the Middle East and Latin America, for these projects move slowly. Nevertheless, underlying a short-term weakness is a clear shift to quick move AC-powered land rigs with safer, more automated pipe-handling systems. North American leads this trend with about 1\/3 of the fleet converted through the past decade, but we see this trend also taking hold elsewhere. The E&P community has been pleased with productivity gains offered by new rigs, the latest example of which is the move towards more pad drilling and skiddable or walking rigs which we offer.","The shale revolution accelerating the fleet upgrade also depends heavily on accurate bit directional and horizontal drilling, which in turn relies on downhole drilling motors. Our Robbins & Myers acquisition strengthened NOV's leading position in the supply of this key technology. Likewise, NOV is a key provider of hydraulic fracture stimulation equipment, another enabler of profitable shale production.","In short, 4 big macro trends in the industry, deepwater rigs, FPSOs, jackup retooling and shale technologies onshore, paint a bright future for the key provider of equipment into each in the long run. Our investments across all 4 areas speak to our confidence in the long-term outlook for each.","However, in the short run, we face challenges in several areas and we were not satisfied with our operating results during the second quarter. Our Rig Technology segment posted good sequential revenue growth, up 8%, but our leverage in margins for the group disappointed. The primary contributor was continuing congestion issues arising from accelerated delivery schedules required on many of our projects.","Last quarter, we cited extraordinary manufacturing costs we believe transitory. This quarter, we had other additional costs associated with installation work arising again from high volumes and tighter delivery schedules. Five years ago, we were contracting to deliver drillships in 36 or more months. Projects underway now target 26 to 30 months, considerably faster. From early 2008, our ramp-up of ongoing installation and commissioning jobs doubled over a period of about 10 quarters. Since early 2012, our installation and commissioning jobs doubled in 3 quarters. Our shipyard partners face similar schedule challenges and are pressing us to commission rigs in 4 months or less compared to an original plan of 6 to 7 months to catch up from construction delays at the beginning of the projects. The rapid ramp-up of 24\/7 operations and extraordinary efforts to hit delivery targets are driving higher freight and personnel costs. We have more personnel engaged in rig commissioning in Asia than ever before. This is in addition to overtime freight and outsourcing costs on heavy volumes of products moving through our plants, along with new technical class requirements and rig designs in the post-Macondo world. Overall, these factors are driving higher project costs than planned.","Second quarter Rig Technology margins were also impacted by very weak demand for land rigs and well intervention equipment across North America. Within Rig Technology, we have plants for land and pressure pumping products onshore with low volumes and under-absorption and plants for offshore products that are overflowing with work. Nothing seems to be at the optimal volume at the moment.","So here's what we're doing about it: First, we are being more assertive on commercial terms for offshore equipment, disciplined around realistic delivery schedules, more conservative project costing and better terms have renewed focus. We are beginning to reload backlog with higher margin work over the coming quarters.","Second, we are continuing to ramp resources on existing projects to get them out on time or with minimal delays. We know our customers are counting on us.","Third, we are resetting our supply chain, both internal and external and have trimmed costs wherever possible at under-absorbed plants. Expansion efforts are proceeding rapidly.","Fourth, we continue to train personnel both internal, as well as our customers' teams. We opened our fifth training facility near the shipyards in Korea. And actually, we will be opening that in a few weeks.","Number five. We continue to expand our aftermarket infrastructure and have seen steady growth in this business, including 16% sequential growth this quarter, which is positive for the mix. To complete the second quarter picture, we also faced some carcass material supply issues on flexible pipe in April and start-up costs in Brazil, which will continue through the remainder of the year. Given the challenges, we are hesitant to forecast Rig Technology margin improvement for the remainder of the year until we get through expansion initiatives, stabilize our supply chain and get a few more rigs out of the shipyard.","Let me stress, though, that we are very confident in our manufacturing team who, despite recent margin declines, continue to post the best-in-class EBIT margins unequaled by our competitors. Our team is doing all the right things to turn margins around and they will succeed. They are the best in the business.","Our Petroleum Services & Supplies segment posted a modest sequential revenue gain as a full quarter of Robbins & Myers contribution and strong growth in international markets more than offset declines in North America. The group posted a sharp sequential decline in Canada due to the harsh seasonal breakup and lower domestic sales against a generally weak North American market backdrop, which applied more downward pressure on margins. Most of our service company customers across North America, drilling contractors, pressure pumpers and directional drillers are curtailing expenditures and living off their inventories of products that we sell.","International markets offer a much brighter picture with demand high in the Middle East, North Sea and other areas. Drill pipe and composite pipe sales were down overall, but both groups began to see modest improvements in orders late in the quarter and continuing in July. Our Downhole Tools group posted lower revenues on the sharp Canadian decline, but manufactured the first bit made in Brazil during the second quarter, which made a record run.","Other groups saw stronger second quarter sales, including Mission products, Quality coiled tubing, XL Systems, Conductor Pipe Connections and Well Site Services, all benefiting from stronger international demand and higher activity in the Gulf of Mexico. Overall, most product lines are forecasting stronger third quarter results as we pull out of Canadian breakout and as international and deepwater Gulf of Mexico growth continues.","Our Distribution & Transmission segment posted solid sequential growth and improved operating margins on the addition of a full quarter of Robbins & Myers, offset by lower seasonal results from Canada, which fell at high decrementals. Integration of R&M, Wilson and CE Franklin acquisitions has preceded well across the group, in particular, the conversion of the Distribution group to a single common ERP system, which is expected to be completed next year. Continued consolidation of purchasing processes and DSCs is expected to result in steadily improving results for the segment over coming quarters.","Overall, NOV's entire organization remains focused on positioning our businesses to better execute against the extraordinary opportunities provided by the big shifts underway in the energy landscape across the globe. The world needs our customers to provide safe, clean, efficient sources of oil and gas for the 21st century and I'm grateful to the many, many NOV employees who provide great services, products and technologies to make this happen.","Thank you, all, for the great job that you do. Jeremy?","Jeremy D. Thigpen","Thanks, Clay. As Pete mentioned, National Oilwell Varco generated earnings of $1.24 per fully diluted share in the second quarter of 2013 on $5.6 billion in revenues. Excluding $57 million and pretax transaction charges, second quarter 2013 earnings were $1.33 per fully diluted share. That's up $0.04 per share or 3% from the first quarter 2013 and down $0.13 per share or 9% from the second quarter of 2012. Sales of $5.6 billion improved 6% sequentially and grew 18% year-over-year despite some real challenges in the market that included a North American rig count that declined by almost 17% sequentially and 11% year-over-year, coupled with oversupplied North American land market that has further curtailed customer spending for both our capital equipment and our PS&S product and services.","Excluding transaction charges from all periods, operating profit for the quarter was $826 million, which is up 1% sequentially and down 9% from the second quarter of last year. Operating margins on this basis were 14.7% for the second quarter of 2013 compared to 15.4% for the first quarter of 2013 and 19.2% for the second quarter of last year.","Now let's turn to our segment operating results. The Rig Technology segment generated revenues of $2.8 billion in the second quarter, up 8% sequentially and up 18% compared to the second quarter of 2012. Operating profit for the segment was $587 million and operating margins were 20.7%, down 50 basis points from the prior quarter and 300 basis points from the second quarter 2012.","On the Q1 conference call, we expected Rig Tech revenues to increase in the low single-digit percentage range as continued declines in our pressure pumping and coiled tubing equipment businesses would be more than offset by a full quarter of contribution from Robbins & Myers and continued growth in our offshore and aftermarket businesses.","Well, as expected, revenues from pressure pumping equipment continued to decline an additional 10% from Q1, which, you may recall, were down 46% from Q4 '12. But this was more than offset by other areas. Sales of coiled tubing equipment actually improved sequentially as we were able to sell and ship some units into international markets. Revenues out of backlog also increased 7% to just over $2.1 billion as we recognize gains in both our percentage of completion and our completed contracts. And perhaps, most importantly, our aftermarket business grew almost 16% sequentially, posting a new quarterly record of $611 million.","Turning to Rig Tech margins. Clay already communicated the 3 challenges that we're currently facing, including the congestion in our supply chain resulting from compressed project time lines, product mix and the incremental expense associated with the numerous strategic growth initiatives and capacity expansion that Clay referenced.","Since Clay already described the impact of the compressed project time lines on our supply chain and our margins and clearly outlined our plan to address each, I'll just briefly touch on the other 2 challenges, which we continue to view as transient issues. From a product mix standpoint, we know that demand for complete frac spreads and coiled tubing units will eventually return in the U.S. As evidenced by the Q2 reports from each of the service companies, the existing fleet of pressure pumping equipment is being utilized and will therefore need to be repaired and\/or replaced in the not-too-distant future. And on a land rig front, we're confident that demand for Tier 1 land rigs will ultimately resume in the U.S. as day rates, utilization rates and the continued migration toward pad drilling all point to the need for more sophisticated and efficient rigs.","Additionally, we're encouraged by the fact that we're beginning to see strong demand for new land rigs outside of the U.S. including Mexico, Argentina, Kuwait, the UAE and especially Saudi Arabia where we sold a couple of rigs in Q2. In short, while we may not experience a meaningful shift this year, we're confident that the product mix issue will improve. Likewise, we're confident that our investments and capacity expansions will soon enable us to improve efficiencies and expand margins.","As mentioned on the last call, the near doubling of our capacity at our BOP manufacturing facility is substantially complete and now we're working diligently to optimize our processes to drive down our internal costs of manufacturing, reduce the amount of work that we're sourcing from third parties and mitigate any expediting fees.","Additionally, we're very close to completing the new flexible pipe manufacturing facility in Brazil, which is scheduled to begin production this quarter and will ship product and recognize revenue in Q1 of next year.","Now let's transition to the Q2 capital equipment orders and our resulting backlog. As predicted, industry demand for floaters and jackups remains very strong. As evidenced by our $3.1 billion in new orders, our customers continue to recognize NOV for our industry-leading technology, our proven track record of delivering projects on time and our unmatched ability to support our equipment globally. For the quarter, we booked 7 drillships, including 6 in Brazil, 1 semi and 12 jackups. Of the 8 floaters that we booked in Q2, we secured the subsea BOP stacks on all 8, plus 1 spare stack. And of the 12 total jackups that we booked in Q2, we secured 9 of the stacks.","On the FPSO front, Clay mentioned our strong order performance in Q2. Needless to say, we're very encouraged to finally gain some traction in this space. All of these new orders were partly offset by revenues out of backlog of almost $2.1 billion, resulting in another record quarter-ending backlog of $13.95 billion, up 8% sequentially and up 24% year-over-year. Of the total backlog, approximately 93% is offshore and 95% is destined for international markets. We expect roughly $4 billion to flow out of backlog for the second half of the year.","Looking into the third quarter of 2013, we expect orders for new drilling equipment packages and floating production equipment to remain strong, and we hope to see pent-up demand for new land rigs in Latin America and the Middle East to finally materialize into orders. As of now we're planning for Rig Tech revenues to decrease in the low single-digit percentage range as continued declines in the sale of intervention and stimulation equipment and somewhat lower project revenues will more than offset continued growth in our aftermarket business. And because of the continued congestion in our supply chain, the shift in product mix and the fact that some of our larger capacity additions will not yet be fully online, we're more cautious on margins for the group, forecasting 20% to 21% for the balance of the year.","The Petroleum Services & Supplies segment posted revenues of $1.7 billion, which was up 3% sequentially but down 2% year-over-year. Operating profit declined 2% sequentially to $304 million and operating margins were 17.4%, down 90 basis points from the first quarter of 2013 and down 470 basis points from the second quarter of 2012.","On the Q1 call, we guided for relatively flat revenues in this segment as we expected the negative impact of spring break up in Canada to be offset by a full quarter's contribution from Robbins & Myers and continued growth in our international markets. We also forecasted margins for the segment to tick down a bit more as mounting pricing pressures on several products, under-absorption in a number of our facilities and the incremental expenses associated with both rightsizing our existing businesses and integrating recently acquired businesses would all put pressure on our margins.","Well, as evidenced by the 3% sequential increase in revenue and the 90 basis point decline in margins, the quarter played out about as expected with one notable exception. Owing to our recent investments to move products, service and people closer to our customers, our international revenues including Canada, improved more than anticipated, posting a 13% sequential gain.","As we enter the third quarter of 2013, we believe Petroleum Services & Supplies segment sales will improve in the low to mid single-digit percentage range as Canada comes out of breakup, activity in the Gulf of Mexico creates more demand for a number of our products and services and our international businesses continue to gain momentum.","At this point in time, we're planning for a relatively flat U.S. land market. However, we know that our customers will eventually work through their existing inventories and require more of our products and services. When that happens, our recently rightsized businesses will enable us to recognize strong flow-through on that incremental revenue. Until that time, we expect PS&S Q3 margins to remain fairly consistent with Q2 with a possibility for modest improvements as we progress through the year.","The Distribution & Transmission segment posted revenues of $1.3 billion, up almost 6% sequentially and up 66% as compared to Q2 of last year, due largely to the acquisitions of Wilson, CE Franklin and Robbins & Myers. Operating profit dollars improved 9% sequentially, to $71 million and improved 31% as compared to Q2 of 2012. And operating margins improved 20 basis points from Q1 to 5.5%.","Like PS&S, we forecasted revenues within the D&T segment to be relatively flat as the negative impact of spring break up in Canada would be offset by a full quarter's contribution from Robbins & Myers. This occurred as expected. However, we were able to generate more growth out of the U.S. operations, which improved 6% sequentially and our international operations, which improved 9% sequentially. We also suggested that segment margins could tick down slightly. However, the incremental volume helped margins to expand in Q2.","Looking into the third quarter of 2013, we expect Distribution & Transmission group revenues to grow in the mid-single-digit percentage range, primarily because of increasing activity in Canada following breakup. But despite the incremental activity, we would expect for margins to remain relatively flat in Q3 as we're absorbing some incremental costs tied to our extensive integration activities.","On the topic of integration, this group is doing a lot of heavy lifting. To put it in perspective, between NOV's legacy distribution group, Wilson and CE Franklin, we have identified 80 facilities for potential consolidation, that's 80 out of a total of 257 North American distribution facilities. Of the 80, we've already fully integrated 22 facilities, which means that we're in the same building with common inventory, common systems and common support staff. We'll complete another 3 facilities this quarter and we have partially integrated another 29, which means that we're sharing roofline; however, we're still operating on separate systems.","At the same time, we're preparing for the global rollout of a common ERP platform across the legacy Wilson and CE Franklin businesses, which we expect to be fully implemented in Q2 of next year. Once these facility consolidations are complete and the system is fully implemented, we will experience further margin expansion in this business.","While on the topic of acquisitions and heavy lifting associated with integrations, let's take a moment to provide a quick overview of our recent activity. Since the beginning of 2012, we have invested $5.3 billion in 20 acquisitions. Of the $5.3 billion, roughly 60% was tied to 3 fairly sizable and well-recognized manufacturers of oilfield equipment, Robbins & Myers, Fiberspar and Interflow. 20% was invested in 2 oilfield distribution companies, Wilson and CE Franklin; 12% was invested to more actively participate in the future growth of floating production, NKT; and the remaining 8% was invested in 14 smaller companies that brought us either a new technology that complements our existing portfolio and can be quickly and easily plugged into our global infrastructure or an existing operation in a target country that we can immediately leverage to grow our presence in that geographic market.","So let's just focus on those 5 North American-based companies that comprised over 80% of our $5.3 billion investment. While we're certainly disappointed that the continued softness in the North American land market has prevented us from realizing the full benefit of these investments, we remain supremely confident that we will ultimately generate the terms that we and our shareholders have come to expect. This confidence comes from the fact that all 5 of these acquisitions were in businesses that we have known for a long time and are perfectly complementary to our legacy businesses. Robbins & Myers is a great fit. It expanded our offering of land BOPs in our Rig Tech group and provided us with additional service infrastructure to further enhance our service and repair capabilities in the field. It also significantly improved our already market-leading positions in downhole motors and downhole progressive cavity pumps. And it added to our already broad suite of flow control products.","Fiberspar's another great fit. We were already industry leaders in providing fiberglass pipe to both the oil and gas and the marine offshore markets. Now we're also the market leader in providing spooled composite pipe to the oil and gas industry.","Interflow is a great fit. It added to our existing offering of equipment utilized in the hydraulic fracturing of wells and provided us with a market-leading position in Canada that we can utilize to promote our other products.","And Wilson and CE Franklin are each a great fit as they helped us solidify our position as the market leader in providing maintenance repair and operating expendables to the upstream oil and gas industry.","In addition to being unquestionable complements to our legacy businesses, the integration of these companies is resulting in a lower overall cost base, as well as new opportunities to grow revenue. For all 5 of these acquisitions, we've already recognized meaningful cost reductions due to consolidation of facilities and reduction of headcount. For Fiberspar, Wilson and CE Franklin, specifically, we're recognizing cost savings by leveraging our combined spend to secure additional discounts from key suppliers. For Robbins & Myers and Interflow, we're recognizing cost savings by in-sourcing products that were previously outsourced such as chrome plating of rotors and well service pumps for our pressure pumping units. And for Robbins & Myers, we're rationalizing product lines across businesses to improve supply-chain efficiencies, better manage inventories and mitigate any potential for customer confusion.","In addition to these cost-saving opportunities, we're also identifying opportunities to grow revenue. For example, we discovered that matching Robbins & Myers stator tube and bonding agent with NOV's legacy elastomer is delivering far better power suction performance than either product previously delivered. For Fiberspar, we're leveraging NOV's global sales force and distributor network to grow Fiberspar's market beyond North America. And for our new distribution business, we're now providing supply chain services to a growing number of NOV manufacturing plants and service facilities, which is resulting in revenue growth for NOV Wilson while simultaneously reducing costs for our manufacturing businesses. I could go on and on, but in summary, the relative lack of demand in the North American land market is currently preventing us from reaping the full benefit of these acquisitions today. However, for the reasons that I just outlined, we remain excited about each of our recent acquisitions. Once demand returns, we will be poised to enjoy strong incremental flow-through on our now lower cost base.","As a direct result of these integration efforts, the more favorable commercial terms that we're pushing through in our offshore rig equipment business and the ongoing supply chain improvements that we're implementing within our rig equipment business, we certainly expect to see margins expand over time. While it may take another quarter or 2 to begin to recognize the impact of today's actions, we're completely confident that we're on the right path.","Now let's turn to National Oilwell Varco's consolidated second quarter 2013 income statement. Gross margin declined 70 basis points sequentially to 23.6% due to all the reasons already discussed. SG&A increased $23 million sequentially due to the full quarter effect of Robbins & Myers. Overall, SG&A, as a percentage of sales, declined slightly from 8.9% in Q1 to 8.8% in Q2.","Transaction costs, primarily related to the Robbins & Myers acquisition, totaled $57 million. Interest expense rose $2 million to $30 million, reflecting a full quarter of interest expense on the $1.4 billion in borrowings against our revolver to fund the balance of the Robbins & Myers acquisition in Q1. Equity income in our Voest-Alpine JV was $15 million, down $4 million sequentially as demand for drill pipe and therefore green tube in the U.S. land market is somewhat limited. We expect for income from the JVs to decline even further in Q3.","Other income for the quarter was $13 million as the combination of FX, bank charges and the gains on the sale of some assets delivered a net favorable result for the quarter.","The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 31%, which is fairly consistent with Q1.","Unallocated expenses and eliminations on our supplemental segment schedule was $136 million in the second quarter, up $19 million sequentially, driven primarily by the increased volume of intersegment business.","Depreciation and amortization was $190 million, up $16 million from the first quarter.","And EBITDA, excluding transaction charges, was $1 billion or 18% -- or 18.7% of sales, marking the seventh consecutive quarter that the company generated over $1 billion in EBITDA.","Turning to the balance sheet. National Oilwell Varco's June 30, 2013 balance sheet employed working capital, excluding cash and debt, of $7.3 billion, which is up $268 million from the first quarter, as a $52 million sequential reduction in inventory was more than offset by $145 million increase in AR, which was roughly 1\/2 of the sequential increase in revenue; $105 million reduction in customer financing as costs incurred on major projects continued to outpace milestone invoicing; and a $158 million reduction in accrued taxes. Current and long-term debt, net of cash, was $1.8 billion at the end of the quarter with $4.1 billion in debt offset by $2.3 billion in cash. Of that $2.3 billion in cash, only 10% of the balance reside in the U.S. at the end of the quarter.","Cash flow from operations was $364 million for the second quarter. And during the quarter, we spent $152 million in CapEx. We also paid down debt by $230 million, made cash tax payments of $497 million and cash interest payments of $49 million. And as a direct result of our continuing commitment to return more cash to our shareholders, we made dividend payments totaling $111 million, which represented a doubling of the dividend paid in Q1.","We are pleased that the combination of our strong financial condition, a favorable market outlook, our leading market position and a track record of solid execution give us the confidence that we will generate sufficient cash flow to continue to pay a healthy dividend without compromising our ability to fund any strategic growth initiatives that can further strengthen our existing business. And barring any cyclical downturns in the global economy and\/or our industry, we fully intend to continue to return cash to our shareholders through continued increases in our regular dividend.","Now let me turn it back to Pete.","Jeremy D. Thigpen","Thanks, Jeremy. I think Clay and Jeremy have really done a good job of kind of outlining what's happening in this quarter and what we expect to happen as we move forward. I'd just like to touch real quickly on, I think, some continuing macro themes that are going to be very important. And really, it's going to be a repeat of some of the things Clay's talked about earlier. But I think these expansions that we're doing are really going to be beneficial for us as we move into 2014, especially. It really gives us a lot more efficient operations, does a lot of cool things for us on products and services and I think they'll be very, very beneficial for us.","The shale development worldwide continues. We're poised to be able to take advantage of that. We think we're in the right places. We're going to be there at the right time and I think it's going to be very beneficial.","The continuing deepwater and premium jackup story is going to continue. You see the number of jackups we've had the past few quarters. We are looking to the future. I think it's going to be very, very positive and especially in the deepwater arena. And again, people like our products and services. A lot of the things that we do we're doing to make sure that we take care of our customers, that we're delivering on time and while that might add a little bit to the expense base, we think it bodes well for our future business with these people and our future relationships.","And then, finally, is the developing FPSO and flexible story. I think we're starting to get the traction there that we thought we'd get for a long time. That's going to be the next leg of the stool for us. We're very confident that as we move into 2014 and 2015, that's going to be a much better story for us.","So I just wanted to kind of touch real quickly on those macro themes. What I'd like to do right now, Larissa, is to turn it over to our callers for any questions that they might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Jim Crandell from Cowen.","James D. Crandell - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","Guys, one of the things I think that we've talked about in the past that would lead to improving margins at Rig Tech would -- was that you were undertaking some pricing initiatives both, I think, as part of new rig packages and then in the aftermarket. I don't believe you mentioned pricing. But is this piece central to your being able to improve margins there over the, let's say, next 6 to 12 months?","Clay C. Williams","Yes, Jim, absolutely. In fact, really the beginning of the second quarter is when we begin to be more assertive on pricing and -- particularly on offshore packages and its spare parts and so something in the mid-single-digit range is kind of what we're looking at here. But that reflects -- we, for the last couple of quarters, faced cost increases in equipment that we make. And so that is leading us to push pricing with the most success offshore. I think land's going to be a little more charging. The market, as we discussed, is a little softer but we're doing what we can.","James D. Crandell - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay. My second question, Pete, is that another company, Dresser-Rand, on their call talked about the pushing out of FPSO projects and they were seeing delays in a lot of the projects they were monitoring. I know you keep up with this especially closely. Can you speak to that? And can you also speak to maybe progress that you're seeing in terms of talking about the standardization of up to a high percentage of FPSOs, which I guess would be necessary to see you develop that business similar to the way your drillship business is developed?","Merrill A. Miller","Sure, Jim. I think -- we've talked a little bit in the past about kind of pushing to the right on some of these FPSO projects. And we continue to see some pushed that way. However, we are starting to get some. And I think that's the critical point here. I mean, we would have expected probably to have a few more at this point in time, but we did get some this past quarter. I think Clay mentioned in his comments or Jeremy did what the backlog was on our flexibles and FPSO business. So we're actually pretty confident that while some will be pushing to the right, enough were coming in that it's going to really start playing better into our backlog. But even the ones that pushed to the right, at some point in time, I would guess in 2014, they're going to come in as well. So we're kind of getting a little bit of both. We're starting to get some now and we're starting to see some push a little bit to the right. I think as far as the standardization program, we continue to push it hard. It is something that we think is really going to be key to the FPSO business. We always kind of take a look at the way that the drill ship business used to look back in the mid-'90s and kind of the cost overruns and disasters that occurred. And when you kind of compare that to what's going on today in the FPSO business, you've got almost a mirror image. We've really helped the industry solve the issue with the drillships. And now we'd like to be able to do the same thing with the FPSOs and we think we're on track to do that. It's not a quick fix, though. I would be lying to say it is, but it's something that we're pushing on every day. We're working very closely with a few shipyards on it today. And I'm confident that we're going to achieve success in that arena.","Clay C. Williams","Yes, we put together a pretty comprehensive group of products now comprising an NOV package and we're starting to get a little traction with that. We also had the opportunity to review a Douglas-Westwood study recently that went in and characterized a number of FPSO projects, that found that all of them were late; all of them were over budget, typically about 1\/3; and all of them being late pushed back first to oil more than 1 year, on average. And so that's a pretty -- that's just not a very efficient way to build FPSOs. And so kind of our vision here is to bring in not necessarily more standardized FPSO. I'd prefer the word configurable. All FPSOs are going to have to be somewhat tailored to the fields that they produce, but it's not going to be one-size-fit-all. So what we're trying to do or develop is a series of configurable FPSOs that integrate an NOV package of equipment and fundamentally reshape how the industry builds FPSOs. And we think there's a lot of improvements that can be made there through that approach.","Operator","The next question comes from David Anderson from JPMorgan.","John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I was just wondering on your Rig Tech margin guidance compared to what it was last quarter. Before, you were looking for 22%, 23%; now you're looking at 20%, 21%. Where was the change -- where did the change come from your in view? Is that a market dynamic? Is it greater start-up cost? Is it manufacturing congestion? Can you just kind of walk through kind of your thought process on kind of how you got to where you are now?","Clay C. Williams","David, it's a realization. We haven't done a good job forecasting these margins for the last couple of quarters, in all candor. We expected -- we've been guiding for a long time margins to come down on Rig Technology. We go back 3 years ago and we said very explicitly every quarter that margins in the low 30s, high 20s were not sustainable and we expected those to march down into the mid-20s range. We guided in 2012 around 24%, which is where we think the long-term margins ought to be and held in the 23% range until the fourth quarter, saw a little softness in the fourth quarter. And then in the first quarter, that was moved down to 21.2%; this last quarter, 20.7%. Each quarter, each of the past 3 quarters, we've had cost that we felt were extraordinary. We could ring fence some. Last quarter, we talked about $32 million of manufacturing costs. This quarter, we ran into some unforeseen I&C, installation and commissioning, costs. What we're doing this quarter is saying, look, we know that the root cause of these things each quarter are the same. Each quarter, the actual costs are a little bit transitory and different, but the root cause is this congestion and this very aggressive delivery schedule that we signed up for. So what we're doing this quarter is sort of just dialing back to a much more conservative stance and saying, I'm not sure what all the headwinds are out there. We're doing our best to identify those but 20% to 21% in Q3 is just more realistic in view of our track record on forecasting the last couple of quarters. But let me be clear. We have a tremendous amount of talent in the manufacturing organization in Rig Technology. I cannot say enough of good things about a team that grew manufacturing and grew throughputs sevenfold over the 5 years between 2005 and 2009. And what we're seeing right now is a even more challenging ramp-up in activities in that group and a much more challenging delivery schedule where we've shaved 10 or 12 months off of the time it takes to build a rig. So what we're running into is it's a time dimension and it's showing up in different parts of our organization. So if you look back at our comments of the last couple of quarters, we've referred to BOP manufacturing. We've had issues really across all the major components going into these rigs at some form or fashion. But our folks are doing a great job working through those. I think the good news this quarter is that installation and commissioning is kind of the last thing that goes on, on one of these rigs. We're going to commission 55 offshore rigs this year. I think we've got about 33 underway right now. And so we're right in the teeth of the most challenging aspects of the I&C work and we're hopeful that the turn comes here quickly. But just to add an abundance of caution, I think, we're calling for more level margins.","Merrill A. Miller","And I might also add that we just delivered last quarter a rig in 26 months. I mean, we've got challenges, but the bottom line is we're delivering to our customers and that's what's absolute and most important thing to us is making sure that we're getting in there and getting those out. And when you start thinking about the history of drillships and getting 1 out in 26 months, that's pretty Herculean. I mean, that's really pretty phenomenal. So our guys are doing a great job on that and we feel good about the future as we look at it.","John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Now this manufacturing congestion has been obviously an issue that's been lingering here for a little bit. You've taken a lot of steps to address this. Where do you think you are -- which inning do you think you are in, in terms of addressing these manufacturing congestion issues? Can you get there in a couple of quarters? Is it a little bit longer? How do we think about how far along you are?","Clay C. Williams","I think we're at the seventh inning stretch.","Operator","The next question is from James West from Barclays.","James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I want to follow up quickly on Dave's question about Rig Tech margins. Clay, you mentioned normalized, you think, mid-20s. Is that -- should we think about as we get past these next several quarters if we are in the seventh inning stretch, as you implied there, that we can see margins approaching that level next year?","Clay C. Williams","Yes. I mean, we need a few more stars to line up. What would help is a stronger North American market, better demand for frac spreads, for well intervention equipment and for land rigs. That -- those businesses that kind of continue to see margin erosion and they're doing a great job reducing costs. We've also closed a couple of facilities around that infrastructure, but a little more demand in that area would help. Continued growth in the aftermarket will certainly help the mix. Continued growth in FPSO, which is -- that's going the right way, but that's going to be a little bit dilutive to the mix. But overall, the kind of the 24% goal is when we step back and we look at a business that has market-leading positions across a lot of critical equipment and technologies throughout the oilfield. I think that's an achievable goal that's still several quarters away. Some other complicating factors, I went through a very lengthy list of expansion projects we have underway. That covers all 3 segments, but many of those are within Rig Technology. It's just very disruptive when you're expanding a plant, pouring concrete while you're also trying to get record volumes out the door, it makes for a tough job for a plant manager. And we've got a lot of plant managers that are really shouldering a heavy load right now trying to do that.","Merrill A. Miller","Yes, another thing that will help us as we move into next year is we will be complete with the flexible manufacturing plant in Brazil. Right now, that's hurting us to the tune of about $10 million a quarter in start-up costs with no revenue to cover that up. We will start production this quarter and we expect to ship our first product to recognize revenue in Q1 of next year.","James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, okay. Good. And then just a follow-up from a really unrelated question. I was in Asia really recently, met with several of the shipyards and they were suggesting that kind of the impediment to getting rigs out the door is more on the equipment side rather than the shipyard side, which makes sense since they're not building tankers, et cetera, this cycle. I know you guys have reduced your lead times significantly. They suggested, and this is -- I'm going to consider the source here, of course, but it's the BOP, the BOP was the critical kind of component here that everything else you guys were able to deliver on time and your competitors deliver on time, but the BOP was the, I guess, the lagging factor, I guess. Number one, is that an accurate statement? And then number two, with the doubling of your manufacturing capacity, does that constraint start to really go away from the market now?","Merrill A. Miller","Well, let me take the first part of that. [indiscernible] James, I've been doing this for about 17 years and shipyards have beaten me up for 17 years, telling me that I'm the critical path. So I would suggest that you consider the source because it's a 3-way deal and the shipyard's got to say, it's not me, man, it's the other guy. And so we like what we're doing. And I would suggest if you look at the record over the last 4 or 5 years, you'll find that almost all these things are delivered on time, on budget. And that's because we're not there hitting it hard. Now I'll let Clay answer the specifics on the BOP.","Clay C. Williams","Let me stress, we appreciate our good shipyard customers and let me continue. They may be listening. But also, in fairness, we've had a few challenges but they have, too. It's just difficult for them to build a ship in 26 months as it is for us. And so one of the complexities that we face when we do installation and commissioning is we rely on shipyard labor to perform a lot of electrical construction, a lot of mechanical construction. And one of the issues we run into is -- and you can imagine, our crews have to schedule closely and articulate well with the shipyard's support crew and they're stressed throughout the system, in all fairness. So we're not perfect and BOPs have been a challenge. But I think both shipyards and all equipment providers are struggling with these much shorter delivery times. It's also made more challenging by the fact that a lot of the rig layouts and designs are different this time. The rigs that were being ordered in '06, '07 and '08, now we've lost some of the learnings. As a matter of fact, we're kind of relearning that because the layouts are somewhat different. We have new class standards coming from the customers, the new ABS 2012, DNV standards and the like are requiring modifications to what we did before and that's affecting both the shipyards, as well as NOV. So there's more complexity this time around. Look, the good news is, though, we got -- both the shipyards and NOV have got great teams who have climbed this mountain before and it's a little steeper this time. But we're climbing it, we're moving up successfully, we get better month-by-month. And so I know we're going in the right direction on this.","Operator","The next question is from Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital Markets.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to probe a little bit further in terms of the second half of the year and the progression, I think. Jeremy, when you were up at our conference back in June, you indicated that the FPSO opportunity set forth in 2013 from an order flow standpoint could approach maybe $1 billion. I'm just wondering if you can give us a quick update on that and whether you still think that's achievable?","Jeremy D. Thigpen","Yes, based on the first half order intake, that appears very achievable. Again, as Pete kind of alluded to, these orders have pushed to the right for the last couple of years and so it's been frustrating for us, but we are finally starting to get some traction. We've got enough FEED studies out there, enough quotations that are out there that we feel confident that we could match what we did in the first half of the year and deliver $1 billion in new orders.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just a follow-up on the PSS part of the business. Just like to kind of recalibrate every now and then in terms of the, give it a general sense, as what the biggest businesses are within PSS at this juncture. And are you looking at the same dynamic than everyone else is in terms of the well count, the horizontal well count really being the key driver for the PSS revenue growth during the second half of the year instead of looking at rig count?","Jeremy D. Thigpen","Yes, there's a variety of products in PS&S. I think most or probably a little more well count-driven, but some are more rig count-driven and so the former group has probably a little brighter outlook as well count and footages continue to rise. And those would include things like drill pipe bits, downhole motors, which we added to with Robbins & Myers. On the more rig count-driven businesses, areas like Well Site Services are seeing a bit of a shift as the industry moves away from more exploratory, drilling the whole acreage to more well manufacturing pad drilling sorts of activities. Part of their game plan is to pressure vendors, rental equipment companies, service providers like some of our businesses within PS&S. And so we're kind of resetting our business and adjusting to that more factory-like setting and making really good progress there as well. But overall, what's encouraging is, and I think we alluded to this in our comments, a lot of things, particularly consumables that we sell within PS&S, we're starting to see demand pick up. We've had good order rates late in June and July and so I'm actually pretty optimistic that customers who are running out of consumables are having to come back to us.","Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then if I just may, I have one final. This delivery schedule on the rigs, and you spent quite a bit of time talking this through. I guess, I'm still curious as to whether or not is this new time frame going to be -- are we basically at maximum efficiency for delivery times or you guys really think there's still some time that's going to be shaved off deliveries? How do you look at that longer term?","Merrill A. Miller","I'll take the first, Kurt. I think when you take a look at what we've been able to do with that over the years, I mean, if you go back to 1996, 1997, it was 4 years for a drillship. You go back into the 2005-2006 time frame, it's 30 -- 36 to 40 months. And then now we've been able to cut that down to 26 months, the one that I just talked about us delivering. And I think, obviously, we're a believer in the learning curve and the race without a finish line. But at some point in time, you start bumping up against reality. And I think today, getting a drillship out in 26 months, as I said earlier, is Herculean and you might get a little bit better but I highly doubt it. That's moving everything about as fast as the logistics change going to move it.","Operator","The last question comes from Edward Muztafago from Societe Generale.","Edward Muztafago - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Was just wondering if you could maybe go a little bit deeper into the Canadian cyclicality and just kind of give us an idea as to how much that impacted earnings overall in the quarter. I know obviously that was more than offset by some other issues, but just trying to think about sequentially how that plays out in 3Q?","Jeremy D. Thigpen","Yes. Overall, our revenue in Canada fell nearly $100 million sequentially. It always falls pretty significantly. And that's mostly within our Petroleum Services & Supplies group. What's particularly painful about that is that the leverage on that decline is always really, really high. So you have, for instance, some rental equipment businesses up there in Canada where the second quarter traditionally a lot of rental tools come in, go off rent. We use that quarter to fix them and to get them ready for the pickup in activity. And so it's a period of time we are incurring all of your costs, and in fact, your costs may actually go up a little bit, offset by revenue from lots of businesses that drop dramatically with the rig count. This year, Canada was particularly painful. A breakup started early in April and has continued throughout the second quarter. Starting to come back now in July, saw rig count pick up, up there. But just terrible flooding, it also impacted the Bakken in the Northern U.S. as well, to some extent. And so took a big toll in our operations. But PS&S is the segment the most hardest hit by that phenomenon and then Distribution also saw big decline and high decrementals for Rigs business as well.","Edward Muztafago - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","The revenue number there is actually very helpful. And just wondered perhaps on a little bit of a higher level, can you talk about -- we've seen something like 13 new build floaters awarded through mid-July. As you kind of talk to the shipyards and you partly alluded to what the outlook is like for the third quarter, but do you think the run rate that we're seeing right now is sustainable through the rest of the year? And maybe if you want to just define a little bit as you look out into 2014, there has been some chatter about an increased interest in a mid-quarter retirement cycle, maybe how that plays into your longer-term outlook?","Jeremy D. Thigpen","Yes. The quarter before last, I think we dealt into this topic. We're big believers in fundamentals here. So if the drilling contractors are making good day rates and that's supported by high oil prices and have lots of good unexplored prospects in the deepwater around the world, we're simple guys. We think that's going to result in a lot more deepwater drilling rigs. And so for that reason, yes, we continue to be bullish. What, I think, we find are drilling contractors who tell Wall Street, \"Well, we're not so sure. Maybe we're kind of loaded up. There's a lot of capacity coming in.\" Which there is, but, heck, there's a lot of oil to be explored for, too. And I think we all have perfect visibility into the supply of new rigs flowing into the marketplace over the next several years. What the market has less visibility into is demand from the E&Ps. But with both WTI and Brent trading over $100 a barrel, as well as millions of unexplored acreage out there left to be prospected, we think that sets up a pretty good set of fundamentals to drive sustained demand over the long haul. So, yes, I'm going to tell you, I think the economics on building rigs today is strong. I hear kind of mid- to high teens unlevered returns and levered returns up in the 20s. And to me, that's probably pretty attractive, pretty good opportunity for a lot of these drillers to grow organically. And we think that's going to be the engine that's going to continue to fuel the order book at NOV.","Edward Muztafago - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","And I guess, no commentary perhaps on the back half in terms of just the run rate, the sustainability of new orders here?","Clay C. Williams","Well, let me reiterate what we said in the opening comments. We think Q3 will be strong. We sold 8 floaters in each of the first 2 quarters of the year. There's a possibility we could sell another 8 in Q3 as well. And then I think I also specifically said double-digit number of jackups, too. So, yes, we're calling for another strong order. I don't know if we'll repeat $3.15 billion, but it should be good.","Operator","Mr. Miller, do you have any final remarks?","Merrill A. Miller","I'd like to thank everybody for calling in, and we look forward to talking to you in late October with the results of our third quarter. Thank you very, very much.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

Now, let me turn it over to Clay.","Clay Williams","Thank you, Loren. And welcome, everyone, to version 2.0 of National Oilwell Varco\u2019s first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. This morning we announced that the company earned $0.76 per fully diluted share in its first quarter ended March 31, 2015, excluding charges related to a voluntary retirement program, the write-down of Venezuela assets, and a discrete non-recurring foreign tax exposure, fully diluted earnings per share were $1.14, down 33%, sequentially, down 12% year-over-year excluding other items from all quarters.","Revenues were $4.8 billion in the first quarter of 2015, down 16% sequentially, and down 1% year-over-year. Consolidated operating profit excluding other items was $692 million or 14.4% of sales in the first quarter. Decremental operating leverage was 37% sequentially. First quarter EBIDA excluding charges was $837 million or 17.4% of sales. This compares to $1.2 billion in the prior quarter and $1 billion in the quarter of last year, excluding other items from all periods.","Business in the first quarter of 2015 declined significantly in response to lower oil prices. We entered 2015 with oil prices half of what they were just a few short months. Now, all commodity prices signal producers to add or diminish supply, and oil is no exception. So in the first quarter with global supplies outpacing global demand by 1.5 million barrels per day, the oil price signal rolled through our industry like thunder and thunderstruck participants responded vigorously.","Spending is falling in almost all regions, driving the worldwide rig-count down by a third since September. The rate of decline of active rigs, most acute across North America is breathtaking and unequaled in prior downturns. NOV saw activities and orders slow in just about all areas of our business and all of our units are experiencing pricing pressure. Most of us in oil and gas industry have been through downturns many times before and have honed our skills at rapidly adjusting spending through the cycles. So, following record results for National Oilwell Varco in the fourth quarter of 2014, our revenue declined 16% in Q1, and is expected to decline further for at least in the next few quarters.","There\u2019s been much debate as to the shape and timing of the eventual oil price recovery. We don\u2019t know if we are in for a v-shaped, or a u-shaped, or a w-shaped recovery, but we will all know soon, because the industry is conducting its first grand global empirical test of price elasticity of the supply of oil. What we do know is that North American oil shales are emerging as the new swing source of oil. Since 2011, in a $100-per-barrel price environment, North American oil shales grew about 4.5 million barrels per day, while the rest of the world posted a 0.5 million barrel per day production decline.","We know individual shale wells decline exceedingly quickly, 8 to 10 times the rate of conventional resources. We know that the sharp and rapid decline in the addition of fresh and new producing wells of all kinds will result in diminished global oil production over time. We also know that the excess productive capacity around the world, the oversupply, is, thankfully, just a few percent, far less than my first downturn in the 1980\u2019s. We also know that global economic activity, which drives oil demand, is not strong, and that lower oil prices will act as an economic stimulus to many economies.","The facts as we know them point to a pretty good foundation for an eventual recovery. All wells, all fields and all basins left wanting for investment inevitably decline. And economies need more energy to grow, so demand for oil will grow, driven by the engine of people desiring a better standard of living. Eventually supply and demand curves will cross, and we will see oil prices signaling producers to get back to production growth. We just don\u2019t know when. And frankly, we cannot wait for the eventual recovery.","Therefore 2015 will be a year for restructuring at NOV. Given our short-term lack of visibility into the timing of the recovery, our approach will be to focus on costs, without sacrificing our long-term opportunities. We are managing our infrastructure to the market, reducing costs as utilization levels permit. This began in earnest in the first quarter, when we reduced SG&A 8%, coming off exceedingly high levels of utilization last year. We started with a voluntary early retirement program for our long-serving employees, and this is being followed by reductions in facilities and workforce as utilization dictates.","We are working to insource more of our production needs, as utilization declines across our manufacturing plants, with a goal of preserving as much work as possible for our own plants and our own teams. We expect to pull in about 650,000 machining hours from our vendors this year and another 600,000 machining hours next year. In our Rig Systems segment, for example, and comparable efforts are under way in Wellbore Technologies in the other segments as well.","While reductions in contract labor, overtime, and shifts help mitigate decrementals, we will face under-absorption overall. We are also under pricing pressure and requests to cancel work, which we are vigorously opposing. We are seeking to structure discounts around volume-related rebates tied to payments and expanded product purchases, in effect picking our points, to try and win greater share, defend volumes, and improve absorption in our plants. We don\u2019t want our customers to get out of the habit of buying from us, to maximize our market position when the inevitable recovery comes.","This downturn is an opportunity to become better. We have long focused on operational excellence, continually evolving to utilize modern techniques to be the best manufacturer. This downturn will drive us to improve efficiency in a supply chain straining through the last decade to accommodate extraordinarily high demands from our customers.","Through the last decade NOV responded with an exceptional level of effectiveness, to a macro-cycle upgrade to the fleet of equipment the industry relies on; the next challenge for us is to retrench and transform, to pivot to new opportunities that are emerging, and to continue to lead the industry. To that end, we will continue to invest in numerous long-term growth opportunities, to execute our long-term strategic plan.","Technology and equipment have transformed our industry to enable accessing new frontiers like deepwater and to access new sources of hydrocarbons from poor quality reservoir rocks like shales. NOV\u2019s DNA is to continue to apply purposeful innovation, to continually expand the opportunity set of attractive investments for our customers.","This is a tough market, with tough challenges, but they are not new to us. Given the difficult oil price backdrop, our first quarter orders were weak for our Rig Systems segment. We booked orders of $236 million, half of what we booked in the fourth quarter of 2014. We also booked a $99 million adjustment to our backlog related to FX, related to contracts denominated in foreign currencies. Since the costs associated with these are also denominated in those same foreign currencies, there is no margin impact - percentage impact, only a revenue impact.","Shipments out of backlog totaled $2.25 billion, yielding an ending backlog of $10.4 billion, down 17% sequentially. The quarter included two jackup packages and a handful of land rigs, mostly targeting Middle East and Latin American markets.","Our outlook for orders for the second quarter is marginally better, but will remain slow as customers who need equipment are taking their time ordering. Areas of comparative strengths are seen in platform rigs, fleet spares, components and software upgrades to improve tripping efficiency offshore, think iron roughnecks and handling tools, and BOPs, land rigs and well service rigs for Latin America and the Middle East.","We continue to see growth in SPS projects, despite some being postponed, some rigs being stacked and or retired which had planned SPSs, and others seeing their scope reduced. We believe contractors are seeking to differentiate the efficiency of their offshore rigs in a crowded marketplace. And this will shape our near-term offshore rig orders, and that a desire for Tier 1 AC land rigs in international markets will characterize the next few quarters for land demand. We also expect many more offshore rig retirements, in addition to the 30 plus already announced, which will speed the inevitable fleet high-grading process, and bring offshore rig supply\/demand into better balance.","Many of our North American land customers indicate they want to pursue upgrading their fleets to Tier 1 in advance of a potential 2016 recovery. In the short run, though, we expect continued soft orders as contractors struggle with lower day-rates, cannibalize components off of stacked rigs, in lieu of placing new orders with NOV.","Installation and commissioning activity around our existing offshore newbuild backlog remains very high. However, in several instances, we and the shipyards are working with the drilling contractors to delay rig deliveries. This helps the drilling contractors postpone stacking costs on un-contracted newbuild deliveries, and it will help us manage supply chain, freight, and installation and commissioning costs more effectively, and level load across our operations. We are also curtailing activity related to our Brazilian rigs, which I\u2019ll speak to more in just a moment.","As a consequence, we are in effect shifting offshore revenue out of backlog into subsequent quarters. This will impact our near-term Rig Systems segment revenue forecast. Near-term total revenues for the Rig Systems segment will decline significantly in the second quarter, due to this effect, as well as the expectation of lower revenues associated with land rig shipments in the second quarter. We expect second quarter revenues for this segment to be in the range of about $1.8 billion, down about 30% sequentially.","Within our backlog at March 31 are orders for 22 drilling equipment packages for floating rigs for Brazil, totaling $3.3 billion. At the time of our last call the ultimate customer for these rigs, a financing vehicle 10% owned by Petrobras called Sete, was within a day or two of securing long-term financing to get current on payments to the Brazilian shipyards building these rigs, which are NOV\u2019s contractual customers.","Unfortunately, the corruption scandal in Brazil was linked to Sete just prior to signing, which resulted in the banks backing away from the proposed financing package then on the table. Since then, our Brazilian shipyard customers have come under significant financial stress due to a lack of payments from Sete. Currently, we understand that the banks and shareholders have granted Sete a 90-day window to seek a solution to its financing struggles, and we know that there is an intense level of activity around securing permanent financing solution involving several banks.","The origin of the rig building program in Brazil arises from public policy goals set forth by the government to foster a local oilfield services and shipyard industry, to employ more Brazilians, and thus far Petrobras remains contractually committed to employing these locally built rigs once they are completed. There are specific requirements within the lease concessions for pre-salt blocks granted to Petrobras by the Brazilian government, which require local content ranging from 37% to 55%.","According to the Brazilian press, these local content requirements have created over 120,000 jobs in the country. We therefore continue to believe that there is considerable political pressure in Brazil to ultimately get these rigs built. We believe these rigs will eventually get built. We are engaged with our shipyard customers in Brazil to adjust manufacturing schedules for the now delayed programs, and are slowing activity pending payment.","Our contracts are still in place, and the down payments and progress billings we have achieved thus far exceed our investment as per our contracts. One of the four shipyards we are working for has continued to pay us due to their Asian partner stepping in to finance operations there. During the first quarter, we recognized $172 million in revenues associated with the program, about 7% of total segment revenues, but this will slow substantially for at least the next couple of quarters, contributing to our lower guidance for Rig Systems Q2 revenues.","And apart from the derricks on these rigs, the components we have built in WIP are marketable in the event of ultimate default, which we still consider unlikely.","Overall, we remain confident in the eventual monetization of our existing contractual Rig Systems backlog, both in Brazil and elsewhere, and are working with customers to modify schedules to accommodate the challenges they are facing, and to ease the stress on our supply chain.","Turning to our other segments, revenues from Rig Aftermarket fell 15% sequentially, more than we expected, as drilling contractors curtailed expenditures sharply, much more than we anticipated. We typically see the first several weeks of the year slow seasonally as contractors set budgets, and then see spare parts orders and repair services pick up in March, as contractors begin work under their new annual budgets.","However, this year, the March pickup never came and April has remained soft. We expect flattish sequential revenues in second quarter, with rising SPS work and relatively strong demand in the Middle East, offset by mounting price pressure on repair, services and drilling expendables, which will drive margins lower by a couple of hundred basis points. Our strategy within Rig Aftermarket is unchanged, to capitalize on our leading and growing installed base of NOV equipment, to provide OEM support close to our customer\u2019s rigs.","The Wellbore Technologies segment declined 23% sequentially, with all major business units posting declines and significant price pressure tied to drilling activity. Drill pipe sales declined the most, coming off an exceptional fourth quarter, which was near our record, and orders for drill pipe slowed to a trickle in the first quarter as most operators are cannibalizing pipe from idled rigs in lieu of buying new pipe.","Looking in to the second quarter, we expect Wellbore Technologies to decline in the double-digit percentage range at high decremental margins, as discounting continues to outpace the speed of our cost reductions. One bright spot within Wellbore Technologies is our IntelliServ wired drill pipe unit, and new closed-loop drilling automation services through our Dynamic Drilling Solutions business unit that continue to attract operator interest through demonstrated reductions in drilling times. We are very excited about the potential of this technology to transform drilling efficiency, and materially improve E&P drilling economics in shales, in the deepwater, and in other basins around the globe.","Completion & Production Solutions segment revenues declined 28% sequentially, at 28% decremental margins, as most products within this group saw sliding demand. Our backlog for the Completion & Production Solutions segment declined 18% during the first quarter, as net new orders of $327 million were offset by revenues out of backlog of $563 million, and an FX adjustment of $81 million. Demand for composite pipe and process & flow products saw book-to-bill levels close to 1 in the first quarter, but we saw sharp declines in pressure pumping equipment demand.","Orders for flexibles and FPSO products also fell short of revenues out of backlog. Ending backlog for the first quarter was $1.46 billion. We were pleased that our FPSO turret business achieved record revenue levels in the first quarter, with great progress on existing projects. Interest by IOC\u2019s and NOC\u2019s in our FPSO strategy has risen considerably through the past few quarters, as operators are actively seeking to pioneer new ways of constructing these complex vessels to achieve on-time, on-budget deliveries and, ultimately, improve development economics.","The industry appears to be latching on to our standardization and modular construction thesis, recognizing that we must do things differently to develop the billions of barrels that have been discovered in the deepwater. Design one, build two, is a great idea. We are engaged on a dozen or so projects. The project awards are going slowly as most are conducting extended FEED studies to reengineer and recalibrate costs, and waiting for deflation in the supply chains. We continue to believe that NOV\u2019s extensive experience in managing complex equipment\/vessel integration projects in shipyards positions us well to pioneer a better way in FPSO construction.","As we expected, our pressure pumping product sales fell sharply during the first quarter, as customers delayed picking up their orders, and pressed hard for pricing concessions. We closed three facilities within the unit during the first quarter and continued to reduce costs within our supply chain. North America was hit hardest, but the Middle East and other international markets are more stable, a recurring theme for many of our businesses.","Looking to the second quarter, we expect revenues to decline a few percentage points, but margins to fall further as the full force of discounting kicks in. Obviously, our second quarter outlook across all our segments is very guarded and our situation is fluid. While we face a difficult market near-term, we will be looking for revenues to stabilize across Rig Aftermarket, Wellbore Technologies, and Completion & Production Solutions in the second half of the year, and we will manage Rig Systems to the backlog and the work available in that marketplace.","The significant drilling cost deflation underway will benefit producers, a modest oil price rebound coupled with lower drilling costs may bring about some green shoots of activity in the second half, and we\u2019ll be watching closely, but, as I said, we plan to manage to whatever size the market is, across all our businesses quarter-by-quarter.","Prior downturns in our industry have provided great opportunity for those with capital and the foresight to look through near-term adversity. NOV is a remarkable franchise. We are also at the forefront of several transformative trends in the oil business. Closed loop drilling automation and FPSO supply chain management are two I mentioned earlier.","Add to the list the key global supplier of pressure pumping and coiled tubing technologies which have enabled hydraulic fracture stimulation and the shale revolution: gas-tight conductor connections; thermal desorption technologies to clean up drill cuttings for safe disposal; RFID technologies to track the myriad of assets used by this industry; flexible pipe systems for subsea developments; water desalination, de-oiling and sand separation technologies; reeled composite pipe for flowlines; bits, drill pipe, and top drives used to set a world record on an extended reach well exceeding 8 miles a few weeks ago; permanent magnet advancements for rotating equipment.","Although the industry is still in the early innings of upgrading to AC electronic controlled rigs, we are at work designing the next generation of drilling rigs, and we will be there with new and better technology for the inevitable upturn. We continue to invest in technology and new products to grow organically, and we will continue to pursue interesting acquisitions in this environment, making sure that we are very disciplined about valuations in view of the current market challenges. We closed two transactions so far in 2015, and have several more negotiations underway. We have also retired 10% of our shares outstanding through the past several months given our stock price downturn, because we view it as an extraordinary opportunity to reduce our cost of capital in a historically low interest rate environment.","Our debt increased $1.1 billion as a result, but with our $3 billion cash balance, net debt is still only $1.2 billion, about 6% of capitalization. I will note too that, we are currently slowing our share repurchases in view of some potential acquisition candidates coming into sharper focus. I\u2019m proud of the leadership NOV employees provide in this endeavor. While the current market is very tough, we are well positioned, with strong financial and operating resources and an industry-leading installed base of complex equipment in need of continuing close OEM aftermarket support.","I\u2019m grateful to all of the great NOV employees who are remaining focused on taking care of our customers through this difficult time. We announced last week that our CFO, Jeremy Thigpen, has left us to become CEO at one of our important offshore drilling customers, Transocean Ltd. We appreciate Jeremy\u2019s leadership through 18 years of service here, in both finance and operations, and we wish him and Transocean the very best.","Our very talented Chief Accounting Officer, Scott Duff, has agreed to serve as Interim CFO, as we conduct a search process for our next CFO, and our long-serving Vice President of Investor and Industry Relations, Loren Singletary, here with me today will pinch-hit on today\u2019s call to step up through the detailed financial results by segment.","So with that, let me turn it over to Loren.","Loren Singletary","Thank you, Clay. National Oil Varco Rig Systems generated revenues of $2.5 billion, down 1% sequentially, but up 12% compared to the first quarter of 2014, as we continued to execute on our backlog completing 14 offshore drilling equipment packages in the quarter. Operating profit for the segment was $488 million, yielding an operating margins of 19.3%, down 70 basis points, both sequentially and year-over-year. EBITDA was $511 million, or 20.3% of sales.","Q4 to Q1 offshore revenues, which represent 75% of the segment total declined slightly and land revenues, which represent 25% of the segment total remained flat. Segment margins fell slightly as bad debt accruals more than offset cost reduction efforts in the quarter.","Now, let\u2019s discuss capital equipment orders and resulting backlog for National Oil Varco\u2019s Rig Systems. In the first quarter, we received $263 million in new orders and recognized $2.25 billion of revenue out of backlog and an FX adjustment of $99 million, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.11 times and a quarter-ending backlog of $10.4 billion, down 17% sequentially.","As Clay mentioned earlier, orders were half of what they were in Q4, and Q1 was one of the first quarters in recent history, where land bookings outweighed offshore bookings. Of the total $10.4 billion in backlog, approximately 91% is offshore and 92% is destined for international markets.","As we move into the second quarter of 2015, Clay noted that NOV Rig Systems revenues will decline as much as 30%. We expect revenue out of backlog to slow to the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion from Q1\u2019s $2.25 billion, as we ship fewer land rigs and see the impact of accommodating certain customer-requested delivery modifications for offshore newbuilds. We believe margins will decline into the mid-teens percentage from 19.3% in the first quarter.","Our goal in working with our customers on these scheduled modifications - scheduling modifications to maximize the margins on contracts we have in hand, and to maintain our core team capable of exceptional performance. This is the right thing to do for our franchise and for our shareholders.","As we have noted many times before, NOV and our shipyard partners have been extremely busy scaling to large numbers of offshore floating newbuild projects through the past few years, most with build schedules of less than three years, which is a considerably faster pace than the four-year plus delivery schedules that characterized orders from 2005 through 2008. This shift have results in - has resulted in higher costs from a supply chain and NOV infrastructure straining to accommodate these more aggressive delivery schedules.","Our record results of 2014 to meet these demanding deliveries drove up over time and air freight and extended our supply chain past optimal cost. Spreading the work out now to later quarters gives us time to manage our supply chain cost down to achieve lower pricing from our vendors to avoid excess over time costs, and to tackle these projects with our core team in a more efficient, more measured way.","And as Clay noted, it helps our customers cope with their stacking cost on certain uncontracted rigs. Our revenue recognition out of backlog will likely be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion for the next few quarters, and we expect total segment revenues for the second quarter to be in the range of $1.8 billion. Our outlook for further offshore newbuild remains subdued for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, we do expect to see some orders for offshore capital equipment as our customers seek efficiency-driven upgrades and spare parts to support their existing rig fleets and SPS activities that will occur.","On land, we expect to see continued demand for Tier-1 AC-driven land rigs in international markets, particularly the Middle East and Latin America. Given our outlook, we are aggressively managing costs down on all fronts. National Oil Varco Aftermarket generated revenues of $719 million in the first quarter of 2015, down 15% sequentially, and down 4% compared to the first quarter of 2014. Revenues fell harder than anticipated as the precipitous decline in land rig activity and stacking of relatively younger rigs negatively impacted demand across the aftermarket business.","Operating profit for the segment was $199 million, resulting in operating margins of 27.7%, down 110 basis points sequentially, but up 220 basis points year-over-year. Decremental margins were 35% and EBITDA was $206 million, or 28.7% of sales. While there is some seasonality in first quarter revenues for aftermarket, the sequential decline was driven primarily by depressed activity levels. Uncertainty in the marketplace led our customers reduced spending and consuming existing inventories, cannibalize existing idle rigs, postpone repair and upgrade work, while they watched and waited like us for signs of market normalization.","Margins contracted on a reduced volume and the discounts made in selected areas to maintain existing customer relationships. Land represented an increased percentage of total segment revenues, up 20% in the fourth quarter to 25% in the first, driven by higher activity in Asia and the Middle East. Additionally, we recently expanded our service and repair facilities to align more closely with our customers\u2019 operations, including two new facilities in the United States to support activity in the Permian and the Marcellus.","As we move into the second quarter, we believe National Oil Varco Aftermarket revenues are stable and will remain flattish with a slight increase in spare parts and rising SPS work, offset by rising discount pressures. Revenues from SPS activities, which occur on a five-year basis, have become much harder to time as some likely candidates for survey work are stacked or retired amidst the challenging offshore market conditions, but nevertheless, our SPS project count is set to grow in the second quarter.","Operating margins will remain under pressure and may decline slightly from Q1\u2019s 27.7% for several reasons. In the second quarter, we will see the full effect of the discounts we made for key customers in the first quarter, mostly in repair and services and competitive drilling expendables. And we anticipate our customers to choose lower-margin repair work over refurbishment programs, preferring to do the minimum required for maintenance versus large SPS\u2019s.","Our longer-term outlook for this group remains very bright, owing to the significant upgrade in rig technology at work in newer, more modern fleets, with higher mix of NOV equipment, and a much larger installed base, which carries a pressing need for greater OEM aftermarket support.","For the first quarter of 2015, National Oil Varco Wellbore Technologies generated revenues of $1.2 billion, down 23% sequentially and 8% compared to first quarter of 2014, reflecting drilling activity declines. Operating profit for the segment was $124 million, resulting in operating margins of 10.6%, down 750 basis points sequentially and 690 basis points from the first quarter of 2014. Sequential decrementals were 42.5%, which were slightly better than anticipated owing to swift cost reduction efforts across the board.","EBITDA for the segment was $229 million, or 19.6% of revenue. NOV Wellbore Technologies carries a disproportionally large amount of the company\u2019s total $190 million D&A load due to intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions, manufacturing and service facility infrastructure and a sizeable rental fleets in two of the segment\u2019s larger business units.","Drilling activity drives NOV Wellbore Technologies. Though drilling activity has not completely abated, average global rig count fell 25% from the fourth quarter average. National Oil Varco Wellbore Technologies may be a global business, but it has a significant exposure to North America, where rig count declines were the most severe. In the first quarter, U.S. rig count activity fell by nearly 800 rigs, declining 66 rigs per week on average. In the 2008 and 2009 during the financial crisis, the pace of rig count declines averaged 55 rigs per week at its steepest point.","In Canada, an unseasonably early break-up meant rig count was down 40% below the previous year. Our largest businesses were some of the most affected by the depressed activity levels, namely: downhole tools, bits, motors; drill pipe; and solids control and waste management equipment. In the current environment, our customers are pressing hard for discounts, and are committed to preserving our market-leading - and we are committed to preserving our market-leading positions during the downturn. We are currently experiencing the fastest rig - land rig count - U.S. land rig decline in 20 years, and the outlook remains tenuous.","Looking into the second quarter of 2015, we believe Wellbore Technologies will be down mid-teens percentage from $1.2 billion on lower activity levels, and margins could decline to mid-single digits from 10.6% with mid-40% decrementals, similar to the first quarter sequential leverage. Fewer rigs drilling fewer wells imply less demand for Wellbore Technologies\u2019 tools and services. Where there is demand, competition will be high and pricing pressure will be very fierce.","We are actively reducing cost across the segment to reflect reduced activity levels, but cost reductions lag revenue declines as we rightsize service and manufacturing infrastructure. Nevertheless, the cost reduction measures we are taking will better position us when the market does turn. In today\u2019s lower commodity price environment, our customers remain focused on improving economic and drilling efficiencies.","At NOV, we are developing new technologies that will help them achieve their goals, such as: Tectonic drill bits, which we are introducing at next week\u2019s OTC, new proprietary threads on drill pipe, and closed loop drilling automation systems. We continue to believe that new products are the lifeblood of any technology company, and we\u2019re proud to say that even in today\u2019s down market, our new technologies are gaining traction, and we will continue to innovate on next-generation technologies.","National Oil Varco Completion & Production Solutions generated revenues of $948 million for the first quarter of 2015, down 28% sequentially and 5% compared to the first quarter of 2014. Operating profit for the segment was $108 million, resulting in an operating margins of 11.4%, down 480 basis points sequentially and 290 basis points year-over-year.","Sequential decrementals were 28%, and first quarter EBITDA for the segment was $163 million, or 17.2% of sales. Q4 to Q1, demand declined almost equally for both shorter-cycle activity-driven revenues and revenues from backlog. Declines were primarily driven by nearly 40% reduction in revenues for higher-margin offshore completion equipment, as strong fourth quarter deliveries did not repeat in the first quarter and North American completion activity slowed. Segment revenues related to production - both on land and offshore were also negatively impacted by reduced E&P spending.","Now, let\u2019s discuss our capital equipment orders and resulting backlog for National Oil Varco Completion & Production Solutions. In the first quarter, we received $327 million in new orders and recognized $563 million of revenue out of backlog along with an $81 million FX adjustment, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.58 times and a quarter-ending backlog of $1.5 billion, down 18% sequentially.","Orders were down 30% from the $469 million won in Q4, although orders for composite pipe and processing technologies showed relative strength in the quarter. Of the total $1.5 billion backlog, approximately 69% is offshore and 82% is international.","As we move into the second quarter, we believe revenues will tick down slightly from the $948 million recognized in the first quarter. We expect revenue out of backlog to be in the range of plus or minus $500 million. Given the current market uncertainty, we anticipate reduced demand and increased pricing pressures for equipment and technologies across the segment, which will reduce margins into the high-single digits, which implies low-20% decremental margins.","As in our other segments, we are actively reducing cost in the NOV Completion & Production Solutions to reflect lower levels of activity. Our order outlook for onshore completion equipment remains soft, particularly for the North American pressure pumping market as customers struggle with low utilization of existing equipment. We see customers cannibalizing spare parts and using existing stock wherever possible, but expect demand for repair and maintenance to return well in advance of orders for full frac spreads and coiled tubing units.","By nature, the FPSO-related bookings are uneven quarter-to-quarter. In today\u2019s lower commodity price environment, we expect orders to slow, as customers recalibrate cost for offshore production projects, although FEED-related activities and interest in pre-salt work continues.","Now, let\u2019s discuss our financial statements. Working down the Consolidated Statement of Income for the first quarter of 2015, you will see across the gross margin declined 270 basis points sequentially and 200 basis points year-over-year to 24.4%. SG&A decreased 8%, or $42 million sequentially, as we continue to make efforts to reduce costs across all business segments.","As a percentage of revenue, SG&A was up 90 basis points sequentially and 40 basis points year-over-year to 10.1%. Other items were $122 million in the quarter due to charges related to our early retirement plans. Interest expense and interest income were flat sequentially at $26 million and $5 million respectively. As compared to 2014, interest expense remained $26 million and interest income increased $1 million to - from $4 million.","Equity income in our Voest Alpine JV decreased $7 million sequentially to $9 million, as demand for casing and drill pipe, and therefore green tube, moderated. Compared to the first quarter of 2014, equity income slightly decreased by $1 million. For the second quarter and full-year 2015, we believe year-over-year equity income will continue to fall as demand for casing and drill pipe decreases. Other expense for the quarter was $56 million, which represented a $36 million delta sequentially primarily due to fluctuations in foreign currencies and write-offs.","The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 37.6%, which was an additional 9.5% over the 28.1% rate that we posted in the fourth quarter of 2014. Excluding discrete items in the quarter, the company\u2019s effective tax rate would have been 28.9%. We believe that a 30% to 31% effective tax rate for NOV continues to be a realistic estimate for the remainder of 2015. If you now quickly turn to the first supplemental schedule, you will see that eliminations were $541 million for the quarter, down slightly from $556 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Unallocated expenses and eliminations were $227 million in the quarter, down $2 million sequentially on lower volume of inter-segment revenues.","And finally, if you turn to the last supplemental schedule, you will see that depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $190 million, down $9 million from the fourth quarter of 2014 and $1 million from the prior year. EBITDA for the first quarter, excluding other items, was $837 million, or 17.4% of sales. Turning to the balance sheet, our March 31, 2015 balance sheet employed working capital excluding cash and debt of $5.8 million, up $355 million, or 6.6% sequentially.","Several factors contributed to the increase and we expect working capital to convert to cash and begin to fall later in the year. The largest impact stems from our net of costs in excess of billings, and billing in excess of costs, and customer prepayments, which together make up the level of customer financing of our working capital and are tied to prepayments and progress billings. As orders have declined, down payments have declined, and our progress on projects is outpacing our progress payments, which we saw in the previous downturn of 2009, and which will continue for the next few quarters.","Working capital impact of this was $425 million in the first quarter. Offsetting items include our accounts receivable, which decreased $392 million, or 9% sequentially due to lower revenues. Inventory increased $97 million, or 1.8% sequentially, mostly due to the transfer of certain short-lived downhole rental tools from PP&E into inventory. While inventory is declining across most businesses, others are still receiving components ordered into construction schedules.","So we expect inventory to begin to decline later in the year as we adjust our supply chain. We also had some customers postponing receipt of orders due to market conditions, which should turn around in this quarter. Also leading to a sequential increase in working capital, accounts payable, accrued compensation and accrued liabilities decreased $419 million, which they do every year in the first quarter.","For the quarter, the company generated $114 million in cash flow from operations. Capital spending for the first quarter was $130 million, down 44% sequentially. In the quarter we also made dividend payments of $85 million and we spent $1.33 billion to repurchase 24.5 million shares for a total of $2.1 billion in share repurchases under our $3 billion authorization. To fund the share repurchases in the quarter, we borrowed $1.1 billion, using our commercial paper program, which increased total debt to $4.2 billion. And our net debt capitalization to a very manageable 6.4%. As a result, we entered the first quarter of 2015 with cash balance of $3 billion, down $512 million sequentially. Of that $3 billion in cash, almost 7% of the balance was in the U.S. at March 31, 2015.","In summary, we saw spending and orders slow in all areas of the business is lower commodity price drove down E&P capital spending and drilling activity. And we have a challenging quarter ahead as we see the full impact of reduced activity levels and pricing pressures on our business. As an industry, we are actively reducing costs throughout the supply chain as we seek new levels of efficiency. While it is early and uncertain, we are encouraged as rig count declines begin to slow and we get closer to trough levels.","Deflationary costs may entice improved levels of activity, and as our industry improves from a contraction mode to an expansion mode, NOV will start to see the full effect of the cost reduction efforts we are making today. Our continued investment in technologies, capacity, and aftermarket support have made us the oilfield\u2019s preferred equipment and technology provider. And as we pivot to new opportunities we expect National Oilwell to emerge a stronger, more resilient and more dependable partner for our customers.","With that, we would like to open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions] And from Raymond James we have Marshall Adkins online. Please go ahead.","Marshall Adkins","Good morning, guys. As usual, a very, very thorough overview. We appreciate that. I don\u2019t have a lot of real specific ones. I want to ask just kind of a bigger picture broader question, Clay. The industry obviously has changed dramatically in the last few years. We\u2019re starting to see dollars flow more into the U.S. versus offshore, given the improving economics here. How do you see NOV evolving over the next five years? I know that\u2019s kind of a big picture question, but I just want to get a sense of how you adjust to the changing environment from one where you\u2019ve dominated offshore rigs and where improving your offshore completion stuff to one where maybe more dollars are spent in the U.S.?","Clay Williams","Yes. Great question, Marshall, and something we\u2019re obviously continuing to think about here. We benefited greatly from a lot of offshore rig building through the last decade, and have been a big participant in that. And we\u2019ve also done a lot - we\u2019ve been very transactional. We\u2019ve invested a lot of M&A capital through the last decade. When we look back to the past 10 years, 97% of our M&A capital have gone into our other three segments, really away from the rig-building space, building out really interesting positions, trying to position us for option value across multiple trends underway.","So when we look at, for instance, a shale well drilling operation, what you see out there is a Tier 1 rig, premium drill pipe, downhole tools, mud motors. You see on the completion side coil tubing units, in-coil tubing, frac spreads, sanders, mixing units, basically all of the picks and shovels. All of the hardware that go into the unconventional shale trend, NOV is global-leading provider of. We look across the oilfield and we see opportunities in waste management. And so things like thermal absorption technology to clean up drill cuttings.","Water management opportunities, we\u2019ve got some great technologies in around osmosis clean up and desalinization of water. De-oiling of water with our WaterWolf products. So we\u2019re doing more on the production side. So this has been - we\u2019ve had a steady application of capital into other trends, recognizing that this industry always changes. And over the past few years, of course, the big change were the shales have emerged as a much lower marginal cost source of oil and the deepwater has some challenges. But I also know from cycle to cycle, marginal costs sort of rearrange themselves.","There\u2019s a lot of smart people in this industry focused on their particular resource base. And with regard to the deepwater, I think certainly the marginal costs out there are coming down. And NOV plans on being a part of that. So when it comes to building FPSO vessels, the industry\u2019s being challenged. We thing we\u2019ve got some great ideas to apply there to bring cost down. The owners of the deepwater reservoirs are experiencing much lower drilling costs with the deflation that has gone on in the drilling space. And these joint ventures that you\u2019ve heard about that are really focused on subsea processes, I think are going to have a great benefit, too. There\u2019s a lot of hay to be made here with reducing back pressures on reservoirs, subsea lifting, subsea separation.","And I think you kind of add all that up, and marginal costs for deepwater reserves are going to come down. What we try to do at NOV is to position ourselves across these various trends and really sort of maximize option value in the participation of all these trends. So looking forward, we see great opportunity as all participants try to reduce their marginal cost. We also see a lot more NOV equipment out there that\u2019s going to need a lot more aftermarket support. And we\u2019ve been investing in that footprint globally, and are going to be there to take care of those rigs.","Marshall Adkins","So obviously you\u2019ve had this great transformation. You have an incredibly strong balance sheet. And over the historical cycles, you always end up being better. Does that mean we transform this balance sheet into more M&A, particularly in those three other parts of the business you built up the last five years?","Clay Williams","Yes, we are looking hard at what\u2019s next for NOV, and I think we are very, very good at deploying capital into acquisition opportunities and then integrating those and maximizing returns on those opportunities. And so we are engaged in lots of conversations out there. There\u2019s a big merger you may have heard about, we\u2019re really interested in seeing what comes out of that. So all these downturns provide pretty extraordinary opportunities to deploy capital to kind of reposition ourselves for the next upturn, and so that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking to do. I\u2019m actually pretty excited about that. We\u2019re doing the painful things, reducing costs as required, but the more fun aspects to think about through the downturn, what do we look like we come out? And our plan is to be stronger and better and to maximize opportunities in the downturn.","Marshall Adkins","Great works, guys. Thanks.","Clay Williams","Thank you, Marshall.","Operator","From RBC, we have Kurt Hallead in the line. Please go ahead.","Kurt Hallead","Hey, good morning.","Clay Williams","Good morning.","Loren Singletary","Hey, Kurt.","Kurt Hallead","So you guys again, I echo Marshall\u2019s about providing excellent information. Appreciate all that info. At your Analyst Day back in November, you guys outlined a very long-term outlook, predicated some of it, or at least based some of it on the Exxon\u2019s forty-year outlook, or so on and so forth. I don\u2019t imagine in six months\u2019 time that really changes a 40-year outlook. But given the dynamics in the offshore drilling business, how do you assess the prospective structural decline in this cycle versus any other offshore drilling cycle that you may have been a part of, Clay or Loren, however you want - may address that.","Clay Williams","Yes, we talked very explicitly at our Analyst Day about basing our strategic plans on a generational look at oil and gas supply, which the ExxonMobil Outlook 2040 is. And certainly - but the other thing we highlighted at that conference, if you remember, Kurt, is the fact that we go through cyclical downturns. So this is not - where we are today is not a surprise to us. I think the challenge for management is to make sure we\u2019re looking through this and continuing to work on a long-term strategic plans and execute our long-term vision, which is still very, very exciting.","With regards to the offshore, like I mentioned earlier, all sources of crude are continually working on reducing their marginal cost, to slide down that marginal cost curve and not be the last barrel produced in terms of economic efficiency. And the offshore is absolutely no exception. And so what\u2019s encouraging about what we see today is that at $100 a barrel, there\u2019s not as much incentive to do things differently. When the oil price drop to $50 a barrel and the IOC\u2019s have found, for instance, 5 billion barrels in the lower tertiary in the Gulf of Mexico, there\u2019s a strong incentive to figure out.","They know the resource base is there, how do we figure out how to produce that at lower cost? And they have the extra tailwind of drilling process deflation. Pricing is dropping for services on drilling those wells on the rigs required, the dayrates around the rigs required to drill those wells. And so it\u2019s a pretty good backdrop to do things differently. And there\u2019s a lot of active and constructive participation from our customers around that. We will bring the marginal costs down on subsea barrels.","Loren Singletary","Yes, I might add, Kurt, that even in the darkest days of the 1980s, we never went a year when we didn\u2019t sell an offshore rig, whether it was a jack-up or a floating rig of some sort. And I think that with the retirements and the scrapping of offshore rigs today at new high levels, I think that we\u2019ll get a balance of offshore floating rigs sooner than later. And so we\u2019re probably in a new paradigm, really, for the offshore market. But the next couple of quarters, maybe the next year or so, are going to be pretty skinny. But we will still be selling a few rigs in the next year.","Clay Williams","That\u2019s a great point. And the rigs that are working out there are going to need components for replacement and they\u2019re going to need components for upgrade. And that\u2019s kind of the base business we\u2019ve survived on in the 1980s and 1990s.","Kurt Hallead","Okay, great. And then maybe a quick follow-up here is, when you talk about a number of different M&A transactions and perspective businesses that may have to be sold, or at least ones that Halliburton already put on the market, you see this as a potential transformative opportunity for NOV? I know you guys have typically not wanted to be involved in the services element of things. Are you guys pretty much going to remain the equipment provider of choice? How are you assessing the outlook here?","Clay Williams","We\u2019re all about deploying capital into interesting situations to enhance competitive advantage and enhance our franchise. And so we tend to look at all opportunities continuously and reassess what we are, where we\u2019re going continuously. So I\u2019ll leave it that way. But this - we\u2019re always looking for opportunities to deploy capital for the benefit of our shareholders.","Kurt Hallead","Great. Hey, thanks guys. Appreciate it.","Clay Williams","Thank you, Kurt.","Operator","From Simmons & Company, we have Bill Herbert online. Please go ahead.","Bill Herbert","Thanks. Good morning. Actually a question along the same lines, and I\u2019m going to widen it a little bit here. So a couple of recurring queries, and sort of a subtext of this call is the prospects for transformation. And so I guess my question is similar to what was just expressed. The circumference of plausible industrial fit, has it widened? And same question with regard to scale in terms of the size of the deal that you\u2019re willing to do and the price that you\u2019re willing to pay for it?","Clay Williams","Not much of which I can answer, or will answer very quantitatively. We maximize returns by trying to minimize capital going into these opportunities. We are a veteran of many, many, many transactions. We\u2019ve done this many times before and built up global-leading franchises around the world, across pretty much all that we do. We\u2019re number one in just about everything that we do. And that\u2019s very central to our strategy. And so in terms of what comes available, not just out of the big red\/blue merger we\u2019ve all been talking about, but more broadly, what\u2019s out there, what\u2019s possible. We\u2019re always looking at opportunities. But the cornerstone of that effort really resides in market leadership.","We\u2019ve been very clear, we think market leadership carries demonstrable competitive advantage in this space. We think we reduce risk for our customers by being market leader. We think scale gets us up learning curves faster, it support broader global networks to deliver products and services and equipment. Let\u2019s us leverage R&D efforts and introduce new products more quickly. For lots of reasons market leadership carries lower risk and higher returns. And so that\u2019s pretty central to what we do when we evaluate opportunities to deploy capital, Bill.","Bill Herbert","And a question with regard to theory versus practice. I mean, clearly right deal\/right scale\/right size you\u2019ll do it. I\u2019m just curious as to practically speaking, given the catharsis of the last six months, has the possible opportunity set ex-Halliburton increased, or do we need additional duration to this downturn in order to increase the number of possibilities and also narrow the bid\/ask spread?","Clay Williams","Yes, that\u2019s the key thing, what you said last. We need sellers to reset expectations. And so we\u2019re helping them do that.","Bill Herbert","Okay. Thanks very much, guys.","Clay Williams","Thanks, Bill.","Operator","From FBR Capital Markets, we have Tom Curran on the line, please go ahead.","Thomas Curran","Good morning, guys.","Clay Williams","Good morning.","Loren Singletary","Good morning.","Thomas Curran","So just sticking with Bill\u2019s topic there and delving a bit deeper into the line of questioning. Clay, perhaps you give us an update on how the current pipeline of prospects compares in North America versus internationally? And certain focal technologies or niches within the divisions where you ideally would make a move?","Clay Williams","I\u2019m going to be a little cryptic around that because I don\u2019t really want tell my competitors my playbook. But what I would say is again, we\u2019re focused on big picture trends in the industry, market leadership and competitive advantage, and looking to deploy capital into those areas more broadly. I will tell you specifically where we\u2019ve been deploying capital the last couple of years has really enhanced our aftermarket business in particular around rig. The rising installed base of NOV equipment and technology out there is pretty transparent to you and everybody. And so what we see are a lot more NOV rigs running and a lot more customers in need of close OEM support.","And what we find is that these great little businesses that we can acquire. In fact, two weeks ago I was touring one that we bought in West Africa, for instance, South Africa. It\u2019s been a great addition and great reputation, and what we\u2019ve been able to bring to that business is kind of the global reach and scale. And so that\u2019s been a great help for our customers in that region. But around the world, all of our customers want us to be closer to the coal face, closer to their rigs for aftermarket support. So that\u2019s an interesting area, and that\u2019s part of the reason at our Analyst Day we said, growth prospects for rig aftermarket long-term are terrific, and we\u2019re putting capital behind that. In other businesses, again we have got opportunities to grow those, expand their footprint and so kind of a similar pattern.","Thomas Curran","And should we think of you adhering to the same reluctance you exhibited thus far within Wellbore Technologies about pushing any further into new services that would lead you to compete directly with some of your oilfield service customers?","Clay Williams","We\u2019re always kind of reevaluating our business model, and does it make sense? And frankly, there\u2019s already some level of competition within that business. And that\u2019s very common across oilfield services. It\u2019s not uncommon for competitors to sell to each other in one product line and compete on another. And so - but we think about that very closely. We don\u2019t want to unnecessarily end up in a competitive conflict situation that really takes a toll on our P&L. So, I\u2019ll leave it there.","Thomas Curran","Thanks. I\u2019ll turn it back.","Clay Williams","Thanks, Tom.","Operator","Thank you. We will now turn it back to Clay Williams for closing remarks.","Clay Williams","Thanks, Brandon. I appreciate everyone\u2019s patience this morning and apologies for the technical difficulties that we started off with. I really also want to thank our terrific employees for the hard work that they all put in here every day, and although we have a pretty challenging road ahead, we\u2019re adapting quickly. We have lots of opportunities emerging to launch new products and to acquire some pretty interesting businesses, and really position ourselves for the upturn. So we\u2019re doing what we got to do in the short term, looking through that for opportunities in the long term. And I know we will emerge better and stronger. And again, thank you all for joining us, we look forward to updating you in July.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect."]}}
