","At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Magda Palczynska, BNY Mellon's Global Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Magda Palczynska","Good morning. Today, BNY Mellon released its results for the third quarter of 2019. The earnings press release and the financial highlights presentation to accompany this call are both available on our website at bnymellon.com. Todd Gibbons BNY Mellon's Interim CEO will lead the call. Then Mike Santomassimo, our CFO, will take you through our earnings presentation. Following Mike's remarks, there will be a Q&A session. As a reminder please limit yourself to two questions. ","Before we begin, please note that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release, the financial highlights presentation and in our documents filed with the SEC, all available on our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, October 16, 2019, and will not be updated.","With that, I will hand over to Todd.","Todd Gibbons","Thank you, Magda. Good morning, everyone. Glad to be back with you. As it\u2019s my first time speaking to you as CEO, I will focus my comments on my immediate priorities, as well as my perspectives on our businesses and will only briefly touch on our third quarter results. I'll leave that to Mike. ","First, let me say how tremendously excited I am to be leading this great organization. During my long career at BNY Mellon, I've held leadership roles across risk, finance, client management and many of our businesses and I believe that gives me a strong grasp of the fundamentals of our company and what our stakeholders need and expect from us. I'm looking forward to continuing to work with Mike and the rest of the executive committee, as well as all of our employees, to stay on course and positioning our franchise to drive better performance and create sustainable growth. ","We've got an ambitious agenda and I strongly believe that we\u2019re absolutely on the right path. The improvements we\u2019ve made to our culture are clear. We're acting with a greater sense of urgency and greater responsiveness and I'm proud of the team's ability to stay focused through leadership change and to continue to deliver great service to our clients. ","It's my intention to ensure we maintain a strong performance culture and remain focused on service quality, continue investing in technology and innovation and improving every aspect of our operations. Through that focus we've made significant progress in the last few years, which I believe positions us to improve our results over the longer term. ","Now, while I was Head of Global Client Management, as well as a number of our servicing businesses, I've had the pleasure of working closely with our clients. During this period I've seen us meaningfully improve our services, as well as provide the technology and expertise to help them navigate challenges and achieve their goals. Our investments in our operations and technology are proving and broadening our capabilities and the adjustments we've made to our client coverage model are helping us deepen relationships and identify more opportunities.","Before getting into the quarter, let me run through what I'm seeing in our businesses. In Asset Servicing we continue to see the opportunity to do more for our clients, as changes in the asset management business puts pressure on their operating margins. These trends should offer more outsourcing opportunities in key segments, such as alternatives. ","In terms of what we're actually doing, we're focused on continuously improving quality, which is fundamental. We are also investing in expanding capabilities to server alternatives such as private equity, credit funds, real-estate and ETFs. For example, we just recently implemented a significant mandate with Goldman Sachs Asset Management who pointed us to deliver a range of asset services for their newly launched European ETFs and we are encouraged by our attraction in this space. ","We are building data and analytic solutions to help clients navigate a changing Investment Management landscape. The basic offering starts with a powerful aggregation capability. We can then apply analytics around that. Leveraging our data and analytics solutions technology, we enabled a large global asset manager to insource $250 billion of AUM within three months. The client now has a higher level of transparency in to cash and positions for the front office trading and has achieved better operational efficiency by leveraging their previous investments in our technology. ","We think our data and analytics capabilities will be a true differentiator over time, but the alliances we are forming will create a more integrated front-to-back operating model. We recently announced a strategic alliance with Bloomberg to integrate our data analytics and servicing capabilities with Bloomberg's Portfolio Management, training and compliance platform. This will allow our common clients to experience faster onboarding, higher straight-through processing rates and more efficient data exchanges. ","This new partnership comes on the back of the one we announced with BlackRock\u2019s-Aladdin platform earlier this year. Client reception to our partnerships has been positive as it helps them simplify workflows, improve efficiency and drive their performance. ","In Pershing, we're focused on helping our clients drive their business in a dynamic industry. The pipeline of opportunity remains strong and we on-boarded a number of new clients in the Broker Dealer and Registered Investment Adviser Space. In the high growth Wealth and Advisory Segment we're investing in technology to improve the client experience, as well as investing in talent and strengthening brand awareness.","One of our priorities is to meet emerging client needs as investor preferences drive firms to transform. For example, we are enabling clients to integrate our technology and leverage pre-built business functions such as trading, reporting and asset movement, without them having to make big investments in their own technology. Overall, we're very excited about the potential for Pershing. ","Moving on to Clearance and Collateral Management, it\u2019s a key differentiator for us. Tri-party Collateral Management balances are up, mainly the result of growth from existing clients and new business and to a lesser extent from last year's client conversions. ","We are confident in the organic growth prospects of this business. We are currently rebuilding our platform to give our clients the ability to seamlessly move securities globally, as well as offer enhanced resiliency and data and analytic capabilities, not currently available in the market. We think it will significantly boost our ability to attract new market participants, as well as additional business from our existing clients. ","In Corporate Trust we're seeing benefits from the investments we\u2019ve made in structural products and we continue to build out capabilities to better serve clients. This is broadening our relationships, especially in the important alternative Asset Manager Segment. ","In Treasury Services we've been refocusing on higher margin and high growth businesses such as trade, foreign exchange and our liquidity offering. Our clients consistently tell me our service is excellent, which reflects on the quality of our people. In addition, we're looking to build off the investments we have made in real time payments. ","In asset management we feel good about a number of the underlying strategies and continue to invest in the U.S. and build solutions to meet investor demand. We are actively launching new products across a number of areas including fixed income products, ESG, enhanced data and multi asset solutions. ","For example, Alcentra raised 5.5 billion euros for its European Direct Lending Fund, double the minimum target. We are investing in rebranding to consistently use the BNY Mellon brand and make it easier to navigate our multi-boutique model. Lastly, performance has been solid across many of the largest strategies. ","Moving to Wealth Management, it\u2019s strengthening our banking investment products and creating a strong foundation by investing in people, technology and platform. ","Now let me turn briefly to our results for the third quarter. EPS was $1.07, that's up 1% versus a year ago. Total revenue was down 5% year-over-year and that was largely driven by net interest revenue. There are a couple of items that impacted both revenue and expense and Mike will walk you through those in some detail. ","Our Investment Services fee lines were nearly or were up nearly across the board as the investment decisions we've been making are starting to yield some incremental positive results. Operating margin was once again resilient at 33% and we continue to deliver strong capital returns to shareholders. ","With that, let me turn the call over to Mike. ","Mike Santomassimo ","Thanks Todd and good morning everyone. Let me run through the details of the results for the quarter. All comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless I specify otherwise. ","Beginning on page three of the financial highlights document. First, the table at the bottom of the page summarizes a couple of notable items in the quarter that had a very small impact on earnings on a net basis, but did impact net interest revenue and expenses. I will describe them later in more detail, and as a reminder, the table also includes some items we highlighted in the third quarter of 2018. ","This quarter, total revenue was down 5% to $3.9 billion. The notable items negatively impacted revenue by a little under 1.5%. The remaining decline primarily reflected lower net interest revenue, the impact of prior outflows in asset management and lower performance fees, as well as the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. ","While total fee revenue was down 1% year-on-year, investment services fees were up in most categories as Todd mentioned, excluding securities lending. ","Net interest revenue was down 18%, partially driven by a $70 million lease related impairment. The impairment was for a legacy portfolio of leases and decreased net interest revenue by 8% and earnings per share by $0.06. ","Expenses were down 5%, mainly reflect a $74 million net reduction of reserves that benefited non-interest expenses and increased earnings per share by approximately $0.06. This was related to a pretax charge that was recorded in the second quarter of 2014 in connection with potential tax related exposures of certain Investment Management funds that we managed. Excluding this and the impact of lower litigation charges, expenses were essentially flat. ","A few other highlights from the page. Pretax income declined by 4% to $1.3 billion. The effective tax rate was 19.1% compared to 16.5% in the year ago quarter. We generated $1 billion of net income applicable to common shareholders, earnings per share of $1.07 was up 1% and our pretax operating margin was 33%. ","Now, moving to capital and liquidity on page four. Our capital and liquidity ratios remain strong. Our key ratios were similar to the second quarter. Common equity Tier 1 capital totaled $18.3 billion and our CET 1 ratio was 11.1% under the advanced approach. Our average LCR in the third quarter with 117% and our SLR was 6.1%.","Turning to page five; my comments on the balance sheet will highlight the sequential changes, as this is a better comparison for you. Our average interest earning assets increased due to the client deposits driving our balance sheet higher. The average rate earned on interest earning assets declined in the third quarter, primarily as a result of the impairment that I mentioned earlier. Excluding this the average rate would have been down only slightly. ","The average rate was negatively impacted by the Fed and ECB lowering interest rates. This resulted in U.S. short term rates moving lower by 20 to 30 basis points, while the long end was down by around 50 basis points since the second quarter which impacted the yield in our securities portfolio. This was partially offset by a modest benefit from our legal activity. ","Loans increased in Clearance and Collateral Management and our trade loans grew within treasury services. However we continue to see low appetite for leverage in Pershing, which continues the impact of our margin loan balances. ","As expected, non-interest bearing deposits declined, while interest bearing deposit increased. Deposit basis were broadly in line with our expectations and the net interest margin decreased by 3 basis points to109 basis points excluding the impairment. ","Page six gives you some more detail of the drivers of the net interest revenue decline versus the second quarter. As I mentioned, we saw a continued decline in average non-interest bearing deposits, which had a negative impact on net interest revenue. We had a benefit from the increase in average interest bearing deposits, as well as lower deposit pricing due to the rate cuts.","Competitive pressure on deposit rates appears to have stabilized since the second quarter, but remains high. The yields on the securities portfolios was down by 15 basis points, which more than offset the benefit of higher portfolio balances. ","Loan balances were mixed, with non-margin loans up and margin loans down and coupled with lower rates as the assets are typically a floating rate which negatively impacted net interest revenue. ","We continue to look for opportunities to deploy our balance sheet and took advantage of higher reverse repo rates, which modestly benefited net interest revenue. As a reminder, we engage in limited hedging and funding activities, but this quarter positively impacted our interest revenue and our net interest margin by approximately 2 basis points. There is an offset to that reflected in FX and other trading. ","Finally, the lease-related impairment of $70 million reduced net interest revenue to $730 million. ","Now page seven detailed our expenses. On a consolidated basis expenses of $2.6 billion were down 5%. The decrease reflects the reduction of reserves for tax related exposure of certain Investment Management funds and the lower litigation expenses that I mentioned earlier. Excluding those items, expenses were largely flat with our investments being offset by declines and other expenses. ","Turning to page eight, total investment services revenue was down slightly. Assets under custody and administration increased 4% year-over-year to $35.8 trillion, primarily reflecting higher market values and net new business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. ","Within asset servicing revenue was down 4% to $1.4 billion, primarily reflecting lower client activity, securities lending revenue and net interest revenue, as well as the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. As we have said in the past, we have not seen an acceleration in pricing pressure in the business. ","Securities lending revenue continues to be negatively impacted by lower balances on the back of weak market demand and tighter spreads and foreign exchange and other trading revenue was slightly down as FX volumes and volatility remain subdued. ","In Pershing, revenue was up 2% to $568 million, reflecting higher client asset values and accounts together with higher clearing and custody volumes. This was partially offset by lower net interest revenue. ","Clearing services fees were up 7% as we continue to onboard new clients and we benefit from growth of existing clients. We are encouraged by the momentum we're building in the business with both RIAs and broker dealers. Issuer Services benefited from higher activity in depositary receipts. Revenue was up 3% to $466 million with 13% fee growth, mostly offset by lower net interest revenue. ","Growth in Corporate Trust benefited from new business and volumes and depositary receipts revenue was up due to the timing of fees and higher cross border selling activity. ","Treasury Services revenue was down 4% to $312 million with fees up slightly year-on-year, while net interest was lower. Deposit balances increased year-on-year by over 20%. ","Clearance and Collateral Management revenue was up 11% to $293 million due to higher clearance volumes related to high levels of U.S. treasury issuance. In recent quarters the majority of our growth was driven by the client conversion from last year, but in the third quarter this shifted with more than two-thirds of the increase coming from existing and other new clients. ","As a reminder, the client conversions were in the run rate starting in the fourth quarter of 2018 and average tri-party collateral management balance were up 19%, and I also want to note that the recent volatility in the repo markets was not a driver of the revenue growth in Clearance and Collateral Management. ","Page nine summarizes the key drivers that affected the year-over-year revenue comparisons for each of our investment services businesses. ","Turning to investment management in page 10, total investment management revenue was down 12%, asset management revenue was down 14% year-over-year to $605 million, primarily reflecting the cumulative AUM outflows since the third quarter of 2018, as well as lower performance fees, the impact of hedging activities and the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, principally versus the British pound, which was partially offset by higher market values. Performance fees decreased due to a particularly strong year of performance for our LDI strategy of last year. ","Our largest revenue strategies continued at solid performance over both short and longer time frames. We had inflows of $1 billion in the quarter, primarily driven by cash inflows and abatement and index outflows. We had $11 billion of inflows into cash and $2 billion of inflows in to fixed income products, while our other strategies saw outflows of $12 billion. ","Overall assets under management of $1.9 trillion are up 3% year-over-year due to higher markets, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and net outflows. Wealth Management revenue was down 8% year-over-year to $285 million, primarily reflecting lower net interest revenue, partially offset by higher market values. ","Turning to our other segment on page 11, total revenue and net interest expense decreased year-over-year and sequentially, primarily reflecting the lease related impairment and corporate treasury activity. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, there are a few things to consider, with respect to net interest revenue, market dynamics are changing quickly, but let me walk you through what we are seeing now, which I\u2019ll remind you is very early and you should make your own assumptions as well. ","The market appears to be pricing in a Fed cutin October and another in early next year potentially January, which impacts the forward curves. We expect the average non-interest bearing deposit balances will continue to come down. ","As of now our interest bearing deposits are a little lower than the third quarter. We do not expect the issues in the repo market to repeat themselves. This will negatively impact net interest revenue by approximately 1% versus the third quarter and we expect the portfolio yield to come down versus the third quarter. If these assumptions persist, we would expect that net interest revenue will be down sequentially by approximately 4% to 6% versus the lease-adjusted net interest revenue in the third quarter. ","In Issuer Services we expect full year fees to be around the same as in 2018, give or take a little bit, so we expect a down-tick in the fourth quarter. As we announced during the third quarter, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our interest in Promontory Interfinancial Network, with an expected after tax gain of approximately $600 million. We expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter subject to approvals. ","As we continue to streamline and optimize the company, we may look for opportunities to accelerate actions which could result in pretax charges in the fourth quarter in the range of $100 million to $200 million. And a reminder that we had some notable items in the fourth quarter of 2018; something else to factor into your modeling. ","With that operator, can you please open up the lines for questions? ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Yes sir. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. ","Glenn Schorr","Hello! Thanks a lot. I know it's a different client base, but I'm curious if you think the price in reductions on the E-broker side and the retail side of E-broker LAN can have an impact on to your Pershing RIA clearing business? Just, could you help us think through that? ","Todd Gibbons","Sure, good mooring Glenn, its Todd. Our business model is quite a bit different than the E- traders. As you know, we are a B2B; we are not a B2C business, so we don't actually charge commissions. We get paid on a number of different revenue streams like assets, as well as the clearing and settlement. So we don't foresee this as having any material impact at this time. ","Glenn Schorr","Okay, and then maybe just a quickie follow-up on the NII, because I appreciate \u2013 I just want to sure I wrote it down. The NIR down 4% to 6% versus the lease adjusted number in the third quarter, and could you just repeat that part. I just want to make sure that we get the right jumping off point for 4Q and rolling into the next year? ","Mike Santomassimo","Yeah, hey Glenn, its Mike. If you look at page six of the deck, you know the lease adjusted number for the third quarter was 800. So that\u2019s your jumping off point and so the 4% to 6% off of that base and if you \u2013 in my commentary I also mentioned part of the decline is related to the modest benefit we saw from the repo activity in the third quarter, so that\u2019s about a percent of it. ","Glenn Schorr","And the rest is just the cuts we've seen and the deposit migration? ","Mike Santomassimo","Correct, yeah it's net interest bearing deposits coming down a little bit, it\u2019s the yield on the portfolio continuing to grind down a bit, and it\u2019s based on where we see the positive balances right now, which are a little bit lower than what we saw in the third quarter, but as you know it\u2019s very early in the quarter to project with a high degree of certainty at this point. ","Glenn Schorr","Okay, and I just want to make sure. You saw some extra deposit slide in from the repo mess in the quarter, but unclear if they stick around. I'm putting words in your mouth, but I just want to see what your thoughts are? ","Mike Santomassimo","Yeah, no. I think the deposits we saw, the incremental deposits we saw in the third quarter were not necessarily related to the repo volatility; that was just underlying client behavior. We made some money by deploying some of our excess liquidity into the repo market, you know during those few days. That coupled with our cleared repo program that we've got you know for clients is where we made the extra money during those few days of the volatility. ","Todd Gibbons","And Glenn, that wasn't a huge amount of money. I mean we had \u2013 we have a lot of liquidity. If there's a little bit of a distortion in the market, we\u2019ll take advantage of it and we did and it had a little bit of help, but it didn\u2019t impact balances. ","Glenn Schorr","Okay, I appreciate that. Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from a line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. Todd, first just a quick one on sort of a high level. Just wanted to \u2013 you know interested in your thoughts on level setting and very helpful to hear your comments in the beginning of the call. But clearly we had a bit of a movement on the top here with BK with you know Charlie moving on and you stepping in. ","And so clearly you were part of the management team, you\u2019ve been at Bank of New York for a very, very long time, developed their plan, so that seems straightforward. But can you help us maybe think about tactical timeframes; how's the Board thinking about their search at this point? Most investors assume that you're going to be part of the consideration for that search; is that fair? And could you help us think about, just in the near term how there might be some tactical adjustments in strategy or is it going to be very, very similar to how we\u2019ve been going, you know steady as she goes, so to speak. ","Todd Gibbons","Okay Bryan. There is a lot there, but let me start that you know with the change at the top, the board executed its succession plan and is going through the due-diligence. It has initiated a search and I have indicated my interest to be a part of that, so that's in the process and we don't have any strict time frames on that, that will flow as it flows. ","In terms of my own priorities and you know anything tactical that we're seeing, frankly I've been in the middle of driving the change agenda that's been going on that Charlie had lead over the past couple of years, and I really felt like I'm an integral part of it. Actually I've enjoyed it. So what I'm not going to do is revert back to some of the ways that things were. So we're going to continue to drive a very strong performance culture. ","I see us holding ourselves more accountable. We're expecting \u2013 we really expect and demand excellence from each other and I'm not going to let that change, so that\u2019s at the high level. The investments that we're making in technology are going to continue. They are going to be focused on a number of things, not only that we make our services more resilient, that we improve the client experience and where we are having some real successes around improving operational efficiency. So that continues to be high on my list and I think there is a lot more that I would follow in my next point here is that we will automate and continue to approve operations. ","I think we've got a lot of attraction that we can point to, a lot of successes and opportunity to do more. I got to stay focused on regulatory relations given who we are and what we're doing and so that will be a high priority, and finally you know Mike and I are now pouring through the planning process and we've got to make good decisions around our investment opportunities. We have quite a number of them and that actually will be fun. ","So I think it's been a very smooth transition. At this point I don\u2019t think anything has changed people and I really am quite pleased with the leadership team, how smoothly they've moved on. ","Brennan Hawken","That's great color, thank you so much Todd for that. One question here for Mike. Previously you guys had guided to the back half of 2019 being flat for operating expenses versus the back half of 2018. I believe that the core expenses in the back half of 2018 were $5.4 billion. It looks like core expenses this quarter is 2.7. Does that mean that we should be looking at core expenses for the fourth quarter to be roughly flat with the core to this quarter, is that fair? ","Mike Santomassimo","Yeah I mean, I think it would take a little bit Brennan, so \u2013 but yeah, I mean I think the guidance we gave in terms of sort of being flat, you know year-on-year give or take a little bit still holds. ","Brennan Hawken","Okay, you mean you obviously laid out the charges, but that would not be core, right? ","Mike Santomassimo","Correct. ","Brennan Hawken","Yep, thank you. ","Mike Santomassimo","You have to look through that. ","Brennan Hawken","Perfect. ","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. ","Todd Gibbons","Good morning, Gerard. ","Operator","Gerard, you may be on mute. ","Gerard Cassidy ","Thank you. I apologize about that, I was on the mute. Thank you. Following up on your comments about the repo destruction and how you had a small benefit, and I know you don't expect it going forward. Can you guys give us any color? Is there any benefit of the treasury now or the Fed I should say coming back in. They are not calling a quantitative easing, but we know they're going to come in and start buying securities. Do you guys see any benefits for your business from their activities?","Todd Gibbons","Well, you know the Fed conducts its open market transactions through repo and they do use our repo platform, our tri-party platforms for some of those transactions. It would be very, very modest if any impact to our revenue. So it will obviously impact the rate at which repo trades, but it's a deminimus impact. ","You know the good news about the business and the tri-party business and our management businesses is it continues to grow. So we've seen \u2013 you know we saw a significant growth in the past quarter. Some of that, less than about a third or so of that was from the conversions that we had from last year. But the rest of it is either new clients or additional growth with existing clients. ","Collateral management and repo, it is growing as the unclear margin rules grow and the demand for secured credit grows. So we like our position there and you know I can go on more about this, because we're \u2013 one of our biggest investments is in what we call the future of collateral management, in making our systems interoperable in a way that just makes it seamless for our clients to move collateral; that will have a huge benefit to them. So the key focus for us, but the disruption in the repo market had little if any impact. ","Gerard Cassidy ","Very good. And then just as a follow-up, you gave us good color on the sequential look into net interest revenue and what you know the forward curve is saying about future fed fund rate cuts. If you guys could paint us a picture for 2020, what would be an ideal interest rate environment for you to benefit from a net interest revenue standpoint? Again, I know it\u2019s \u2013 and I\u2019m not going to hold you to it, but just curious what would be that ideal environment. ","Todd Gibbons","I'll take it. I\u2019m looking at Mike here. You know a steeper yield curve and fewer uses; it really isn\u2019t a lot more complex than that. ","Gerard Cassidy ","Very good. No, I appreciate that, thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin [ph] Usdin with Jefferies. ","Kenneth Usdin ","Hey, good morning guys. I just have a couple of follow-ups on the NII front. Hey Mike, so can you talk a little bit about \u2013 it seems like you know if the balance sheet were to be flattish from here even, that the NIM obviously is still grinding down. Can you talk us through \u2013 you mentioned a little less competitiveness on the deposit side, but the dynamics of the asset portfolio re-pricing, that whole, you know the three-quarters aspect versus what you are seeing on the deposit betas. Can you give us some color on both sides of what you are seeing? Thanks. ","Mike Santomassimo","Yeah, and I\u2019ll start with the portfolio Ken. And you know obviously what you are seeing in the portfolio is you know yields continue to grind down as sort of rates have come down. It's really no more complicated I think than that, and about a third of our portfolio re-prices every quarter, either through you know securities maturing and getting reinvested or through the floating rate you know component of it; and in those cases you know the rates in the portfolio are moving ahead of when the Fed moves and so you are going to see a decline in the asset yields first and then when the Fed moves you are able to move deposit pricing down and so you are going to have that lag and so that rates are declining and it's negative \u2013 it has a negative impact you know during that period. ","I think on the pricing side, you know what I said was you know pricing remains competitive, although its stabilized over the last you know 90 days, 120 days or so and so we're seeing you know pretty consistent competition across a whole series of our competitors, but we're not seeing anything that\u2019s irrational you know across that set right now. ","Kenneth Usdin ","Okay, and I guess as a follow-up then, so if we just play it forward and you look at your forward curve and you mention the October and the potentially early \u201920, at what point do you see the yields on the asset side starting to level up because of that three quarter roll through. Like do we get to a point in early next year where you just kind of have flushed everything down? How do we start to assess like when that bottoming point might happen? ","Mike Santomassimo","You know, I mean look, I think that's the question I think most people are thinking about and I think as you sort of look at it, it\u2019s really going to \u2013 it starts to stabilize when forwards start to stabilize, right, and I think when you look at forwards right now, it's still declining as you look out, and so I think when forwards start to stabilize you\u2019ll start to see the portfolio yield stabilize as well. ","Kenneth Usdin ","Okay, thanks Mike. I appreciate it. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. ","Brian Kleinhanzl ","Great! Yeah, just two quick questions. I wanted you to mention that the promontory sales is going to close this quarter. Was that \u2013 I mean that gain could be used for addition share repurchase if you decided to do that or is that already included in the CCAR plan? ","A - Mike Santomassimo","It's something we'll consider as we look forward for our capital plan next year. ","Todd Gibbons","So no, it was not included in our CCAR plan for this year. So we couldn't \u2013 you know we could take that because it hadn\u2019t taken place. ","Brian Kleinhanzl ","Okay, but you\u2019re not going to do additional share purchase this year? ","A - Todd Gibbons","We will \u2013 we\u2019ll consider it as part of the plan next year. ","Brian Kleinhanzl ","Okay. And then just focusing on the investment management business, I mean you have negative operating leverage in there. Year-on-year, I mean what does it take to kind of generate the positive operating leverage in that segment again? ","Todd Gibbons","So if you look at our investment management businesses, a number of the businesses are doing pretty well. Our LDI business continues to grow. Our Altrin [ph] \u2013 credit business in Alcentra is doing pretty well and in fact our managers in the U.K. are doing reasonably well. ","Where we are challenged is in our business in the states and we've taken some steps to combine those businesses into what we now call Mellon, but until we see that stabilize, it's going to be \u2013 that\u2019s where the challenge really resides. So we need to see some improvement in the performance. We think by combining there are things that we can do operationally to continue to manage the cost, but that's our focus point. ","Brian Kleinhanzl ","Okay, great, thanks. ","Operator","And next we'll go to Alexander Blostein with Goldman Sachs. ","Alexander Blostein ","Great! Hey, good morning guys. A question around deposit growth this quarter, some pretty nice trends sequentially. I know there's been a strategic focus for you guys to get a larger share of kind of customers\u2019 wallets over time. So maybe talk a little bit about the sources of growth this quarter and sort of the attraction you\u2019re getting into the wallet share gain, thanks. ","Mike Santomassimo","Yeah, this is Mike. Yeah, as you highlighted, you know we\u2019ve been focused for the \u2013 you know the better part of a year or a little over that, sort of really driving more share of client deposits through a whole series of initiatives that I think you know I mentioned in my commentary around treasury services, which is a good example where you know deposits are up you know around 20% and I think that's a great example where you know it's not only about getting deposits. ","It also brings with it other activity and fees with it as we sort of go after that, those relationships. And I think that effort that we've got is really across every single one of our businesses, with the asset servicing, corporate trust, treasury services, wealth management, and I think at varying degrees we\u2019ve had success in growing our share of operating deposits across the different client segments. ","Todd Gibbons","Yeah, I would add to that Alex. This was not a focus of ours in years gone past, especially in zero rate environments and with leverage ratios and so forth, but today we\u2019ve established a couple of these campaigns and we've been pretty successful and you know we\u2019re a very attractive client or counterparty for depositors and we can connect it to the businesses. It makes a lot of sense. The more we can get to payments business, the more opportunity we've gotten to grow our deposit base. So it's largely just increased focused and targeted campaigns. ","Alexander Blostein ","Got it, thanks. And then a more tactical question I guess. With the Fed being back in the market by T-bills, historically we\u2019ve kind of used the deposit rebates of the trust banks that are somewhat correlated with the level of excess reserves in the banking system. Would this create a similar dynamics \u2013 in other words if the Fed becomes again more aggressive in buying back our treasuries and T-bills, would that be an overall helper to the size of the balance sheet as we move forward? ","Todd Gibbons","You know, I think you know \u2013 I mean the deposits have been correlated you know in the past to excess reserves, but you sort of \u2013 you really need to look at it over a period of time and in any given quarter that may or may not be the case and we'll see how the most recent announcement and activity levels sort of play out and the Fed\u2019s just getting into the market now with this week. I think some of those you know trade settle later in the week for the first time, and so I think it\u2019s too early to know exactly what impact it's going to have and I think you really need to think about it over you know some period of time and quarter-to-quarter it may not play out exactly as the historical trend might indicate. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Great, great, thanks very much. A question for both Todd and Mike on the expenses. I think Mike, you mentioned \u2013 if I have wrote this down correctly, an estimate of $100 million to $200 million of restructuring charges in the fourth quarter. If you can talk about the underlying expense that is projected to reduce, I guess going into next year, you know cognizant that you probably don\u2019t want to give guidance for next year yet, but just to get a sense of that. ","And then I guess bigger picture Todd, you talked for a long time about investing in a technology to increasingly automate the business and reduce that operational costs and you've done a lot over the last several years in making progress on that. So just trying to get a sense of as we move forward over the next day one to two years, is this \u2013 did we have a lot more runway and there is initiative to the extent that we can keep the expenses at least flat for the organization or even down. ","A - Todd Gibbons","Okay, Brian why don\u2019t I take the latter part of that and I\u2019ll hand it over to Mike for the earlier part of the question. We've got nearly 100 programs in place so we do continue to see significant opportunity to automate a lot more things like reconciliations. When we look at the accounting platforms and the NAV calculations, there are still many manual processes in there that we are targeting, so I kind of look at \u2013 and there are still you know locations that we can \u2013 that we need to manage where there's opportunity. ","And as we look out to 2020 and some of the things that we can accelerate, I'll call out you know a couple of items. Number one, I think around reconciliations we can increase the scalability of the plant. We've actually been applying machine learning and creating much much more automated reconciliation process. It doesn't seem like a lot, but if you think about what we do as a company, it is a massive undertaking with a huge amount of headcount dedicated to it. ","We\u2019re also investing in a client inquiry system where we\u2019ll digitize all of the clients\u2019 inquiries into us. That doesn't sound like a lot either, but if you can imagine the millions of transactions that we process. If we can automate how we capture inquiries around it, we're also automating our instruction capture and as I mentioned earlier, there's opportunity for us to do more around the accounting services and striking net asset values. ","So as I look out over the next two or three years, this is not a -- we're not stopping, there's a lot more that I think we can do here. ","A - Mike Santomassimo","Yeah, and I think as you think about the charges, that investments we\u2019re making, we've got a very disciplined process to look at the ROI\u2019s and the payback periods for each of the investments and we do that for all of them, so you should assume we\u2019re doing that as we look at the investments we\u2019re making. ","Brian Bedell","Okay, that's all great color. And then just to follow up on the asset servicing. I think Todd you talked about increasing some of the servicing capabilities for alternative. Do you feel that your \u2013 the platform that you have for that right now is adequate to do that or are there potential significant enhancements to come either organically or through acquisition and I guess could you leverage BlackRock\u2019s eFront, with the recently acquired eFront platform. I know you\u2019ve got the relationship with Aladdin. ","A - Todd Gibbons","Yeah, I mean let me go to the beginning of that. When we look at the real estate servicing business, we're growing that quite rapidly from investments that we've made previously and that's just continuing to capture the market. So we see opportunity there without a whole lot of more investment. We\u2019ll have to obviously keep the platform firm. ","Where we are making some investments is more around private equity and credit platforms, so we've got a couple of potential wins there and we are not just looking at BlackRock, but at others for potential partnerships that we might be able to leverage as well. So yeah, we think in the wealth space, without a huge amount of investment we can continue to capture some growth and some market share. ","Brian Bedell","Got it. Great! Thanks very much. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Out next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America. ","Mike Carrier","Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the questions. May be first, just given some of the traction you're seeing in Pershing and Collateral Management, where is the firm today in terms of maybe market share and which strategies are you putting in place to drive additional organic growth and bring on additional clients? ","Todd Gibbons","Okay. Well, I'll start with Collateral Management first. So if you think about our Collateral Management business, it's primarily around tri-party repo, but there are also un-cleared margin rules that are going into effect where the buy side now has to collateralize it's derivative transactions. And those are phased in and so that market is actually growing, so we are benefiting from that. ","Where we are investing is to make it seamless for our clients to move collateral around the world on our platform, which will make them much more efficient, effectively what it does for them, it reduces the amount of liquidity and capital as they have to commit to their own business. So it generates real funding benefits to them, so they are quite excited about it. ","The other thing we're doing is we're investing in automation of the rule set. So if you think about the tri-party repo, two parties have that rules and we've automated that rather than making it a manual process which makes it much, much easier for them to initiate transactions. So that's number one. ","Number two, if you look at the worlds repo market, only about 25% of that uses tri-party today and as we provide these type of services and make it much more attractive for people that are doing things, what they call a bi-lateral repo, which is just doing it directly, so we think we can either use tri-party services or act as a custodian. So we think there is growth potential there, so that's one of the things that were driving for and that will be a two-year process and we're pretty excited about the prospects there. There is a lot of going on in this space. ","The other question was around Pershing. Yeah, Pershing is a little less impactful on the Collateral Management space. Pershing's really providing, clearance and custody for broker dealers investment advisers and to some extent there is some prime business there with hedge funds as well. And the beauty there is that market is growing, the advisory business is growing quite rapidly, we're on the corporate side of that. So there was some lost business due to consolidations. We\u2019ve now implemented enough new business to start to offset that. I think Mike had made that very clear on previous earnings calls and so we see the - we see ourselves in the potential to start showing growth there. ","Mike Carrier","Alright, that\u2019s helpful, and then just a quick clean up. Mike just on the reserve release did you fully exit the exposure on the utility and then same thing on the tax rate, just on the low end. Any update in terms of the guidance or the outlook? ","Mike Santomassimo","We did fully dispose of the exposure for the utility, so there is no more left. And on the tax rates, it's a little noisy just given the in\u2019s and out\u2019s this year, but we haven't given employer guidance, but what we said in the past was sort of 21-plus or minus. My guess is we'll be a little bit below that 21. ","Mike Carrier","Okay, thanks. ","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. ","Rob Wildhack ","Good morning guys. In the business can you give us some details or some thoughts on client attrition and how that has been performing recently versus prior years and what you're doing to maybe improve retention? ","Mike Santomassimo","Rob your phone like gave out there a little bit, on which business you were talking about. Which business was it? ","Rob Wildhack ","The core business. ","Mike Santomassimo","The Asset Servicing business. Sure, I think Todd can add some color in there. You know I think as we as look at the things that we're doing to continue to improve the quality of the service we have, that is directly aimed at continuing to reduce attrition and improve the service level for our clients and I think where we have put focus on that with our largest clients, we are seeing really good traction and results. I think so when you look at the impact that client losses or attrition had in the quarter, it's pretty similar to what you would have seen over the last number of quarters or a couple of years. ","Rob Wildhack ","Okay, thanks. And then Todd, you mentioned decision making around upcoming investment opportunities. It seems like we've talked about a few of them here, but maybe at a higher level can you talk about your priorities and any additional color on the opportunities you are most excited about? Thank you. ","Todd Gibbons","Yeah, I spelled out the priorities earlier and they really continue to basically be, continue with the change agenda that I've been part of over the past couple of years, and I look forward to continuing to drive that. So we are not going to revert to practices that we are weaker than where I think we are now, that's for sure.","In terms of right now where I think we are seeing opportunities is in the wealth space around Pershing and our own wealth management business and we talked about the client business probably in too much detail and I gave you a lot of color there. ","But asset servicing still has quite a few opportunities, we talked a little bit about alts. But to Mike\u2019s earlier point around attrition, as long as our capabilities are as strong as they are and our service is as good as it is, the attrition rate will go down and I think that, I think we'll keep moving the needle on it. You're always going to have some clients leave for some reason or other. We've got to make it more and more difficult for them to leave. That's why we're pretty keen on these \u2013 on these partnerships that we've had. ","The one that we announced with Bloomberg in the quarter is another indication of that and by being able to make it much more convenient for them to do business with us, by a single sign on through Bloomberg to get all kinds of custody information makes, it more difficult to leave and that's what we want to do. ","Rob Wildhack ","Got it, thank you. ","Todd Gibbons","Thank you, Rob. ","Mike Santomassimo ","Alright, thanks everyone. We\u2019ll talk to you next time. ","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Andy Clark. Mr. Clark, you may begin.","Andy Clark","Thanks, Wendy, and welcome, everyone. With us today are Gerald Hassell, our Chairman and CEO; Todd Gibbons, our CFO; as well as several members of our executive management team. Before we begin, let me remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. The actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement on Page 14 of the press release and those identified in our documents filed with the SEC that are available on our website. Forward-looking statements in this call speak only as of today, April 17, 2013, and we will not update forward-looking statements. Our press release and earnings review are available on our website, and we will be using the earnings review to discuss our results.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Gerald. Gerald?","Gerald L. Hassell","Thanks, Andy, and good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us today. I know you have a busy day ahead of you, so let's get right to it.","As you saw from our earnings release, for the first quarter, we reported a loss of $0.23 per share. This included, of course, our previously announced charge of $854 million or $0.73 per share related to a U.S. Tax Court's disallowance of certain tax credits. We were obviously very disappointed in that ruling, and we will appeal it.","Now looking at how our business model performed, we believe we earned about $0.52 or $0.53 per share on a core basis, and Todd will take you through those numbers and how we got there in just a moment. We are pleased to see the year-over-year growth in some of our key revenue items, and Investment Management in particular had another excellent quarter, benefiting from high market values and the 14th consecutive quarter of net long-term inflows. In fact, it was a record quarter in terms of those net long-term flows of $40 billion.","Our record asset flows in the first quarter were driven by increases across all of our asset classes, both passive and active strategies. With passive, we're seeing strong flows in equity products. And our active products are trending upwards, principally with LDI, global equity and global real returns strategies. Our success in attracting new assets helped drive assets under management to a record level of nearly $1.43 trillion. Our investment performance continues to improve versus the 1-, 3- and 5-year periods, and we recently won several awards, notably Lipper Fund Awards, 2 for Dreyfus and 2 for Newton. So all of this bodes well in terms of continuing to capture long-term flows in Investment Management.","In Investment Services, overall fees grew, driven by increases in asset servicing transaction levels and treasury services volumes. It was also nice to see foreign exchange revenues bounce back as volumes have improved and there was a sequential increase in volatility. Now the market environment remains challenging for DRs, Corporate Trusts and net interest income as capital markets activity continues to trend below normal levels, and we all know interest rates remain historically low. The low-rate environment creates the opportunity for us to realize gains as we rebalance and manage the duration risk of our investment securities portfolio. As we've said in the past, you should look at NII and net securities gains combined when assessing our performance.","Expenses were up 3%, and Todd will go through them in just a minute. And as you look at them, you'll see that our discretionary expenses, we believe, are being well controlled. Against that backdrop, we remain very focused on our key priorities of investing in our businesses to drive organic growth and sustainable shareholder value, delivering on our operational excellence initiatives, maintaining a strong balance sheet and, of course, returning capital to shareholders. So let me share some highlights on each of these fronts.","In terms of investing in our businesses, I want to single out a few efforts. First, in Investment Management, we continue to invest in building out our manufacturing and distribution capabilities with a particular focus on the Asia-Pacific region. We've also been expanding in our wealth management franchise, and the results are bearing good fruit. In global collateral services, our investment in creating an end-to-end solution for our clients' growing collateral needs is helping us capture more opportunities. Our new business pipeline is growing very nicely, particularly in the areas of collateral segregation and optimization, as our clients prepare to meet the Dodd-Frank requirements later this summer. And in global markets, we've been building out our capabilities to capture more of our clients' trade order flow across a wider variety of asset classes. And in foreign exchange, we've invested in electronic trading platforms, and we're providing more options to execute standing order instructions. And we've also equipped our traders with enhanced technologies to better negotiate trades. So in essence, we're giving our clients many more reasons to trade with us.","In addition to investing in our businesses, we're also investing in our brand to create a greater awareness of the broad set of investment services and investment management options available to our clients. We are the investments company for the world, serving the entire investment life cycle. But we're also probably the largest investment manager in the world that nobody knows, and we're working to change that.","Now another key priority is our operational excellence initiatives, and we're on track to achieve the savings we've outlined for you. But we're also looking at these initiatives much more strategically. So we're not limiting ourselves to the traditional approach of incremental cost savings. Importantly, we have challenged ourselves and are investing in simplifying our core operating model, retiring legacy systems and utilizing technology to dramatically improve our straight-through processing rates and better manage and reduce the risk in our business model. I am very optimistic that our new leadership team overseeing operations and technology will continue to bring a fresh approach to driving and improving upon these initiatives.","Finally, another key priority is managing our capital wisely and returning excess capital to shareholders. The earnings power and the strength of our business model gives us the flexibility to move forward on our capital plan. And we announced a 15% increase in the quarterly dividend and our plans to repurchase shares worth up to $1.35 billion, which is a 16% increase from the prior year's board authorization.","So in sum, core revenues are pretty strong. We're controlling expenses well. We're investing in our future, and we're able to execute on increasing our dividend and buyback program. So with that, let me turn it over to Todd to go through some of the numbers.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Thanks, Gerald, and good morning, everyone. My comments will follow the quarterly earnings review beginning on Page 2. As Gerald noticed -- noted, EPS was $0.50. That's excluding the tax charge. This quarter includes roughly $0.04 related to a provision that we took for administrative errors that I'll discuss in more detail in a minute, as well as lower-than-normal investment in other income, which, as you know, can vary quite a bit from quarter-to-quarter. It also includes a benefit of approximately $0.01 to $0.02 related to a loan loss provision. The way we look at core earnings, as Gerald mentioned, it nets to about $0.52 to $0.53 for the quarter, which compares to $0.52 in the year-ago quarter. Last year, it's probably worth noting that other income from last year, so this is versus last year, that other income was down $67 million and other expense was up $87 million. We'll go into each of those in a minute. So the underlying quality of our earnings compares quite favorably.","Looking at the numbers on a year-over-year basis, total revenue was $3.6 billion. That's down 1% as fee and other revenue was flat and net interest revenue declined. Investment management and performance fees were up strongly. We had nice fee growth in asset servicing, treasury services, and FX revenue was also up nicely, while declines in NIR, issuer services, other trading and investment and other income offset those gains. Expenses were up 3%, and they were 6% if you exclude amortization of intangible assets, M&I, litigation and restructuring charges. We'll talk more about that in a minute.","Turning to Page 4, where we can call out some business metrics that help explain our underlying performance. You can see that AUM of $1.4 trillion was up 9% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially, resulting from net new business and higher market values. During the quarter, we had record net long-term inflows of $40 billion and short-term outflows of $13 billion. Assets under custody and administration were up 2% year-over-year, that's to $26.3 trillion, driven by net new business and improved market values, partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Linked-quarter AUC\/A was flat, as the increase in market values was offset by the change in currency rates, and net new business was offset by redemptions.","Most of our key metrics showed growth on a year-over-year basis. All clearing metrics were up. DARTS volume and average long-term mutual funds are up quite significantly. Average loans and deposits and wealth management and investment services continue to grow, and average tri-party repo balances continue to grow at a good clip. The main exception was the decline in the market values on securities on loan, and the decline in short interest was -- has negatively impacted demand.","Moving on to fees on Page 6. Asset servicing fees were up 3% year-over-year and sequentially. Both increases reflect increased activity with existing clients, partially offset by lower securities lending revenue. We had an estimated $205 billion in new AUC\/A way wins for an estimated total of $1.2 trillion in AUC wins over the last 12 months. Of that, nearly 50% remains to be converted, primarily over the second and third quarters. Issuer services fees were down 6% year-over-year, and they were up 10% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease primarily resulted from lower DR revenue driven by lower issuance volumes and also lower servicing fees. The sequential increase primarily resulted from higher DR revenue driven by higher core issuance and cancellation fees and, as we expected, the seasonal improvement in dividends. That was partially offset by slightly lower Corporate Trust revenue. Clearing fees were flat year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. The sequential increase was driven by higher mutual fund fees, increases in positions and assets and an increase in DARTS that was partially offset by higher money market fee waivers. Money market fee waivers for the quarter actually increased slightly from the fourth quarter, as well as there were fewer trading days in the first quarter.","Investment Management and performance fees were up 10% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. If you exclude the Meriten acquisition that we closed in the fourth quarter, Investment Management and performance fees were up 9% year-over-year driven by higher market values, net new business and lower money market fee waivers. The sequential decrease reflects seasonally lower performance fees and, as I just mentioned, higher money market fee waivers sequentially. That was partially offset by higher market values. Comparisons to both periods were negatively impacted by the stronger U.S. dollar.","In FX and other trading, revenue was down 16% year-over-year and up 16% sequentially. So looking at the components, FX revenue was up $149 million, was up 10% year-over-year and 41% sequentially as we enjoyed the benefit of higher volumes over both periods. Volatility was slightly off year-over-year but up significantly on a sequential basis. Other trading revenue was $12 million compared with $55 million in the year-ago quarter and $33 million in the prior quarter. The decline was principally driven by losses on interest rate hedges and lower fixed income and equity trading.","Investment and other income totaled $72 million in the quarter. That compares with $139 million a year ago and $116 million in the fourth quarter. Both decreases reflect lower leasing gains, as well as lower foreign currency remeasurement. The year-over-year decrease also includes lower seed capital gains, but the sequential decrease includes lower net gains on loans held for sale that we've retained from a bank that we had previously divested.","Turning to Page 8 of the earnings review, you'll see that the current low interest rate environment continues to have a negative impact on NIR. It was down $46 million versus the year-ago quarter and $6 million sequentially. The year-over-year decrease was driven by lower accretion, basically lower yields on the reinvestment off of securities. And that was partially offset by a change in the mix of earning assets, as well as higher average interest earning assets driven by the much larger deposit level. The sequential decrease was really just driven by lower day count in the first quarter.","The net interest margin was $111 million. That compares to $132 million a year ago and $109 million in the sequential quarter. The year-over-year increase reflects higher average earning interest assets and lower reinvestment yields.","As a reminder, the current low interest rate environment has driven significant improvement in the value of the investment securities portfolio, and it's creating the opportunity for us to realize gains as we rebalance and manage the duration risk in that portfolio. We think that gains on these sales should be considered along with NIR when you look at our total results.","At the quarter end, we had an unrealized gain on the investment securities portfolio of $2.2 billion. We had $48 million in net securities gains during the quarter, so if you look at both the combination of NIR and gains, it was $760 million -- $767 million in -- combined, which compares with $805 million in the year-ago quarter and $775 million in the fourth quarter.","Turning to Page 9, total noninterest expenses x amortization of intangible assets, M&I, litigation and structuring charges were up 6% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Both increases were primarily driven by higher pension expense, and we also had a $48 million provision for administrative errors and certain offshore tax-exempt funds. The year-over-year increase was also driven by the cost of generating certain tax credits, higher software [ph] and net occupancy expense, as well as the impact of the Meriten acquisition. The increase in software costs relates to application development costs and higher amortization related to the new technology projects. We would expect for the balance of 2013 that software and equipment line to continue to grow at about 1% to 2% per quarter as we bring on new projects.","The increase in net occupancy primarily reflects timing of costs associated with our global footprint strategy and, in particular, New York City real estate initiatives. We should start to see the benefit in the second half of this year. The sequential increase also reflects higher incentive expense due to the accelerated vesting of long-term stock awards for retirement-eligible employees.","Before turning to an update of our operational excellence initiatives, I want to provide some final comments on the administrative errors I just discussed. The errors relate to questions about the resident status of certain offshore funds, potentially exposing the company to a tax liability related to the funds earnings. It is possible that we may need to increase the reserve further if losses become probable. Having said that, in the second quarter, we anticipate generating gains of approximately $200 million on a number of transactions, including our portion of a gain from a recent ConvergEx divestiture. Although it's difficult to predict the timing, these gains will basically offset the downside scenario if we do have to increase the provision. We've also completed a review of similar funds in our complex, and we have not identified any similar issues.","Turning to Page 10. You can see the progress of our operational excellence initiatives. Our efforts to date resulted in $137 million in quarterly run rate savings, and incremental program cost totaled about $16 million. During the quarter, we continued our global footprint position migrations. We've ramped up our Eastern European global delivery center. We realized saving by restructuring some of the investment boutiques and consolidating Dreyfus back-office operations, and we've achieved further operational synergies related to the BHF Asset Servicing acquisition. We produced compensation savings from additional IT staff moves to global delivery centers, and we consolidated and reduced real estate square footage, primarily in the New York City, metro and EMEA regions.","As you can see on Page 11, our risk-based capital ratios remain very strong despite the tax provision and the introduction of Basel 2.5. Our estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio was 9.4% at quarter end. That compares to 9.8% at December 31, with the decrease was largely due to the impact of the tax charge that we just mentioned.","Looking at our loan book on Page 13, you can see that the provision for credit losses was a credit of $24 million. That compares to a provision of $5 million in the year-ago quarter. About half of the credit was driven by a broad improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio, and half related to a reduction in our qualitative allowance. Excluding the $854 million charge, the effective tax rate during the quarter was approximately $0.24 -- excuse me, 24%, and that's about in line with our previous guidance.","A few factors I think you should take into your consideration about the current quarter, that is for the second quarter. We should see a seasonal increase in securities lending. While we don't foresee a significant improvement in rates, the combination of net interest revenue and securities gains should be flat to slightly better, and net interest revenue should benefit from the increased day count and the larger securities portfolio. The quarterly provision should be around 0. We plan to repurchase shares during the quarter. And the effective tax rate should come in at 25% to 26%.","With that, let me hand it back to Gerald.","Gerald L. Hassell","Great. Thanks, Todd. And Wendy, I think we can open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question today is from Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Gerald, you mentioned the signs of momentum across the franchise, but despite the new business wins and the higher asset levels and improved market tones, revenues are still down from last year and earnings are flattish. So while I know you're always trying to be disciplined on expenses, what do you need to see in the environment to potentially raise the ultimate goals of the operational excellence program?","Gerald L. Hassell","First of all, the revenue decline year-over-year was mostly in the net interest income line, and we've taken some steps to shore that up. And on the expense side, we do have the operational excellence initiatives underway, as I said in my comments that we're always looking to improve upon those. We haven't come out publicly and said we want to do something better than what we've already laid out for you, but I can assure you that we're working very hard to continue to maintain or lower the running rate expenses associated with this low economic environment and to take out costs structurally on a long-term basis.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then relating to the fixed income business, I realize it's still a modest contribution, but how would you say early progress is going? And are the nature of those hedges related to overall balance sheet management, a particular trading strategy or something else?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, the -- why don't I talk about hedges. Most of the decline was related to the hedges, and there are really 2 of them. One is hedging traditional interest rate risk, but the hedge didn't -- doesn't qualify, in that case, as a hedging instrument, so its mark-to-market fluctuates with changes in rates. We don't typically see such a big move, but that was a reasonably significant component of it. The other aspect of it is one of our boutiques is particularly sensitive to changes in interest rates, their revenues are. So they have a relatively modest hedge. So that's more of a timing issue, Howard. So what ends up happening is the mark on the hedge we take now and the revenue will be reflected in future quarters, and it could go the other way. The rest of the other trading was also soft, so our fixed income and our equity trading was a little bit soft for us in the first quarter.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then finally for me, Todd, your CCAR results were quite strong, and the approved capital plan is pretty meaningful. But with that buyback plan that you have in hand and the new business that you see installing over the next few quarters and the higher asset levels, at what point, if at all, does leverage become a constraint again for you to work down the share count and buy back stock?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, we don't see it. I mean, we -- right now the balance sheet is staying fairly stable. It's still pretty large, but it's not growing, and we don't see an environment where that would change. So we're not constrained right now by that leverage ratio. We think we can balance the 2, execute our buybacks, manage the size of the balance sheet and continue to execute on the capital deployment that we've authorized.","Operator","Our next question is with Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Can I start by asking you a little bit about the impact of FX translation? You mentioned it being in the investment management line. I was just wondering if you saw that across the income statement and whether or not it had a net effect to the bottom line?","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes, it -- Ken, it was basically neutral to the bottom line. It -- there was a little bit of geography on it. The most impactful was on the revenue line for asset management. But net-net, it was about neutral to the company, and it wasn't that meaningful that it moved revenues positively or negatively.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And second question, the servicing business showed really well this quarter, and I was just wondering if you can kind of give us some color underneath and it looks -- you talked about the wins and the still to be implemented. Can you just talk a little bit about just what the drivers are? Underneath, it looks like SEC lending was down, so how much of it was custody versus broker dealer versus collateral, and some more color on the underlying?","Gerald L. Hassell","Why don't we have Tim take that question, Ken?","Timothy F. Keaney","Yes. Ken, yes, I would say we're seeing volumes helping us in our asset servicing business and net new. We still have about $540 billion left to convert. Our payments business grew nicely as well. That was volume-driven. We're also seeing a general tailwind, both around outsourcing, where in our broker-dealer clearing and purging business, a number of small or midsized brokers are looking at getting out of self-clearing and outsourcing infrastructure. And then in asset servicing, we still see a continuing trend in the investment management sector and the insurance sector, where they're outsourcing their middle and back office. So I would say those are the general drivers.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. My last one, just a quick one. Just on issuer, I know it's talked about sequentially DR is better, but Corporate Trust is still lower. Can you just -- can we talk a little bit just through that Corporate Trust piece? And is it close to bottoming yet for either sequentially and year-over-year? When do we finally run out of that on the bottom side?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, Ken, what we've indicated is that we think the contraction in Corporate Trust would probably have an impact of maybe 50 to 75 basis points negative in our -- as the runoffs exceed the new business, maybe 50 to 75 basis points in our revenue. It's actually done a little better than we had anticipated, and the reason for that is we've seen quite a few more CLOs, with our -- seen a recovery of that side of the structured market, and a fair amount of issuance, but it's still we would expect it to runoff at about that rate. The more negative thing has been the cyclical impact that we're experiencing in DRs is even -- that hasn't bounced back. So we continue to see more cancellations than issuance, and so the universe of outstanding DRs for us to generate income on has declined.","Operator","The next question is from Josh Levin with Citi.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Gerald, did I hear you correctly in your prepared remarks? Did you say you're sort of thinking differently about costs? Did you allude to something, some kind of change in thinking?","Gerald L. Hassell","No. The comment I made about it was we had our operational excellence initiatives in place that we publicly announced to everyone. We're on track or slightly ahead of achieving those. But my comment was we're looking at this and challenged ourselves to look at it beyond just traditional incremental cost savings and are looking at the core operating platforms of the company. I've said to many of you that one of our real challenges is we're too complex to our clients in terms of our various operating platforms, our accounting engines, our reconciliation engines, et cetera. We're looking to dramatically simplify that and, therefore, make it easier and better for our clients to do business with us, take risk out of the system and lower the structural costs. And so we're moving into that phase of our review. We have a new leadership team around this. They're putting some fresh eyes on this. And I'm optimistic we can gain some more benefits out of our program over the long term. That's what I was referring to.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, and then a follow-up. When you look at your different business lines, where do you see the most opportunities or the opportunities for the greatest amount of operating leverage and the least amount of operating leverage?","Gerald L. Hassell","Well, I guess I would address this slightly differently in terms of the way you've asked it. We've traditionally looked at our investment services businesses as a series of individual business lines and almost as a portfolio of businesses. We're looking at this much more holistically because that's what our clients do. And so rather than having individual operating platforms per business, we're looking to consolidate across the business lines and, therefore, offer our clients a more integrated product set and integrated solution set. That's where I think there are some benefits working across the seams of our businesses to improve not only the structural cost but also the service offering to our clients. So that's where I think there is continued upside leverage to our business model.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Josh, I'll just follow up on that. If you look at -- if you do look at the 4 key investment servicing lines that we indicate or we disclosed, the highest margin tends to be issuer services and treasury services, and then asset servicing and clearing services tend to have about the same margin. So that'll help you understand where the growth is going to come from.","Operator","The next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A quick follow-up on the conversation you're just having and then a couple of other questions. On the follow-up, in order to do this, does it take an incremental investment spend beyond what you've discussed with us before? Or is this embedded within the expense trajectory run rate that you've laid out?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, the -- as we've disclosed, right now we're most focused on delivering the savings that we've talked about, which is in the $650 million to $700 million range. That is net, so every quarter we disclose to you exactly what our investment activity is going to be to get there. So what we've laid out, we don't want to get distracted. We're going to execute on that. Gerald is looking at -- he's really referring to what are the incremental things that we can do as we look at that expense base holistically. And at this point in time, it's too early to really say whether there's an investment to be made there or not, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. All right. That will come in -- you'll describe that in future quarters. Okay.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes.","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then the second thing is on the administrative error review. You indicated that there's a potential downside scenario, and I just wanted to understand what that is a function of. I mean, obviously, there's -- the review needs to be completed. And then you're assessing the downside risk? Or are there other people you have to get opinions from, like regulators or tax people within different jurisdictions?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, ultimately, we're going to have to work with tax authorities to determine whether we are obligated to pay tax on these investment gains. And what we want to make clear is the downside to that, if we do have a downside, it will offset the gains that we have from a number of transactions that we're going to close on or have closed on in this quarter.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So you're expecting that the finalization of your assessment of the downside scenario would be made within the next quarter?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, I can't -- I'm not certain of that, Betsy. There is some lack of certainty. So it's possible that we could show gains in this quarter and still have that open item.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then lastly, Todd, you were talking about how we should be looking at NII plus security gains when we're thinking about returns on the portfolio. And I'm just wondering how to think about the -- how long we should be thinking about your ability to harvest security gains going forward in the current interest rate environment?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes. The gains are coming from a couple of different sources. One is as you come riding down the yield curve a little bit, if interest rates haven't changed, you actually get an increase in the market value of the security. And there also becomes interest from money market funds and so forth to pick up those assets as they become eligible for funds. So as they -- kind of as we do a rich\/cheap analysis across the yield curve, that's generating, in our estimate, about half of them. The other half is really based on credit and the significant recovery in some of the sub-investment-grade securities. There's still many, many hundreds of millions of dollars in unrealized gains there. But what the team does is they look at the -- they look at how those securities have performed, the capital that they've consumed and where they can redeploy. And from time to time, there's a good reason, there's an economic reason for us to take them and we do. And so there's a substantial amount of a gain in the portfolio there that could be realized for a significant period of time if we stay in this rate environment.","Operator","The next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So just to follow up on the last question, when we think about the reinvestment. Can you guys talk a little about the yields that the securities that you're currently selling are earning today and maybe perhaps what you're reinvesting in and the yields on those investments?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes. If they're in the credit securities, Alex, they can have a little bit of higher yields. But you're even seeing those securities come down into 3% or 4% type of range. So there's kind of modest sales because the gains are so big, so you're not giving up a whole lot of securities. It does have a little bit of -- when we net it all out, it could have a little bit of negative net interest income, but it's the right economic thing to do under the time -- at the time. New investments, we look across globally. It's probably averaging in the $150 million to $160 million within the securities portfolio.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, just one more time on the administrative error, and it sounds like you guys have some downside scenario in mind. I was hoping you could share that with us, what the, I guess, max liability could be. And you mentioned a couple of sources of gains that you could take. Does that involve just some of the businesses that you sold? Or does that involve a step-up in security sales? Like how should we think, I guess, about bridging the gap, like knowing what the ultimate potential downside could be?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes. We have announced a few divestitures and closed on one of them, and there are more that we'll close in the quarter. And those gains, so those are known gains right now that we will take in the second quarter, are about the same amount that the downside case, if it's determined that we do have a tax liability and that 100% of that exposure, if we end up having to create a provision for that.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay, and just the last one for me. On the side of the balance sheet, it seems like noninterest-bearing deposits came down. We're seeing the same with a couple of your competitors. But as we look out from here, does the balance sheet stay sort of stable? Or does it grow with net new business? I guess, how should we think about the size of average earning assets from here?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes. The balance sheet has been relatively stable for the quarter, and there's a little bit of a decline right at the -- from the very high levels that we had at the end of the fourth quarter. But for these -- for the first quarter and moving into the second quarter, it's been relatively stable. I think as we grow assets, we would see some growth in the balance sheet that typically comes with that. What I mean by that is we -- as we grow assets that we service, whether it's in corporate trust or in asset servicing or, for that matter, at -- in clearing, we would expect to see about a similar growth rate in the underlying deposits. The real driver, though, is if there's some economic environment that changes, whether there's a flight to the quality or that the people continue to go out the risk curve, where you might see some of the balances flow out into the market.","Operator","The next question is from Glenn Schorr with Nomura.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","First question, I guess, is on just the top-level view of assets under custody, flat quarter-on-quarter, plus 2% year-on-year. The fees are in that same range, up 4% quarter-on-quarter, 1% year-on-year. So you mentioned a lot of the moving parts on the fee side. On the asset side, I'm just curious why we might not have seen better growth given the environment? And maybe it's a mix of business you can talk about what might be in the running off versus the new -- the type of new business that you're bringing on.","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes. Tim, why don't you take that one?","Timothy F. Keaney","Sure. Glenn, yes, I think what you see playing out a little bit with us here, Glenn, and we've talked about this before, we're a bit more of a fixed-income-oriented book. So income markets were sort of up marginally to flat. We did convert about $350 billion in the quarter. Currency is clearly not helping us here. We did sadly lose one pretty significant client, and you also saw that come out of our securities lending program, and we had some redemptions in fixed income and in money markets. So those were sort of the headwinds. But I think the good news story is, and this has been more of a continuing trend here, is the types of products and services that we're winning and the clients are putting out to bid isn't really geared to AUC. So a transfer agency, sub accounting, middle-office outsourcing would be 3 good examples of that. And I would say our pipeline probably averages about 40%, and about 40% of what we've been winning in the last few quarters would be that type of business that's not geared to AUC. And I think that's why you're seeing sort of a little bit of a gap between AUC and actually having higher fee growth than what you're seeing on the AUC line. So that is something I would expect to continue.","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes, so Glenn, bottom line, we saw some redemptions in the loss of a significant client, which we're not pleased with at all. But it was offset by new convergence and new business coming in. That's the way to think about it.","Timothy F. Keaney","Yes, and I think you also have to think about our mix of assets, too, because despite the very strong equity market, the net impact between currency and market was basically flat in our mix of assets.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Yes, I hear you. It actually makes me ask a silly question of I'm not sure what you're supposed to root for, higher rates or lower rates, because...","Gerald L. Hassell","Still like higher rates.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, we'll go with the higher one.","Gerald L. Hassell","I'll go with the higher rates, Glenn.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Last one, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned on the expense side, obviously, the operating excellence benefits, but you talked about doing a decent job on what is discretionary. And I didn't know if you can give a little more color on what you thought across the expense line items, what the key numbers, what are -- what is discretionary and what isn't. In other words, you mentioned software is going to have to grow as you put new business on, but can the professional fees, can the sub custodian fees -- where do you see some discretion?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes. Why don't we tick through a number of them? Our staff expense has some measure of discretion. So if you see -- I mean, it is up for the quarter, but recall this is a quarter where we have about $50 million of acceleration related to equity grants for retirement-eligible employees. And we also saw a $10 million increase in our defined benefit pension expense. So we were able to absorb all of that and still show some improvement. On the professional, legal and other, the biggest component in there is consulting and any discretionary use of consultants, we're keeping a very close eye on. Software and equipment is -- a lot of that is the investment that we've made in the past as it comes online and the depreciation actually picks up. So that's a little -- at this point, it's a little less discretionary. Occupancy, just is we're going to see some improvement there, Glenn, as the -- especially the footprint actions that we've taken around New York City start to pay off. So we actually wrote off some leasehold improvements in the quarter, and then we'll have a lower run rate going forward. So that's a good investment. And the other discretionary item is business development. And you can see that we've controlled it despite the efforts that we're making to invest in our brand, and we will see some expenses around the branding efforts.","Operator","Our next question is from Cynthia Mayer with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So maybe just quickly a follow-up on Glenn's question on AUC. I understand that you lost a big client, but the $205 billion in new wins also seems a little light, at least compared to the 12-month figure you give. And I'm wondering, is that lumpiness? Or do you see wins slowing down at all? And then also on the loss of the significant client, is that a big enough client to impact SEC lending going forward?","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes. So why don't -- I'll take part of it and then turn it over to Tim. Yes, it was a significant client both in terms of assets under custody and they there were active in the SEC lending program. That's why it showed up in both categories. And as you all know, we hate to lose, and we're kicking ourselves for losing it. It was a very competitive environment and we lost. But the lumpiness, we do see quarter-to-quarter lumpiness in the win side as well. And so this quarter, we saw $200-and-some-odd billion worth of wins. The pipeline is quite strong. It's actually up year-over-year, so we're encouraged by our ability to win new business out of the pipeline going forward. And we still have about $0.5 trillion worth of assets under custody yet to convert. So we still see positive attributes in terms of our ability to grow this business. But Tim, if you want to pick up on it?","Timothy F. Keaney","Oh, no, Gerald, I think the only other thing I would add to that, Cynthia, is, again, back to that mix point of sort of the 40%-ish not being geared to AUC. So when we look at this internally, we look at AUC and we also look at the value of what we're converting. And I would have put this sort of in the pretty good news camp in terms of the $205 billion when you look at it on a value basis.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then, I guess, on the AUM side, you guys had strong long-term flows in the quarter, so can you talk a little about where the bulk of those flows were coming from? What's the blended fee rate on those? And was any of that seasonal?","Gerald L. Hassell","We have Mitchell Harris with us here today, representing Investment Management. So Mitchell, perhaps you can address that.","Mitchell Evan Harris","Sure. A lot of it is coming through LDI, which tends to have a somewhat lower margin. But we are starting to see a subtle shift in the markets, and we are starting to see international equity and Asian equities, global equities, real returns, as well as emerging market debt taking part of those flows. So I think what we see longer term is a subtle shift from the lower-value fixed income products to a slow shift toward more of the equity products and the higher-value fixed income products like high yield and emerging market debt.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then maybe just one final one on custody. Can you update us on the repricing initiatives?","Gerald L. Hassell","Tim, that's yours.","Timothy F. Keaney","Yes, sure. Cynthia, thanks for asking. You'll remember that we're sort of focusing our repricing effort not on the 80% of the fee line where it's more about cross selling, it's on sort of the 20%, the small- and medium-sized clients. We're making very good progress. All of the clients -- small clients have been repriced. And as I think we talked about last quarter, we're sort of now renegotiating with clients as their contracts come up for review, and those tend to be the larger clients that are invested in multiple products. So the good news is we've been making very good headway there. We'll have another couple of hundred clients that will reprice this year. I expect the retention rates to remain high, although I expect the percentage rate increase that we will get will step down a bit well below in the 18% to 19% we've been seeing in the small clients, so sort of right where I'd hope to be right now, frankly.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Foran with Autonomous.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP","I guess I wanted to ask about a higher-rate environment as we think out a couple of years and maybe build scenarios into models and stuff like that. So 2 questions, I guess one more mechanical, just with the securities changes you're talking about. Should we expect you to get more asset-sensitive as time goes by? And then, two, when we think about the benefit to NII and money market fee waivers that you give us, should we drop that all to the bottom line in a higher-rate environment and kind of think about a step change in pretax margins? Or would there be kind of some kind of change in the expense outlook as revenue changed as well?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Brian, the -- talking about the money market fee waivers, most of that would drop to the bottom line. What you can't predict is exactly what investor behavior is going to be. I don't know if we'll see more money come into funds or there's a reason why rates are higher and money could exit. But assuming behavior is the same, that would be a significant contributor to -- and it would be just a step function, if you will, in the -- in our EPS. Looking at the interest rates on our other earnings areas, for example, securities lending, there are a lot of reinvest -- or repriced assets south of LIBOR, so there's very little LIBOR curve there. So it could help that substantially. Again, that would be a very high-margin business, most of it dropping to the bottom line. And finally, with our net interest revenue, so we're sitting on an awful lot of money that is earning 0 or something very close to 0, just in the European Central Bank, for example. That can be anywhere from $10 billion to $20 billion that is earning 0. So if we do see a blip up, there would be some ability to generate some income there, as well as on the compression on our other deposits. So I can't predict exactly what investor behavior would be. We would certainly not expect it to be at such an inflated balance sheet in the event that we did see a tick-up in interest rates. But we would, as we've modeled this, we would expect significantly higher NIR as well.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP","I guess as you think out as well about business opportunities in the collateral management and transformation opportunity you've been working to, just what happened year-to-date? Would the regulatory changes just kind of push out the opportunity? Or has the opportunity been modified somewhat?","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes, it's part of the Dodd-Frank legislation, and the rule writing is still being finalized. But we expect to see -- and it's showing up in our pipeline and our client conversations later this summer. So some part of collateral management's being realized upon as we speak, particularly in some of the transformation activities. But as I said in my opening comments, we expect to see a broader pickup later this summer and through the course of the year as Dodd-Frank legislation kicks in and our clients really do, in fact, have to start posting collateral all around the world.","Thomas P. Gibbons","The other thing that's happened is the financing-related aspects of it have actually picked up, so we've seen pretty decent growth there. But spreads and rates have come down, so just over the past 6 to 9 months, LIBOR's down about another 12 or 14 basis points. So the repricing of that portfolio could benefit from the growth that's been offset by the repricing.","Operator","The next question is from Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Yes. So among your custodian peers, you experienced the most amount of reinvestment risk -- or pressure, rather, last year. And I was wondering if you might comment if there's been any changes in the composition or position of the portfolios in the last year, including seasoning or legacy yields that would increase or decrease your exposure or reinvestment risk this year, assuming that rates stay low?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, we've put on a little more duration in the portfolio when we saw interest rates pop a little. When the tenure went up over 2%, we did extend it and take the opportunity to extend a little bit of the duration of the portfolio. And that's why we're feeling that it'll probably be -- the yield on the portfolio should be a little more stable going into the next -- into the rest of the year. Plus, we've put a little more to work, so the portfolio is up by about 6%. During the course of the quarter, most of that was -- most of the benefit of that wasn't really seen in the quarter. We'll see it in the second quarter.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then you said in the past that we might be able to gauge the success of your cost efficiency program by looking at pretax margin x NII and servicing. I'm not sure if there's any distortion in the trends there, but I was wondering if -- how you might comment on how you're grading yourself on that metric.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes. If you look at the investment services business, we give you a statistic that shows you the margin relative -- on the fee business, and it's stuck at about 93% on a year-over-year basis. That's largely -- what it's masking is the decrease in our higher-margin businesses is masking the improvement that we've -- that we're seeing in asset servicing. So I think it's moving about as we've expected. Now it's going to be a function of where the revenue lines are moving.","Gerald L. Hassell","Well, I was just going to say you can see, from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, we saw it getting back to that 93% zone from the fourth quarter. So some of the savings are, in fact, kicking in, and we just -- we saw some higher-yielding business come on, like foreign exchange, like some of our other asset servicing repricing. So you are starting to see some benefit from the overall program.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then just a final one for me, I know you've commented twice already, but I wanted to give it one more try on the technology spending. Your competitor is saying they plan to become the low-cost provider in servicing through its technology transformation, and you're acknowledging that you're still working on rationalizing your various platforms. So I'm wondering is the kind of transformation that State Street's talking about even possible if you don't first combine your platforms? And is what you're saying is that you now believe it's imperative for competitive reasons that you need to start a new investment cycle? Or am I just reading too much into that?","Gerald L. Hassell","Well, I think, first of all, we spend a couple of billion dollars a year already on technology, so it's not that we're starting from 0. And it's a matter of prioritization of some of those technology spends on maintaining existing programs versus investing in new ones. And I think part of our job, as the senior management team, is to make sure we're allocating capital in our investments in the proper category to achieve the end-state platforms that we're looking to get to. And we're going through that process now to make sure we're investing in the future architecture of the company. Since many of our products are commodity like, I think we have to be an incredibly productive and incredibly efficient operating platforms in order to remain competitive and to continue to grow our business. And so strategically, that's what we're looking to do, is take advantage of the new technologies, to invest in those sooner to get to the end state faster. We're not ready to talk about what the level of investment is to get there. We're still going through that process, but I can assure we're looking at all avenues to take advantage of the new technologies in the marketplace.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I know you guys are a preeminent trustee, and I'm going to ask about the $8.5 billion settlement where Bank of New York is acting as trustee for MBS from the country-wide situation. And there was an expert opinion filed by an Adam Levitin saying why the deal should fail. And some other experts have said this deal might not go through. And I guess the hearings start May 30, where the court will rule if that deal should go through. So I guess my question is, what assurance can you provide investors that both the deal will go through and that Bank of New York won't be vulnerable to additional losses? I guess there are $108 billion of investor losses and Bank of New York, acting as trustee, decide $8.5 billion was the right amount. So correct anything I said that was incorrect, and tell me why you think this deal might go through or your view on it.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Well, Mike, it's Todd. I'll take that. Certainly, as trustee, we believe we've acted at all times in the best interests of the investors, so we're confident about our position there. In terms of our exposure, we are completely indemnified. So we don't see any specific -- we don't see or nor are we particularly concerned about risks to us in our role. It's impossible for us to determine how the courts will ultimately rule, but again, we're indemnified, and we're quite comfortable with our position.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","All right. Well, I guess the one issue I'd focused on is who made the determination that an $8.5 billion settlement was the right amount. And based on the review that I've done relying on some legal experts, it seems as though only one firm, RRMS, came up with that valuation number. Now there's other experts who I think said that number was okay, and you, obviously, would rely on other experts outside of the financial area. But is that correct, that there's just -- you solely relied on RRMS for the financial conclusion that $8.5 billion was the right number? And what gives you confidence that, that firm, RRMS, did a sufficiently good job?","Gerald L. Hassell","Well, you have to remember, Mike, that firm worked with, I think, it was 18 large investors who were the principal owners of those tranches of investment -- of securities. So you add 18 very large investors who thought that, that was an appropriate amount to settle on, not the firm that you're referring to and not us. That -- those 18 investors with that firm had discussions with BofA in terms of whether that was an appropriate settlement. And we're now looking to the courts to decide.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And I'll queue if I can call this my second-half follow-up. Those large investors, I think, comprised only around 23% of the total investments. And so that would imply there's almost another 80% of investors who would not be represented by those 18, or I had 22, large investors who agreed to that agreement.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Well, Mike, that's what the -- why we -- why it's in the courts. It's up to the courts to decide. It's not up to us.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Bedell with ISI Group.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just back to the fundamentals. On the -- just a question on the Investment Management business, the realization rate on the assets under management were a little less than I thought. If you can outline maybe the contribution from the negative foreign currency translation, maybe that was the bigger driver, and also the money market fee waiver delta from 4Q to 1Q, and whether, other than mix shifts between products, that, that was the primary driver?","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes. Mitchell, why don't you take the fee realization side of the question.","Mitchell Evan Harris","Sure. It is mostly -- Brian, you're right. It is mostly on the foreign exchange side. We're quite heavily exposed on our equities to sterling. Sterling is the bigger driver. It's about 2\/3 of the current currency exposure to sterling, which fell more than the euro did. The euro is the other part we're heavily exposed to. So over 50% of our equity revenues are exposed to non-U.S. currencies. So that's really been the drag going into the first quarter.","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes. And on the money market fee waiver, they were up a little bit on a sequential quarter basis.","Mitchell Evan Harris","It was small.","Gerald L. Hassell","But not a terrible amount.","Thomas P. Gibbons","For asset management, it was sequentially -- it hurt them by about $5 million. On year-over-year basis, it helped them by about $5 million. And it's about double that for the company.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Double that, so okay, is it about 5 -- I think you were at like  a $0.04 to $0.05 EPS run rate on fee waivers in prior quarters. Is that still the right page? Or is it a little worse than that?","Thomas P. Gibbons","No, it is, Brian. It's still in that range.","Gerald L. Hassell","That's about that same range.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Same range, okay. And then just lastly on the purging business, if you can you talk about some of the outsourcing opportunities and maybe sort of the timeline that you're thinking that you can convert some new wins there and whether the organic growth -- the organic revenue growth from that can -- we can sort of see -- begin to see that in the results relative to the macro drivers of trading and, obviously, fee waivers.","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes, we'll have Brian Shea take that question.","Brian T. Shea","Brian, it's Brian Shea. I would just -- I'll reverse it a little bit and just talk about the organic growth drivers first for a second and then come back to your new business pipeline-related question. The core assets on our platform are growing pretty well. So customer assets on the platform are up year-over-year double digits and 6% sequentially. Mutual fund assets are up pretty solidly, and that's -- and what's important about that is that we had significant net new long-term issue fund flows on our U.S. platform in the first quarter and a real shift in the balance of the investor behavior. Meaning that last year at this time, it was primarily fixed-income-oriented mutual funds. And this year, through the first quarter, it's a predominantly equity-oriented mutual funds, which is a pretty big shift in investor sentiment. And while we're not the predictor of that, that would be, I think, a positive trend if it sustains itself in terms of investor behavior and willingness to trade. And you're seeing that a little bit in the higher DARTS volume as well. So the fundamentals of the current businesses are pretty solid, and so we like that. In terms of the new business, what's happening is we're starting to see larger opportunities from self-clearing firms. And it's really driven, I think, by continued pressure on large financial institutions in terms of regulatory change, capital requirements, capital investment. So they're thinking through what their core competencies are and what -- where they can create their own leverage. And so we're starting to see bigger global wealth management firms consider outsourcing to the purging platform. So too hard -- hard to tell at this point whether -- what the yield will be on that or the timing, but we're hopeful that we'll see some decisions in the second and third quarter. And we're deeply involved in dialogue with a handful of firms.","Operator","The next question is from Robert Lee with KBW.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to -- first, guys, I just wanted to clarify a little bit on your new business win metrics. I guess I have always assumed that, that was a net number, net of known future losses. Is that net or gross, the $500 billion left to convert?","Timothy F. Keaney","Yes, that's a -- Rob, it's Tim. That's a gross number.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","So I guess the follow-up to that, if we were to think of a net number based on known losses, accounts, things you may lose, what would that be?","Timothy F. Keaney","I think the last time I looked at that, it will be a net positive as I look out over the next quarter or 2.","Thomas P. Gibbons","We don't lose -- typically, lose a whole lot of business, Rob.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe a second question. I'm just curious, within issuer services, obviously, you still have the runoff with the legacy book. But as you pointed out, CLO activities certainly picked up since the start of the year. And I'm just curious about any changes in the pricing dynamics of what you're seeing on like new CLO activity compared to maybe some legacy products that are running off. Is the pricing similar? Has there been a change in the pricing dynamic one way or the other?","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes, I think on the new CLOs, first of all, you have to remember they're less complex, less leveraged, and therefore, that's one of the reasons why the pricing on the new CLOs is lower than the old ones that are rolling off. And you have to remember, when the old ones were being established at that time, it was in a fairly frenetic market where the pricing discipline, if you want to call it that, part of the issue was less sensitive, and so the new business is much more tightly priced. So that's factoring into why the growth in Corporate Trust, even with CLO, is picking up, isn't fully offsetting the amortization of the old structures.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","All right. Great. And since I'm the last one, can I maybe just -- indulge me on one more question?","Gerald L. Hassell","Okay. Go ahead.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","In wealth management, you've had pretty strong growth in loans and deposits. And I'm just curious, with some evidence of there being some increased risk-taking, I guess, conventional wisdom, to some extent, has been that, that's coming out of kind of cash, so maybe deposits. I'm just kind of curious, you had this strong growth in deposits and wealth management, is that just market share gains that you're seeing? Is it -- is there something else going on in there because it's been pretty strong?","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes, I know. Actually, I'm delighted you asked the question. We like the wealth management business a lot. I think we are, in fact, gaining market share. We've added quite a bit of new staff to the team, and I think it's paying off. Some of the traditional wealth management firms that supported wealth management clients around the country or around the world have been challenged a little bit reputationally, and we've got strong investment management products. We have a great balance sheet. The loans that we're putting on are very, very, very high-quality loans. So we like the business a lot, and it's growing nicely. We'd like to continue to invest in it more.","Okay. Thanks a lot, Rob, and thank you very much, everyone who dialed in. And we appreciate the call. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent.","I will now turn the call over to Ms. Valerie Haertel. Ms. Haertel, you may begin.","Valerie Haertel","Thank you. Good morning, and welcome everyone to the BNY Mellon first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With us today are Gerald Hassell, our Chairman and CEO; Todd Gibbons, our CFO; as well as members of our executive leadership team.","Our first quarter earnings materials include a financial highlights presentation that will be referred to in the discussion of our results, and can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. You will note that we updated our assets under management reporting in our press release to improve transparency and to align our investment strategies with similar fee rates. I'd also like to take this opportunity to let you know that we will hold our Investor Day this year on Thursday, November 16 in New York City. We will provide further details as we move closer to the meeting but please mark the date on your calendars. We hope that you will be able to attend.","Before Gerald and Todd discuss our results, let me take a moment to remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release, the financial highlights presentation and those identified in our documents filed with the SEC that are available on the website, bnymellon.com. Forward-looking statements made on this call today speak only as of today, April 20, 2017, and we will not update forward-looking statements.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Gerald Hassell. Gerald?","Gerald Hassell","Thanks, Valerie and thank you for joining us this morning. As you may have seen from our release, we again delivered double-digit earnings per share growth for the quarter. We earned $0.83 per share, up 14% year-over-year, which includes a $0.03 per share tax benefit related to new accounting guidance for stock awards. And looking at our results on an adjusted basis total revenue grew by 2%, driven by 4% growth in Investment Services fees and 4% growth in Investment Management and performance fees and 3% growth in net interest revenue.","Total non-interest expense was up 1%, resulting in nearly 130 basis points of positive operating leverage. Our pretax operating margin increased to 33% and we are continuing to deliver high returns on tangible common equity this quarter achieving a very healthy return of 22%. And since we shared our three-year strategic plan with you on October of 2014, we have delivered nine straight quarters of solid performance against the EPS calls that we laid out for ourselves. The relative consistency of our results reflects how well our dynamic, well-diversified, low-risk business model is positioned to create increased value for clients and shareholders through all environments.","So now let me update you on our progress against our strategic priorities during the quarter. Our top priority is enhancing the client experience and driving profitable revenue growth. In Investment Services, we've been investing in cutting-edge collateral optimization and management solutions that we delivered to both the buy-side and the sell-side. During the quarter, collateral balances continued to show robust growth, which speaks to the strong level of client uptake that we have experienced. Another area of investment has involved building best-in-class technology and middle-office services that enable asset managers to leverage our scale and expertise.","Now you may recall that back at our Investor Day, we discussed the market opportunity to service alternatives, including real estate assets. Yesterday, we announced that PGIM Real Estate, the real estate business of Prudential Financial, one of the Top 10 real estate investment managers in the U.S. selected us to provide fund administrative services for $33 billion in U.S. real estate assets. And these assets are not included in our assets under custody and assets in our administration win for the first quarter, but they will be included in the second quarter. This mandate is a clear endorsement that our investment in the alternatives space are paying off.","We were also recently selected by AIA Group, the largest independent publicly listed Pan-Asian Life Insurance Group to provide investment book of records software and to consolidate all of our Investment Management data on to a single platform. And we're seeing a demand for investment books of records solutions as global investment returns firms seek to replace legacy platforms to manage investment risk, improve decision-making, and ensure consistency in reporting. Our best-in-class Eagle data management platform is well positioned to meet that demand and given its flexibility and our ability and to scale to support growth.","Now for the quarter, we had $109 billion in estimated new AUC assets under administration and business wins, which I'll remind you excludes the impact of the Prudential transaction. So we're off to a good start in 2017. And we remain encouraged by the strength of our new business pipeline.","In Investment Management, we had a good quarter with revenue up 8% and pretax income, excluding intangibles, up 24%. Our adjusted pretax operating margins rose to 34% helped by increased revenues and various expense actions. Overall, asset management flows improved to their highest level in several years. Of note, our cash business - above [ph] the industry trend of outflows and in the quarter, we added $13 billion in assets inflows.","Now looking at our investment performance over the longer term, we continue to see strong performance with two-thirds of our actively managed mutual fund assets ranked ahead of their peer median on a three and a five-year basis. Within the business, we are continuing to revitalize our investment product portfolio to meet evolving client demand. So for example, some of the greatest growth opportunities in active management lie in multi-asset class, alternative and specialist active equity strategies. As a result, we are working to increase our product offering in these areas. And we've also been investing to develop additional capabilities in credit, real return, equity income and liability-driven investment.","Across all of our businesses, we continue to focus on enhancing the client experience, which we have no doubt will drive future revenue growth. We have a high tech and a high touch approach to servicing our clients, investing in the digital experience and adopting a common discipline and approach that further improves how we interact with our clients. Our second priority is executing on our business improvement process to create efficiency and quality benefits for our clients and reduce technology and operations and structural costs for ourselves.","Now during the quarter, we continue to increase our use of robotic and cognitive technologies to drive efficiencies and productivity. We have increased the number of bots in production from about 150 bots at year-end to over 220 at the end of the first quarter. And this speaks to the success of our early efforts on this front. Those bots are automating certain task which is improving accuracy and decreasing processing time by as much as 50% to 80% depending upon the function. And we further downsized our real estate portfolio during the quarter exiting three locations for a reduction of 83,000 rentable square feet. Now in a year-over-year basis, we have exited 10 locations and 776,000 rentable square feet. And you can see the impact of these actions in our lower net occupancy costs.","Now we also continue to align client pricing when increasing regulatory and service costs. For example, we imposed new fees to compensate for cost related to the investor tax reporting that we provide to European offshore funding counting clients. When we formalized our business improvement process a few years ago, many wanted to know how long it could continue to generate savings. We still have a solid pipeline of opportunities to expand automation, further rationalize our real estate footprint and reduce vendor cost, which will help us to further reduce costs and improve our operating margin.","Now our third priority centers on being a strong, safe, trusted counterparty. During the quarter, we upgraded and streamlined risk reporting and making the enterprise much more resilient. And we continue to expand the global footprint of our risk and compliance organization to gain access to top qualitative and quantitative talent capabilities outside of the U.S.","Our fourth priority involves generating excess capital and deploying it effectively. We remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet, including strong capital and liquidity positions while returning significant value to our shareholders. From a regulatory ratio standpoint, our fully phased-in SLR is now at 5.9%, which is a healthy buffer to the regulatory minimum, especially considering our low credit risk business model. During the quarter, we returned nearly $1.1 billion in value to our shareholders, repurchasing 879 million in shares and distributing $201 million in dividends.","Our fifth priority is attracting, developing and retaining top talent. To win the competition for talent, we are investing in our people and our culture, creating workplaces that support a diverse flexible and adaptive workforce and holding everyone accountable for results. Our Workforce Excellence Program, which we are expanding in 2017 is transforming our workplaces into efficient and collaborative spaces that leverage the full capabilities of our technology. The program is strengthening the company's resiliency, making us more agile and reducing our operating costs. And we recently released our second Annual People Report, which illustrates how our people lead, innovate and collaborate to positively impact our company and our clients. It's posted on our website and I encourage you to go check it out.","So in summary, we are continuing to execute on our strategic priorities, transform our company and increase the value we deliver for our clients and our shareholders. Our performance is only beginning to reflect the progress that we have made in digitizing our business and harnessing emerging technologies, which should result in an increasingly distinctive client experience and new sources of value for our clients. We see ourselves as being a great platform company that integrates the best of what we do and what others have to offer for the benefit of our clients and the marketplace.","While it is still early, we are confident in our future as we continue to invest, innovate and transform into a more digital data-driven global financial services powerhouse. It's exciting to envision the potential opportunities for our clients and our shareholders.","So with that, let me turn it over to Todd.","Thomas Gibbons","Thanks, Gerald, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, we performed well as our strategy is strengthening our franchise, benefiting our clients and improving our financial performance. When you look at the results for the year-over-year quarter, I think a few things stand out.","First, we experienced solid revenue growth in Investment Services fees and Investment Management and performance fees, both were up 4%. Second, while our net interest revenue and our net interest margin benefited from the rate increases, both results were a little lighter than we anticipated due to the slightly smaller balance sheet. Now the dynamics of that I'll discuss later in a little more detail. I will also provide with you some additional color on how additional rate increases are expected to benefit both NIR and the NIM. And finally, we generated positive operating leverage and increased our operating margins from both higher revenue and continued expense control despite the significant pressures that we felt on regulatory costs.","Turning to our financial highlights document, I'll continue my commentary starting on Slide 4 and that gives you an overview of our operating results for the quarter. Our first quarter EPS was $0.83, that's 12% higher than the year-ago quarter on an adjusted basis. Year-over-year looking at our performance on an adjusted basis, first quarter revenue was up 2%, expenses were up 1%, and we generated approximately 130 basis points of operating leverage. As we've noted in prior quarters, the strength of the dollar continues to impact our results, it's negative for revenues and positive for expenses. However, the net impact from currency translation was once again minimal to our consolidated pretax income.","Income before income taxes was up 6%. Our adjusted pretax operating margin was up two percentage points to 33%. And return on tangible common equity on an adjusted basis was 22% for the quarter compared to about 21% in the year-ago quarter.","Now moving ahead to Slide 8, I will discuss our consolidated fee and other revenue. Total Investment Services fees were up 4%. Asset servicing fees were up 2% year-over-year and they were flat sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects net new business and that includes the growth of our collateral optimization solutions, as well as higher equity values and it's partially offset by the impact of the U.S. dollar as well as the negative impact of downsizing of the U.K. retail transfer agency business. Year-over-year, the impact of these latter two items was approximately minus 2% to our revenue growth rate.","Clearing services fees increased 7% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, primarily driven by higher money market and mutual fund fees. Issuer [ph] service fees were up 3% year-over-year reflecting higher depository receipt fees and that was partially offset by lower fees in Corporate Trust. Treasury services fees increased to 6% year-over-year reflecting higher payment volumes, partially offset by higher compensating balance credits provided to clients; and that reduced fee revenue, although it did increase net interest revenue a bit.","First quarter Investment Management and performance fees increased 4% year-over-year; that's primarily acting higher market values and is partially offset by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar principally against the British pound, as well as the impact of last year's asset outflows. On a constant-currency basis, Investment Management and performance fees actually increased 8%. We've been focused on delivering profitable revenue growth within Investment Management through our business improvement process which reduces expenses and drives future growth. In line with our objectives, adjusted net operating margins improved to 34% for the quarter driven by higher revenues and expense improvement actions taken over the course over the last year.","Turning to foreign exchange and other revenue; FX and other trading revenue on a consolidated basis was 6% lower year-over-year and it was up 2% sequentially. FX revenue of $154 million was 10% lower year-over-year and 12% lower sequentially. The year-over-year and sequential declines were primarily driven by lower market volatility. The migration to lower-margin products also impacted the year-over-year comparison but not so much the sequential comparison. Investment and other income of $77 million compared with $105 million in the year ago quarter and $70 million in the fourth quarter. Both comparisons primarily reflect the net gain related to an equity investment and decreases in other income from our increased investments and renewable energy. The year-over-year decrease also reflects lower lease-related gains. The sequential increase was partially offset by lower income from corporate bank-owned life insurance.","Now Slide 9 shows the drivers of our Investment Management business that help explain our underlying performance. Assets under management of $1.73 trillion was up 5% year-over-year reflecting higher market values offset by the impact of the dollar, primarily versus the British pound. With regards to flows, with net inflows of $27 billion, we had the best quarter in years. While active equity strategies continue to experience outflows, the revenue impact was more than offset by inflows of $18 billion into other active strategies. This includes $14 billion into liability-driven investments and $2 billion into multi-asset and alternative investments as we maintain our focus on improving the revenue mix toward long-term high-value active solutions.","With regard to short-term flows, as Gerald noted, we added $13 billion in cash and we did that by focusing both on the performance as well as increasing distribution through our liquidity portals. This was in contrast to the cash industry which experienced overall outflows.","Now turning to our investment services metrics on Slide 10; assets under custody and administration at quarter end were a record $30.6 trillion, that's up 5% year-over-year and reflects higher market values offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger dollar. Linked-quarter, AUC\/A was up 2%, mainly driven by improved market values and a slightly weaker dollar. We estimate total new assets under custody and our administration business wins were $109 billion in the first quarter. Looking at the other key Investment Services metrics, you'll see average deposits declined 8% year-over-year and 7% sequentially reflecting both the impact of the rate increase as well as our efforts to proactively manage our balance sheet to meet the liquidity and capital requirements. Lastly, tri-party repo balances grew a healthy 13%.","Turning to net interest revenue on Slide 11; you'll see that on a fully tax-equivalent basis, NIR was up 3% to $804 million versus the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year increase in NIR primarily reflects higher rates and the impact of interest rate hedging activities and those actually negatively impacted the first quarter of '17 less than the first quarter of '16. And that was partially offset by lower average earning assets as well as higher average long-term debt. The sequential decrease primarily reflects the impact of interest rate hedging activities in the fourth quarter of 2016 premium amortization adjustment, which combined reduced net interest revenue by approximately $43 million sequentially, and that's about 6 basis points impact to the net interest margin. Substantially, all of the interest-rate hedging activities and for fourth quarter were offset in foreign exchange and other trading revenue.","Now NIR benefited from higher rates, which was partially offset by a reduced balance sheet and we've discussed that previously how we intended to do that. As well as some adjustment to the asset and liability mix to build a cushion for the fully phased-in liquidity coverage ratio that went into effect in the first quarter. As we look forward to the second quarter and the full year, using the forward yield curve to estimate, we would expect to see NIR rise 2.4% in the second quarter - excuse me, 2% to 4% in the second quarter and 4% to 6% for the full year as the balance sheet stays flat or contract slightly.","Turning to Slide 12, you'll see that our adjusted non-interest expense on a year-over-year and sequential basis increased 1%. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher consulting and staff expenses, partially offset by lower other expense. The increase in consulting expense primarily reflects higher regulatory and compliance cost related to resolution planning and CCAR. After we submit the resolution plan on July 1, the quarterly run rate for these expenses should come down by approximately $10 million. The increase in staff expense primarily reflects higher incentive expense that was partially offset by the favorable impact of a stronger dollar.","As you will see, we added a separate line item for our bank assessment charges to provide additional transparencies [indiscernible] and are expected to remain a significant cost item. The sequential increase in non-interest expense primarily reflects higher staff expense and that was offset by lower business development, net occupancy, software and equipment, as well as professional, legal and other purchase services. The increase in staff expense reflects divesting of long-term stock awards for retirement-eligible employees, partially offset by lower severance expense in the first quarter.","Consistent with prior quarters, the first quarter reflects the benefit of improved efficiencies as well as savings from our location strategy which is designed to optimize our footprint, as well as from our vendor renegotiations that continue to reduce our cost. Savings from efforts like these are enabling us to fund important growth initiatives, including NEXEN, as well as to absorb increased cost related to the regulatory requirements.","Turning to capital on Slide 13; all of our fully phased-in ratios increased during the quarter. Our fully phased-in supplemental leverage ratio increased to 5.9% as we both generated capital and reduced average assets. One of the benefits of our decreased balance sheet as we now have a reasonably - reasonable buffer above the SLR minimum that will provide additional flexibility in managing our capital going forward. We also remain in full compliance with the liquidity coverage ratio. A few additional notes about the quarter; our effective tax rate of 22.3% was reduced by approximately 3% or $0.03 per common share from the application of the new accounting guidance related to the annual vesting of stock awards. This results in a benefit this quarter due to our stock appreciation above the awards original grant price.","Now Page 9 of our press release, we show investment security portfolio highlights. At quarter end, our net unrealized pretax loss from the portfolio was $23 million, and that compares with $221 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016. And that improvement was primarily driven by a reduction in market interest rates.","Now let me share a few thoughts on our outlook on topics that have been top of mind with investors since the change in the new administration. We believe that many of the post crisis regulations have made us and the banking industry stronger, although some modest adjustments could be helpful to our business model it is really too early to predict outcomes. So at this point, we're maintaining our current regulatory compliance initiatives and the significant corresponding spend associated with them. However, during federal reserve governors departing speech, he suggested adjusting the enhanced SLR requirement for risk and that should provide some relief for the custody banks.","Now let me provide you with some color on how we're thinking about the next quarter and the full year to assist you with our modeling. As we look forward in the event of future rate increases, we expect flat to modest contraction of our balance sheet which we also expect to be more than offset by a higher net interest margin. We expect net interest revenue to increase approximately 2% to 4% sequentially and approximately 4% to 6% for the full year. We also expect our net interest margin to expand to 100 - somewhere between 120 and 130 basis points by the end of the year, which should continue to expand in coming years as we reinvest maturing securities on our portfolio.","Regarding fee waivers, we have recovered nearly all of the pretax income related to the interest rate sensitive fee waivers. We also expect our regulatory and compliance cost to continue to be elevated in the second quarter reflecting the increased expenses associated primarily with the resolution of recovery plan but with CCAR as well. As mentioned earlier, we expect these expenses to decrease over the second half of the year by approximately $10 million per quarter. Despite the increased regulatory cost, we expect our total expenses to remain close to flat to last year's level in the second quarter. For the full year, we expect our total adjusted expenses to be up no more than 1%.","Regarding taxes, we expect our 2017 effective tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 26% as we have previously guided. And finally, we expect to generate positive operating leverage once again in 2017.","With that, let me hand it over to Gerald.","Gerald Hassell","Before we open the line for our questions, let me offer a couple of more thoughts. As a reminder, this is our ninth consecutive quarter of solid performance against our EPS goals.","I also want to remind you that we have a well-diversified, lower risk business model that is largely fee-based with recurring fees representing nearly 80% of our revenues. Now that positions us to consistently deliver solid quarterly results and higher risk-adjusted returns versus other financial institutions. And we're executing our strategic priorities to deliver even greater value for our clients and our shareholders.","With that, operator, we can now open it up for some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth Usdin","Thanks a lot guys, good morning. Todd, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the balance sheet and specifically your point about reinvesting cash flows off the securities book in terms of where the curve has moved to? And then just separately, how do we just think about given that you're not a traditional bank, how do we think about the deposit data and how you expect your balance sheet to act differently, if at all, from more of traditional to regional?","Thomas Gibbons","Sure, Ken. Good morning. I think as we've guided in the past, we do see some sensitivities to interest rates to the balance sheet. In fact, it moved pretty much - the deposit base has moved pretty much along the lines that we had anticipated. So we saw in the quarter, on average, deposits down about $15 billion. That has - since actually gone up a little bit, but it feels like it should be fairly steady there. The betas themselves are pretty low; so if you - as you see from our disclosures in the quarter, our interest rate paid on deposits moved from a negative 1 to 3 basis points positive. So about 4 basis points with the 25 basis point move. Remember not all of this is dollar denominated but 75% of it is. So far that move, you could kind of look at the beta somewhere between the 20% and 25% range. We would expect those betas to creep up as interest rates continue to go up. So what we would expect to see is a little bit of contraction in the balance sheet and a little bit of expansion in the net interest margin, and that's why we think we can continue to see the growth that we're talking about in NIR. So not a whole lot further contraction in the balance sheet is what we currently expect.","Kenneth Usdin","All right. And as my follow-up, I'll just ask the first part, just keep it that. Just again your reinvestments - you know, in terms of the long end has come in quite sharply. Are you able to find new securities to replace that roll-off still at higher levels? Just - can you talk through on front book, back book and just kind of reinvestment yields?","Thomas Gibbons","Yes, that is obviously a little bit disappointing that the yield curve has remained so flat. It was not when you do modeling, you typically do it assuming a parallel curve. Although when we're doing our forecasting, we are forecasting and off of a forward rate curve. So the assumptions that we're making here is that the market will follow the forward rate curve and obviously, the forward rate curve for longer term rates has come down with the rally in the markets over the past months or so. So the answer to the question is we would expect off of that forward rate curve to see; first of all, a substantial amount of those securities portfolio are floating, so clearly they are going to reset with the LIBOR resets and the remainder is repricing a substantial amount as repricing each year. And we would - given those two factors, we would expect to grind the yield up in that securities portfolio overtime in the rate environment.","Kenneth Usdin","Got it, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein","Thanks guys. Just the first question in the - around the servicing business. It definitely feels like the competitive dynamics have gotten a little tougher. JP Morgan announced that you've gone a little bit more aggressive in that business in the last couple of quarters. So maybe you could talk about your relative position in the space there today. I guess, how do you defend your position and perhaps the areas where you feel most - the biggest opportunity for yourself to grow, both from a revenue perspective but also from a profitability perspective?","Brian Shea","So, this is Brian Shea, I'm happy to take that. We feel pretty good about the outlook for the investment services businesses. You're seeing the investment services fee revenue growth up 4%, which is actually improved over what has been a year-over-year more recently. And we think the asset servicing business which is going to benefit from secular trends which are putting pressure on asset managers to transform their operating models and to outsource more of their solutions. So that's why we see growth opportunities in the middle office space, we see growth opportunities from technology solutions; Eagle, that Gerald mentioned is a great example of that. And we see growth in the alternative space, the announcement of the PJM real estate outsourcing opportunity is a great example because most of the market is still in-sources their real estate to fund administration and this is a big growth opportunity for us. So we see - and we see growth opportunities in the EPS administration space and we're investing in all those areas; so we feel good about the long-term prospects in the asset servicing business.","The Clearing business is also performing pretty well and we're benefiting from the fact that self-clearing firms are reconsidering whether they want to clear for themselves and pershing has a solid pipeline. As a result of that we're getting good growth in the RA custody business which is benefiting from the Department of Labor Fiduciary Standard. We're getting some mutual fund consolidation drive into the platform again driven by the DOL change where people are moving mutual funds to platform so they can put them under an advisory framework. And so we - and we still see some - and we're getting real leverage between pershing and the private bank. We have record levels now of both - credit facilities established between the wealth management bank and pershing clients and record levels of outstanding credit now over $3 billion in loans provided to those introducing broker-dealers and RIAs.","The issue of service business is solid, we have solid share in the markets we're in. Obviously, we benefit from a higher - their issuance environment, Corporate Trust is in the first quarter, the year-over-year comparison is the issuance of global debt is down, something like 15%. But our share of the market is pretty steady, and we're positioned to grow as the issuance market picks up and we're getting good traction in the corporate and insurance space in particular. And of course, we're a leader in the broker-dealer clearing space, U.S. government securities and tri-party repo market; and we've invested heavily in resiliency resolvability, scalability of that business so that we can serve the market well and responsibly, and we expect that business - that will start to grow in the second half of this year and throughout the course of '18.","So overall, there are competitive pressures but honestly, we're really focused on what the clients need in this market and what the clients solutions we can use to differentiate ourselves, so we feel pretty good about the prospects.","Alexander Blostein","Thanks. And I guess a follow-up along similar lines which is on collateral management specifically. Gerald, you highlighted that in the release and your prepared remarks that that's been a pretty exciting area of growth for you guys. Is it possible at all to kind of break out what the revenue contribution is overall for the firm now from a collateral management and maybe just give us a sense on what the growth in that area has been?","Gerald Hassell","Well, we break out a lot of detail already, Alex. Breaking out a particular individual line item is just too complicated. Considering it's both for the buy-side as well as the sell-side, it goes across asset servicing and our markets business, and so to segregate it and to call it out individually would be pretty tough. That being said, it is an increasingly and in demand set of solutions. And so it was initially around collateral management, and then it became segregation issues around the new regulatory environments down the world. Now we're shifting into collateral optimization and building the engines for that on a global basis. So we still feel very positive about its growth trajectory on a global basis for both the buy-side and the sell side.","Alexander Blostein","Got it. All right, taking a try. All right, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.","Glenn Schorr","Hello. A question on the whole SLR and Central Bank deposits, including the leverage ratio. Not asking you to speculate of what will happen; I think it should happen, it's happened in the U.K. My question is, if it were to happen, what would you do to the money [ph]? It's a decent size chunk of your balance sheet. How does that get reallocated? What kind of benefit could that be, if it happen?","Thomas Gibbons","Glen, it's Todd. I'll take this. I think there are actually two; if any release comes on the SLR, I think there's two approaches to it. One is that they would change the denominator a bit just as you described, maybe they would exclude from that riskless securities such as treasuries or Central Bank deposits. The alternative is to adjust the enhanced SLR to the additional 200 basis points; similarly, the way they do to the G-SIB [ph] buffers that are required on the risk-weighted ratios. And that is what Governor Trilo [ph] recommended specifically in his departing speech. And we would assume that perhaps given where we are on a G-SIB [ph] buffer, relative to others, that might be about half. So that just kind of paints the picture for possible future rule changes.","All that being said, we still have - I don't think you would see a dramatic change necessarily in how we have to manage capital because the CCAR would still be constrained by the leverage ratio, the traditional leverage ratio itself. So we would need to take that into consideration. It would make it easier for us to meet our spot ratios, we're one of the few institutions that tends to more constrained by spot but that's really no longer the case with where our capital is today. So now we're in a pretty good position. It would probably put us in a position to take on certain types of low-risk activities that we wouldn't have otherwise taken. I mean, it would increase the deposits activities, there are certain lending types of activities that might be a little more attractive to us than they would have been.","So I think number one, it is a possibility that we could expand into certain activities and manage our capital a little bit tighter. The other potential outcome is if there is a reduction, for example, around treasures and Central Bank deposits; we would expect that to promote more activity in the repo markets in other markets that we serve, so that - that could potentially be a positive to the fee generation of the company.","Gerald Hassell","Glenn, if I could just add - you know, on the supplemental leverage or enhanced supplemental leverage, it's actually very nice to see Governor Trilo [ph] in his final speech specifically call it out related to the custody banks. If we see some movement, I'm a little bit optimistic, we will. It will allow us to have a more flexibility with their balance sheet. As you know, over the course of the last year, we pushed deposits out which is counter-intuitive to what a bank is supposed to do. And so I think by some relaxation of that that will give us more flexibility on the balance sheet and whether it's repos or repo financing or accepting customer deposits and putting those deposits to work which can create more income and it could just give us more flexibility in the future.","Glenn Schorr","I think I appreciate all those comments. But quickly follow-up on that regulatory theme is, you were kind of clear in terms of what we should expect, cost-wise. I just want to revisit, how come regulatory costs are higher right now, there is this overall feeling like they've plateaued and trending better in general, what specifically is taking up some of the dollars being used right now?","Thomas Gibbons","So for us, Glenn, it's really the resolution plan. So we - as you know, we've got feedback on the resolution plan. Last year we responded to the deficiencies in October, we got positive feedback on the deficiencies but there were other options that we needed to deliver by July 1. We have a significant number of people, I mean, a very significant number of people focused on delivering this resolution plan; that comes with quite a few investments. We had said in the past that the investments associated with that probably had between the capital and other spend of over $140 million. We are in the highest burn rate point right now, up to the delivery of it on July 1. And then we would expect to see a little bit of relief thereafter. Of course, we'll then be waiting for feedback, and I'm sure we'll continue to evolve and improve the plan over the next few years. But I think we've made great progress and it has come in at a significant cost.","Glenn Schorr","Got it. Thank you for your answers. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next line comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Great, thanks very much. Maybe just Todd, if we could just go back to the net interest revenue, and if you could talk a little bit about the hedging activities in the first quarter and sort of the thought for coming into the next quarter. I think there was less of an offset in fees this quarter, if you could talk about that dynamic moving into the second quarter and whether you think that will push us through the year [ph]?","Thomas Gibbons","Sure, Brian. So there are basically two types of hedging that goes on. So if you look at our long-term debt, most of that debt, we have to swapped to floating. And if the hedge on that from time to time based on interest rate movement but there will be a component of that that is deemed to be ineffective. That ineffectiveness is run through net interest income. Overtime, it will work itself out to zero but they are long-term hedges. So one quarter, it might be up a little bit; one quarter, it might be down. It was unusually positive in the fourth quarter of 2016. So when you look on our schedule on the earnings release on Page 7 and you look at the yield on long-term debt, that's where the noise is coming from. That long-term debt is basically just floating. But you might have noticed in the quarter that we saw - in the fourth quarter we saw a 136 yield down substantially from the third quarter. That was because of gains on that - from the ineffectiveness otherwise, it would have been about 163.","Moving to the first quarter, you saw it pop up to 185, well, if you adjusted for the - if you take into consideration the impact, it would have been down about 6 basis points from that. So it's moving up as you would expect it to move up on average with the movement in LIBOR since that has been primarily swapped. So I think it's not a whole lot more complicated than that. There is one other element and so that doesn't impact other trading at all. We also hedge the spread between the overnight rate and LIBOR, and that does not get hedge accounting treatment on those swaps. So a gain or loss on those runs through directly through trading and that creates some noise as well. And again, that's just averages itself out; sometimes it's a positive, sometimes it's a negative.","So the impact to this quarter has effectively overstated the fourth quarter NIM and overstated the fourth quarter's earnings by about $40 million and understated a little bit by this quarter, and that was ultimately had about a 6 basis point sequential negative impact to the NIM. So when we look out forward, we just assume that's going to average itself out, it's very difficult for us to predict, and that's why we do call it out.","Brian Bedell","And so that averaging out is included in your 4% to 6% guidance for the...","Thomas Gibbons","Yes, yes, it is. I'm not suggesting we've got a recovery from anything that we've done now. Just going forward, we assume it's zero.","Brian Bedell","Okay. So locked in for 1Q and then zero for the next three quarters?","Thomas Gibbons","Right.","Brian Bedell","And then how many Fed hikes are you - additional Fed hikes after the March quarter you were including in the fourth\u2026","Thomas Gibbons","Yes, it looks - it depends on the day that you do the calculation but as we prepared for this we had two additional Fed hikes in that forward curve.","Brian Bedell","Okay. And then just my follow-up would just be on the - I'll try maybe to talk a little bit more about the clearing business; it's been actually very strong considering the client run-off, maybe if you can just talk about the tempo this year and that if there is any more attrition from the clients that have departed. And then you mentioned a lot of elements of cross-selling within your own franchise and the benefits from the fiduciary rule coming through, is that going to create stronger tailwinds coming into the second half of this year so that rules here gets implemented?","Brian Shea","Yes, good question, Brian. It's Brian Shea. I would say, this clearing business has been remarkably resilient and despite the fact that we've had some large client losses over the last year or two, mostly driven by global wealth firms exiting the U.S. marketplace which we're big Pershing clients. Despite that, the core underlying business has been performing pretty well and the metrics are starting to improve. We're seeing a pretty solid pipeline of large firms, including self-clearing firms, reconsidering whether or not they're going to outsource their clearing. Those tend to be choppy but we're encouraged by the trend and we think we have the right platform to help to be the solution to that. We're also - have invested in an integrated bank and brokerage custody platform that's very appealing to wealth management firms and to registered investment advisory custody firms. And our registered - our RIA custody business is experiencing double-digit growth and one of the things that's differentiating us is this private banking partnership with the wealth management group. So just to give you an idea, we're up to about $4.8 billion in credit facilities established and over $3 billion in loans outstanding; and that's the private Bank of BNY Mellon making loans available to the high net worth investors of our RIA custody clients and introducing broker-dealers clearing clients, so that's good.","From a DOL perspective, it's driving more traditional brokers to the advisory model which is part of the resiliency of that advisory growth and - but we're also seeing now a trend toward mutual fund consolidation, meaning that assets are moving to brokerage platforms or to the Pershing platform as advisors want to actually include mutual funds into an asset allocation or advisory receipt relationship; so that's a positive trend for Pershing. So overall, we have a pretty good outlook and the revenue diversification of Pershing is pretty strong, so it's been resilient.","Brian Bedell","Great, thanks for that color. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Good morning. I had a couple of follow-up questions; one on the SLR discussion that you had earlier, Todd. Just wondering, would you consider any changes to your press strategies in the event that there was an SLR change?","Thomas Gibbons","Potentially. I mean, we've - as you know, we've issued quite a bit of preferred over the past couple of years and we've kind of changed our capital stack. So I think we're pretty comfortable with that capital. In fact, we probably have a little more space that we could go if we wanted to. So if the SLR demand - and it's largely to drive the Tier 1 capital which is the numerator for the SLR. So if SLR changes took place, we would have to rethink that; so I think the answer to that is yes, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","And is there any flexibility there? I'm just wondering if there's kind of a non-call provision that you're dealing with for a number of years or not?","Thomas Gibbons","Yes, no, we're - there are some non-calls on those but we're quite comfortable with the capital and the cost of the capital. I mean, some of those seems to be below 5%; so it's certainly less costly than Tier 1. So my expectation is that we would keep it in place. It's just a question of how much future issuance that we would do.","Betsy Graseck","Got it. Okay. And on the regulatory expenses, you - I think you indicated that currently you're running at high watermark $140 million. I assume that's an annual number or is that a quarterly number?","Thomas Gibbons","Yes, the $140 million guidance is something that we provided a while ago which is what we thought is the number of projects that we're going to require to invest and would ultimately cost us between capital and expense. The capital will obviously ultimately become an expense. We've not given additional information against that, but as we responded to last year's letter, we have increased the run rate spend, just the monthly run rate spend, on a number of different components of the resolution plan requirements. That is what we expect to see to wind down a little bit in the second half of this year.","Betsy Graseck","In the second half, it's $10 million in 3Q and $10 million in 4Q for a total of $20 million decline. Is that\u2026","Thomas Gibbons","Yes, that's the guidance.","Betsy Graseck","Right, I just want to make sure it was $20 million in total, not just $10 million. Okay. And then just last question, NEXEN take up, maybe if you could just talk a little bit about what you're seeing there and also what incremental your clients are asking for that you're focusing on delivering, incremental functionality perhaps that you might be working on?","Gerald Hassell","Why don't I give you a couple of headline numbers, and then Brian you may want to give some color commentary on the natural initiatives with individual clients. But today, we have about 60,000 users on our NEXEN Gateway. 11 different businesses within the company are consuming it or putting applications up on it. We have about 17 different clients who are accessing our API store, we have about 140-or-so APIs in our store. There is about another 100 APIs that are queued up to go into the store. And so we're seeing a pretty significant take-up. And then the data that's coming out of our digital pulse has been captured and consumed mostly internally to improve our operations and find pockets of ways to automate and reduce our own structural cost. So generally, the take-up has been quite positive and the businesses are using it, and we're seeing real applications up and running on it.","Brian Shea","Yes, I agree with that. And I would just say, in addition, let's see we're starting to build out the app store and actually, the first third-party vendor will be live in the App Store in the second quarter. We have a pipeline of five or six that have committed that we'll be putting on over the next couple of quarters. And then you know, there is an even more robust pipeline of firms in discussion with us as we sort of execute this vision of delivering the digital investment platform that our clients need to reduce their vendor management integration, discontinuity cost and help - and we're going to enable that through NEXEN. So again, every two weeks, we add more functionality, more capabilities and we're getting more traction with the clients and of course, as a result, the clients are starting to see more value, incrementally every two weeks.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And anything in particular people are asking you to do that you're putting on the to-do list or...","Thomas Gibbons","I wouldn't say anything specific that would be - or shattering. Just continuing to deliver all the capabilities of the company through a single gateway and also enabling them through APIs to integrate with us the way they want to work. Those are the two big drivers. And frankly, longer term as we execute this more fully, we're going to be easier to do business with and to Gerald's earlier point about improving the client experience, it's going to improve the client technology experience significantly, and it's going to make it easier for them to do more business across the company. So not only - so we see this really creating long-term value for the company.","Gerald Hassell","Yes, Betsy, the live situations with a number of clients tend to be around data aggregation and them being able to pull data out of the system in a much more easily consumed way versus us pushing mounts of reports that take days to produce. And we've been able to shorten that reporting cycle down to minutes and in some cases for different fund companies and hedge funds. So that's the initial set of applications.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott","Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. On backs of the SLR and the potential changes there. How much flexibility do you think you've got on the level of capital you run with, so that the numerator - part of the question, just given that that CET-1 is 10%; I think you talk about running with a minimum of 100 basis points buffer over the regulatory minimums of kind of 9.5%. I mean does that kind of limit the amount of flexibility you've got if we're just focusing on the numerator side, so the option is more around the denominator and how you can run the balance sheet differently?","Thomas Gibbons","Sure, Geoffrey. It's Todd, I'll take this. So first of all, our minimum for the common equity Tier 1 is 8.5%, so we're at 150 basis points over that on a full - for the fully phased-in. So we feel like that feels like a pretty decent buffer, certainly it's adequate we would think for most of stress test at least as we've seen them in the past. I think the - in terms of the SLR, I think that had been the binding constraint in the past but now that it's up at 5.90% or close to 6%, and at 6.60% in the institutional bank where it needs to be at 6%, it too feels like it has a pretty good buffer to withstand two things that could potentially move that. You're not going to see a lot of noise, we wouldn't expect in the risk-weighted assets, so for the common equity Tier 1 ratio but what you could see under the SLR is an expansion of the balance sheet if there were big deposit flows. So we think that gives us an adequate buffer and for that, certainly in this new interest rate environment.","And secondly, there are fluctuations and other compressive income that really comes out of the securities portfolio. So we've structured the securities portfolio in such a way that if less rate sensitivity than it had been in the past, and we think it could accommodate some fairly substantial increases in long-term rates which we'd actually kind of like to see at this level of a buffer, so we feel it's pretty well-balanced right now.","Geoffrey Elliott","Thanks. And then on the CET-1 again, the advance ratio is a lot lower than the standardized ratio. Is there anything that you've heard recently that gives you confidence that the advance ratio could be relaxed a bit, may be operational risk ought to be calculation changing or something like that?","Thomas Gibbons","Yes, there is what's become known as Basel IV has been batted about quite a bit. At this point, I would say, it's too hard to determine or it's impossible to determine whether there is ultimately going to be adapted. Within that, one of the considerations would be to change the treatment for operational risk, which we would encourage, I think would make some sense. That would probably provide some relief to BNY Mellon. And I think there are some other considerations that may very well offset that around market and other types of less other types. So we don't - A) We don't know whether it's going to be adapted; B) It's not the test that used in the CCAR, it's the standardized test which almost has to be very difficult to run if off the advanced approach and get consistency.","So we don't know whether it will be adopted. We're not really sure ultimately what the impact would be to us. It's probably net positive on operational risk and slightly negative on the other items.","Geoffrey Elliott","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just a couple of follow-ups at this point. So helpful on the $10 million a quarter in consulting headwind here in the near-term. But taking a step back, and I think you guys up made some comments about it, previously, if we end up in a lesser burdensome compliance and regulatory environment, how should we think about how that might provide an additional lever for you to pull on the expense side? And then if we think about how may be Brexit might offset some of that, they need to invest, might offset some of that given how controlled you guys have been on the expense front for several years. Like when we put all that to mix over the next few years, assuming we have regulatory relief, how should we think about what could happen to operating expenses?","Gerald Hassell","Well, let me take a high level stab at it and then Todd, you can weigh in some. I think the way we contemplated, to the extent that we have some sort of change in tone on the regulatory side that we can actually direct some more of our resources and frankly, some of the higher intellectual capital that company is can be consumed by regulatory requirements, if we can redirect it to new products and solutions and that is our goal as opposed to taking it dollar-for-dollar reduction in whatever expenses we may have from regulatory relief. We'd like to invest more in some of the businesses and some of the solutions. We like to invest more in further automating the company which will drive better operating efficiencies for the long-term. And so we would like to see some of it continue to go to shareholders, but a lot of it reinvested in the company for future growth and for future improvements in our strategy and technology and automation.","Thomas Gibbons","And I would add just a couple of things here. If you think about the U.S. regime, there has been an awful lot of new rule-making that's gone on and actually the implementation cost to comply with that. And I probably said once or twice before that we think that the run rate has probably peaked and I was wrong. But if you think about things like CCAR, even the advanced approaches to calculating the risk-weighted assets, CCAR is continuously developed. The resolution plan, which comes with some new requirements for example, around liquidity and capital management, the liquidity coverage ratio and the - which is a demanding regulatory reporting exercise since we're providing significant amounts of daily information. So we're getting all of that implementation in place and there will certainly be, I'm sure, no matter what the change in the regime, ongoing requirements to improve that. But we'd like to think that we don't see a lot of new rule-making out there because I think we're getting all the way through really the Dodd-Frank requirements.","So in the U.S, there probably would be some relief regardless of what comes from - what the regime actually does. I think globally, one of the things that we broke out on our reports, expense report is bank assessment charges. And so the FDIC charges have gone up substantially as have what we see both on the European Resolution Fund, as well as just bank levies in certain parts of Europe. There is the potential for some relief on that but probably even that's a year away. And the other thing I might add, why we want to still be cautious here is that in Europe as we implement method and other additional regulations, the compliance cost there are quite high as well; so we're going to get - I think, some short-term relief; whether that actually rolls into long-term relief or not, it's too early to call.","Brennan Hawken","That's all really, really fair and very helpful, thanks. And certainly Todd, I think you've got some company in trying to call a top on the regulatory burden and worse. Can you - one follow-up on the SLR buffer, I think you guys said that you would expect it to have from 200 bps to 100. When I had looked at, I guess, maybe I compared it to the enhanced buffer that it come up with and I thought maybe it might even be a bit lower for you. What makes you think that it would only be halves for you rather than maybe even a potentially better outcome?","Gerald Hassell","That's highly speculative on my part. I'm just seeing it - if you were to correlate. You might be right, Brennan, if you were to correlate the 200 to the buffer - in the G-SIB [ph] buffer and you use the same regime to calculate it, something like half I think would be a reasonable estimate. But you're right, it could be a little bit more than that.","Brennan Hawken","Fair enough, great. Okay, thanks.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning, Gerald; good morning, Todd. A question Todd, and I know there has been a lot of talk about the balance sheet and I think you gave us guidance in your prepared remarks about basically a flattish balance sheet from here until the end of the year. If you guys look longer out from your customer's standpoint, and we get into a 3% Fed funds rate environment let's say going into 2019, are there still lazy deposits, if you will, sitting on your balance sheet that would move into higher-yielding alternatives? Or do you see with your current customer base that the deposits they have are truly what they're probably going to keep with you even in a higher rising interest rate environment?","Thomas Gibbons","Okay. So I'd like not to call them lazy because this is - a lot of this is related to activity that goes on, Corporate Trust activity, Asset Servicing activity, settlements, and so forth. And we do think the betas will increase, so there'll be - and in many instances, we actually have contractual rates that we apply to client deposits. So I think the way to look out at the future is there'll be - just as we saw the spike up in deposits with the Fed easing, I think we'll see that kind of market share gain, if you will, to total deposits come out which it practically has. And then we will start - the business will grow, the deposit size of the business will grow with activity as it has historically. That's our expectation.","Gerard Cassidy","Yes, no, that's good. And then I know this is a hypothetical and maybe will never come through. The industry, including you guys, have suffered from the LCR ratio being as high as it is. If there wasn't that requirement to have the LCR ratio as high as it is, what do you think a more reasonable LCR ratio should be for you guys, or are you comfortable with what it is now?","Thomas Gibbons","Well, and I'll be happy to comment on that one. And the LCR may very well get some conversation. But I think there's another thing that you should be aware off. In the resolution plan, there's something called the R-Lap which is the liquidity that you need in place in order to go in and manage a resolution plan. That's going to be - it's pretty highly correlated to the LCR, so it could be another - it's another constraint to that. I think that you should be aware off, and we're working through that as we deliver it to the regulators this summer. That being said, the LCR is a constraint. It does limit the types of things that you could do. There is no question that it has an impact on lending.","And if you took into consideration that there are probably substantial amount of liquid assets on the balance sheet that don't fall into the denominator, it's probably more constraining than it really need to be. I think conceptually, it's a very good tool. It's how - it's an approach to managing liquidity that makes a heck of a lot of sense. I think perhaps it could be tweaked a little bit; if it were, it would give more - it's another one of these things that will provide more flexibility, probably generate a little bit more NIR.","Gerard Cassidy","I appreciate it. Thank you so much.","Gerald Hassell","Thank you very much, everyone, for dialing in today and your interest in us. And I'm sure you'll have some follow-up questions with Valerie and the rest of our IR team. So thank you, everyone.","Operator","If there are any additional questions or comments, you may contact Ms. Valerie Haertel at 212-635-8529. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

And welcome to the First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call hosted by BNY Mellon. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded, and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent.","I will now turn the call over to Ms. Valerie Haertel. Ms. Haertel, you may begin.","Valerie Haertel","Thank you, Wendy. Good morning. And welcome everyone to the BNY Mellon first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With us today are Gerald Hassell, our Chairman and CEO; Todd Gibbons, our CFO; as well as our executive management team.","Our first quarter earnings materials include a financial highlights presentation that will be referred to in a discussion of our results and can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.","Before Gerald and Todd begin, let me take a moment to remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors.","These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release, the financial highlights presentation and those identified in the documents filed with the SEC that are available on our website bnymellon.com. Forward-looking statements on this call speak only as of today, April 22, 2015, and we will not update forward-looking statements.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Gerald Hassell. Gerald?","Gerald Hassell","Thanks, Valerie, and welcome everyone, and thanks for joining us this morning. As you can see, we are achieving the results consistent with the goals that we shared on Investor Day. For the first quarter, earnings per share were $0.67, which was up 18% year-over-year.","Now focusing on our year-over-year comparisons on an adjusted basis, total revenue was up 4%, total expenses were down 2%, so we generated more than 500 basis points of positive operating leverage. Now the stronger U.S. dollar reduced both our revenue and expenses, but had a limited effect on net income, and Todd will cover that more in a moment.","Our return on tangible common equity in the quarter was 20%. Now we also returned significant value to our shareholder in the form of dividends and share repurchases during the quarter.","Simply put, we are executing against our strategic priorities and it\u2019s showing up in our numbers. Let me remind you of what those priorities are and how we are doing against them.","Now our first priority is driving revenue growth. During the quarter, revenue in Investment Services benefited from continued growth in both clearing and Global Collateral Services. As we have been saying, we are investing in both of these areas to deliver enhanced capabilities to our clients.","Across Investment Services and in Asset Servicing in particular, we have been quite targeted about the business we are taking on, we are just going aftermarket shares. We are focusing on deepening our client relationships, delivering the highest value to our clients and growing profitably, and I think our results are showing just that.","And you also recall that late last year we created the Markets Group to bring together existing capabilities from a number of different areas. We have been repositioning the business by exiting various activities that no longer fit our strategy, while investing in foreign, securities lending, collateral management solutions for our clients. Now these initiatives are already improving our performance and reducing our costs.","Now for example, our enhanced electronic foreign exchange platforms are capturing more client driven volumes and when volatility increases as we saw in the first quarter, we clearly benefit.","But the Markets Group had stronger foreign exchange results, stronger collateral management and securities financing activity, while simultaneously existing derivatives divisions and reducing the capital and costs associated with it. Good overall results that helped improve the company\u2019s operating margin.","Turning to Investment Management, to further diversify our assets under management, we are building out our retail distribution capabilities, and investing and expanding our Wealth Management platform.","The inflows from these retail distribution initiatives are in fact improving, but not yet at the point of being able to offset the active institutional equity outflows that we and the entire industry have been experiencing.","Now after quarter end we reached an agreement to sell our Meriten boutique, which is our German based boutique. This is part of our business portfolio review process to identify opportunities to better redevelop our capital.","The sale will allow us to focus on those boutiques with global scale that most benefit from being part of BNY Mellon and where we see the greatest growth opportunities. And we expect the sale will close at the end of the second quarter and our Investment Management operating margin should improve with this divestiture.","On the Investment performance front, during the quarter we strengthen our capabilities and they were recognized through two rankings. In the first quarter as a testament with continued growth and success, the Dreyfus\/Standish Global Fixed Income Fund hit the number 1 ranking in the World Bond category for long-term investors and has been consistently a top performer. Our Wealth Management business was named the 2015 top National Private Asset Manager and top Private Bank Offering for Family Offices by the Family Wealth Report.","Now our second priority is executing on our business improvement processes, where we have been taking actions from top to bottom, transforming our company through our continues improvement process, it is reducing structural costs and risks, and improving client productivity and service quality.","Now let me share some examples. We are simplifying and automating our global processes. We are continuing to optimize and streamline our technology infrastructure, particularly in Asset Servicing, leveraging a common architecture to reduce our costs and increase agility, so we are delivering new solutions to our clients even faster. We mentioned last week that we are succeeding and reducing our annual infrastructure spending and that share on trend continued in the first quarter.","Now we are also shrinking our real estate portfolio in consolidating locations. Now we have been able to accelerate some of our efforts, which allowed us to come in better than expected in our net occupancy expense line.","Now also as part of our business improvement process, we are improving our return on technology investment. Today, we have best-of-breed applications in most of our important business activities, such as tri-party, clearing, payments, settlements and collateral management. Our technology is well-regarded by industry professionals and we are particularly proud for our most recent acknowledge.","Now one of which was the Anita Borg Institute recently named us as a top company for women technologists for achieving the highest overall score for all companies evaluated. Now this recognition helps us attract and retain top talent in the industry.","Our third priority centers on being a strong, safe, trusted counterparty. The results of the 2015 CCAR demonstrated that under severally adverse scenario, our projected minimum Tier 1 common ratio and our common equity Tier 1 ratio under stress were the most resilient among all the 14 advanced approached bank holding companies. So we are well-positioned for all stress scenarios and feel confident that we can continue to execute on our capital plans going forward.","Now we also fully recognize the importance of our organization to the financial marketplace and that our reputation is in assets that we must uphold everyday. To further protect and enhance our safety and soundness, we are investing and focusing on compliance risk management and control functions. We have recently resolved some very important issues on that front and the actions we have taken will significantly reduce the probability of future issues.","Our fourth priority involves generating excess capital and deploying our capital effectively. So during the quarter we repurchased 10.3 million shares for $400 million. And our capital plan calls for the repurchase of up to $3.1 billion of common stock over five-quarter period.","And finally, our fifth priority is to attract and retain top talent. We have been executing against an integrated talent management strategy across the entire company and have been focused on developing talent from within, as well as infusing expertise with key strategic hires in areas where we benefit from new prospectus and capabilities.","We recently promoted several individuals identified through our talent management process. The greater responsibility, including our newly formed BNY Mellon Technology Solutions Group, Global Fund Accounting, Middle Office Solutions and our European bank.","Additionally, we added key external talents, including our new Chief Auditor and a new Board member was our fourth new director in less than year. Fresh perspectives, ideas and the right team composition make us stronger.","So, in summary, we are executing against our priorities and firmly believer we are on track to achieve the earnings, expense and operating leverage goals we outlined for you on Investor Day.","So, with that, let me turn it over to Todd.","Todd Gibbons","Thanks, Gerald, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will follow the financial highlights document and start with page six that details our non-GAAP operating results for the quarter.","As Gerald noted, EPS was $0.67, that\u2019s up 18% versus the year ago. Revenue in the first quarter was up approximately 4% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, reflecting growth across all of our key businesses. We\u2019ve particularly strengthened asset servicing, clearing services and foreign exchange.","Expenses were down 2% year-over-year and 1% sequentially as the business improvement process is helping to increase efficiency and reduce our cost. Our ability to drive revenue growth and control expenses resulted in a little more than 500 basis points of positive operating leverage year-over-year.","Now, let me point out that we\u2019ve estimated that the stronger U.S. dollar reduced our revenue by approximately 200 basis points and reduced our expenses by approximately 300 basis points and had a slightly negative impact on total net income. Business most impacted was Investment Management while currency had lesser impact on our investment services businesses net results.","We\u2019ve added new foreign exchange metrics on page six of the new release that\u2019s kind of help you capture the impact of the two currencies. If you look at that, you will see that the pound was down approximately 9% year-over-year and euro was down 18%.","So I\u2019ll discuss briefly the estimated impact to each of our business unit as I cover the segment results. Income before taxes was up 16% year-over-year and 11% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, our pre-tax margin increased approximately 300 basis points to 30%, that\u2019s up from 27% in the first quarter of 2014. Return on tangible common equity was 20%.","Page seven shows the drivers of our Investment Management business that help explain our underlying performance. We had 7% year-over-year AUM growth and $17 billion of new net inflows during the quarter. You\u2019ll also note that we experienced net outflows in equities in the quarter while our LDI business continued its rapid growth.","Our Wealth Management business also is performing well benefiting from our investments and promoting our brand in the expansion of our sales for us. Average loans and deposits continue to trend up.","Turning to page eight, you can see our financial results for Investment Management. As I previously noted, Investment Management was most impacted by currency translation since we have a large number of our boutiques outside of U.S. and results in about 42% of our revenue actually being non-U.S.","First quarter Investment Management performance fees were $850 million. Investment Management fees were up 1% year-over-year or 7% on constant currency basis, reflecting the higher equity market values, the impact of the Cutwater acquisition and strategic initiatives. We had a performance fees of $15 million that compares to $20 million in the year ago quarter.","Other revenue was $47 million in the first quarter, up from $16 million in the first quarter of last year and $7 million in the fourth quarter. Both increases primarily reflect higher seed capital gains. The sequential increase also reflects reduced losses on hedging activities within one of the boutiques.","Net interest revenue increased 6% year-over-year and 7% sequentially reflecting the higher loan and deposit levels mostly at the private bank. Revenue growth on a year-over-year basis was up 4% in Investment Management but adjusted for the currency translation we estimated, it would have been up about 9%. Earnings were also negatively impacted. Income before taxes excluding amortization and tangible assets was up 6% year-over-year and 7% sequentially.","Turning to our Investment Services metrics on page nine, you can see that assets under custody and administration at quarter end were $28.5 trillion, that\u2019s up 2% year-over-year and that\u2019s really driven by higher market values, net new business and partially offset by the stronger U.S. dollar. Linked quarter AUC\/A was flat, adjusted for currency effects, year-over-year growth would have been roughly 5%.","The market value of securities on loan at period end showed strong growth on a year-over-year basis. Securities on loan were up 10%, they are now at $291 billion and that\u2019s due to the expansion of the receipt of securities\u2019 potential collateral as well as the impact of new clients joining our lending program and existing clients increasing their lending activity.","Our average loans and deposits were both up significantly here as well. The key broker-dealer metric of tri-party repo balances grew 9%, all of our clearing metrics recorded pretty good gains with DARTS volumes and average long-term mutual fund assets, each showing double-digit growth.","Moving onto Depository Receipt metric, we\u2019ve had a focus on exiting some low activity programs, the ones that are at the low end of our client base as well as programs that do not meet our profitability criteria. This continued with the routine closure of programs due to corporate actions has resulted in a net decline in the number of sponsored DR programs in the portfolio.","On page 10, you can see detailed segment reporting for Investment Services. The key variances are reflected in fee and other revenue on our consolidated results on page 11. So let\u2019s move to that page.","We will see that asset seed servicing fees were up 3% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects net new business largely driven by global collateral services and securities lending as well as the increase in market values.","The sequential increase primarily reflects higher client expense reimbursements and higher securities lending revenue and global collateral services fees, both increases were partially offset by the stronger dollar.","Clearing fees were up 6% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. The increase from the first quarter \u201814 was primarily driven by higher mutual fund and asset based fees and higher clearance revenue driven by higher DARTS volume. The sequential decrease primarily reflects fewer trading days in the first quarter.","Issuer service fees were up 1% year-over-year and 20% sequentially. Both increases reflect higher corporate actions in DRs. Additionally, Corporate Trust fees seem to stabilize.","Treasury services fees were up 1% year-over-year and down 6% sequentially. The sequential decrease primarily reflects seasonally lower payment volumes.","FX and other trading revenue on a consolidated basis was up 68% year-over-year, that\u2019s up 52% sequentially. For this line item, you can also refer to the table at the top of page eight in the news release. See the details I\u2019m discussing. FX revenue of $217 million was up 67% year-over-year, that\u2019s 32% sequentially, reflecting higher volumes and volatility as well as DR related activity.","Other trading revenue was $12 million. That compares with revenue of $6 million in the year ago quarter and the loss of $14 million in the fourth quarter. Both increases reflect higher fixed income trading revenues.","The sequential increase also reflects reduced losses from the hedging activity by one of our investment boutiques. Investment and other income were $63 million, with $39 million lower year-over-year and that was driven by lower leasing gains.","One final impact on the currency impact on our Investment Services business while less impact than we see at Investment Management. We estimate that both revenues and expenses would have been up roughly 2% on a constant currency basis, would have been up by an additional 2% on a constant currency basis. Pre-tax income was not meaningfully impacted.","Turning to net interest revenue on page 12 of the financial highlights, you will see that NIR on a fully tax equivalent basis was unchanged versus the year ago quarter and up 2% from the fourth quarter. Year-over-year the increase in deposits drove growth in our securities portfolio and offset the impact of lower yields.","The sequential improvement reflects the benefit of putting more cash to work as you can see in loans and securities which also increased our margin for the first time in years. The net interest margin for the quarter was 97 basis points, 8 lower than the year ago and 6 from the sequential quarter.","On page 13, you will see that non-interest expense decreased by 2% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower expenses in all categories except the sub-custodian expense which is volume related and other expense. And I should point out that other expense include the impact of the new European Union Single Resolution Fund as we\u2019re accruing our estimated annual contribution requirement.","The lower expenses primarily reflect the favorable impact of the stronger dollar and we\u2019re seeing the impact of our business improvement process here as well. Our total staff expense decreased 2% year-over-year. As you might have seen in our annual report, we elected to freeze the defined benefit plan and we replace it with a defined contribution plan.","In the first quarter, we recognized that\u2019s $30 million benefit related to the curtailment of the defined benefit plan. For the full year, we expect to have a positive benefit to the DD plan itself, resulting in a $10 million net credit that include the curtailment gain we just received.","In addition, we expect to have about $12 million of additional expense in the back half of the year for the participants that were formally in the defined benefit plan. As a result, you can see that you can expect benefits to increase about $30 million in the second quarter.","Our headcount was 900 lower year-over-year. There was a sequential increase of 200. That reflects the onboarding of employees related to the January Cutwater acquisition, the liftout of the Deutsche Bank private equity and real estate administration business and new hires to support several largest client onboarding initiatives.","The decrease in total staff expense was partially offset by higher incentives, reflecting better performance as well as a lower adjustment related to the finalization of the annual incentive awards and the impact of long-term stock award vesting for retirement eligible employees. Both of these last two items typically occur in the first quarter.","As a reminder, the first quarter usually has a spike related to long-term awards and we will expect incentives to decline in the second quarter by somewhere in the vicinity of $65 million based on performance.","On our last earnings call, I told you that occupancy costs should rise related to the sale of One Wall Street as we move into our new facility, which will result in double rent in 2015. This increase was not reflected in the first quarter because it was offset by the outsourcing of maintenance costs, a stronger dollar and the subletting of some vacant space. For the full year, we still expect occupancy costs to increase as we previously indicated, as we take further actions in our real estate portfolio.","Turning to capital on page 14. With respect to our capital ratios this quarter, the fully phased-in common equity Tier I ratio under the Advanced Approach declined from 9.8% to 9.1% and that was driven by an increase in risk-weighted assets primarily related to operational risk.","Now as we\u2019ve highlighted in previous periods, our operational rigorous model was impacted by external losses incurred by other financial institutions. This quarter, one notable external loss in the payments space go through our model and added approximately $11 billion of risk-weighted assets and therefore negatively impacted our ratio.","I might want to add -- I want to add here and let you know that in the second quarter, we expect to have a benefit to our risk-weighted assets, as we believe we will be deconsolidating many of our Investment Management funds, as we intend to be an early adopter of the reason we issued consolidated accounting standard. So we effectively expect to reverse the impact of what we saw in the first quarter.","Our estimated supplemental leverage ratio increased to 4.5%, as we generated capital and reduced the average balance sheet size slightly. Our estimated LCR is already over 100% and compliant with the fully phased-in requirements, which is 80% and will step up to over 100% over the next couple of years.","Now, a few final notes about the quarter. As you will see in our release, our effective tax rate was 24.5% but that includes 2% benefit related to income versus variable interest entities, which if you included in line -- excuse me, if you included that in our numbers, our tax rate would be in line with the guidance of about 26%. So, I think that\u2019s the appropriate way to look at it.","I will also point out that we\u2019ve increased our tax-advantaged investments, including energy credits, which are now having the effect of reducing our tax rate but also reducing our pre-tax income and therefore our operating margin. So if we were to gross up the revenue from the tax credits and report the impact on the tax equivalent basis, our pre-tax income would have been higher by about $64 million and our operating margin would have increased by approximately 120 basis points.","We have elected to disclose this impact on footnote on page 25 of our news release rather than included in our financials. But we think it\u2019s important as we make these investments and you see a reduction in some of the pre-tax.","Also in the earnings release on page 11 on some investment securities portfolio highlights. You will see that the net unrealized gain in our portfolio was $1.7 billion at quarter end, that\u2019s up from $1.3 billion at the end of December.","During the quarter, we transferred $11.6 billion of available-for-sale securities to held-to-maturity securities and we also purchased additional held-to-maturity securities during the quarter. Our strategy is designed to reduce the volatility of our capital account from interest rate fluctuations.","Now, I\u2019d like to discuss a few points to factor into your thinking about the second quarter and the years we look ahead. Net interest revenue was expected to be slightly higher in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter of \u201915, as we benefit from the change in the asset mix and day count. We would expect incentives to decline in the second quarter from the first quarter as we did last year.","We expect Investment Management continue to be impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar due to its non-U.S. presence while the impact in the overall company is expected to be nominal. The effective tax rate is expected to be in a range of 25% to 26%, and we anticipate proceeding with our capital plans subject to market conditions and the other factors.","To summarize, we are achieving results, consistent with the goals we shared on our Investor Day, executing against our strategic priorities and on track to continue to hit our Investor Day targets.","With that, let me hand it back to Gerald.","Gerald Hassell","Thanks, Todd. And Wendy, I think we can open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse.","Ashley Serrao","Good morning.","Gerald Hassell","Good morning, Ashley.","Ashley Serrao","Gerald, a two-part question on headcount. One, I was hoping you could help me just reconcile your commentary from the shareholder meeting where you noted that the company look good on a revenue per employee metric, but then at the same time you reduced headcount by over a 1,000 positions over the course of last year. And two, as we think about the potential, if we do leverage technology across the franchise, why shouldn\u2019t decline in headcount continue?","Gerald Hassell","Well, as you know last year, we took an increasingly aggressive action on the headcount side and were able to get some structural changes to our headcounts. We saw actually a continued positive trend in the first quarter of this year, except for the fact we\u2019ve acquired a couple pieces of business. And we\u2019ve been building out some capabilities for some new clients in certain key areas.","Clearly, our goal as part of our business improvement process is to drive down the labor component of our company and use technology as the strategic asset. So, one of our goals is to get to revenue per employee up, the employee expense down and use technology as a strategic asset to get there. So clearly part of our plan is to reduce that employee headcount per revenue.","Ashley Serrao","Great. And my follow-up is for Todd. On the balance sheet and reinvestment of cash, how much more run rate you have there and then can you give us a sense of the duration and reinvestment yields here? Thank you.","Todd Gibbons","Sure, Ashley. Why don\u2019t we start with duration? So what we\u2019ve effectively done is we\u2019ve got about half of the duration of the portfolio or we call, half of the sensitivities of portfolio in held-to-maturity about half in the available-for-sale accounts. And the duration of the total portfolio is probably around 2.5. So we softened the volatility, dampen the volatility pretty substantially to our OCI for movements in interest rates.","We still are structured to see a pretty significant benefit from a rise in interest rates. So if we wanted to in our net interest income, as well as in fee waivers and other parts of our portfolio. So if we wanted to, we could probably continue to increase the portfolio a bit. LCR is not necessarily a limiting factor here because we can increase the duration of our HQLA assets, which is effectively what we\u2019ve done here. So, I would say there is a little bit of room there actually but not a lot.","Ashley Serrao","All right. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the strong quarter.","Gerald Hassell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Luke Montgomery with Bernstein Research.","Luke Montgomery","Morning, guys. Just another stab at the headcount question. Investor claiming that your firm has too many employees relative to comparable peers and the difference isn\u2019t explained by business mix. I think though, if you adjust for the sale gains you had last year, it looks like the comp to revenue ratio has been tracking just a couple percentage points higher than your closest peers.","So maybe there is a little work to do there. You\u2019ve acknowledged the plan but I think the sensible question is whether there are underlying explanations like lower cost, offshore support or outsourcing by others that you don\u2019t do, maybe labor intensity of the businesses you had that they don\u2019t. So, I just want to give you an opportunity to speak to that.","Gerald Hassell","Sure, Luke. Thanks. There is a couple of things that you should factor into your thinking on a comparable basis. One, we\u2019ve been in-sourcing our application developers where others have been either outsourcing it or moderating it. They were actually getting more capacity or less dollars in our technology application volume, sourcing those capabilities. And we\u2019ve laid out some of those numbers for you last week and in prior weeks.","The second issue is we do internally transfer agency businesses, both in the U.S. and in Europe whereas our principal competitor actually does it through a joint venture or outsources it. Transfer agency services are very labor intensive and therefore, if you were to combined the outsourcing or joint venture arrangement with a competitor you\u2019d probably find a larger headcount on a percentage basis than we may experience.","Last but not least, we do have things like corporate trust and clearing services, treasury services that some of our competitors do not have. They do have a labor component associated with it. But they are also good operating margin businesses. So, I think that\u2019s where the comparable basis starts to bring in a question that headcount versus revenues. That\u2019s why we are focused on a revenue per employee. And I think we compare very favorably to other institutions. Our goal is still to improve in that category and our goal is to still improve the operating leverage of our company. That\u2019s what we laid out in Investor Day, that\u2019s what we are committed to delivering.","Luke Montgomery","Great. Thanks for that. And then as a follow-up, I wonder if you might take a stab at breaking out employees by business or maybe consider adding some disclosures to that and in the future?","Gerald Hassell","Okay. We will give it some thought. Thanks.","Luke Montgomery","Okay. All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning. Quick question on FX, pretty solid this quarter, nice bounce back from last quarter. Was DR switching to a tailwind here this quarter or was that neutral? And did some of the adjustments that you made to that business that you referenced in your prepared remarks make -- help to make that -- help to impact that revenue line here this quarter?","Gerald Hassell","Yes, Todd.","Todd Gibbons","Yes. You had a couple of questions there, Brennan. In terms of DRs, DRs were a little stronger in the first quarter and some of that was timing from things that we\u2019ve seen in the fourth quarter. So we did get a benefit of that, and there is some FX related to corporate actions in DRs. And so we dig at a pickup there. And then some of the FX was substantial increases in volumes, which is somewhat market related as well as just trying to capture on the systems more of the volumes. And then the remainder of the pickup was market driven with some of the events in the Swiss and the higher volatility that we saw in the first quarter.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. Thanks for that. And then I know you referenced that you expect the asset management margins to improve on the German divestiture, but is it possible to quantify the impact to the margins there?","Gerald Hassell","Yes. Curtis, do you want to?","Curtis Arledge","Yes. The marine business was not a huge contributor to our overall pretax and was a large contributor to both revenues and expenses. But the strategy around our divestiture being that we really do have strong fixed income capabilities in Europe and other boutiques and the business didn\u2019t drive a significant amount of pretax such that it made sense to continue to have as much of an offering in Germany as we had there. So it\u2019s not going to be a dramatic impact on margins, but absolutely positive.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. Thanks very much.","Curtis Arledge","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","Great. Good morning, everyone.","Gerald Hassell","Hi, Al.","Alex Blostein","Todd, question for you on the balance sheet, actually couple of questions there. So your comment earlier around putting some of the excess cash to work, I was wondering if you guys could quantify that. We obviously see the mix of the balance sheet kind of moving out of the cash and cash sitting at the fed and to securities portfolio.","How much I guess of the actual deposits you guys could consider moving over time? And should we I guess take that maybe the sign of confidence that you guys are starting to see some of that nonoperational cash becoming operational year-over-year, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re doing that?","Todd Gibbons","Yes. I think, A, there is greater clarity or there is perfect clarity now around the -- I shouldn\u2019t call perfect. There is better clarity around the LCR, Alex, which gives us some confidence. And now the HCM account would be traded under the LCR. So we have put prudency limits around how far we would go with that.","So if you can see in the quarter I think cash declined by about the size of the increase in the securities portfolio. We do have a very stable core deposit base well in excess of the amount of cash that we -- or securities that we have in the high quality liquid assets in HTM account. There is probably a little bit more room for that.","I think most of what you will see us do now is work on both the assets in the non-HQLA to see if we can bump up the yields a little bit in the assets in the HQLA with the same push. But we are kind of sticking -- we are at 97 basis points in NIM. Our guidance is 95 to 102 rate environment that we try to stick with that out. So I think that\u2019s probably the best estimate of where we are going to be there.","Alex Blostein","Got you. And then a follow-up on just the overall size of the balance sheet, so this is the first decline in average earning assets of the size we see from you guys in a while. I was just curious I guess where is the decline in deposits coming from, what kind of decline base is that, where is it going, just to get some better sense of the moving pieces there?","Todd Gibbons","It is not. As you look at into the details out, you will see it\u2019s not in our deposit base and deposit base is about flat to up slightly, where you see it is in other borrowed funds. And occasionally, we do put securities out in repo and we will take advantage of some interest earning opportunities. There were less of them, so we bought down the balance sheet by $10 billion. That was self-induced by our treasury team.","Alex Blostein","Got you. Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning.","Gerald Hassell","Good morning, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","A couple of questions. One on just an SLR, you made a little bit of progress this quarter, just wanted to understand how much of the benefit the deconsolidation of those investments you mentioned earlier were going to have, if you could refresh our memory on that, as well as opportunity to improve maybe sooner rather than later with pref issuance?","Gerald Hassell","In terms of the deconsolidation, we think it\u2019s probably in the ballpark of about 2% of the assets. So if it\u2019s 2%, we\u2019ve got a 4.5% ratio, you can kind of do the arithmetic about 9 or 10 more basis points there, Betsy. It\u2019s not a huge mover, but every little bit helps and there is -- obviously there is no cost to doing that.","As we disclosed in our CCAR, we are giving some consideration to doing a preferred and preferred could be an additional, it\u2019s a cheaper source of capital obviously than common. And it maybe something that we could do on our path to compliance if we felt it was appropriate based on what we see happening to deposit base.","The deposit base is relatively stable. It might be up a little bit what was since the end of quantitative easing. But I think there is going to be some shifting around and the future of the deposit base is going to be a function of how the fed actually conducts its monetary policy.","Betsy Graseck","Great. Okay. And then just separately on clearing, we heard from JP that things get tougher there is possibility they might fade the clearing business. I mean, how do you think about that, how do you think about the future of clearing? Is there any efforts to potentially put clearing into a shared entity -- industry shared entity?","Gerald Hassell","I will take part of it, and then I will turn it over to Brian Shea. So Betsy, as you know, we have sort of two forms of clearing businesses. One is the institutional side, who brought the dealer clearance business where we have a very significant market share. It\u2019s always been a basis for some of our tri-party collateral management capabilities that\u2019s allowed us to build our collateral management and enhance in on a global basis. So it\u2019s been a core business for us and to differentiate it for us in the marketplace.","As you may know, the Federal Reserve is our client in that space is well on the reverse repo program. So we see it as an important activity. We are mindful of the fact that central clearing houses and other market participants want to utilize some of those activities, but today it\u2019s a good earner for us. We are investing in it and it\u2019s allowing us to bring to market new capabilities.","And our other clearing business which is really a financial advisory solutions platform, i.e., Pershing, now we see that as a credibly strategic asset for the company growing very, very nicely, wealth managers, private banks, advisories around the world want to utilize that platform to serve the end investor. That\u2019s a strategic growth asset of our company. And Brian, you may want to add some to it?","Brian Shea","I think you\u2019ve done a terrific job.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Good morning, guys. I was wondering if you could talk about, we\u2019ve gotten to the point there it seems like we may have seen that turn in professional, legal and other services, you guys are taking care of a bunch of the litigation.","And I am just wondering if you can give us a line of sight there, that\u2019s been the second biggest category, that\u2019s been a pressure on earnings for quite a while. Are we at an inflection point there? Are you at the point where you can at least feel confident that we\u2019ve kind of peaked there or starting to turn down?","Gerald Hassell","Yes. I think Ken there are couple of items there. I mean, we -- a lot of our purchase services are things like data sources and information that we used to our business. Our procurement activities are actually helping us drive some of those services. We think actually it\u2019s a little bit more room there.","In terms of the management consulting and some of the consulting expenses that we\u2019re incurring related to some of our major platform initiatives, those will probably be running at the rate that we\u2019re seeing now or in the ballpark, there was quite a spike in the fourth quarter. We wouldn\u2019t expect that to recur, but they could be in the same level that they are at today.","Legal is a little bit early to call. It should be a piece driven with our settlement, so we might see some benefit out of that through some of our litigation defenses which also fall on that line. So I think in the short term, I look for it to stay down at this level that we saw come from -- down from in the fourth quarter. There might be some room going out, but I am not going to -- at this point I don\u2019t think I really give guidance to a big number yet.","Ken Usdin","Okay. And my second question maybe one for Curtis just on the -- in the investment management business, Todd hearing your points on the effect of FX, but the growth rates even adjusted for the three individual investment management lines are somewhat subdued, meaning implies that the fee capture rates look like they are still under some pressure with your mixing still into LDI and out of act of equity. Just wondering if you can kind of shed some additional light on just continued optimization there and what should we expect thus far is the outlook for fee capture.","Curtis Arledge","Yes. So fee capture when you blend assets, we have fees that are very different in each asset class. And so what we have seen is the fee capture declines really have been result of the success of our rapidly LDI business. So LDI, again the U.S. LDI and European, UK specifically LDI businesses are somewhat different. The biggest part of our LDI business is in the U.K. and Europe through Insight and they have continued to garner assets as pension plans are derisking. The business -- that business is actually quite active business as you\u2019re trying not just to manage against an interest rate liability but also an inflation liability. They earn both base fees and performance fees. So when they perform well, their fee realization is actually meaningfully higher.","But again, what\u2019s happening on the total fee capture is that the declines -- we cover this at Investor Day you may remember Ken that it really had a lot to do with the fact our LDI business is growing so rapidly. But again, it\u2019s not a passive business, it\u2019s very much an active business, and much of our performance fees over the past many quarters have been from our LDI business.","Ken Usdin","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Gerald Hassell","Thanks, Ken.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo","Hi. I have one question with three parts. At the annual meeting, new director Ed Garden said that Bank of New York is focused on being best-in-class in everything we do. So first, are you benchmarking versus best-in-class? Second, what is the best-in-class number for ROTCE and the margins for investment management and investment services?","And third, when you look at best-in-class, wouldn\u2019t it be more appropriate instead of looking at revenue per employee to look at net income per employee and on that measure it seems like you rank below peer? Thanks.","Gerald Hassell","Thanks, Mike. We certainly aspire to be best-in-class in everything we do. And to be recognized as the industry leader in the areas we operate in. We do metric ourselves against the variety of different institutions and a variety of different metrics to try to achieve those goals. We challenge our teams across the company to aspire to those metrics.","For the public consumption we give you broad metrics. It\u2019s tough to give you every single metric that we operate in the company within. And so things like fee to expense ratio across investment services, you see continuous improvement there. The revenue per employee is admittedly a broad metric but it\u2019s an indicative metric of one other things we\u2019re trying to work towards.","We look at client survey and client satisfaction surveys. We measure those that we shared with you at the shareholder meeting last week are extremely high scores. We want to get to 100%, I\u2019m not sure we will ever get there, but those are some of the things we\u2019re trying to work towards, things like straight through processing rates, accuracy rates are all things that we measure in investment services.","Investment management side, we look at the investment performance of the boutiques and the asset classes versus their fee realization. So we have a lot of metrics across the company where we\u2019re aspiring to be the best to everything we do. Will we always get there? It will be a challenge to get there in every single category, but that\u2019s certainly our aspiration.","Mike Mayo","All right. One follow-up then because last week you did mention the revenue per employee and after getting back to my desk, I\u2019m looking at net income per employee. It didn\u2019t look quite as good or like underperform peer. So why is revenue per employee the right metric to look at instead of net income per employee? And also, when you sell your German boutique, will that help that metric? And can you elaborate on that sale because that seems new?","Gerald Hassell","Okay. Mike, whether it\u2019s revenue per employee or net income per employee, I think they are a metric. But I think the metric ultimately that you need to follow is what is happening to our operating margin and how are we performing, because if we in-source or outsource, whichever way you go is there is good reason for one company do one way versus another doing it another way. Ultimately, it\u2019s got to drop to the bottomline.","And I think what you\u2019ve seen in our performance this quarter a 300 basis point increase in our operating margin is pretty substantial. And we continue to focus on driving the margin. We think the strategies ultimately will pay off. We think the in-sourcing of our application developers not only do we have the intellectual property close to our clients, which can make us the best-in-class in terms of providing technology solutions, we also have it at a lower cost because we own it. And that\u2019s being reflecting in our technology costs, which are declining.","So I think that that\u2019s how ultimately you have to measure us, because it\u2019s just too hard to tell exactly what\u2019s going on with headcount and how people compute it and whether they\u2019ve got contractor in versus full time employees and so forth. In terms of Meriten, I\u2019ll turn it over to Curtis.","Curtis Arledge","Yes. Thanks. One thing I would want to make sure that we highlighted that we in addition to selling Meriten, we also acquired Cutwater. There is actually a net reduction in staff as a result of that, but it\u2019s not going to meaningfully change any of the metrics that you\u2019re looking at, Mike. So that really was a strategic repositioning of our portfolio.","Again, we had more fixed income capability in Europe than we felt like we needed. And we also want to grow Insight\u2019s terrific LDI capabilities in the U.S. So partnering them with an excellent firm at Cutwater really was we thought fantastic move. So I just want to make sure we capture both of those.","Gerald Hassell","And I think, Meriten is part in by itself, it\u2019s not going to move the needle a lot. But as we pour over the portfolio, as we change our derivatives businesses we streamlined our capital markets activities as we exited the futures clearing margin, as we exited two corporate trusts activities in Japan and Mexico, now throw Meriten into that. As we continue to pore over what makes sense in aggregate, they\u2019re starting to move the needle.","Mike Mayo","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Hi. Good morning, folks.","Gerald Hassell","Hi.","Brian Bedell","Maybe just following along that path on the actual cost saves from strategic actions. And maybe if you can just update us on the aggregate level of cost saves on a year-over-year basis that you expect from consolidating some of the back-office platforms in asset servicing like moving to the one platform in custody?","Brian Shea","Yes. So Brian, this is Brian Shea. We continue to drive forward with our business improvement process, which is transforming for success. And as Gerald mentioned earlier, we\u2019re going across the board. So from a business excellence perspective, can\u2019t just talk about the business portfolio review actions, Meriten was the latest in a series. We continue to drive more leverage across the franchise in terms of enterprise team work. We\u2019re executing on a global location strategy to reposition people to lower cost locations.","Lets talk about the in-sourcing of technology development, which not only improves our speeds to market and intellectual capital leverage, but it also reduces our costs and reduces our dependency on contractors and consultants.","We are moving forward with the platform consolidations in the latest quarter or in the last month we completed the final stage of our corporate trust replatforming to a new -- to our target platform and that will enable us to retire another large historical legacy platform of the company.","So there\u2019s a lots going on. But the key message I\u2019d say is one, we gave you a target at Investor Day. We\u2019re going to meet that target and we\u2019re on track to meet that target. And the work that we\u2019re doing is not one-time cost driven, it\u2019s sustainable continuous improvement and so we believe we can continue to drive improvement in this process so over the long-term.","Todd Gibbons","And Brian, I would just add that, we\u2019ve learned the lesson of announcing a big program and then delivering on the program and unless it shows up in the operating margin and the operating leverage, it doesn\u2019t count and it\u2019s showing up in the operating leverage and the operating margins.","So our margin went up by 300 basis points in the first quarter of last year. Our fee-to-expense ratio has improved in Investment Services and we produced over 500 basis points of operating leverage. Those are the facts.","Curtis Arledge","And I would add to that Brian, all the actions that we\u2019re taking to streamline the organization and transformation that, Brian, just talked about make us a little simpler, a little less risky, but there are also continue to be significant regulatory requirements for us, the resolution planning, meeting some of the data requirements that are substantial.","So the regulators continue to increase the bar and we need to be prepared to be able to fund those investments and some of this will drop to the bottomline and some of it will enable us to fund the increasing demands from the regulators.","Brian Bedell","Great. Right. So that remains the wildcard on the regulatory front from the expense perspective its sounds like.","Gerald Hassell","Yes.","Brian Bedell","And then just to follow up, this might be too early to try to figure, but you talked a little bit about the NEXEN platform at the shareholder meeting. Maybe if you could -- is there a way to quantify the competitive advantage if you think you will be able to get from that from new product rollout, some of the internal sourcing that you just mentioned, say over a two or three-year period from a revenue perspective?","Gerald Hassell","Yeah. I would -- I don\u2019t want to give you a specific revenue target, but I can say that, we\u2019re committed to be the investment industry technology leader, partly in-sourcing strategy that we mentioned is not just around being more cost effective, its about transferring domain business knowledge into the technology development team in a way they create the competitive advantage.","NEXEN will be a visible manifestation of that to our clients. It\u2019s a sort of the next-generation technology platform that\u2019s going to allow us to connect the various applications across the various businesses and deliver more seamless and state-of-the-art intuitive platform to BNY Mellon\u2019s clients.","It\u2019s going to be -- it is based on the secure cloud-based -- private cloud-based platform, which accelerates our speed to market for new capabilities and actually reduces our cost of infrastructure.","It has an EPI marketplace essentially allowing seamless integration with our clients in much so will be an easier firm to do business with and integrate with from a technology perspective.","It will be completely mobile in a way that we deliver. So any mobile device anywhere, anytime people will be able to connect through NEXEN. It has the equivalent of an app store, which means that we are going to be able to easily integrate third-party providers of choice into the platform.","So that we reduce our clients\u2019 vendor management and integration costs, and ultimately, it will be the delivery vehicle for our big data solutions, which we are already developing delivering to clients in the area of liquidity management, collateral management, but will allow us to deliver insights to our clients.","So we\u2019ll -- we are rolling this out internally in the beginning this quarter and we\u2019ll start rolling out to customers in the second half of the year for selected businesses and over the course of 2016 we will rollout more broadly to the broader client base. Hope that helps?","Brian Bedell","Yeah. That\u2019s pretty color. Thank you.","Gerald Hassell","Thanks Brian.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.","Glenn Schorr","Hi. Thanks very much.","Gerald Hassell","Hi, Glenn.","Glenn Schorr","A quick question in money market land, I'm curious if you feel like you have the product offering set where you wanted to be as we transition next year and what kind of sensitivities you think you are looking at in terms of client bounce migration, prime funds, the treasury funds and what kind of fee give up and fee waiver give up that might be -- may -- that we are thinking gets recaptured that might not be based on how clients migrate?","Curtis Arledge","Hey, Glenn. This is Curtis. Let me give you the view from the Investor Management perspective and then maybe, Todd or Brian, talk about it on the other side. So, first of all, you are seeing people reposition their money market offerings, as we get closer to next year\u2019s floating rate NAV for institutional prime funds and we\u2019ve actually been spending a lot of time on that as well.","And so not ready to announce anything just yet, but I think, it's fair to say, that the industry will position itself for, what we do believe will be a shift in asset, there are a lot of people who currently -- institutional clients that use fixed NAV prime funds that will not be able to have them be in floating in status. So we know assets are likely to move.","We continuously survey our clients and not just across investment management but the whole company. We are obviously a very large player here. And we do believe that -- between the third and 50% of the clients will shift to treasury funds.","And so to answer your questions about what that means from a fee waiver perspective, I actually has -- it\u2019s very significant where interest rates are when that occurs fee waivers are more challenging in treasury funds. And so, if in October of 2016 interest rates haven\u2019t moved, there will be a negative impact from fee waivers from that activity. ","One of the other thing, it is somewhat offsetting that though and you\u2019ve seen some banks begin SLR is having an impact changing their views on deposits and so we have absolutely seen hedge funds and other clients who would have left the deposits on bank balance sheets move those two money market funds.","And so we are actually in the first quarter across our platform and within investment management, we saw balances remained relatively stable, the seasonality would have suggested that they would have been down somewhat. So there is a growth in money market funds occurring as a result of regulation, so there are some countervailing at play here.","Todd Gibbons","Yeah. So, I think, going for the company as a whole that if interest rates were to stay at zero and you did see a movement for prime, again let\u2019s talk with, what Curtis just indicated is the movement you are seeing into treasury funds not necessarily coming from prime right now, it\u2019s coming from bank deposits.","But if in the event as we -- as we move forward money market would fund reform, we would expect prime to go to more toward treasury. And that -- if interest rates stayed at zero that would be a negative for us because there is lower yield in treasury and therefore they are going to be a modest increase in fee waivers as a result of that. If interest rates normalize than the recovery track of fee waivers would be as we\u2019ve described.","Glenn Schorr","Got it. Okay. I appreciate it. And then just one little catch up on occupancy cost. You mentioned that we couldn't see the double occupancy cost in first quarter. I just want to make sure they were there but they were offsetting items because I would just want to make sure we are modeling second, third and fourth quarter correctly for the...?","Todd Gibbons","I\u2019d love to -- let me clarify that and make it absolutely clear. So yes, we do -- we are paying the double rent. We had a little benefit from currency translation. We also had a little benefit from our outsourcing of maintenance which falls through that occupancy expense line. And in addition, some of the costs associated with the move have not been reflected in that line. So I think the best guidance I could give we had indicated that we thought the line would be up about $30 million for the full year, it\u2019s probably best to think of it at about that amount.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell","Yeah. Good morning. Maybe just a quick follow-up on the deposit discussion, obviously given leverage constraints across the industry it\u2019s sort of a difficult problem for everybody. How do we think about it long-term up -- is it more that hey we can\u2019t really tell our clients what to do because we don't want to lose relationships and push deposits down like a JPMorgan and longer term the economics with higher rates you kind of get to a crossover point where you actually earn your cost of capital on those deposits?","Is that sort of the strategy that -- or is there something more proactive you can do to push down leverage and move into money markets. So just wondering if there's any kind of constraints on money markets for a lot of corporate treasures if they have a risk of being locked up for 30 days and things like that?","Gerald Hassell","Well why don\u2019t I start and I\u2019ll turn it over to Todd. Well, it\u2019s a very dynamic situation. Supplemental leverage phases in and we work our way towards it. Obviously the level of the balance sheet becomes increasingly more important. We\u2019d like to earn some money on those deposits in the short run. We are watching our deposit base and our client activity. We clearly want to try to drive the deposit base towards operational deposits which are having more favorable treatment.","We are educating all of our teams around the company around client activity and whether it's operational deposits or not and therefore the value associated with that. That helps us engage with our clients better and really drive better outcomes for our clients and ourselves. So it\u2019s a very dynamic situation. We are very engaged with our clients on it where we think it\u2019s appropriate as we\u2019ve done in Europe where we are charging for deposits we are but we are modeling this and watching it very carefully.","Todd Gibbons","Yeah. Jim, I would just add to that, that it\u2019s hard to predict how deposits are going to move until you are clear about what the Fed monetary policy is going to be. So if they are drained in a traditional way which would be through reverse repo then we would think deposits would be -- would run off and it would be price based.","Another alternative is literally just to price them. So there are going to be non-operational deposits which mean they aren\u2019t very attractive under the LCR. And I think banks will be not willing to pay a lot for them especially if they are somewhat constrained by the SLR ratio.","In the event, net interest rates rise and those deposits want to stick with institutions that are very strong institutions, there will be a cross over at 60 or 70 basis points that looks pretty attractive as a return on capital even just leaving it at the Fed. So there might be a point where you probably race in for further capital just to keep the balance sheet -- keep them on the balance sheet to make it very -- actually a zero risk return but a decent return on regulatory capital.","Jim Mitchell","Okay. Thanks for that. That's very helpful. And then may be a quickie on the net share count. I think you -- last year's buyback, I think net of employee stock issue was about, I guess, at 35%, 40% dilution. Is that the way to think about it going forward or should we think about the employee issuance is more of a fixed cost and as the buyback increases the net share count reduction improves?","Todd Gibbons","It\u2019s relatively stable. So you\u2019ll see a little bit of a higher one as the buyback increases but not a lot. So you should still I think, think in the same terms that you just mentioned that there will be share issuance with the employees.","Jim Mitchell","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Todd Gibbons","That\u2019s kind of a ballpark. Okay.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Adam Beatty with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Adam Beatty","Thank you and good morning. A couple of questions on Investment Management, specifically on the multi-affiliate model. I appreciate your comments so far on Meriten and Cutwater and Insight. Just more broadly across the affiliate portfolio, is there additional streamlining that you're thinking about? Are there capabilities that you're looking to add or maybe some affiliates that are subscale? Just more broadly how are you thinking about the affiliate portfolio? Thanks.","Gerald Hassell","Yes. So one of the things that we announce recently was the formation of a actually a new investment boutique from start with the state of Texas as a cornerstone investor. We actually launched a firm called Amherst Capital and it\u2019s designed in many ways to benefit from a lot of regulatory change that we are talking about where banks are having to hold more capital, much of the changes in real estate finance have been impacted by that.","And so that boutique will actually manage funds in real estate finance as result of this change. And so that\u2019s an example of the kind of thing where we are continuously looking for places, where we believe our clients can earn some very attractive returns, relative to their liabilities and also to their needs. And so we -- one way that we manage our portfolio was by starting new things, launching new things. And it was a great thing to have a very well-known, sizable institutional client launch that with us.","On the other hand, the Meriten sale very much was looking at our portfolio and seeing the great growth that we\u2019ve seen from other investment firms in our mix and so both, Insight, Standish, Alcentra, Newton even had some very good European fixed income capabilities. So when we feel like our capabilities get to the point that there is more attractive owner of the firm, we have sold it.","And in the past, we closed firms that become subscale and didn\u2019t deliver the investment performance, we\u2019re always looking to find those investment capabilities that we think are excellent that fit, meets that we think our clients have and that are in line with market trends such as I described around the Amherst. It is a continuous process. I will tell you that we are not traders of our investment boutiques.","I want to make sure that we don\u2019t send that message because the truth of the matter is we are trying to have investment lineup that satisfies the complete solutions for our vast global client base. And again, the Meriten enterprise by itself is not our core strategy of ours to sell firms but really just made more sense to do something different. The Cutwater acquisition again expanding pension derisking capabilities into the U.S. is a major market trend and that\u2019s why we made that acquisition.","Adam Beatty","Makes sense. Thank you for the color. And then just turning to the equity capability, which stands out a little bit from an otherwise strong franchise on those terms are there product gaps that maybe you're looking to fill? Is it a question of current products maybe being out-of-favor or mainly a performance issue? I know you've done some work on distribution and how is that coming to fruition?","Gerald Hassell","Yes. Thanks for that question. It\u2019s a good one. Again, most of the assets under management that we have are with institutional clients who are very disciplined around rebalancing. And so as equity markets have performed well, the client base that we have is very thoughtful about managing their overall asset allocation. And so rebalancing has absolutely been a big part of the trend we\u2019ve seen not just this quarter but in previous quarter.","If we look across the industry and some of what we see in retirement channels and in retail channels that have been -- there has been less volatility. There are actually inflows into some equity products and a lot of the investment we\u2019ve been making in our wealth management business and in our U.S. retail intermediary business have been around being able to capture those flows.","And just year-over-year, I can tell U.S. retail across all products had a very nice uptick, about 60% increase in sales. And our wealth management business is also showing some very nice growth.","In active equity, we\u2019ve seen some impact at the institutional level where clients have moved from active to passive. I\u2019d tell you that about a third of what we\u2019ve seen in our business in this quarter was a move from active to passive. So that\u2019s a dynamic at play as well.","Adam Beatty","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott","Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. At the Investor Day you talked about 11% to 12% range for the Basel III Tier 1 common ratio. Clearly even with the reversal of the operational risk here you're going to be a bit below that. Are you still thinking about that 11% to 12% range as the right number or do you think it\u2019s kind of shifted down?","Gerald Hassell","No, Geoff. I think, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the impact of the increase in the operational risk capital will be offset by the deconsolidation of certain assets, as we believe we are going to be an early adopter of the consolidation standards. So that will bring us back closer to the 10% range and then there will be some natural accretion of capital, as we both increase our SLR requirements.","And we like to be about it. I think being optimal is being about 2x. So if we have 5.5% of the SLR based capital, leverage capital that would probably put us in about at 11% or so for a common equity Tier 1. So, I\u2019d still keep it pretty close to the range of 11% to 12%.","Geoffrey Elliott","And then just a quick question on the numbers. There was a big increase in non-controlling interest to $90 million and there was also a big step up in the income from consolidated investment management funds. It sounded like you were saying there was some sort of hedging effect that drove that, but I just wanted to make sure I understood what was going on.","Gerald Hassell","Yeah. This refers back to the consolidation of the variable interest entities that we are just talking about in the balance sheet. So effectively what happens when we have a small interest in our fund, we have to consolidate the entire fund. And as we consolidate that, we recognized the revenue not only from our own small interest but of our clients. And then we take that revenue -- so in the first quarter, it did very well. So it went up substantially and our clients saw much more in the form of revenue that we typically see.","And if we go through the balance sheet, you\u2019ll see there is deduction on an after-tax basis of that minority interest. And so what it looks like is we have a large pre-tax income and therefore have a very low tax rates and that\u2019s not our income, doesn\u2019t get included in the tax rate but in effect it\u2019s best just to take the way we report our numbers on an adjusted basis. That\u2019s why we didn\u2019t say our revenue grew 6%, which is what the GAAP number was. It actually grew 4% because we took the client revenue out of the revenue line. As we adopt the new standard, we\u2019ll get a lot less noise from that because it will eliminate most of what you see coming through there.","Geoffrey Elliott","Great. Thank you very much.","Gerald Hassell","Okay. Thank you very much, everyone. And we really appreciated you dialing in. If you have further questions, please give Valerie Haertel a call and we look forward to catching up with you soon.","Operator","Thank you. If there are any additional questions or comments, you may contact Ms. Valerie Haertel at 212-635-8529. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent. I will now turn the call to Mr. Andy Clark. Mr. Clark, you may begin.","Andy Clark","Thanks, Charlene. Welcome, everyone. With us today are Gerald Hassell, our Chairman, President and CEO; Todd Gibbons, our CFO, as well as several members of our executive management team. Before we begin, let me remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement on Page 13 of the press release and those identified in our documents filed with the SEC that are available on our website, bnymellon.com. Forward-looking statements in this call speak only as of today, October 17, 2012, and we will not update forward-looking statements. Our press release and earnings review are available on our website, and we will be using the earnings review to discuss our results. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Gerald. Gerald?","Gerald L. Hassell","Thanks, Andy, and good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us. As you've seen from the release, for the third quarter, we generated net income of $720 million and an earnings per share of $0.61. Now that did include the benefit of approximately $0.04 per share from a lower tax rate. As a reminder, we reported $0.53 per share in the third quarter of last year.","In a macro environment that continues to present challenges to all of us, we are winning new business, investing in organic growth opportunities, delivering on our operational excellence initiatives, improving on our already strong capital position, continuing to return capital shareholders and at the end of the day, our core revenues were up 2%, and core expenses were flat.","We were particularly pleased with the strength of our investment management area, which benefited from strong investment performance and a 12th consecutive quarter of long-term flows. We had $58 billion in net long-term flows over the last 12 months, which included $9 billion during the third","[Audio Gap]","helped drive assets under management to a record level of $1.4 trillion. And during the quarter, we received a number of industry awards, which is very, very gratifying. Insight was named the Fixed Income firm of the year and LDI firm of the year by Financial News. ARX, our Brazilian investment manager, was awarded Active Equity Manager of the Year, and the BNY Mellon Emerging Market Debt Fund was named Emerging Market Debt Fund of the Year.","We also purchased the remaining 50% of our West LB Mellon Asset Management joint venture, which further strengthens our franchise in Germany. We combined some of our Standish fixed income activities with Alcentra to create a world-class and sizable manager of credit strategy.","We also announced plans to combine our Pareto currency risk management boutique with Insight to creating one manager of risk management solutions. So there's lots of good things occurring in investment management.","Turning to Investment Services, we also benefited from new business, as well as typical seasonality in Depositary Receipts. In Asset Servicing, we had more than $520 billion in new assets under custody wins. Now with market values increasing and conversions to prior business won, assets under custody reached a record level of almost $28 trillion. Also during the quarter, we fully integrated the BHF Asset Servicing business onto our systems. So we are in fact integrating and retiring legacy platforms. And feedbacks on our newly formed global services organization has been overwhelmingly positive, as clients struggle to meet the current and emerging requirements of Dodd-Frank.","Now offsetting some of these positives were seasonal reductions in volumes that affected our foreign exchange and clearing businesses. Also, Corporate Trust continues to be negatively impacted by low levels in new issuance versus a natural retirement of existing securities. We continue to make good progress on our operational excellence initiatives, which are focused on providing great client service while improving productivity and reducing risk. And on the capital front, we generated strong returns on tangible equity, continue to return capital to shareholders and improve our already strong capital position.","Now going forward, we remain very focused on capitalizing on our core -- organic growth opportunities identified within our company that can help clients grow and navigate the current environment. Now there are some great examples of this. Take global collateral services where we're seeing real exciting opportunities. We're working to leverage the tremendous power of our Pershing distribution capability for our investment management products, and we're doing this globally, as we believe our technology and distribution platforms export well around the world. And we're also building on our trading capabilities to better service our clients to provide more opportunities to capture trading flows for a variety of instruments. We're a great counterparty and some natural extension of our business.","So while we're certainly pleased that our core businesses are growing and we're succeeding in capturing new business and controlling our expenses, we're also creating our own long-term revenue growth capabilities. Now it's also imperative for us to focus on the great ideas and opportunities that exist in-house and to relentlessly manage our cost base to improve EPS performance.","With that, let me turn it over to Todd to go through the numbers.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Thanks, Gerald, and good morning, everyone. My comments as usual will follow the Quarterly Earnings Review that begins on Page 2. Reported earnings per share was $0.61. That compares with $0.39 last quarter, but remember that last quarter included litigation charges of about $0.18. The $0.61 includes the benefit of approximately $0.04 from a lower-than-expected effective tax rate, is also $0.03 due to elevated other income and lower provision.","Looking at the numbers on a sequential basis, total revenue was $3.7 billion. That's up 2%, while fee and other revenue was also up 2%. Investment management fees, investment services fees, investment and NIR were each up, and those were partially offset by declines in FX revenue. Expenses were flat and if you exclude M&I litigation and the restructuring charges as well as expenses related to the Shareowner Services, which we sold at the end of last year. Year-over-year on that same basis, they were up 2%. The increase was a result of the cost of certain tax credits that we had in this third quarter that provided a meaningful benefit to the bottom line and helped our effective tax rate.","Turning to Page 4 where we'll call out some business metrics that will help explain our underlying performance. You can see that assets under management of $1.359 trillion was up 5% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. That's resulting from higher market values but also good inflows.","During the quarter, we had net long-term inflows at $9 billion and short-term inflows of $9 billion as well. It was our 12th consecutive quarter of positive long-term inflows with flows of $58 billion over the last 12 months. Assets under custody and administration was up 3% sequentially to a record level of $27.9 trillion. That was driven by higher market values and net new business. Assets under custody is up about 8% on a year-over-year basis.","Now looking at a number of our key metrics showed growth on a year-over-year basis. Collateral management balances continued to grow. They surpassed $2 trillion for the first time, and global payment volumes were also up about 2%. Wealth management loans and deposits were up for the year as well. Clearing metrics were mixed with DARTS down significantly, both sequentially and year-over-year, while average long-term mutual fund assets were up.","Going on to look at fees on Page 6. Assets Servicing fees were down 1% sequentially. That's largely driven by the seasonal decrease in securities lending revenue and partially offset by net new business and higher market values. Asset Servicing fees were up 2% year-over-year, primarily reflecting net new business and higher market values and securities lending revenue. We had $522 billion in new assets under custody wins, our best new business quarter since 2008. AUC wins totaled more than $1.7 trillion over the last 12 months, of which approximately $740 billion remains to be converted, with half of that expected to be converted between now and year end and the remainder during the first half of 2013.","Issuer service fees excluding the Shareowner Services business were up 13% sequentially and down 22% year-over-year. The sequential increase resulted from seasonally higher DR revenue related to corporate actions, partially offset by lower Corporate Trust fees. The year-over-year decrease largely resulted from lower DR revenue driven by lower volumes and lower Corporate Trust fees reflecting the continuing net runoff of structured debt securitizations. This runoff could reduce the company's total revenue over the next few quarters by about 50 to 70 basis points assuming the structured markets do not recover.","Clearing fees, which are more activity sensitive were down 7% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. Both decreases were principally driven by lower DARTS volumes, reflecting the sharp decline in share volume on both the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, which was down 31% year-over-year and 10% sequentially on a combined basis.","Investment management fees, excluding performance fees, were up 3% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. Both increases were driven by higher market values and new business. The strong performance of the boutiques continues to attract long-term flows. In FX and other trading, revenue was up 1% sequentially and down 9% year-over-year. Looking at the components of FX, looking at the components underlying that, FX revenue totaled $121 million. That's a decrease of 23% sequentially and 45% year-over-year. Both decreases were driven by lower volatility and lower volumes.","Other trading revenue was $61 million compared with revenue of $23 million in the second quarter and a loss of $21 million in the year-ago quarter. Both increases reflect improved fixed income trading, as we benefited from the development of our trading capabilities as well as our strong counterparty status. Investment and other income totaled $124 million in the quarter. That compares with $48 million in the prior quarter and $83 million a year ago. Both increases primarily resulted from higher seed capital gains and higher equity's investment revenue.","Turning to Page 8 of the earnings review, NIR was up $15 million sequentially and down $26 million versus the year-ago quarter. The sequential improvement reflects higher interest earning assets driven by very large deposit levels and is partially offset by the elimination of interest on the ECB deposits. The year-over-year decrease in net interest revenue was principally driven by lower yields, the elimination of interest on ECB deposits, and it was partially offset by the increased investment in high-quality investment securities. The net interest margin was 1.20% compared with 1.25% in the second quarter and 1.30% in the year-ago quarter. Both decreases mostly reflect lower reinvestment yields, primarily driven by accretion as well as the significant increase in customer deposits.","Turning to Page 9, you can see that we exhibited good expense control. Total noninterest expenses, including amortization of intangible assets, M&I litigation and restructuring charges as well as the expenses related to Shareowner Services was flat sequentially and up 2% year-over-year. Sequentially, the decreases in professional, legal and other purchase services and business development expenses were offset by the annual employee merit increase that took effect on January -- July 1. On a year-over-year basis, after adjusting for the benefit for -- excuse me, the cost of generating tax credits in the third quarter of 2012 and the benefit of a state investment tax credits recorded in the year-ago quarter, expenses were flat.","On Page 10, you can see the progress we've made on our operational excellence initiatives. On a gross basis, our efforts during the quarter resulted in $105 million in quarterly run rate savings and incremental program cost totaling $23 million or net savings of $82 million. Year-to-date, we generated net savings of $223 million. That's a bit ahead of the plan we disclosed last year.","We had some key events this quarter that contributed to our progress in meeting the operational excellence goals for this quarter and will have a greater impact as we move forward. For example, we're more fully leveraging the Eastern European operation. This came with some GIS acquisitions, which for the first time, gave us a low-cost operation where we can service European clients from their own time zone. In addition, we completed our final BHF client conversions as Gerald alluded to earlier. And in corporate services, we consolidated offices in London and Amsterdam and continue to benefit from the enhanced global procurement program. By year end, we do expect to be well within the range of our targeted net savings.","Page 11 details our capital ratios. Our estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio was 9.3% at quarter end. That's up 60 basis points, with the increase chiefly attributable to the stronger earnings and the increase in the value of the investment portfolio. Our Basel I Tier 1 capital ratio is at 15.3%, also up 60 basis points. We benefited from a very attractive market and issued $550 million of fixed rate, non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock that qualifies as a Basel III Tier 1 capital, and we're very pleased that the coupon was at the lowest rate for a bank-issued, non-cumulative perpetual preferred.","On Page 12, you can see that the market value of our investments securities portfolio increased from last quarter. The pretax net unrealized gain on our securities portfolio was up by more than $1 billion to about $2.5 billion, reflecting a decline in interest rates and improved credit spreads. We did take advantage of the strong market to sell a few securities that we thought were priced a bit rich.","Looking at our loan book on Page 13, you'll see that the provision for credit losses was a credit of $5 million compared with a credit of $19 million in the second quarter and a credit of $22 million in the year-ago quarter. The credit primarily resulted from a gain on loan sales as well as repayments. The portfolio continues to perform very nicely, and as you can see, NPAs continue to decline. The effective tax rate was 23.1%, and that primarily reflects the benefit from completing various tax audits.","Now a few points to factor into your thinking about the fourth quarter. In terms of NII, we think we can maintain something between the second and third quarter levels. We would expect seasonally lower DR fees and seasonally higher investment management performance fees. The quarterly provision should be around 0 and give or take a few million. And the operating tax rate in the third quarter of 2012 should be approximately 27% to 28%. We continue to invest in organic growth as Gerald had mentioned. We're maintaining our strong balance sheet, and we're driving expense savings through our operational excellence initiatives.","With that, let me turn it back to Gerald.","Gerald L. Hassell","Thanks, Todd, and perhaps now we can open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Cynthia Mayer with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess, just to expand on your guidance on NII, I think you said something between 2Q and 3Q. Is that right?","Thomas P. Gibbons","That's correct, Cynthia.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And I guess as part of that, what would be your outlook for NIM? I think last quarter you predicted it would fall a few basis points, and I guess it's up 5. What is your outlook there?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, as we said in the past Cynthia, we're not managing to NIM. We are managing to NIR. So we're willing to take on deposits and place them at the fed even though that generates a very low NIM because you can only get 25 basis points on that. So our focus, again, has been to drive NIR up or keep it stable in this kind of an environment. All that being said, I think if you were to hold the balance sheet constant and the interest environment stayed depressed at this level, you would see some continued contraction over the course of the next 12 months in the NIM.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Great. Now on the Asset Management side, you guys had $9 billion in long-term inflows, which is great. Can you talk a little about where you're seeing those coming from? And are you seeing any particular strategies as you look ahead, which are really driving the flows?","Curtis Y. Arledge","Yes. Cynthia, it's Curtis Arledge. The flows that we saw on the third quarter -- first of all, the third quarter isn't typically an extremely strong quarter in terms of new mandates. But having said that, it was substantially better than a year ago. The $9 billion had -- definitely had an index component to it. About $5 billion of the $9 billion came from index strategies. Active strategies in both fixed income and equities did get some inflows. I would tell you that our dialogue with clients in terms of where they're going with money is I'd described it the following way: We've had good discussions and good investments by clients in strategies that are volatility and risk dampening. So we see clients that have equity strategies looking to do things like long\/short, and absolute return strategies have absolutely been -- absolute return has absolutely been an area where clients have been moving. There also has been a movement in -- among equities to move and diversify away from the U.S. As U.S. markets have done better, we've seen clients that have moved some of their portfolio and diversified to be more global. The emerging market, that story has been a place where people have gone looking for yield. That's been a pretty consistent story for the past several quarters. I would tell you that I think that this -- we have a lot of clients. This isn't -- and it's probably true across the board in a lot of businesses, but a lot of our clients are definitely watching and waiting to see how both the election and the fiscal cliff get dealt with. So our pipelines are pretty constant, but I think the dialogue is going to be very much driven by sort of how the next several months play out. I think a lot of clients actually want to do things, but there's just so much uncertainty. They're waiting to see how things go.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And maybe last question is it looks like your headcount ticked up, which seems maybe at odds with some the rationalizations you have, you highlight and the expense controls. I'm just wondering what accounts for that.","Gerald L. Hassell","Sure, Cynthia. It's 2 main things. One is as we migrate some of our jobs to some of our global centers around the world, there's a little bit of bubble headcount associated with that. But most of it's associated with insourcing contractors, particularly on the software application side. We've been using third-party contractors. We decided it's much more efficient. And frankly, we retain the intellectual property and intellectual capacity of the talent by insourcing it rather than using third-party contractor. So there's a benefit both on the cost side as well as retaining the talent.","Thomas P. Gibbons","And that's why you don't see -- even though you see that number go up, you're not seeing an increase in salaries.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I'm asking about the bloodbath on servicing fees side, and this is not a new question. It just keeps getting worse and worse. So if I look at your servicing fees including foreign exchange securities lending this is the lowest percentage of those fees to assets under custody in your history, and you're also seeing that at the other processing banks, too. So we always ask this question. What are you doing? What can you do to stem the margin pressure in the core servicing business?","Gerald L. Hassell","So I'll make a couple of comments, Mike, and then perhaps turn it over to Tim. So a couple of things that we're doing: We are seeing better recovery on securities lending, and we're being more active there. And I think the numbers speak for that both in terms of securities on loan as well as the year-over-year improvement in that category. So we are seeing securities lending being reactivated in the marketplace, and we're being more active on that front. Tim will talk in a moment what he's trying to do on the core Asset Servicing side, where you're seeing certain kinds of fees move, and the core fees have actually moved up. But you're correct. They haven't moved up totally in line with assets under custody, and Tim will talk to that perhaps in a moment. And on the trading and foreign exchange side, we are investing on our trading activities and various electronic platforms in order to capture more flows that go through our fingertips. And so we're not going to rely on foreign exchange coming back to the degree that it did, but we are investing in the businesses to capture more of the other instruments that are traded naturally by our clients. And we think an opportunity gain some of that traction and some of the revenues around that will improve the overall returns on the business. So with that, maybe I'll turn it over to Tim.","Timothy F. Keaney","Yes. Gerald, thanks. Mike, Tim Keaney. A couple of things, first of all, we're going back to repricing as I said on previous few calls. We started off Broadway with smaller clients, which is now done. That's not a needle mover, but it's a step in the right direction. We're moving up the chain to larger clients, as their contracts come up for review. We've had 29 of our larger clients out of 29 successfully repriced with about a 20% uptick in core fees, and we're just going to stay at that. That's probably going to take us about 3 years to go through the whole cycle, as contracts come up for review. But more to your question of the disaggregation between growth and AUC, I might just comment on that for a second. Year-over-year, we saw a huge amount of de-risking. We see about a third gearing for us to market and as Todd mentioned, a significant portion on the year-on-year uptick in AUC with market. We also had a little bit of a mix issue where about 60% plus of our assets under custody are geared towards fixed income. But I will make one other point. We have maintained pricing discipline, we do have some large clients year-on-year, particularly in Europe, that are coming through because we are maintaining absolute strict pricing discipline. So I think you do see that pulling through and also the mix in new business that we're winning. We do see a significant portion of new business coming from outsourcing and transfer agency that are key pillars for us, and that really isn't geared to AUC, and last point, we still have half of what we've won yet to convert.","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes. I'd say one other final comment, Mike, in terms of what are we doing. The effort that we're putting into and the resources around collateral services, global collateral services is for real, and we do see that as a real opportunity to capture revenues around assets that are within our custody base. And so I think that's going to be an opportunity for us to gain fee revenues off of the current client base.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","All right. Just a -- one follow-up, so more products I understand that, whether it's trading or more securities lending. You repriced off Broadway. I understand that. But I'm sorry, what was 29 out of 29?","Timothy F. Keaney","Yes, 29 out of 29 of our larger clients has their contracts come up for review Mike. We renegotiate higher fees.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","But I thought you said on a recent presentation that you don't have pricing power with strategic clients?","Timothy F. Keaney","Yes, Mike. Let me -- it's a good question. Our largest 100 clients, roughly 100 clients are super large, multi-product users of our services. That is much more about cross selling and share wallet and introducing some of the new things that Gerald mentioned. Collateral would be a great example, some of the things that Art's building into that client base. We have no pricing power with those names. But all the clients below those names, we have plenty of opportunity to up price.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","No, I'm sorry. I'm just reconciling the largest 100 clients where you don't have pricing power but you're looking to cross sell with 29 of 29 of your larger clients. Which larger clients are those if they're not 1 of the 100 largest?","Timothy F. Keaney","Yes, think of those clients as kind of 3 million and below.","Gerald L. Hassell","Mid-sized.","Timothy F. Keaney","Yes, mid-sized clients, and that's the best way I would describe it, Mike.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","All right. That's clear. But to what percentage of your revenues come from your largest strategic clients? Wouldn't that be, I'm just guessing, 2\/3?","Timothy F. Keaney","Yes, I don't have that stat handy. I would just say it's a very large percentage of our fees. Yes.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","So we're really talking about repricing for that last 1\/4 to 1\/3 and then cross selling for the other 2\/3 to 3\/4. Is that a fair characterization?","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes, more or less, Mike. That's right.","Operator","Next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So it seems like the operational excellence program continues to do a little bit better than expected for the last couple of quarters. You've had net benefit. So just wondering if you can give us an update on are you accelerating some of the saves. And at this point, how good do you feel about meeting, if not, even perhaps, beating the initiatives that you've laid out?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, I think there are a couple of things going on. We do feel pretty good about the timing. A couple of things have worked out, and some of the investments that we thought we would need to make are a little bit less than what we had first expected. In the fourth quarter, we are looking at continuing to invest in some actions that will generate ongoing benefits especially around the real estate side. So we wouldn't expect the bottom line to be as great as what we've seen in the past couple of quarters, Ken. That's why we're kind of guiding you to stay within the range that we had projected.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then if I can just ask a couple of just small, tiny questions, can you tell us what accretion was this quarter and also just what the magnitude of fee waivers was or the delta in fee waivers?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Sure. Accretion was down about $7 million or so, Ken, and that's about the quarterly run rate we would expect. In other words, it should continue to come down at about that level. So I think it was around $67 million or something -- $67 million thereabouts. And your second question was around fee waivers. The delta on fee waivers is very slightly improved. Now I'd already projected the trough 3 times previously, so I'm not going to project it again, but maybe we have gone through it.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then my last question is just regarding some of the fee income items were really strong this quarter, and I don't want to call them non-core, but maybe they might be -- but they look to be a little bit above trend. I just wanted to ask specifically on investment and other income and even on the fixed income trading took some comments you made earlier. How do we get an understanding of what kind of like good forward-looking run rates are in those areas? Or are they at a point where you're just starting to harvest more on both of those areas?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Okay. Sure. So why don't we start with the fixed income and other trading. We have been investing in that as Gerald had indicated, and I think we had given some indication in the past that we thought that line would be around $50 million. I think there's opportunity for that to be a bit higher than that on a go-forward basis. And I think we've demonstrated a little bit of that in this quarter. But there will be some volatility around that, as you would expect, Ken. In terms of the investment and other income, we had given, I think, guidance in the past that if you look through those -- and we give a lot of disclosure in the earnings review of those -- if you look through the portfolio of items there, we would expect about $80 million to $85 million in core, but it seems like we've been seeing -- we've been harvesting some things or getting some benefits. There were seed capital that can be a bit volatile, and we did crystalize some gains on our seed capital this quarter. But I would -- I'd still target around that level and understand that there can be $20 million or $30 million of upside or downside to it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Gerald, I wanted to dig in a little bit on the collateral management opportunity set that you indicated a little bit earlier in the call. You talked about it being a fee revenue generator. If you could speak to how you think about sizing that and generating that. And then the other question is whether or not there's any capital impact from the collateral transformation process that you're suggesting?","Gerald L. Hassell","Okay, great. The fee side of it is, it is all fee-based so that's the good news. We are seeing increasing opportunities. I think we have one in the metrics on our tables, our assets collateralized, tri-party collateral, continues to move up. And we are seeing progress there. The dialogue with our clients, particularly I'd say the buy side, has dramatically increased because they're realizing what they're facing in terms of having to post collateral to either today or in the future as the regulations get crystallized around all their various trading activities. And so the dialogues are quite productive. It's still early stages in terms of the fee revenues that we're seeing actually translate or show up in our own revenue stream. So -- but we are optimistic and hopeful that this will be a significant item in the future. The timing of it's a little bit unpredictable because the regulations are still being written, but the level of activity and dialogue is quite real, and we are spending the money now investing in the technology, which is absorbed in our running rate on expenses, to be able to capture that opportunity. So we feel good about the future here.","Thomas P. Gibbons","And Betsy, you'd ask about capital. And this is Todd, I'll take that. If you look at the various activities, they tend to be very well collateralized, I mean that, to us, wherever we act as a principal. So if it's securities finance or actual lending, we get collateralized with good securities at a reasonable margin. And on a risk-based -- a risk-weighted asset, they tend to be very, very low, so they can be easily absorbed into our balance sheet. It's a better allocation of our -- if it is coming onto our balance sheet, it's a better use of our deposit base than keeping it at the Fed or in cash in other banks.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And is there, as part of this also, people presenting to you potentially things like corporate bonds, let's say, and then your lending on securities to -- treasuries or GNEs [ph]?","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes. That is one of the potentials of \"asset transformation\", taking ineligible assets and creating them into eligible assets, and that's something that we are taking a look at. We think we have the expertise internally to be able to be able to value and look at that kind of collateral. And with proper margining with the proper counterparties, we think it's a good way to use our balance sheet and to support our clients. So yes, that is something we are looking at.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And that's in addition to the fee capture that you discussed earlier?","Gerald L. Hassell","That's correct. That's on top of the fees associated with collateral services. Tim, you had a comment?","Timothy F. Keaney","Yes. Betsy, it's Tim. Just one other point I'd add. The flip side to not being geared on the asset side, the custody side as much to the equity market as we'd like is the huge amount of treasuries that we have in assets under custody and the majority of our clients that are in our securities lending program. So we think one of the areas that will benefit greatly from this kind of vertically integrated unit that we put in place will directly benefit our clients because of the amount of AUC we have in treasuries.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with ISI Group.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Let's go back to the Asset Servicing question on the fee realization rates. Tim, maybe if you could just characterize the nature of the mandates that you've won in the $522 billion of wins this quarter. And then just, again, remind me of how much you have left to install into the fourth quarter. And are you bringing mandates in there that have somewhat of a lower fee capture that skews that rate? I know you did talk about the outsourcing wins that helped it, but just trying to get a sense of sort of that administered balance function relative to the revenue going forward.","Timothy F. Keaney","Sure. Thanks, Brian. Yes, we won $520 billion, which was a great quarter, a continuing trend now for several quarters. As its financial institutions, particularly fund managers, most of it was growing current client relationships as part of our strategy where we move up out on the value chain. And so we continue to see things like sub-accounting, where we converted $6.1 million sub-accounting fees -- sub-accounting accounts, which is not geared to AUC. We continue to win transfer agency and middle-office outsourcing, and we make sure that we get paid our minimum target margins. The challenge and this is showing up in the $740 billion we haven't converted yet, is it just takes a little longer to convert. It's a much more mechanical process. So we still have $740 billion to convert. I think Todd mentioned the stats. 50% will convert in the fourth quarter and then the remainder equally over Q1 and Q2 next year. So I don't want you to be overly concerned on the mix because, as we've said, we're not going to dig the hole any deeper for us by lowering our margins for these products. We're maintaining strict disciplines on minimal margins.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","It sounds like combined with the repricing that you mentioned earlier, I think you said up 20% for those 29 clients. Is that correct?","Timothy F. Keaney","That's up 22%, Brian.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","22%, yes. So combined with that, it sounds like on a go-forward basis as we move into 2013, given the mix of those wins, we should be thinking somewhat of a higher core asset servicing realization rate on that asset mix. Is that...","Timothy F. Keaney","Yes, I think that's right, Brian.","Gerald L. Hassell","And again, Brian, the metric that we keep focused on is that fee revenue to operating expenses. Our goal -- we're being very disciplined about getting our above that 100% mark on fees versus operating expenses, and that's the best metric to continue to focus on for us and that's in this space.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then, Todd, just on the balance sheet, you talked about, obviously, in this low rate environment, some potential NIM pressure going to 2013. Can you just talk about the -- your strategy on the securities portfolio in terms of what types of things you're investing in, I guess with particular attention to agency MBS. Obviously, deals there are pretty low right now. I mean 15-year yields are below 1%. Are you altering that strategy going forward? Or is that part of the NIM compression story?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Sure. In terms of the agency RMBS, I think QE3 has made certainly the fixed agency RMBS a much less attractive asset. So we actually did get ahead a bit on our allocation to agencies before QE3 came about, and that's worked pretty well for us. So I don't think you're going to see us buying a whole lot of fixed agency RMBS because of the yield declines post to the Fed's announcement. We will continue to purchase and we haven't completed our full allocations to munis. There are some corporates both in the U.S. and abroad that we're looking at, some floating rate asset-backed securities. We kind of like CLOs, covered bonds. And we are looking at agency floaters in the quarter. For example, we did buy some agency floaters.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Finally, just remind us of the portfolio duration.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Portfolio duration is -- it's under 2 years. It's probably about 1.75 right now.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just on the money market fee waivers, the cents per share that, that's impacting you?","Thomas P. Gibbons","It's still in the $0.05 or so per share, maybe $0.05 or $0.06 or $0.04. It moves a little bit, but it hasn't moved much. We've kind of gone to that level and haven't seen a whole lot of change. There was one quarter we saw it got a little bit better but not a lot.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just lastly on the foreign exchange trading. You had a very good quarter, the second quarter, up much more than peers. This quarter, you're down a little bit more than peers. Were there just something that caused that elevation in the quarter? Or is there a different explanation for that?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Well, in the third quarter, and we have started to give you a market disclosure, which shows the level of volatility in the market and volatility is the driver of our profitability, and there really is no volatility in the major currencies, and we probably attribute that to the central banks keeping everybody pretty much in line with their currency. So this is a direct impact of fewer volumes. There's less trading activity that took place in the third quarter. You can see that in the stock exchange metric. Even though that's not a direct correlation, it tends to be correlated. Much lower volatility and that's a direct reflection in our numbers. I don't know Gerald, you have anything to add?","Gerald L. Hassell","No, no. I think it's -- for this quarter, it was right in line or unfortunately, negatively in line with the volatility index. So I don't think, based on what we've seen so far, that our foreign exchange trading was any different than anyone else's, particularly associated with the volatility or lack thereof.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just on the mix between custody and negotiated FX.","Thomas P. Gibbons","It's actually quarter-to-quarter sequentially, essentially the same. The \"standing instruction\" remains about 9%. It was the same percentage as last quarter. It hasn't dipped down, so it's still a valuable product to our clients.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I want to follow up on the collateral management opportunity that you talked about. It's clearly big numbers. All of a sudden, the buy-side estimate came out with budget collateral, and we also talk about it. But when you look at the ultimate revenue opportunity, can you help us understand? I guess, like when you're sitting and negotiating the fees or the way you envision it to happen, clients are getting squeezed from a lot more things that they have to do, the cost of money. Do you think that's going to be a meaningful area for you to drive, I guess, incremental profitability, given the fact that it probably might be difficult to negotiate on meaningfully there?","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes, I think, it is because there's multiple levels to collateral services. There's the basic level of segregating the collateral, i.e. custody. There's transforming the collateral that we've talked about that Betsy asked the question on. There's optimizing the collateral within the day or over a period of time during which the collateral is being posted. Many of these things, particularly on the optimization side and the transformation side, actually can reduce the capital cost to both sides, both to dealer side and the buyer side. And when you reduce capital costs, there is ability to get some good revenues out of that. So don't think of it just in terms of a transaction, think of it in terms of how it improves the capital costs associated with the collateral being posted both on the buy side and the sell side.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it, helpful. And then, Todd, I was hoping you could run through issuer services just one more time. It feels like underneath the surface, seasonally strong quarter but I guess some things were a little bit slower than normal. Can you give us a sense, I guess, heading into the fourth quarter, what's a good run rate for that revenue bucket is?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Sure. Let me give a high level, and then I can ask Karen, who runs the business, to give a little more detail. It is seasonal. The third quarter tends to be a dividend and corporate action season for our business now. The delta from last year's second to third quarter to this year's second to third quarter was down quite a bit, so we did see the bump but not nearly to the extent that we saw last year. And we'd expect the delta from the third to the fourth quarter for our DR business to follow that. It will be down, but not to the same extent. So it's going to be falling but from a bit of a lower level. So the -- and Karen can give you some of the reasons. That's a super cyclical business, and it's becoming more and more of an emerging market equity business. In terms of Corporate Trust, we're just seeing a little faster runoff of old deals versus new deals that are coming on. And unless we see something -- some come back in the structured finance market, that's primarily what's driving that, we are seeing some decent action CLOs again. But unless we see some comeback in the rest of the structured finance market and non-agency mortgage market, we could see this trend for a number of quarters. So Karen, do you have anything to add to that?","Karen B. Peetz","Yes, I'll just a couple of different statistics to what Todd said. And as he emphasized, DRs are an emerging markets play. And so with equity prices being down outside the U.S., investment sentiment being down globally, mergers and acquisitions being down, some of the statistics are that our DR trading value went down 30% year-to-year. Capital raisings were down 63%, and the fees generated from corporate actions, which are obviously difficult to predict, were down almost 30%. IPOs, coming to market, were also down year-on-year. So overall, the net cancellations ended up exceeding issuance by a wide margin. We only had $145 million cancellations and then compared to net issuance of a $1.5 billion the prior year. The good news out of all of that sadness is that the pipeline is building, but it takes longer for these deals to come to market. And there are 45 new programs out in worldwide and 115 new unsponsored programs. So there is some hope that as we look to the future, there'll be additional issuance activity.","Thomas P. Gibbons","So Alex, this is typical of what we've seen in this business. It tends to be hyper-cyclical. So we just went through a cycle, looks like we're coming toward the end of a cycle. And hopefully, if we get through the fiscal cliff and some investor sentiment changes, we could see this change pretty quickly.","Gerald L. Hassell","I think it points to some comments that Curtis was making earlier. Just investors around the world are sitting on the sidelines waiting for some greater clarity both in the U.S. and abroad. And when some of that clarity starts to improve, I think this is the kind of business that you'll see snap back.","Karen B. Peetz","The only other thing that I would add is that the U.S. CLO market, as Todd said, has been heating up, which are projecting about $40 billion of new issuance this year. And we've won 35% of the deals in the market, with 25 new deals and mandates on 12 more. So we are hoping that, that activity will continue to forecast for 2013 is quite positive for CLOs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Thank you guys so much for this color, very helpful. Curtis, one for you. On asset management, things continue to perform quite well, and we're heading into, I guess, a performance fee quarter. So given the fact the markets have done well, it sounds like you guys have done well, can you give us a sense on either performance relative to benchmark or percentage of AUM that's kind of eligible for performance fees or something to help us understand how meaningful a performance fee quarter that could be for you guys?","Curtis Y. Arledge","Yes, absolutely. We are -- We obviously have a very big second quarter performance fees, and our fourth quarter, obviously, we'll have to wait and see how the end of the year plays out. But I'd tell you that right this minute we think that the fourth quarter is going to be pretty much in line with the fourth quarter of last year, plus or minus kind of based on how things stand today. Our performing -- our best performance has been good throughout the year and improving. And so that would be probably the best guidance I could give you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Luke Montgomery with Bernstein.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I'd like to come back to the NIM and the securities portfolio just for a sec. It looks like it's been holding in a bit better than we expected anyway. So would you mind commenting briefly on your outlook for reinvestment risk in 2013, and specifically how you position the securities portfolio? You mentioned a duration of under 2 years. Would you have big slugs of that portfolio coming due starting in 2013? And what's your assessment of contraction prepayment risk with QE3, et cetera?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes. A lot in that question. So I think the -- where we had guided a couple of quarters ago was that we can continue to actually increase the size of the portfolio with the amount of growth in deposits and excess cash that we've done. So as we saw some of the higher yielding assets come off, we could reinvest at a faster pace, and that was going to offset the impact of that. The -- we got another headwind when the ECB cut rates to 0 on excess reserves. So that's why it backed off a little bit from where we were 2 or 3 quarters ago. But the gist of it is, is we can -- we will reinvest more than just what is maturing so the portfolio will continue to grow. We also -- just as a reminder, the investment portfolio is only about -- it's a little more than about 40% of our interest-earning assets. So we are seeing some growth in our loan volumes both in wealth management, both of it related to our global collateral services where we're increasing our secured lending, and we're seeing a little bit in our core businesses as well. So 2\/3 of our NIM is generated by that. So it's not solely what's coming out of our portfolio. But we do think the maturities coming out of our portfolio will be a bit of a headwind on the NIM, all else being equal, and in the vicinity of 3 or 4 basis points.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Great. Appreciate that color. Can you also just remind us of any expected capital impact under new regulations, related specifically to securities lending indemnifications that you extended to clients? And has there been any progress on those discussions with regulators? Is it a big deal for you? And is it already incorporated into your pro forma capital calculations?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, at this point, I think, it's too early to say. That's still under development. There are conversations, but we're not really in a position to make a definitive statement, a statement one way or the other, Luke.","Operator","Our next question comes from Howard Chen with Credit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just on the latest Basel III guidance of the 9.3%, I mean you're effectively 2 years ahead of where you wanted to be at the fourth quarter of 2014. So it would seems to me you can kind of ramp up capital return. Do you agree with that? And are there any offsets we should be thinking about in that equation?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Well, we are just heading into CCAR season right now, and we're taking a hard look as we'll go through our stress testing. And I think that given the strength of our -- the left-hand side of the balance sheet and we're ahead of where we had anticipated to be in terms of Basel III compliance, we will definitely take a hard look at this and see what the appropriate deployment is, whether it's going to be the same or more.","Gerald L. Hassell","Howard, just a quick comment. We think being ahead of schedule and given the capital that we're generating every single quarter gives us enormous flexibility as we go into, as Todd said, CCAR season. And we'll go through this process and see where we can come out.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And then just in terms of deployment, I mean, how are you thinking about maybe keeping or changing the mix of share repurchase versus dividends, keeping some dry powder for strategic acquisitions and obviously, organic reinvestment?","Gerald L. Hassell","Well, let's start with the last part of the question. We are not interested. It's not on the table in terms of acquisitions because we think the organic growth opportunities internally are so evident, both on the revenue side as well as investing and retiring platforms, investing in some of those operational initiatives, so the capital that we're generating in that regard is really dedicated to the great organic growth ideas that we've identified internally and to support our clients as they face this marketplace. The balance between dividends and share buybacks is always an interesting intellectual debate, as well as a financial debate. We think the answer is yes in terms of there should be a good balance between dividend growth and share buybacks. And Todd, you may want to add to it.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Well, we do talk to our investors and they help to inform of what that mix might be. And I think as we look out at the stress testing, there is sensitivity to percentage of the dividends relative to buybacks that we need to be aware of as well. But we will certainly look -- when we think of our capital deployment, we'll look at all of that here in the fourth quarter.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. Looking forward to the update. And then shifting gears. I was hoping you could update us industry tri-party repo reform. What should we be anticipating on the horizon? And do you see this ultimately impacting any changes that would flow through either kind of your expense base or capital position due to kind of potential reforms?","Gerald L. Hassell","The quick answer is all of the investment and tri-party reform is in our run rate today. We are improving the technologies to address the issues that came out of the tri-party reform task force, and that's effectively to eliminate the intra-day credit that's being provided at the marketplace today. That requires a variety of technology improvements, as well as some change in behaviors on behalf of the investors and the dealers. That's progressing well, any of the expenses associated with that reform are in our run rate today. There are investments, as I said, that we are making on the technology side. I think we're making good progress, and there's still a lot more work to do. But we're making very good progress in meeting what the market is looking for.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, Gerald. And then just finally for me, on the expanded trading capabilities, we can certainly see some early traction again this quarter. But just could you, from a high level, talk about what you hope this to be, what's the opportunity set? I mean how should we think about hiring expectations over the next year to sort of great view on success over kind of the next coming years on this?","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes, the bulk of the investments are really on the technology platforms, again. We've described it in the past. Foreign exchange is going the route of the equity markets, where it's more electronic, it's higher speed, streaming prices to clients on a consistent basis, giving them greater optionality in terms of how they execute with us. We want to do the same thing with our fixed income securities area. We think we're a great counterparty in terms of derivatives, and we have a strong balance sheet and a great rating. And so you've seen some pickup in our activity there. We're not looking to do exotics. We're looking to do pretty plain vanilla and straight-up, customer-driven, client-driven activity. Our clients are the natural users of these things as investment managers. We see the transactions going through us on the servicing side. We want to just capture more of that flow and service our clients incredibly well. So I think the -- there'll be perhaps a little more volatility in the number, but I think the trend will be upwards. Art, do you want to add something to it?","Arthur Certosimo","Okay, Gerald. Thank you. Yes, we have invested -- clearly, the bulk of the investment is in the technology area. We have also invested in some personnel that have enhanced our rates business. But we're kind of a natural here, as Gerald has said, between high levels of service, strong counterparty, throw in there efficient settlement, where we're uniquely positioned to do something like that as well. It's just a nice service enhancement for us for not only our asset services clients, but our Corporate Trust clients, our DR clients, our treasury services clients. We have this wonderful broad client base that we can sell these services into. It just makes a lot sense for us.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And just maybe to follow up on this. I don't know how much you want to share, how much work you've done, but I mean, if we look at just the top kind of 13, 15 global dealers, maybe the fixed income revenue pool as they define it is maybe, let's say, it's like $100 billion. When you look at the opportunity set from all that you want to do, healthy counterparty, not take risk, I mean what do you see as sort of the definable market opportunity here?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, I think, as far as the areas of growth, we'll see growth in the capital markets services space across rates for sure. Interest rate swaps is a great business for us, particularly on execution. And then, we're not going to leave out foreign exchange. I mean foreign exchange is still a very important business for us, and we simply need to be a more competitive through technology resources. In addition, I'd left out the purchasing network, which our purchasing client base is a marquee client base that we can also sell these services into. So we're really looking at growth across, I'd say, the rates business, particularly on fixed income and foreign exchange as well.","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes. Just in general, Howard, the size of the pie is very, very large, and we're only getting a small fraction of it. So we can just take relatively incremental pickup in some of that activity that we're already the natural party that's servicing those transactions. So we just want to just capture more of the flow internally.","Operator","Our final question then comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Can you guys share with us -- you're way ahead of schedule on Basel III Tier 1 common ratio, where you are today versus where you thought you're going to be. Can you tell us the factors that contributed to that success of getting there sooner?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Sure, Gerard. There are a number of items. We're, first of all, retaining income. We are watching our intangible amortization burn-off, which goes into the capital account effectively. We have benefited under Basel III, the other comprehensive income or the changes in the available for sale portfolio runs through the capital accounts, so that has improved probably $1 billion pretax, a little -- probably about $500 million or $600 million after tax in the quarter. So it's the combination of income, the combination of OCI. And also, the original BIS guidelines were strictly driven by ratings, and as they've been adjusted, we also got a benefit on some of the sub-investment grade securities that weren't quite as capital attractive as they otherwise would have been. So it's the combination of those 3 items, and that was a very significant one I might add. So those 3 items have put us well in advance.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then the last question is coming back to the commentary you made about the pricing with your top 100 clients and how it's -- you have limited pricing power there. Are you guys seeing in that group -- and I know you're going to grow the revenues through more cross-selling for that group of clients, but are you seeing actually more pressure on pricing because of the environment that you're customers are in? Or is it now just a steady pressure that really hasn't intensified in the last 12 months.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, Gerard. Before we -- and I'll look to Tim to answer that question. I mean, I'd like just to remind you, we're talking about the Asset Servicing business, which is about 25% to 30% of our total revenues. We're not talking about investment management. We're not talking about issuer services or treasury services or all of our other businesses. So we're really focused on a relatively important, but only 25% to 30% of our business. Tim, do you want to add anything to that?","Timothy F. Keaney","Yes. Gerard, I would say just generally, I've seen a little bit of a tapping down of repricing. Clearly, the fund management sector and insurance sector, which are driving a lot of our business, are under pricing pressure, but that's why we stay really focused on quality service. And I think that's why we've seen a bit of a damping down. But the coverage model that we put on these names, which I really didn't talk about yet, we have a whole business dedicated to those top 125 names with a high-touch service model, and it's already pulling through. I mean half of the new business we won on the quarter directly relates to 2 big clients that we've been focusing on. So we don't have the ability to raise prices. We've seen a little bit of a dampening down over the last year or so on negative reprices. But it is really much more long-term by cross-selling and delivering the new things that Art is building in collateral into those clients.","Gerald L. Hassell","Thanks, Gerard.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Andy Clark. Mr. Clark, you may begin.","Andy Clark","Thanks, Wendy, and welcome, everyone. With us today are Gerald Hassell, our CEO; Todd Gibbons, our CFO, as well as several members of our executive management team.","Before we begin, let me remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement on Page 14 of the press release and those identified in our documents filed with the SEC that are available on our website, bnymellon.com.","Forward-looking statements in this call speak only as of today, July 18, 2012, and we will not update forward-looking statements. Our press release and earnings review are available on our website, and we will be using the earnings review to discuss our results.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Gerald. Gerald?","Gerald L. Hassell","Thanks, Andy, and good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us. As you saw from our release, the second quarter, we generated net income of $466 million and earnings per share of $0.39. Now, of course, this includes our previously announced litigation charge of $0.18 per share. After netting out a few items, we look at our core earnings at about $0.53 per share, and Todd will walk you through how we get there. Now that compares to $0.59 in the second quarter of last year and $0.52 per share in the first quarter of this year.","We achieved another quarter of positive growth in Investment Management and Investment Services fees, a clear sign of the strength of our business model. The impact of new business helped drive our fee growth. In Investment Management, we had $26 billion in long-term inflows. Now that's the 11th consecutive quarter of positive long-term flows in our Investment Management segment. And we also are pleased to report that during the quarter, the pensions and investment publication published an annual survey that ranked us #1 for providing liability-driven solutions to our Insight boutique.","In Asset Servicing, that new business helped drive assets under custody, a record level of more than $27 trillion. Also, like asset management, the quality of our Asset Servicing capabilities continues to be recognized by third parties and is clearly helping us win business. During the quarter, we received 17 #1 category rankings among our peer group of the world's largest global custodians in the Global Investor survey publication. That follows top rankings last quarter among peers in the 2 other major surveys. So we grew fees during the quarter in both major business segments when key equity indices were actually down, and there was lower volatility in the currency markets.","Turning to the expense front. On an operating basis, total expenses were up 1% sequentially after adjusting for M&I litigation and restructuring charges. And we're actually down 1% year-over-year. We're continuing to make good progress on our operational excellence initiatives.","In addition, during the quarter, we announced 2 leadership appointments that are intended to further develop those efforts. We've promoted Suresh Kumar, the role of Chief Information Officer. Suresh is very skilled at driving efficiency, creating innovative client-centric solutions and simplifying our IT structure. Just as information, he spent much of his career as the CIO of Pershing. And of course, Pershing has some of the leading technology in that space.","We also created the role of the Chief Operations Officer, which we filled with a gentleman named Ed Watson, who we brought in from the outside. And Ed has vast experience in the financial services industry. He'll help lead the effort to rationalize and optimize our core operations across the company. And it's good that Ed's going to bring a fresh eye from the outside.","In terms of capital, we ended the quarter with our estimated Basel III Tier 1 common, up over 100 basis points at 8.7%, reflecting the impact of the new notices of proposed rulemaking as well as our positive performance and our slightly larger balance sheet. We generated $527 million of growth Basel I Tier 1 common. And we delivered a 15.7% return on tangible common equity, even after the litigation charge. And we also purchased more than 12 million shares during the quarter. Our strengthened capital position provides us greater flexibility for ongoing investment while continuing to return capital to our shareholders.","Now also during the quarter, we made some significant progress in aligning our businesses to further leverage the breadth of our capabilities. We formed a new unit, called global Collateral Services, which will help us better serve the rapidly growing market for collateral management. Now this is an area we're quite excited about as the need to post, segregate and optimize collaterals across all market participants continues to grow. And we are extremely well positioned to serve all of them, help them manage their risk and reduce their capital costs. And we also made some meaningful progress in navigating the litigation environment by putting some major litigation behind us with no significant impact to our capital.","In summary, we're growing fees in our core businesses, continuing to strengthen our balance sheet and making progress in those areas that our investors are focused on, including investing in new areas to generate organic growth and, of course, being very disciplined in managing our expense base.","With that, let me turn it over to Todd to take you through the numbers.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Thanks, Gerald and good morning, everyone. My comments will follow the quarterly earnings review beginning on Page 2. Reported earnings per share, $0.39. This includes the $0.18 for the litigation charge that we announced last week. It also includes a total benefit of approximately $0.04 related to securities gains. We had a slightly lower tax rate, and we also had a negative loan loss provision for the quarter.  The way we look at our core earnings, therefore, it nets to about $0.53 for the quarter.","On a sequential basis, total revenue is $3.6 billion. That's down 1%, while fee and other revenue was unchanged. Investment Services fees, Investment Management and performance fees and FX were all up. They were offset by declines in NIR and investment and other income. If you exclude the volatile category of investment and other income, our core fees were up 3% for the quarter. And we're continuing to hold the line on core expenses.","Now, let's turn to Page 4, where we'll call out some of the business metrics that help explain our underlying performance. On Page 4, you can see that our assets under management of $1.3 trillion was down slightly sequentially. And that reflects the lower equity market values that we saw on the second quarter. Those lower market values were offset partially by inflows, and they're up 2% year-over-year as asset inflows were offset also by lower equity market values. We had long-term inflows for the quarter of $26 billion, and it benefited from the strength on our fixed income and equity index product. It was our 11th consecutive quarter of positive long-term inflows.","Assets under custody and administration was up 2% sequentially to a new record of $27.1 trillion, driven by net new business, but also offset by slightly lower equity market values. Assets under custody's up 3% on a year-over-year basis.","A number of our other key metrics showed growth on a year-over-year basis. Loans and deposits are up significantly. DR programs are up slightly, and collateral management balances grew nicely, a trend we are well positioned to further leverage with our recently formed Global Collateral Services group. Now except for those that are volume related, all of our clearing metrics also improved sequentially.","Moving onto fees on Page 6. Asset Servicing fees were up 1% sequentially as the impact of net new business and seasonally higher securities lending revenues was partially offset by lower equity market values. Asset Servicing fees were down 2% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower equity market values and securities lending revenue, partially offset by new business.","We had $314 billion in new AUC wins. Over the last 12 months, new AUC wins have now totaled nearly $1.3 trillion, and there's still about $400 billion scheduled to be converted between now and year end.","Issuer Services fees, and we're excluding the Shareowner Services business that we sold last year, were up 10% sequentially and down 12% year-over-year. The sequential increase resulted from higher DR revenue. The year-over-year decrease resulted from lower DR revenue as well as lower money market-related fees and lower trust fees related to the weakness in the structured products in Corporate Trust.","Clearing fees were up 2% sequentially and up 6% year-over-year. The sequential increase was primarily due to higher mutual fund fees, and that's partially offset by the impact of lower DARTS volumes. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher mutual fund fees, partially offset by the impact of lower DARTS volume and higher money market fee waivers.","Turning to investment management fees, where we performed very well, especially considering the weakness in the equity markets. As a reminder, roughly 50% of our Investment Management fees are correlated to global equity markets.","Investment Management and performance fees were up 7% sequentially and up 2% year-over-year. Both increases reflect higher performance fees. If you exclude the performance fees, the underlying investment management fees were up 2% sequentially and down 2% year-over-year. Sequentially, the increase is due to net new business and higher money market fees, which were partially offset by lower equity market values. The year-over-year decrease was due to lower equity market values, offset somewhat by net new business.","In FX and other trading, revenue was down sequentially. It was down 6% sequentially, and it was down 19% year-over-year. If you look at the underlying components, your FX revenue totaled $157 million. That's up 15% sequentially but down 15% year-over-year. The sequential increase resulted from higher volumes, while the year-over-year decrease reflects significantly lower volatility.","Other trading revenue was $23 million compared to $55 million in the first quarter and $38 million in the year ago quarter. Both decreases were driven by lower fixed-income trading reflective of market conditions in the second quarter.","You will note that we have provided a new table on our earnings review that details investment and other income. As you can see, the line item has a fair amount of variability. Investment and other income totaled $48 million in the quarter compared with $139 million in the prior quarter and $145 million in the year ago quarter. Sequentially, the decline resulted from lower leasing gains, seed capital gains and equity investment income. The year-over-year decrease primarily resulted from lower asset-related gains and lower equity investment income. As we've indicated in the past, we expect investment and other income to be volatile but to average approximately $80 million to $100 million per quarter.","Turning to Page 8 of the earnings review. NIR was down $29 million sequentially and up $10 million versus the first quarter, and that's on a tax-equivalent basis. NIR in the quarter was adversely impacted by narrower spreads and lower accretion. Frankly, it's a little lower than we've anticipated as it has taken us longer than expected to put our deposits to work in securities and secured loans.","The year-over-year increase in net interest revenue was primarily driven by higher average client deposits, increased investment and high-quality investment securities and higher loan levels, offset partially by narrower spreads and lower accretion. The net interest margin was 125 compared to 132 in the first quarter and 141 in the year ago quarter. The sequential decrease reflects narrower spreads and lower accretion. The year-over-year decrease was driven primarily by the significant increase in client deposits, which were invested in lower-yielding assets reflecting current market environment.","If you turn to Page 9, you can see that total noninterest expense, excluding the intangible -- amortization of intangible assets, M&I litigation and restructuring charges, were up slightly sequentially. And that's primarily reflecting the cost of certain tax credits, higher business development expenses as well as the deposit levy imposed on our Belgian bank subsidiary. All of that was mostly offset by lower staff expenses. Despite the headwinds I just mentioned, expenses were down 1% year-over-year on an operating basis, reflecting the impact of our operational excellence initiatives.","On Page 10, we've broken out the progress we've made on those initiatives since the program began in the fourth quarter of 2011. On a gross basis, our benefits have resulted in $95 million -- $94 million in quarterly run rate savings, and we have had incremental program cost totaling $23 million for net savings in the quarter of $71 million. The bulk of the savings, $55 million, was related to integrating and consolidating our business operations and also leveraging our global delivery centers.","On the technology front, we've started the process of simplifying our infrastructure and eliminating a number of servers as well as rationalizing applications and actually insourcing software engineers. Within corporate services, we've achieved benefits from consolidating some real estate, and we've begun to see the benefit of our enhanced procurement function.","Looking forward, program costs will remain elevated in the third quarter, but we remain on track to achieve our target savings by the end of 2012.","On Page 11, we have details on our capital ratios. Our estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio is 8.7% at quarter end. That reflects the impact of the final Basel 2.5 regulations as well as the recently released rules by the Fed on the U.S. interpretation of Basel.","As we noted in an earlier press release, our ratio benefited from a reduction of risk-weighted assets related to the treatment of sub-investment-grade securities, and that was partially offset by the treatment of investment-grade securitizations and the methodology for accounting correlation amongst financial institutions' exposures. As well, we saw some meaningful balance sheet growth in the second quarter that did add to our risk-weighted assets.","The table on Page 12 provides a reconciliation of our Basel III ratios. The ratio for the first quarter of 2012 and second quarter of 2011 were calculated using the prior BIS guidance.","Turning to Page 13, you can see that our investment securities portfolio continues to perform quite well. The pretax net unrealized gain in our securities portfolio increased by $258 million to $1.4 billion, and the percentage of sub-investment-grade declined from 5% to 4% of the portfolio.","Moving on to our loan book on Page 14. You'll see that the provision for credit losses was a credit of $19 million.  That compares with a charge of $5 million in the first quarter and a 0 provision in the year ago quarter. This credit primarily resulted from the decline in the expected loss from a broker-dealer client that had previously filed for bankruptcy as well as improvements in the mortgage portfolio. NPAs declined from $331 million to $294 million.","The effective tax rate was 15.8%. That was largely driven by the reduction in the tax rate due to the litigation charge of approximately 9%. The operating tax rate was an estimated 26.1%, which is somewhat lower than a range of 27% to 28%, and that's due to an increased benefit from certain tax credits. This also compares with 26.9% in the year ago quarter.","Now, a few points to consider in your thinking about this third quarter. Third quarter earnings have traditionally been impacted by a seasonal slowdown in transaction volumes, as well as capital market-related revenues, particularly securities lending and foreign exchange. We should see a seasonal increase in DRs, as that tends to be the dividend season now. In terms of NII, we think we can maintain the second quarter run rate even with the recently announced EC move -- ECB move to 0 rates. The quarterly provision should be in the range of $0 million to $15 million, and our merit increase was effective on July 1.","Now, we continue to remain focused on driving expense savings in the operational excellence initiatives. The tax rate in the third quarter of '12 --  of 2012 should be approximately 27% to 28%. And finally, we expect to continue to execute on our share repurchase program.","Beyond that, as Gerald mentioned, the establishment of our global collateral services unit has positioned the company to capture greater collateral management, collateral transformation and collateral finance revenues going forward.","With that, let me turn it back to Gerald.","Gerald L. Hassell","Great. Thanks, Todd. And I think we're ready to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Glenn Schorr with Nomura.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I'm curious if you could expand a little bit on the big increase in deposits, where it came from, what kind of clients were they, where you're putting the assets right now?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes. Most of the deposit in increase, Glenn, was a spike right in the end of the quarter. So it's going to be relatively temporary. If you look at, for the quarter on average, it was only up about $3 billion.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Got it. But -- so you mentioned it spiked at the end of the quarter, but temporary just client parking money, not putting money to work. So I'm assuming you're keeping -- parking that at the Fed?","Thomas P. Gibbons","That's right. That's going to be in and out over maybe a 4-week period.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Got it, got it. On the NIM side, if you look at through the detail in the average balance sheet, it's kind of simple that asset yields coming down at the deposits, primarily foreign deposits. And it seems like you have less room on the liability side. Is that basically where we're at now? And you mentioned you think you can defend these levels even with the ECB cut, but is there any chance to move the deposits over maybe with the Fed and pick up a little bit?","Thomas P. Gibbons","It would be a wonderful thing if you could actually, Glenn, swap the deposits, swap euros into dollars and leave them at the Fed, but the swap would go against you negatively It actually would create a negative interest rate. So at this time, not much of a change there.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And so with no change, is this the type of quarterly progression we're looking at, or was that like a onetime step-down, and now we can hold these levels even if rates don't move?","Thomas P. Gibbons","I think we can hold these levels. We do have some headwinds here, because we do tend to leave some money at the European Central Banks. And that was -- in the past, we received a little bit of an interest rate. We won't see that going forward for the foreseeable future, but we are continuing to put more money to work, primarily in dollars, where we are continuing to find some pretty attractive low-risk assets. And I think that will offset the 2 headwinds, if you will.","Gerald L. Hassell","Glenn, I also want to emphasize as we're doing this, Todd made some comment in his opening commentary that we've been a little bit slower in putting some of the money to work, because frankly, we've been quite conservative in putting the money to work because we to want to stay within our risk appetite. We're not looking to go out of the bounds of our risk parameters, and we just don't think it's prudent to do so in this kind of environment.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Last one is just maybe a little more color on the huge flows that you keep seeing. What products are these? What's the average fee relative to the current book of business? Anything you could help there would be great.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Glenn, you're referring to asset management?","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Correct.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Let me turn that one over to Curtis.","Curtis Y. Arledge","Glenn, in the first quarter, we actually -- even assuming that [ph] long-term flows of $7 billion. And in this past quarter, it was $26 billion. I actually thought the composition was pretty different. As you know, the markets were a little bit better in the first quarter. Equity markets were up, and we saw higher average fee products in the first quarter. In the second quarter, it did revert back to more fixed-income, more index products. So we frequently talk about our business in terms of assets under management. From a revenue perspective, though, they're actually pretty similar quarters.  The $26 billion would have been in lower average fee products.  And we do see in our pipeline, I will tell you that our pipelines generally are more favorable. The mix is toward higher fee products. So actually, our one not-funded mandates have a slightly higher average fee going forward at the end of the second quarter than they did at the end of the first quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Howard Chen with Credit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Todd, just putting frictional deposits aside, can you just provide an update on some of the taxable actions to stabilize and expand the NIM that you laid out the Investor Day? And do your thoughts change at all now that we're seeing some further compression across the yield curve and the long end?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Sure. Not a whole lot. I mean, what we indicated to you is that we would invest in some RMBS securities, primarily agencies, but there are some non-agencies to note as well. Some asset-backed securities, which we continue. We're probably doing a little more treasuries than we would have thought, just given the rate environment and the risk environment. So I'd say it was a combination of the 3 of those. Outside of the securities portfolio, we have begun a program of secured lending globally. That is slower than we had anticipated, but it is slowly building, and we're continuing to add to that. We also see some opportunities, for example, in trade finance as you had a number of folks exit. That has grown. We got a big pop a while back. It's growing a little more modestly, but that's another area that we'd be looking to push.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great, thanks. And then shifting gears to the revised Basel III guidance, there seems to be a lot of questions in the market. And I think it'd be helpful if you could just walk through some of the moving parts of the new guidance, maybe walk through what your risk rating assumptions were before and what they are now in some of the various parts of the portfolio that are being impacted?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Okay. I mean, we're kind of unusual, as you know, Howard, because we had maintained a large portfolio of sub-investment-grade securitizations. And that was the portfolio even though we had marked it to market, and we felt it was actually a pretty attractive and not nearly as risky asset, especially where we were carrying it. It actually required more than 100% capital against it. So under the revised guidance and what is known as the simplified supervisory formula approach, which I can tell you is anything but simplified, but under that guidance, the capital associated with those sub-investment-grade securities declined pretty significantly.  Still very high, but to a much more reasonable level. So as we had indicated in the past, that was probably costing us 250, maybe even 300 basis points against our Tier 1 common ratio. That probably declined to about 200 basis points, so -- excuse me, by 200 basis points. So we picked up a very large benefit there, about 2\/3 of the -- about a 2\/3 reduction. That was offset by a couple of other items. Number 1 is the investment-grade securitizations moved from a floor of about 7% to a floor of 20%, and, depending on the attachment point, the detachment point and the delinquencies in the underlying securities, they can be higher or even higher than the 20%. So that was a give-back of some of that 200 basis points that I just described. And in addition, there is a correlation multiplier for primarily financial institutions exposure. Since we do have financial institutions exposure, that had a negative impact to us, as did the smaller one, but as did the market risk assessment that came in the quarter as well. So all of those amounted to about 145 basis points of benefit. And then our balance sheet grew in the second quarter by about 35 basis points, hence the requirement, hence the 110 basis points that we reported.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Thanks for all the detail, that is helpful.  And you've always stressed the point that the past few stress tests have been predominantly Basel I focused. But I'm just curious, given this improved guidance post the NPRs, how does this change your capital return philosophy when you think about resubmitting the CCAR for more capital return this year?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes. As we're nicely positioned under Basel III.  As you can see here, we're well ahead of where even we had anticipated we would be. I think we think it's reasonable, because frankly, we didn't think that the sub-investment grade security should have attracted the amount of capital that they had. So basically, it's in line with what our thinking was. So we're happy to see that there -- that we had greater flexibility, and we're happy to see that others in the past have been able to take capital actions at significant levels.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then just final quick numbers one for me, Todd. That merit increase that began in July 1 that you spoke to, is there any way to kind of size the impact of that?","Thomas P. Gibbons","It will probably be about a $0.01 of expense.","Operator","Our next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Two questions. One on the performance fees, very strong performance fees in the quarter. Could you just give us some color on that, given that the markets wouldn't have suggested that strong of an outcome?","Thomas P. Gibbons","So our performance fees, we have a wide variety of mandates that generate performance fees. And the bulk of them are recorded and paid in the fourth quarter. So our fourth quarter is generally our highest quarter for performance fees. If you go back over the last 4 years, we've had an average performance fee of about $100 million on average annually, and roughly 60% of that would have occurred in the fourth quarter. So that seasonality we would generally expect. To your point, we had a very strong second quarter. We do have a number of mandates that pay annually, but the beginning date might be February, so February to February or June to June. We also do have mandates that pay more frequently than annually, so we might value performance fees semiannually. So the second quarter has been the second-highest quarter typically. And this particular quarter, the performance fees that we earned are indexed to a variety of benchmarks.  So it might be the clients' portfolio benchmark, it could be the S&P 500, an index, or it could be a nominal benchmark like both a yield -- a targeted return of 8%. In this particular quarter, we had actually nice breadth across our investment firms. Three of our investment firms actually have pretty meaningful performance fees because they beat a benchmark. Again, I think a lot of people associate performance fees with just, as the market goes up a lot, you'll have a lot more performance fees. And there is some correlation to that. But a lot of our performance fees are actually geared more to whether we beat a benchmark, so in a down market, if we had been underweight risk or underweight the right factors or if we had been positioned in a way that we can outperform a benchmark, then we have the opportunity to earn performance fees in the second quarter, that turned out to be pretty positive. I do think that it's important to note, we still think the seasonality that has existed in the past is what you should expect going forward. And so if on average, we've earned $100 million annually on performance fees, so far year to date, we've earned about $64 million. So we might have a better year. But the seasonality, we still expect the third quarter to be generally lower and the fourth quarter to be generally higher.","Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. So 2 takeaways. One is that the performance fees are reflecting the second quarter performance.  There's no kind of lagging from what happened in the first quarter?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, there are a lot of things going on in -- so many mandates contribute to the overall performance fee. I would tell you that what drove the strength of it is mandates that outperformed in the second quarter, but they are mandates that have been around for a long period of time. So there -- it could have been a June to June measurement period. In the second quarter, we had the payment of those performance fees.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it, okay. And it's more equity or FIC or...","Thomas P. Gibbons","It's -- again, it's mixed. I would say that our fixed income mandates generated a large share of the performance fees this quarter.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just secondly, for Todd, on the operational excellence initiatives update that you gave us, it feels like you're a little bit farther along than what your targeted plan is. Are you -- does this suggest that you're going to be either extending the amount of dollars you anticipate you'll be getting back from the program? Does it suggest that you'll just be getting there sooner?","Thomas P. Gibbons","We knew, Betsy, and we try to make this evident in the first quarter, we knew that a lot of the benefit we were going to get for the initial actions that we took was going to be in the first quarter. And we've got that run rate. So you can see, we invested in the second quarter about as much as we benefited. And we would expect that to be the case for most of the rest of this year. I think we can beat it. I think we might be able to beat the target that we've established here. But we are going to making some additional investments, and we want to make sure that that's understood.  So not a huge amount of additional benefit in 2012. I think you'll start to see it in 2013, the investments that we're making in the second half of this year.","Gerald L. Hassell","Just to add, Betsy, though, just as on a business-as-usual basis, given the slower revenue environment that we're all facing. We're being incredibly disciplined around the core expense base as well, and we're really trying to manage those very, very tightly in addition to the initiatives that we have in place. So we're being very, very mindful of all of our expenses across the board.","Thomas P. Gibbons","But the way we designed it, the cost to decommission systems, the cost to consolidate real estate is embedded in the benefit.","Operator","Our next question is from Cynthia Mayer with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You mentioned that clearing services fees were higher despite lower transaction volumes, and I think you mentioned higher mutual fund fees. So I'm wondering if you could give some color on why those are trending higher? Is that a mix shift or a change in the actual fees somehow charged on the funds?","Brian T. Shea","This is Brian Shea. Just mutual fund assets are growing modestly, driven by asset values, but we continue to have more individual investments in mutual fund positions on the platform. And one of the things we're doing is we're seeing growth in the mutual fund no-transaction-fee platform that we have. And we're also in the process of converting our mutual fund processing to an internal sub-accounting system called Surpass [ph], which is a service delivered by the Asset Servicing group within BNY Mellon. So essentially what we're doing is we're making the mutual fund processing more operationally efficient, and that's part of the driver behind the mutual fund revenue growth.","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes, and I would also add, Cynthia, that's it's -- and Brian is being a bit modest in the sense that we are getting a lot more accounts on the platform to begin with. Some of the clients that are there today are being more successful in gathering assets, and we're being more successful in gathering clients. And so I think it's just a reflection of the strength of the platform overall and that we're not being heavily reliant on some of the traditional fee categories for us to be able to show improvement in clearing services.","Brian T. Shea","Exactly. I guess we're still seeing underlying growth in the base of individual investments and individual security positions and custody. And that's helping drive strong core fee revenue growth.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just on the record AUC levels and the 314 in wins, granted, I'm sure there's a lot of variety there. But can you give any color on sort of the composition of the wins recently? Any shift there? Are the fees any different from your existing book?","Timothy F. Keaney","Cynthia, it's Tim Keaney. I would say, yes, we continue to see continued growth in outsourcing and transfer agency, part of what Brian just referenced. We see a lot of activity from financial institutions that also drove a big uptick in our sales pipeline, which is up 50% quarter-on-quarter. So I'd say you'd see about 40% to 50% kind of outsourcing and transfer agency, which really isn't geared towards AUC. And the rest are good stock and trade core asset servicing business. And I wouldn't say there's an overall change in pricing. I would say we've seen a tap down on repricing as we've continued to maintain strong pricing disciplines. But new business, I wouldn't say I've seen a material change in pricing.","Operator","Our next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to go back to the balance sheet just one second. Can you help us break down the balances that you guys have with central banks, between the Fed, ECB and maybe some other ones, just to kind of better get a sensitivity if there are, in fact, more moves by other central banks.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, Alex, those -- we don't disclose which central bank there -- any balances might be sitting, where they might be sitting. And they're so volatile, I don't think it would be particularly helpful to get a snapshot.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then within, I guess, Todd, you mentioned discount accretion was a little bit lower for this quarter. I was hoping you could give us the number, what that was this quarter versus last quarter?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, it's probably down about $6 million or $7 million, Alex, on a quarter. And I would expect that it will slowly amortize down. You can probably look at it about $5 million-a-quarter reduction.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just maybe hoping to spend a couple of minutes on the update on litigation. So obviously, the Sigma settlement that you guys announced a few weeks ago, I guess there's a few other lawsuits outstanding with the similar issues, so I was just wondering how that might change your views around reserves or future litigation expense on that front.  And I guess the second one is around foreign tax credits and the impact of the recent settlement, I guess, from a similar lawsuit, if you, I guess about 1.5 months ago and how, again, how that impacts your view on litigation reserves for that loss.","Thomas P. Gibbons","So I didn't -- the first question was related to the...","Gerald L. Hassell","The Sigma settlement.  Why don't I take that one, and then you can talk about the tax matter one. The charge that we took a couple of weeks ago was principally related to the class action suit that was raised, so $280 million, and it's subject to court approval, but principally related to that single-class action suit. There are similar clients, who had similar issues who were not in that class action that we also incorporated into the charge. So we feel like we have the vast majority of the financial crisis Sigma-related litigation charges embedded in that single number.","Thomas P. Gibbons","And as regards the tax matter that you raised, Alex, there was a recent court decision, there was a possibility that could have influenced our thinking around the reserves. But it was the -- the decision was not based on the -- on our case, which was economic substance. So it really did not inform our case at all at this point. We have tried the case, and we're looking forward to, I think, we -- our team did a very nice job. And we're looking forward to a judgment probably sometime in the spring of next year.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And Todd, just the last one for me. In the Issuer Services this quarter, I think you guys had a bit of a seasonal benefit as well, obviously smaller than you have in the third quarter. Can you give us a sense what the benefit, I guess, was this quarter and how we should think about the seasonal benefit within Issuer Services for the third quarter?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, that was referring, specifically -- in the Issuer Services business, we really had 3 business. We had Shareowner Services, we had Corporate Trust and we had DRs. And we share -- we sold our Shareowner Services at year end, so we try to show you with the -- with and without the performance of -- or the historical performance of Shareowner Services. And as regards to the DR business, I'll turn it over to Karen.","Karen B. Peetz","Sure yes. The DR business has a lot of impact from the emerging markets activity, so when that turns down, so does the activity in the market. There's lower issuance in cancellation, less corporate action as well as fewer IPOs. So although we expect in the third quarter to see some increased dividend, the actual overall activity has decreased.","Operator","Your next question is from Brian Bedell with ISI Group.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just quickly on the Basel III securities. So for the sub-investment-grade securities, based on your comments, Todd, if you were to sell them now, would they still generate some additional improvement in Tier 1 common?","Thomas P. Gibbons","They would, Brian, but nowhere near to the degree using the new rules that they would have in the past.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Right. So based on the numbers that you put out, it looks like maybe a little -- like 100 basis points or less instead of the 250 to 300?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, something like that.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay and does the change in the Basel III ratios impact your view on doing M&A over the next couple of years?","Thomas P. Gibbons","I'll turn that one over to Gerald.","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes, Brian, as I said earlier, we're really focused on organic growth and the initiatives that we've identified internally. We, interestingly, have identified a number of things that we think that are better investment than M&A activities. Over a period of time, Global Collateral Services is a great example, pulling together a variety of activities across our company and investing in the technology and the front end to solve a problem in the marketplace. We're also more focused on making sure we execute on a variety of the integration and operational excellence initiatives, and those have some costs associated with them. And we think there's a faster payback on those as well. So we just think that those things are a better investment than looking externally for M&A opportunities. Plus, our share buyback program, given our share price, we think that's a better investment overall as well. That being said, if something extraordinarily comes across the take [ph] at a price that's unbelievable, sure, we'll take a look at it. But I think we have enough opportunities internally to really generate better returns for our shareholders.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And then in the Asset Servicing business, quick question for Tim. On the net new business that was installed in the second quarter and how much is left to install in the pipeline.  And then also, Tim, if you can comment on the FX trading. It looks like you gained market share versus State Street and Northern Trust this quarter.  Is there anything that you've done to retool that platform, and how do you see that going forward?","Timothy F. Keaney","Yes, Brian, I'll take the Asset Servicing and new business question. I'll invite Art to talk about the FX. We have about $400 billion to convert.  Just about all of it will convert before the end of the year. So I would say that's looking pretty good. I think I mentioned I'm also encouraged by the big uptick in the pipeline, and it's really driven by, really, fund managers that are rationalizing the number of their providers. And we've also seen a shift now 2 quarters in a row as fund managers launching new products, which is something we've been delighted to see. So strong new pipeline and about $400 billion left to convert.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And just quickly on the pricing initiatives on the  smaller clientele, can you just give us an update on how that is going?","Timothy F. Keaney","Yes, thanks, Brian. We finished pricing about 650 tail clients. I'll just remind everyone those are the smallest clients that we have. We've retained just over 75% of those clients. So I'm delighted with that result. We've had about 20 larger clients. So clients that are paying us $0.5 million and above whose contracts have come up for review. And I think I mentioned last quarter that as new clients come up, and that may take a cycle of 3 or 4 years, we're repricing those clients, and we've kept every one of those clients as well because of the approach we've taken. So I still call it early innings, Brian, but as we're working up the lead table and as clients come up for review, those quality statistics that Gerald referenced in his opening comments are really making a difference.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's great. And then on the FX?","Arthur Certosimo","Hi, Brian, Art Certosimo here. Recently, we implemented a new standing instructions program, which has helped maintain standing instructions volumes. So giving clients choice in the standing instructions space clearly has made a difference. And clients are doing their part to either maintain or increase negotiated volume. So we're seeing a pretty good positive trend on the volume side of foreign exchange. That, of course, is being offset, though, by the difficult markets and the shrinking spreads that we see due to most of the market condition around the world.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And just lastly, money market fee waivers for the quarter.  Can you give us a sense of what they were?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, they were slightly improved, Brian, but I think -- I'm hopeful to not even have to say this anymore, they seem to have dropped, and we seem to be dragging along at this level, both on a year-over-year and sequential basis.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And the absolute level, it's $65 million or something like that?","Thomas P. Gibbons","It's even a little bit more than that. It's about $0.04 to $0.05 impact.","Operator","Our next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Can you describe the behavior of your custody clients? Are they gaining or losing assets in aggregate?  With a lot of the money leaving the market with a lot of institutions putting their money just simply into cash, what's the characteristic of your clients?","Timothy F. Keaney","Mike, it's Tim Keaney here. I would say year-over-year, we've seen more net new. So we see transaction volumes kind of flat to trending up. We see net new organic positive -- year-over-year, we saw a pretty strong outflows. That stopped in the sequential quarter. And the other thing I didn't mention in terms of the new business, and this is a question I think you ask from time to time, about 50% of what we're seeing so far in the first half of this year is net new business. So things, as an example, that clients have done for themselves where they outsource to us, like transfer agency or fund accounting. So I don't know if that answers your question, but that's certainly what we're seeing.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Mike, maybe I can add. Given the size of our book and the number of clients we have, if somebody changes their asset allocation and they switch from equities to fixed income or to cash, it's still going to stay within the family. We are seeing more cash balances just because people are taking a less risky attitude towards the marketplace. Earlier in the year, we saw more flows into equities. And more lately, we've seen more flows into cash. Now with cash around the world earning close to 0, that's becoming problematic for them. But I think the size of our book and the breadth of our clients, it seems to move from one category to the other. But, Curtis, you're one of the largest asset managers on the planet.  How do you think about it? How do you -- what are you seeing in terms of your activity?","Curtis Y. Arledge","Yes, so Mike, Curtis Arledge. I would say there are sort of 3 major trends that I would describe investors are focused on. We absolutely have seen clients who might, in the past, have owned equities increase the asset allocation to fixed income. Many times, that is a defensive move. It's also a move to the, in some cases, more in line with their liabilities, which are more fixed-income in nature. So that's been one significant trend. I say another major trend has been people who may have de-risked, gone to cash or to more defensive positions, have really spent a lot of time looking for real-return, absolute-return investments where they can get a generally higher level of total return but really manage the downside volatility. So investors are looking at investment offerings where they may not have as much upside, but the benefit of giving away some upside is that they take less downside risk. And we've actually seen pretty meaningful discussions and inflows into those types of investment offerings. So I think that's -- those are 2 kind of answers to the what are people doing from a defensive perspective. I'd say another, the last thing I would point to is that there have been pretty meaningful flows in conversations with clients about diversifying their portfolios globally. So really I think clients are very aware of the debt situation in advanced economies, and that happens to be where they have the preponderance of their portfolios. So there's been more discussion about diversifying internationally especially movements towards countries where there is some real economic growth. So those are sort of the major, I'd describe it as the sort of the very large picture of major things.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Gerald, you opened your comments saying that you're not going to go outside your risk parameters, kind of implying still a risk-off mentality. What are the early indicators that would tell you to start taking more risk?","Gerald L. Hassell","That's a very interesting question, Mike. Europe is still an absolute mess. I can't describe it any other way. And so, given the kinds of deposits that we have in Europe, then, in euro dollars and euro currency, that's where we're probably most challenged, because simply putting money to work in euro land, given the environment, has been a real challenge for us. That's why we're looking at other parts of the world for -- whether it's trade finance or other types of secured fundings. Those are the categories that are still within our risk appetite that will allow us for some investment opportunities. And so things like trade finance, secured repos in other parts of the world, increasing some of our lines there to offset what I think is a very negative environment in Europe.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then lastly a follow-up on the capital question. So you have a new ratio for the Basel III Tier 1 common ratio due to some changes. Is this it? Are we done?  Or could there be some additional tweaks that would cause you to modify that ratio either up or down?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, I wouldn't -- you got to remember, this is a notice for proposed rule making. It is not the final rule. And so there are a couple of elements in that rule that are out for discussion, and it's certainly possible that the regulators would revise this somewhat.  Whether it would be to the good or the bad is impossible for me to protect -- predict, Mike. And this is our best estimate of our current interpretation of the rule, so it could be tweaked a little bit.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","My first question, just to follow up on the Asset Servicing comments, there's good pipelines, there's good builds, but the line item, just core Asset Servicing was down a few million sequentially. I'm just wondering if you could tease out the market impact from the transactional impact and may be some color on what's going on in broker-dealer services within?","Timothy F. Keaney","Tim Keaney here. Just on the Asset Servicing, one thing that's -- I just brought your attention that Todd might have made reference to is we had a pretty significant amount of drop in reimbursements. So clients where we would have been charging them for mailing or postage that have internalized that, there was a big drop in reimbursements, both year-on-year and sequentially. That's not bad news at all actually, because that's offset one for one in the expense line, so you're not seeing that. So what you would really be doing is seeing kind of net new business and organic growth making up for soft markets. I think that's the general theme on market and currency, both sequentially and year-on-year.","Thomas P. Gibbons","There is a slight, Ken, there is a slight currency, negative currency impact in revenue that's not quite offset fully in expenses.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. My second question is to follow up on the legal questions, can you give us an idea of what that possible estimatable number would be, the one that we usually get in the queue just with regards to how the charge came through and then any adds to it? Can you give us a sense of how that sets up? I still think there's a lot of questions about still the potential legal risk and incremental charges that could still happen from here.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, I think you're referring to what we call the reasonable, reasonably possible disclosure. And we would think that it's likely to decline.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","By the magnitude of the charge?  Or hard to say if there's other things still coming in?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Well, we'll give it to you shortly, so I think we're in the process of developing that now. So it's a little bit early for me to say that, Ken. But what I can say is I think we've got quite a few matters behind us in this corner, and we're feeling a lot better.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got you. Can you quickly just remind us what the accretion benefit was this quarter versus the 81 last?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, it was about -- I think it was about $7 million to $8 million less, Ken.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it.","Thomas P. Gibbons","And the guidance I tried to give there is I would expect as we look forward the next couple of quarters that it would burn off at about $5 million-a-quarter rate.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Right, okay. And then just regarding the Other, in clearing services, DARTS were down, but you had still pretty good performance here. I'm just wondering for an update on that business. Is there still good pipeline of conversions just underlying trends in that part of the business?","Brian T. Shea","Yes, it's Brian Shea. We benefited, as I mentioned before, from just some asset gathering and growth in the underlying mutual fund based on the underlying number of individual investments that we custody. And so we're seeing essentially a record level of individual lessees in [ph] custody, and we closed the second quarter with over $1 trillion in assets and custody overall with Pershing globally. In terms of the pipeline, the pipeline is solid, and given the environment, while DARTS are off and there's pressure on broker-dealer profitability all across the industry, in one way, that's a possible silver lining for us in the sense that more self-clearing firms evaluate moving to a variable-cost clearing platform and model. So we do see a reasonable pipeline of firms that are engaged with us and consider Pershing as their clearing partner, and so we feel reasonably good about that. And we'll have some decent third quarter conversions coming up.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And last quick one, just on FX, you did have the nice sequential bump. Any comments on just the makeup of your FX results? Any switching between direct and indirect or in relative profitability within?","Gerald L. Hassell","No, not really, Ken. We benefited from some volume increase in the quarter. Obviously, the volatility is still pretty low and quite low in the marketplace. But we had some new service offerings which are helping capture some of that volume, and we're continuing to offer increased capabilities to capture that.","Operator","Our final question today is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","The question I had, Todd, you referenced that the net interest revenue was adversely impacted by narrower spreads and lower accretion. But you also were a little disappointed that you weren't able to put the deposits to work fast enough in secured loans and securities. On the secured loan side, what are you guys seeing? Is it more challenging to put it to work in certain industries?  Or what are you seeing on the loan side?","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes. I would say that it's probably taking us a little longer time to have the team in place, the collateral monitoring in place that we look forward for that and also signing the clients up. There's good interest there, but that's probably primarily what's driving it. So I'd say we're only about 50% of the target we wanted to be at this point. One other point I want to make sure, Gerard, that's clear is with the ECB cuts, we did have money since I've mentioned sitting at the ECB. And that will have a little bit of a headwind. I think we can still overcome that with the additional actions that we plan to take. And if we did nothing, that could be as much as $20 million to $25 million in the second half negative to us. So we are considering options, including the possibility if we see a further buildup in deposits of maybe even charging a negative rate or imposing some kind of a charge on deposits in euros.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And on the loans, when you're at 50% of where you would have liked to have been or thereabouts, is it more in sectors like telecommunications or real estate, that type of lending versus financial services lending?","Thomas P. Gibbons","It's mostly in the financial services space where we're getting good market, money-market-related types of collateral that we can mark on a daily basis and margin on a daily basis.","Gerald L. Hassell","And Gerard, it's really relatively short-term secured financings with securities that we can understand and mark and with counterparties that we feel very confident with. So it's not traditional commercial bank lending.","Operator","This does conclude the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to speakers for closing comments.","Gerald L. Hassell","Well, great. Thanks, everybody, for joining us. And I really appreciate it. And if you have further questions, Andy Clark [indiscernible] are prepared to answer all your questions, and look forward to engaging with you in the near term. Thanks a lot, everybody.","Operator","Thank you. If there are any additional questions or comments, you may contact Mr. Andy Clark at (212) 635-1803. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Please note that this conference call will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon\u2019s consent.","I will now turn the call over to Ms. Valerie Haertel. Ms. Haertel, you may begin.","Valerie Haertel","Thank you, Nicole and thank you everyone for joining us. As Nicole mentioned, we are reporting our fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings. With us today are Gerald Hassell, our Chairman and CEO; Todd Gibbons, our CFO, as well as members of our executive leadership team. Our fourth quarter earnings materials include a financial highlights presentation that will be referred to in the discussion of our results and can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.","Before Gerald and Todd begin, let me take a moment to remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release, the financial highlights presentation and those identified in our documents filed with the SEC that are available on our website bnymellon.com.","Forward-looking statements made on this call today speak only as of today, January 21, 2015 and we will not update forward-looking statements. As a final note, we plan to file our 2015 10-K on February 26th.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Gerald Hassell. Gerald?","Gerald Hassell","Great. Thanks, Valerie and welcome everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning. Our fourth quarter results capped off what I think was a very good year. We demonstrated that our strategic plan has positioned us well to perform in all operating environments. Even with geopolitical instability, emerging market weakness, higher regulatory compliance requirements and low interest rates, we executed on our strategic priorities and focused on what was within our control.","For the full year, EPS was up 19%, total revenue was up 2% while total expenses were down 2%, resulting in more than 400 basis points of positive operating leverage. Net interest revenue was up 5% and we improved our pre-tax operating margin to 31%. And finally, our return on tangible common equity was a very healthy 21%. So, we are on track to achieve our three-year goals, targets which call for healthy earnings growth, not reliant on improved market conditions.","So, turning to the fourth quarter itself, adjusted earnings per share was $0.68 and that excludes $0.11 per share for the impact of the previously disclosed impairment charge related to a recent court decision, which Todd will discuss in more detail in a moment, and litigation and restructuring charges. That puts earnings per share up 17% year-over-year on an adjusted basis.","For the quarter, again on an adjusted basis, total revenue was up 2%, total expense was down 2%, and we generated over 300 basis points of positive operating leverage, mainly driven by our business improvement process. Net interest revenue was up 7% year-over-year and our return on tangible common equity was 19% for the quarter.","Now looking at our progress against our strategic priorities, as I said in the past, our first priority is driving profitable revenue growth. We have heightened focus on disciplined revenue growth, which means paying particular attention to our clients, profitability, and shareholder value versus gross revenues and market share.","During 2015, we made progress in a number of different fronts. We are focused on deepening our client relationships by leveraging our expertise and determining how we can add further value to them and increase the acceptance rates of our services. At the same time, we\u2019re also examining each business and service that we offer to ensure that we are receiving value for what we deliver.","The strategic platform investments we\u2019ve been making continue to pay off. We\u2019ve been able to create efficiencies and savings for us, and in many cases, for our clients as well. We are now in the early stages of rolling out our new platform NEXEN, which will deliver additional functionality and capabilities to all of our clients.","On investment management, we extended our liability driven investment strategy into the U.S. market through our Cutwater acquisition. Our U.S. retail and wealth management initiatives continue to add to our new business platform. This week, we announced plan to acquire Silicon Valley wealth manager Atherton Lane Advisers, which have $2.7 billion of assets under management. This investment further strengthens our footprint in one of the fastest growing U.S. wealth markets. And we\u2019re also pleased to welcome them to the BNY Mellon team.","And in the U.S. retail space, we had success with the Spanish global fixed income strategy, which was the highest growth product in Morningstar\u2019s world bond category in 2015. And in the markets group, we continued to enhance our collateral management systems and foreign exchange trading platforms, all to drive efficiencies, capture more volume, and improve the opportunities for future revenue growth.","And our second priority is executing on our business improvement process. We\u2019ve been meeting or exceeding our business process goals and are on target to achieve the structural cost reductions that we shared at Investor Day in October of 2014. During 2015 we simplified and automated global processes, optimized and streamlined our technology infrastructure, and shrank our real estate portfolio.","During the fourth quarter, we took a number of additional actions to improve the Company\u2019s business and financial performance. Let me give you couple of examples. We are implementing robotics and machine learning to eliminate repetitive non-value added work, enabling a quicker automated process while reducing wasting costs. We completed three proofs of concept, all demonstrating a high degree of accuracy and processing, reducing transactional processing time, and eliminating manual steps, all of which enables us to redeploy resources to activities that create greater value for our clients.","Last quarter, I mentioned the new client pricing strategy group that we created to analyze and measure service delivery costs to better align our costs with client pricing. This group is now reviewing balance sheet related business practices such as overdraft as well as manual transaction activities, a new strategy around physical securities as well as standardizing pricing across our business units.","We\u2019re also continuing to build out our global delivery centers in lower cost locations to allow for further expansion and position migration. And we moved over 230 full time staff positions to global delivery centers during the quarter and more than a 1,000 full time positions in 2015. And we\u2019ve also begun to implement bring-your-own-device strategy reducing number of data terminals across the Company and have cut back redundant price increase. These efforts, large and small are part of our continuous, comprehensive and sustainable process to create efficiencies and savings consistent with our continuous improvement culture.","Our third priority centers on being a strong, safe, trusted counterparty. During 2015, we reduced and simplified our counterparty exposures, invested in and focused on compliance, risk management and control function, examined and enhanced our vendor management practices following the SunGard incident, incorporating license learned and sharing those with our clients, and made significant investments in our resolution and recovery plans. We also introduced a more robust data governance framework that will strengthen our data collection and analytical capabilities, which is important in meeting all of our regulatory requirements globally. And lastly, we demonstrated our strong business recovery capability in response to the historic flooding in Chennai, India where we have thousands of employees.","Our fourth priority involves generating excess capital and deploying it effectively and wisely. We remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet as well as capital and liquidity positions while returning value to our shareholders. So, in accordance with our 2015 capital plan which authorized us to repurchase up to $3.1 billion of our stock, we repurchased $431 million in share and we distributed a $188 million in dividends during the quarter. For the full year, we repurchased approximately $2.4 billion in shares and distributed more than $760 million in dividends. Over the last four years, we have reduced our shares outstanding by 13% which is among the best in the industry. And from a regulatory ratio standpoint, all of our key capital ratios improved as we move toward full compliance. This quarter, our CET1 ratio under the fully phased-in advanced approach, improved to 9.5%, and we increased our supplementary leverage ratio to 4.9%.","We also remain in full compliance with the liquidity coverage ratio which became effective in 2015 for the full phase-in period that extends through and 2017. We remain very confident that we will be in full compliance with all of the regulatory ratio requirements at the time of or ahead of the required dates.","And our fifth priority is to attract, develop and retain top talent. We have continued to focus on investing in our people; we have refreshed the tools and processes we use to manage, grow and get the most of our talent. And we are seeing the benefits of prioritizing talent, as reflected in our financial performance.","So, as we look ahead, given the rocky start to the year in the financial markets, we expect our business improvement process to be increasingly critical to our results going forward. We remain confident that our strategy and relentless focus on the execution of our priorities will enable us to achieve the three year financial targets we shared on Investor Day and importantly, deliver value-added services and solutions to our clients.","So with that, let me turn it over to Todd.","Todd Gibbons","Thanks Gerald and good morning everyone. My commentary will follow the financial highlights document, will start with slide seven. Before I walk you through the details of the financial results, let me provide you with an overview of the court decision that Gerald noted which resulted in a fourth quarter after tax impairment charge of $0.10. The charge resulted from the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals decision related to $312 million secured loan we had to Sentinel Management Group, which filed for bankruptcy in 2007. Following a favorable December 2014 decision favorable for us by Federal Court finding that our lien against Sentinel was valid, we received payment of the outstanding principal and interest on the loan. Subsequently, the bankruptcy trustee appealed the decision and the appellate court invalidated our lien on the collateral that supported the loan.","The impact of this decision is that we will have an unsecured claim in Sentinel bankruptcy. As a result, we took an impairment charge in the fourth quarter of $170 million on the pretax basis or a $106 million after tax, representing our estimate of the probable losses.","Turning now to our fourth quarter results and the financial highlights document, we will start with slide seven. I\u2019ll focus on our non-GAAP or operating results for the quarter and the year-over-year comparisons. On an operating basis, our fourth quarter EPS was $0.68 that\u2019s up 17% versus year ago. On a year-over-year basis, fourth quarter revenue was up 2%, expenses down 2%, and we had 308 basis points of positive operating leverage.","As we\u2019ve noted in prior quarters, the strength of U.S. dollar continues to impact results negatively for revenue and positively for expense. Net impact from currency translation is minimal however to our overall consolidated financial results. Adjusted for the dollar, revenue would have been up approximately 3% and expenses a little less than 1%. However, our investment management business is impacted more significantly from the strength of the dollar as significant component of investment management revenue is from non U.S. dollar sources.","If you reference page six of our earnings release, you will see the two currencies that impact investment management the most, it\u2019s the pound and the euro, and they were down 4% and 12% respectively against the U.S. dollar.","Income before taxes was up 10% year-over-year on an adjusted basis. On a year-over-year basis, our pretax margin increased approximately 200 basis points to 30% in the fourth quarter. Return on tangible common equity was 19% for the quarter.","Now moving to slide 10, that details our operating results for the full year; you can see the 2% revenue growth and 2% decline year-over-year in expenses as Gerald mentioned that resulted in 420 basis points of positive operating leverage. Income before taxes grew 12%, EPS up 19%. On a constant currency basis, revenue was up 5%, expenses were up 1%.","Slide 11 illustrates key metrics of our performance that demonstrate solid execution of our strategic priorities in 2015. You can see the four quadrants here. EPS up 19%; non-interest expense down; pre-tax operating margin expanded nearly 300 basis points; and return on tangible common equity is also up 300 basis points to 21%.","Slide 12 shows our consolidated fee and other revenue. Asset servicing fees were up 1% year-over-year, down 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects growth in global collateral services, broker-dealer services, and higher securities lending revenue, which is partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the stronger dollar. The sequential decrease primarily reflects lower client activity.","Clearing services fees were down 2% year-over-year and sequentially. Both decreases were primarily driven by industry consolidation as three large clients had transitioned to self clearing firms. Partially mitigating this impact is the new businesses we are on-boarding from a competitor who exited the business and through a combination of net new business and expense control. We expect clearing to be pre-tax income neutral in 2016.","Issuer service fees were up 3% year-over-year and down 36% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects net new business and lower money market fee waivers in Corporate Trust that was offset a bit by the stronger dollar. The sequential decrease primarily reflects seasonality in DRs. As we\u2019ve noted in prior quarters, our Corporate Trust performance has been improving; this quarter it was a positive contributor to our growth.","Treasury services fees were down 6% year-over-year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects higher compensating balance credits and lower volumes.","Fourth quarter investment management and performance fees were down 2% year-over-year that would have been up 1% on a constant currency basis. And that was driven by higher performance fees and a slight reduction in money market fee waivers, partially offset by lower equity markets. Sequentially, investment management and performance fees increased 4% and that\u2019s primarily due to the normal performance fees seasonality. Performance fees were $55 million and that compares to $40 million a year ago, driven by stronger performance across a wide breadth of strategies including a sharp increase in equity long-only fees.","FX and other trading revenue on a consolidated basis was up 15% year-over-year and it was down 3% sequentially. FX revenue of $165 million was flat year-over-year, down 8% sequentially. Year-over-year, we saw lower standing instruction volumes and lower volatility which were offset by higher volumes in other trading programs. Also included is the impact of hedging activities of foreign currency placements. The sequential decrease primarily reflects lower volumes and volatility and seasonally lower deposit receipts related activity and that was partially offset by the hedging activity for foreign currency placements.","Other trading revenue increased to $8 million compared with the trading loss of $14 million in a year ago quarter and a loss of $1 million in Q3. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects the losses on hedging activities within one of the investment management boutiques that we recorded in fourth quarter of last year.","Financing-related fees increased 19% to $51 million and that\u2019s compared to the year ago quarter and decreased 28% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher fees related to tri-party repo activity. In the second quarter, we noted that some of our clients could moderate their usage or possibly find alternative sources for this financing in the future; we actually did end to see this take place during the fourth quarter. The sequential decrease primarily reflects lower underwriting fees and the impact of lower fees related to the superior secured intraday credit I just mentioned.","Investment and other income of $93 million compared with $78 million in the year ago quarter and $59 million in the third quarter. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher other income related to termination fees in our clearing business and that was associated with the client transitions that we mentioned, as well as seed capital gains and that\u2019s partially offset by lower asset-related gains and lease gains. The sequential increase in investment and other income primarily reflects higher asset-related gains, income from corporate and bank owned life insurance, and other income related to clearing termination fees partially offset by lease residual losses.","Slide 13 shows the drivers of our investment management performance that should help explain the underlying business. Assets under management of $1.6 3 trillion were down 4% year-over-year, driven by stronger dollar and lower equity markets, and they were flat sequentially.","We had long-term outflows of $11 billion, $16 billion out of index funds and $5 billion into active funds. Additionally, we had $2 billion of short-term cash flows. For the full year, we had long-term outflows of $17 billion, mainly in the equity and index investments, partially offset by flows into LDIs and alternatives.","Our wealth management and U.S. intermediary expansion initiatives continues to show some progress. Wealth management loans were up 21%, deposits were up 6%. In addition, we announced the acquisition of the Silicon Valley wealth manager, there is AUM of 2.7 billion and 700 high net worth clients, an investment that expands our presence in this fast growing market. In U.S. intermediary, we had strong performance in a number of investment strategies, bringing to organic growth rates that exceeded their Morningstar categories.","Turning to our investment services metrics on slide 14, assets under custody and administration at quarter end were $28.9 trillion, up 1% or $400 billion year-over-year, reflecting net new business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and lower market values. On a constant currency basis, year-over-year growth would have been up approximately 3%. Linked quarter, AUC\/A was also up $400 billion.","We estimate total new assets under custody and administration business wins are $49 billion in the fourth quarter. And that gives us a total of $1.2 trillion of new business wins during the year. Fourth quarter net new business was below average. Just as a reminder AUC\/A wins are episodic and they can vary from quarter to quarter. Our pipelines continue to look healthy. And as we\u2019ve discussed, our strategy has been to prioritize organic growth by deepening our existing client relationships and selectively adding new businesses -- a new business versus simply growing market share.","Now looking at some other metrics for investments services, the market value of securities on loan at period end was down 4%; average loans grew 4% while average deposits were down slightly. Our broker-dealer metric of average tri-party repo balances grew 2%; the clearing metrics were mix; DARTS volume in large long-term mutual fund asset were down, while active accounts were up modestly. The net decline in sponsored DR program reflects our continued focus in exiting low activity programs.","Turning to net interest revenue on slide 15, you will see that NIR on a fully taxable equivalent basis was up 7% versus the year ago quarter and it was flat from the third quarter. The year-over-year increase in NIR reflects higher yields due to a shift out of cash into securities and loans as well as lower interest expense on deposits. While the volume of earning assets declined 2%, their yield increased 6 basis points year-over-year and the yield on interest bearing deposits decreased to 2 basis points. Sequentially NIR was flat.","Our net interest margin for the quarter was 99 basis points, 8 basis points higher than year ago quarter and 1 basis-point higher than prior quarter. Deposits were down 9 billion sequentially on average that was the expected response to the Fed\u2019s a first rate move. Our models continue to estimate some additional loss of deposits as the fed continues to raise rates, as implied by the forward curve at year end and then increasing in line with our Investor Day goals.","Turning to slide 16, you will see that non-interest expense on an adjusted basis declined 2% year-over-year and was flat sequentially. Year-over-year increase in non-interest expense reflects lower expenses in all categories except staff expense. Now, there are few expense items that were both positive and negative to earnings that I\u2019d like to call out and I think it will help give you a bit of context.","Staff expenses grew by 4% year-over-year and that\u2019s reflecting severance cost of approximately $55 million in ongoing support of our business improvement process and an adjustment of roughly $30 million related to updated information received from an administrator of health care benefits, all that was partially offset by the impact of curtailing U.S. pension plan earlier in the year. Decrease in other expense primarily reflects adjustments of approximately $35 million to our estimate for bank assessment charges. And that estimate included the European single resolution fund and it was partially offset by higher asset based taxes. Factoring in these items, we once again showed strong expense control.","Turning to capital on slide 17, fully phased-in and common equity tier 1 ratio increased by 20 basis points to 9.50 that was driven by lower risk-weighted assets as capital was about flat. Our supplementary leverage ratio increased to 4.9% this quarter, principally due to a reduction in our balance sheet as well as reduction in off balance sheet exposures.","A couple of other notes about the quarter from our press release, as you will see in the release on page three, the effective tax rate was 20.1% which is approximately 5% lower than our previous guidance. The rate is lower approximately 3% due to the impact of the impairment charge that I mentioned at the beginning of my comments and approximately 2% lower, driven by the benefit of a more favorable geographic mix of earnings and a little higher tax-exempt income.","On page 11, you will see some investment securities portfolio highlights. At quarter-end, our net unrealized pre-tax gain on our portfolio was $357 million that compared to $1.05 billion at the end of September, the difference in value is principally due to the increase interest rates.","Before I wrap up, let me summarize several items that I\u2019ve discussed in this quarter. As we\u2019d indicated, the impairment and litigation charges resulted as $0.11 charge, and we\u2019re negatively impacted by increased compensation cost driven by severance and health care cost adjustments that I just spoke out that amounted to be about 5%. On the benefit side, we benefited by reduced bank assessment charges, lower tax rate, and termination fees related to our clearing businesses which added about $0.06 to earnings. These items in aggregate had a negative impact of about $0.10 in the fourth quarter to our reported earnings.","Now, I\u2019d like to provide you with a few points to factor into your thinking about 2016. As you know, we\u2019ve been planning and managing to the flat rate scenario as outlined at our Investor Day in late 2014. Now that the Fed has increased rates, we\u2019re using the forward rate curve assumptions. The rate increases obviously are positive for us but we are still facing global economic and geopolitical challenge as evidenced by the market\u2019s sharp decline year-to-date. As a result, we are cautious about how this set of challenges will impact the Fed thinking about future rate increases. Additionally, we are concerned about the equity market performance impact to our organization.","With that said, let me provide you with our current thinking as we look ahead to the first quarter and the full year. We expect the modest increase in NIR and NIM in the first quarter. With respect to the recapture of money market fee waivers, we continue to expect to recover 70% with the 50 basis-point increase in rates, 25 of that increase has already occurred. On expenses, our goal is to keep expense growth flat in 2016. However, higher rates will eliminate fee waivers and that will drive the higher distribution expenses. Largely as a result of the higher distribution expense, we expect the total expense growth to be in the range 1% to 2% next year.","In the first quarter, we expect to see a $15 million increase in the bank assessment charges and it should run at that for the full year. And we would expect staff expense to be impacted in the first quarter by the acceleration of long-term incentive compensation expense for retiree eligible employees that typically takes place in the first quarter.","We expect our tax rate for the full year to be approximately 25% to 26%. We expect to continue to repurchase shares under our current authorization, both in Q1 and Q2. Our repurchase for the second half of the year will be contingent upon the Federal Reserve not objecting to our CCAR request later this year. We think our performance, both in the quarter and throughout 2015 underscores that our strategic plan has positioned us well to perform in some tough operating environments. We are focused on our strategic priorities; we\u2019re executing on them; and we remain on track to achieve our three-year goals.","With that, let me hand it back to Gerald.","Gerald Hassell","Thanks, Todd. And Nicole, I think we can now open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brennan Hawken from UBS.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So, on the expense front, thanks Todd for walking through some of the onetimers that impacted the results. How should we think about the go forward or the direct [ph] jumping off point, based on some of that noise that we saw here in the fourth quarter?","Todd Gibbons","Yes, I would -- so, as I walked you through each one of those, I would take the category run rates down by about the amount that I mentioned.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. The specific numbers you gave, offsets and upward pressure, were the right numbers to rebase and then come up with the baseline starting off point, right?","Todd Gibbons","I think that\u2019s a fair start, Brennan.","Brennan Hawken","Okay, great. Thanks a lot. And then thinking about the clearing headwind, how should we think about that rolling into next quarter; what\u2019s the right way to think about the revenue? Because I know that I think you had said at a conference that there might be some further headwind here in 1Q, maybe their timing of when the clients came off in 4Q might not have been fully reflected in the 4Q run rate. So, how should we think about that coming into 1Q from here?","Todd Gibbons","Yes, I think that\u2019s right. Maybe Brian Shea can take it on, Brain?","Brian Shea","Yes, sure. I mean the clearing revenue fee pressure is really driven by few large client exists, primarily driven by the exit of Barclays and Credit Suisse from the U.S. wealth management market entirely, which were two large clients. And those -- Barclays exited in the middle of the fourth quarter and Credit Suisse began their exit in the fourth quarter, so they are partially out.","I think you will see continued pressure on the fee revenue line in clearing services for the next few quarters. I think it will be partially offset by a couple of things. We actually had a really strong new business year in clearing services in 2015. We were benefiting by the exit of a large clearing competitor from the market and picked up quite a few high quality clients. Those clients tend to be less fee revenue driven and they tend to be a little bit more balance sheet and lending driven, so that the growth they drive will partially offset the fee decline but you will see some other growth in the NII instead of the fee line. And we also have pretty strong growth in the RIA custody and the prime business, and Pershing is also going to benefit immensely from the fee waiver restoration as rates rise which will help the fee line win as the Fed continues to move over whatever period of time they act on.","So in the meantime, we\u2019re focused on strong expense discipline in the clearing business. And as Todd mentioned, we think we can keep the PTI flat in 2016 despite pressure on the fee line.","Brennan Hawken"," Okay, Brain. Thanks for that. So basically, are you saying that the revenue headwind that we saw axing out the new business wins, right, just focusing on that first, should sustain for another couple of quarters and then you\u2019ve got the offsets that you highlighted picking up from there?","Todd Gibbons","Yes, partially offsetting that with NII growth and some of the fees from the JP Morgan [ph] more clients offsetting. But I think there will be pressure on the fee line specifically for the next couple of quarters and we\u2019ll work hard to manage the expense to make sure the PTI impact is neutralized.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","So, just picking up on the clearing question, just want to make sure that we kind of put that question a bit. Are all the clients or all the transaction in the wealth management space as sort of been announced over the second half of 2015 or any kind of like reflected in the guidance, because I think some of them are closing later in 2016?","Todd Gibbons","Yes.","Alex Blostein","So, should we expect another kind of step down in fees in the second half of \u201816 or everything is already reflected from the clients that exited in 4Q?","Gerald Hassell","No. So, it\u2019s a good point. There has been another large U.S. wealth manager that\u2019s announced the exit; it\u2019s another global SIFI that\u2019s announced their exit from the U.S. wealth management business. That transition out will probably take place in the fourth quarter of \u201816. So, that\u2019s not positive. On the other side of that though, we continue to have a strong pipeline of new business in clearing services. And frankly, we have a number of self clearing firms that are considering outsourcing their clearing. So, I hope that we are able to attract some significant new business that offsets that potential loss or the likely loss in the fourth quarter.","Alex Blostein","And then Todd, shifting gears a little bit on to the balance sheet. It looks like if you kind of move across the buckets on the yield side, doesn\u2019t seem like many have them moved, I guess just as obviously the Fed hiked later in the quarter. Help us understand maybe just kind of the run rate of what the NIM we should look for starting 2016, assuming no further rate hikes, and kind of your expectation for the balance sheet, just kind of trying to rightsize NII outlook for 2016 versus 2015?","Todd Gibbons","Yes. We would expect Alex modest growth. I think one of the frustrating things that you\u2019ve seen the 25 basis-point increase in the short rates and long rates have actually come down. So, the reinvestment activity is not going to benefit what we would have modeled or some percentage of the reinvestment. So, we would expect balances to come down a little bit, NIM to widen and overall net interest revenue to show a little bit of growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Luke Montgomery from Bernstein Research. ","Luke Montgomery","I just wanted to ask about the energy exposure in your C&I loan book. I think outstanding is $500 million, but there is another $5 billion unfunded commitments. So, I was wondering maybe if you could characterize the customers you\u2019re lending to, speak to covenants or other protections against those lenders drawing down lines of credit, if they get stressed, and then just generally your sense of whether this exposure is something to be concerned about?","Gerald Hassell","Most of -- almost all of the exposure in the energy sector is to investment grade names. So, a lot of integrated firms, we do have some pipeline and refiners, and there is a little bit of E&P but that is to very high quality names. So at this point, we think it\u2019s a pretty solid growth. We might see some transitions in credits, but I do not expect to see any losses.","Luke Montgomery","And then at your Investor Day a little over a year ago, I think you laid out the path to SLR compliance that you\u2019re targeting year-end 2017. Since then, you\u2019ve added 30 basis points; I think the total you\u2019re hoping for is 250 to 350 basis points of improvement. So, I wonder how you\u2019re thinking about accelerating the path there as we get closer phase-in date. And I think the biggest piece of the plan was deposit reduction. So what\u2019s the contingency plan given that rates, I mean you said yourself that you might not expect anymore rate hikes. So there is no help there.","Todd Gibbons","So, what we\u2019ve seen to-date, so if you look at the -- we can\u2019t really look at the spot balance sheet, you\u2019ve got to look at the average balance sheet, because we do see some noise on your end on our balance sheet, but it\u2019s average that drives the ratio. So, if you look in the quarter, we did see a $9 billion reduction in balances in the quarter. And that\u2019s a pretty quick response to the rate move that we had seen.","In addition so far this year, it\u2019s probably down an additional $8 billion. So we would have estimated that we\u2019d see about a $20 billion reduction in the first move. And if we see more, we\u2019ve indicated that would be in the 40 to 70 basis-point-- excuse me, $40 billion to 70 billion type of range as we get to a more normal range.","If that doesn\u2019t happen, what we have done is we prioritized the entire balance sheet. We might have to take some actions against that for some of the less value deposits. At this point in time, we don\u2019t think we need to rush into compliance. We are building capital; we build about 800 million in a year even with 800 maybe a 100% payout ratio. And if the balance sheet does come down but -- and we can do some other things actually to track the balance sheet a little bit. We think we will grow ourselves pretty well into a reasonable rate without going anything exceptional to our clients.","Operator","We will take our next question from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. ","Brian Bedell","Just one more on clearing, just to be clear on that. So, I think Brian or Todd, you were saying, you expect pre-tax profit for the clearing business in total to be flat from 2015 to 2016, do I have that right?","Todd Gibbons","That\u2019s correct, Brian.","Brian Bedell","Okay, great. And then\u2026","Brian Shea","I can add something there for you. The clearing fees are about 12% of our total revenues, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about. And it has been a decent grower in the 5% to 6% range. So, it\u2019s going -- I think the team has done a great job managing our expenses and responding to the consolidation in industry that we\u2019ve seen here little bit. So, for a year, it might pause on its growth.","Brian Bedell","It was good color from Brian on the fee dynamics there but maybe if I can just dovetail into the money market fee waivers, obviously 70% coming off of two hikes. What percentage do you think you will get at a full run rate on just the one hike and do you really need to wait to like get through 1Q and into 2Q to see that?","Todd Gibbons","I think, it\u2019s just the beginning here; it\u2019s fairly linear. So, we right now the behaviors are seeing are consistent with what we had projected. So, we\u2019re seeing it now.","Brian Bedell","Okay.","Todd Gibbons","And it didn\u2019t show up very much in the fourth quarter, yes, we saw a little bit in the asset management side and little bit in the corporate trust side. Pershing tends to lag in the fee waiver abatement. So, we do think that there is always some acceleration into the first quarter.","Brian Bedell","And then maybe just to -- I know you gave out the EPS drag from fee waivers, if you can give that number for 4Q and what you think it might be for 1Q?","Todd Gibbons","Well, we\u2019ve indicated it\u2019s in the $0.06 to $0.08 range. And so, our file lets you do the math but we\u2019ve indicated the 50 basis-point move and I just indicated it was linear, would reduce it be 1%. So, I don\u2019t have to mess it up on the call here; you can figure that out.","Brian Bedell","Fair enough. And maybe just then switching to the asset management business, maybe if Curtis is there, if he can comment on the acquisition. I guess more broadly on the potential from making more acquisitions for the business, given the recent declines in valuations and just comment on sovereign wealth spending exposure across the franchise?","Curtis Arledge","First of all, we\u2019re very excited about the acquisition that we announced yesterday afternoon of Atherton Lane. And it\u2019s consistent with the strategy that we\u2019ve had in wealth management which is to go into a market. We actually have a team in San Francisco and in Palo Alto who are BNY Mellon employees and have been there for some time in San Francisco and then about a year ago in Palo Alto. But then to find a firm that fits culturally who has a great client base, as Todd said, 700 clients, very fast growing economy, and have that firm fit culturally with what we\u2019re doing, meaning that they think about the entire -- the holistic client need, everything from financial plans to how they think about generational wealth transfer, using trust, insurance and then obviously investments. So, we\u2019re going to bring them the sixth largest asset management firm in the world and all of the banking capabilities of BNY Mellon. And they are eager -- a big part of what makes this work is that they are eager to transition a firm that they\u2019ve grown very nicely since 2005, really to the next level and become part of a global franchise.","So, we did this in Chicago with Talon in 2011, with I(3) in Toronto in 2010 and acquisitions that precede that. It\u2019s pretty much our strategy to get a toehold and then bring the full power of our institution to the clients in that region. And we love that strategy. And to the extent that we can -- in other MSAs, other markets where there is -- we think there is real opportunity for what we can do for clients to grow our capabilities, we love to continue to look at those acquisitions. I\u2019ll tell you that we\u2019re extremely thoughtful about not just the terms and conditions of the acquisition but also that cultural fit is there. And it takes some time to identify and ensure that we have that in place. So, it\u2019s a pretty methodical process.","Brian Bedell","Do you see more opportunities, given the valuation to clients; I guess I would say, is there pipeline significant?","Curtis Arledge","Yes. So, I think that we\u2019re certainly spending time looking for other opportunities like Atherton Lane. So, I want to balance this, so yes, we would love to find other opportunities like that in other markets. And we look at them all the time. It\u2019s one of the great things is we\u2019re connected, Brian talked about Pershing and the rest of our Company has a lot of insight into high quality RI firms around the country. So, we\u2019re always monitoring it like scouting report as to who would be a good fit, who culturally is positioned and yes, we absolutely would love it. We also want to make sure that we execute because we want to make sure every time we do one of these that it works for both acquiring party and their clients.","Brian Bedell","And just the sovereign wealth fund exposure in the institutional segment?","Brian Shea","It\u2019s been an interesting year. You\u2019ve read I\u2019m sure many articles about sovereign wealth funds. At our Investor Day, we described that we were the second largest manager of sovereign wealth fund assets. So we obviously have a lot of clients in this client channel -- clients and assets. And","I will tell you -- and I think we highlighted this at Investor Day, a significant portion of that is indexed assets. Todd and Gerald both referenced our flows. And a big portion of our outflows, both for this quarter and this year have been indexed related assets where the fees are quite small. So, we have absolutely -- you can see our outflows and index for the year. And without -- may not be appropriate to talk about any specific clients or client activity but in line with what you\u2019ve seen from the industry. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. ","Ken Usdin","Todd, on the core businesses, can you just talk about -- I know ex market impacts, the servicing business ex securities, lending was a little soft. You cited in the press release activity. The wins this quarter across the assets were pretty low also. Can you just talk us to what do you think again ex the market impact; what\u2019s your outlook for servicing fee core ex securities lending growth and how much of a weight was the lower activity on the line this quarter?","Todd Gibbons","And you also need to factor in the impact of the currency a bit of the stronger dollar because there are a fair amount of non-dollar revenues. So that\u2019s costing us somewhere between 200 basis points and 300 basis points in revenues.","Ken Usdin","Sequentially, Todd?","Todd Gibbons","Not sequentially, sequentially it\u2019s almost neutral. So it\u2019s not a big impact sequentially.","Gerald Hassell","Ken, I think one way to look at it is revenue growth is a challenge. I mean look at everyone across the marketplace, trying to generate significant revenue growth is a challenge for everybody. We are winning in the places that we want to. We would certainly like to deepen our client relationships and provide more services to many of our existing clients. And I think we have a great solution set to offer. And so that\u2019s one of our key priorities is doing more within existing client base with great set of value-added services and solutions. But revenue growth is tough and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve said and remain incredibly diligent on the expense side. And that remains a focus and we still think we have more opportunities there. And that\u2019s what really propelled our earnings growth this year. And it\u2019s going to be one of the reasons for our success in 2016.","So yes, it\u2019s a bit soft, we acknowledge that. We are redoubling our efforts on our client relationships but we\u2019ve got to pay a lot of attention to the expense base to deliver the earnings that you all are looking for and that we are looking for.","Ken Usdin","Yes. And just on that point about operating leverage, again the market environment is going to make this a tough one to answer. But how much additional flexibility do you have on the expense base, if the environment doesn\u2019t quite pan out; can you commit to getting operating leverage? I know it\u2019s tough given where the start of the year is but how much flexibility do you think you have on top of the actions taken to continue to ratchet down expenses further?","Todd Gibbons","Why don\u2019t I start that one and Brain then you might add. Brian has really been leading a significant component of our business improvement process. We still see a number of additional things that can generate some additional cost benefits. I must admit that fruit\u2019s probably a little higher on the three but there is still a fair amount of fruit. We\u2019re seeing our infrastructure cost continue to come down, we are using more automation tools, we\u2019ve got things like bringing our own device that Gerald alluded to, some of these are smaller dollars versus others, and our real estate strategy I think is paying off. We\u2019ve got ahead of where we thought we would be this year as we moved out of one lawsuit faster than we could and that brought our guidance for expenses in the occupancy space down and we reviewed our guidance because of that. We also see other real estate strategies that could add a bit. We see opportunity in some of our market data, actually probably find cheaper sources of market data and more appropriate, so we got better tools in place to determine who is using what and how we can deliver better services that are less costly. I don\u2019t Brain you have anything to add to that.","Brian Shea","I would add Todd, I think you and Gerald covered many of them already but our mentality on this is, it is continuous improvement. So, we are going to keep driving this business improvement process regardless of the market environment whether it\u2019s worse or better. Even if rates rose 100 basis points, we\u2019d still be driving this because we think we can create sustainable shareholder value. So, all of the things that Todd mentioned, we are excited about the potential from these three pilots in robotics and the ability to start to scale that impact in 2016. The real estate portfolio, you know what we\u2019ve done in New York but that\u2019s actually a global process, so we will be getting more yields from that over time. We\u2019ve in-sourced a lot of application development, our cost per unit for development is better, and our capacity has actually increased. So, we see the opportunity to continue to do more on that.","We\u2019ve talked about executing the private cloud; we have moved to significant amount of our legacy servers to a private cloud environment but we have more to do still, and that will create ongoing structure of cost savings. We continue to reduce our dependency on contract developers and temporary services and lower our people related expenses. And as you can see, even from the severance charge Todd took, we\u2019re executing global location strategy. We moved a 1,000 people to global delivery centers last year and I expect we\u2019ll do a similar amount in 2016. So, we continue to execute every component of this process. And I think we have more value to leverage from this franchise.","One other part of this, which is enterprise team work, which is they were really collaborating more effectively between investment management and investment service, a great example is the private banking partnership between Pershing\u2019s broker-dealer and RIA clients and our own wealth management group. We are now -- have established now something like $2.3 billion in credit facilities for the clients of independent RIAs and broker-dealers who are trying to compete in the wealth management market. And that\u2019s creating some real lift for the wealth management business and some real leverage to our clients. And it\u2019s another example of working differently.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Mayo from CLSA.","Mike Mayo","Hi. I wasn\u2019t sure about the answer to the last question. So, Gerald or Todd, do you expect to grow revenues faster than expenses in 2016? I understand you\u2019re doing a lot of different things, but when you add it all together, when you look out, can you commit to having that or can you not commit to it?","Todd Gibbons","I think Mike we do expect to grow expenses -- excuse me, revenues faster than expenses. But with this market disruption, we have to keep that in mind. The equity markets do have an impact on our business. We\u2019ve indicated in the past a 100 basis-point move -- 100-point move in the S&P 500 is worth about $0.02 to $0.04 for us. And that assumes if it moves on average from the beginning of the year, so on average it\u2019s down 50. So that would be -- if the market continues to sell off that could be a headwind. We will still target trying to generate positive operating leverage, but there are market conditions where that would be impossible.","Mike Mayo","So flat markets, flat rates; you\u2019d expect to have positive operating leverage.","Todd Gibbons","That\u2019s correct.","Gerald Hassell","Yes Mike.","Mike Mayo","And then just some of the ins and outs on the expense side, I still don\u2019t understand why the combination of custody platform wouldn\u2019t provide you with some expense savings and is that simply delayed or that I\u2019m thinking about that the wrong way, and on the negative side the regulatory cost that\u2019s the expenses and then the revenue side still with the asset servicing linked quarter, it was -- third to fourth quarter it was down and why is that down I guess that some of the headwinds that, probably thinking about here?","Gerald Hassell","So Mike, if you look at the expenses, almost every single category with the exception of total compensation, which Todd explained was largely affected by the severance costs in the fourth quarter, every single category our expenses are down. So all of the things that we\u2019ve talked about, whether it\u2019s custody platform, transformation or conversions, whether it\u2019s simplifying our operating structure, whether it\u2019s taking advantage of technology and robotics, it\u2019s showing up in our numbers, it\u2019s showing up in every single line item. So, I would dispute to your claim that it\u2019s not showing up in the numbers, it is. So, I think you\u2019ve got to look at it across every single line item, look at the positive operating leverage, the improvement in the operating margin, it\u2019s there Mike.","Mike Mayo","And then as far as the regulatory headwinds which I guess you\u2019re managing and then on the revenue side.","Gerald Hassell","Regulatory headwinds are included in our expense base. We\u2019re offsetting those regulatory headwind costs with aggressive reductions in the operating expenses in all the other categories. So yes, we\u2019re funding investments in resolution and recovery plans, better analytics, better CCAR process, better controls across the Company, improve risk management capabilities. All of that is being funded and we\u2019re still reducing the operating expenses year-over-year and improving the operating margin of the Company.","Now on your question on investment services fees and asset servicing in particular, yes, it\u2019s a tough revenue environment and we have to up our game, [ph] engage with our own client clients even stronger than we have in the past and really try to put our best solutions and best services in front of them to gain more traction there. So that is one of our objectives and priorities for 2016 is enhancing our client experience and gaining revenue growth.","Mike Mayo","And then last follow-up. Can you remind us how much asset servicing relates to fixed income versus equities, because shouldn\u2019t you be impacted a little bit less than some of your peers?","Todd Gibbons","Yes, we believe that we will be less impacted than most of our peers. We\u2019re probably the reciprocal of what they\u2019re somewhere between 35% and 40% equity and that would mean [ph] fixed income in many markets.","Operator","Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Thanks very much. I\u2019m good. Those are all my questions.","Gerald Hassell","Thanks Betsy. Thanks for dialing in.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will now move along to Adam Beatty from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Adam Beatty","Maybe just one more on expenses, I know that outside services came down pretty nicely year-over-year. If you could give some color on that in terms of how much of that is sort of core services, like outsourcing, basically headcount replacement versus more traditional pro-services like legal and technology, and the trends and the outlook there. Thanks","Todd Gibbons","Yes, we are definitely trying to trend away from relying on outside services, typically across substantially more than what we can do internally. We\u2019ve even seen that on the legal side as well as temporary services that are provided in various functions. We follow it very closely. Anytime somebody has been -- outside service has been around for a while, supervising that service gets a notification, questioning why it\u2019s still around and why we haven\u2019t internalized it. I don\u2019t know Brian, you might want to comment; you\u2019ve done a lot of things there.","Brian Shea","Yes, I think we\u2019re just -- in general on our major strategic projects and investments, we\u2019re relying more on our team and developing our own team whenever we think it\u2019s a sustainable need and a capability we need rather than rely as much on contractors, consultants. Part of that\u2019s also the ongoing IT application development in-sourcing which is reducing contract consultant cost, and actually we think improving our speed to market and our actual development productivity at the same time. So, it\u2019s a variety of things, not one single thing but we\u2019re really focused on every part of these expenses.","Adam Beatty","So, it sounds like ex maybe some episodic things, there is room for further reduction there?","Brian Shea","Probably a little bit.","Todd Gibbons","Yes.","Adam Beatty","And then turning to investment management and the flows, specifically wealth management, the outflows came a lot from indexing, I assume that\u2019s somewhat institutional. In wealth management, you\u2019ve mentioned 5 billion of active inflows, not sure how much of that was wealth management but what are you seeing amongst your clients now and how they\u2019re reacting to the market? Thanks.","Curtis Arledge","I think it\u2019s exactly what you\u2019d expect it to be, which is a mix of the uncertainty; the volatility has been very significant. And I think August really shocked people and then you got a little bit of recovery and the first part of this year has been challenging. People are trying to understand that this is a beginning of something greater. We\u2019re talking with them a lot about the differences between now and the financial crisis. Banks have substantially more capital and are a lot less averaged. Obviously the China impact is something we\u2019re really trying to understand, with everyone struggling for the data and really be insightful. So trying to help our clients understand what\u2019s happening is something that they\u2019re all interested in.","I\u2019ll tell you that there are also many who have been since the financial crisis underinvested; there\u2019s been a lot of people who have been more in cash and we stressed them that having a solid investment plan and overall financial plan is critical. Being too conservative is not a good thing and many of them have been so. So, we\u2019re seeing some people who are beginning to put money to work, they\u2019re scaling in. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a -- until volatility settles down, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see the dramatic shifts. I will tell you that flows in the industry and we see -- as we\u2019re in both investment management and investment services see so much what\u2019s happening, a lot of clients rebalanced when the equity markets did well. And I do think that we will see people who reduced their equity exposure earlier, they are absolutely going to rebalance, see it in the other direction; as markets decline, they may wait from a timing perspective for things to settle down a bit and just make sure they understand what\u2019s really happening with the economy, the impact of lower energy prices. I still think there is a pretty significant lag effect on what it\u2019ll mean for the real economy which would ultimately be positive.","So, I think our clients are uncertain but also interested in figure out whether this is an opportunity to add investment risk to their portfolio.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our final question from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. ","Gerard Cassidy","Can you guys share with us the -- you\u2019ve touched on this in past calls I believe, the blockchain technology, how you are pursuing that and what the implications are for it longer term; should it ever become a reality, one of the opportunities for you with it and one of the negatives that it could cause to your Company?","Gerald Hassell","We are spending a lot of time and energy in different parts of the Company on the block chain technology and where it can be applied. I think last quarter we commented we have two pilot programs actively engaged internally. We\u2019re participant in a couple of consortiums on blockchain technology. Interestingly we\u2019re hosting a blockchain technology day, next Monday with our own technologists and outsiders, exploring all the different opportunities that we see and others see. So, we\u2019re very actively engaged in the dialogs and the concept of where it can be applied. I think here are some real opportunities for us to be a disruptor to the existing infrastructure. I think it\u2019s going to take quite a bit of time to get there. But we are not sitting back waiting; we are actively engaged in the dialogs. ","Gerard Cassidy","And when you say quite a bit of time to get there, are we thinking three years out, five years out or is it just too hard to say when it becomes -- it inevitably becomes fully functional?","Gerald Hassell","Yes, it\u2019s too hard to say. We are all very intrigued with it, we are very intrigued with the concept of it and how it could structurally change a lot of the processes we do. And by the structural change, i.e. reduce costs for us and our clients. And it\u2019s going to take some time to get there to become fully functional.","Gerard Cassidy","And then just coming back to the sovereign wealth funds, two questions on that or two part -- one question two parts. One, the drop in the deposits in the foreign offices, was that attributed to the sovereign wealth funds pulling money out? And second, what\u2019s the total dollar amount under management in the quant funds with the sovereign wealth business?","Gerald Hassell","The drop in the deposits, I don\u2019t think anything to do with the sovereign wealth funds.","Todd Gibbons","The drop in deposits is consistent with what we saw what happen when rates moved and there were better alternatives than staying on our balance sheet for low yield.","Gerald Hassell","We don\u2019t comment on the size of the assets under management for sovereign wealth funds specifically. But given that we\u2019re a significant player, we\u2019re seeing what the rest of the industry is seeing and that is certain sovereign wealth funds are liquidating their assets and continuing to follow their social agendas and using money within their own country. So, we\u2019re no different than the rest of the industry in that regard.","Gerald Hassell","Well, thank you very much everyone for dialing in. We really appreciate it. If you have further questions, Valerie and her team look forward to hearing from you. And I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll run into all of you pretty soon. So, thank you very much again everyone.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\u2019s conference. If there are any additional questions or comments, you may contact Ms. Valerie Haertel at 212-635-8529. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent.","I would now turn the call over to Mr. Izzy Dawood. Mr. Dawood, you may begin.","Izzy Dawood","Thanks, Wendy, and welcome, everyone. With us today are Gerald Hassell, our Chairman and CEO; Todd Gibbons, our CFO, as well as our executive management team.","Let me take a moment to remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings release and those identified in our documents filed with the SEC that are available on our Web site bnymellon.com. Forward-looking statements in this call speak only as of today, October 17, 2014, and we will not update forward-looking statements.","Before we begin, I would like to note two changes in our earnings materials. Firstly, I have introduced a financial highlights presentation which is a summary review of our revenue, expense and business segment trends along with related commentary. We will use the financial highlights presentation to discuss our results. In addition, we have consolidated our earnings press release and earnings review documents into one earnings release document. The earnings release and financial highlights presentation are available on our Web site.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Gerald. Gerald?","Gerald Hassell","Thanks, Izzy and good morning everyone and thanks for joining us this morning. Let me highlight some of the key takeaways for the quarter. We achieved continued momentum in investment management and investment services as we saw strong fee growth in these businesses reflecting our focus on developing and delivering the very best capabilities in the marketplace. We drive continued progress on the expense control front. As our expense growth rate was well below the growth rate of our fee revenues. We maintained a strong capital position, which prepared us well to comply with all the regulatory requirement, while allowing us to continue to invest in our businesses and maintain a high capital payout ratio.","And as you can see on Page 3 of our highlight deck, we had earnings per share of $0.93 and that included $0.29 per share for previously disclosed gains net of litigation and restructuring charges. Investment management had another excellent quarter with investment management and performance fees up 7% year-over-year. Asset center management increased 7% to a new record, 1.65 trillion driven by net new business. And also during the quarter we had 13 billion of net long-term flows reflecting the strength of our liability driven investment strategy, and interesting as we also had $19 billion of short-term inflows.","Turning to investment services, fees grew at 5% year-over-year driven by strong growth in asset servicing, clearing and treasury services, which more than compensated for a decline in the issuer services. So in spite of the continued runoff at high value securitizations in corporate trusts investment services overall had a very healthy revenue increase. Assets under custody or administration were up 3% to $28.3 trillion. In foreign exchange our continuing enhancements are helping us gain new clients on our FX platform and that contributed to the sharp volume gains that helped mitigate the significant decline year-over-year in industry-wide volatility. Now of course recently market conditions have increased that volatility which is generally good for market participants.","Now we also saw an increasing contribution from our collateral services, which helped our growth as clients are increasing their use of our optimization and segregation solutions.","On the expense front, our aggressive commitment to reducing expenses and improving productivity is showing up in our numbers, particularly when you look at the trend and staff expense. Our normalized expenses were flat year-over-year and up only 1% sequentially, very strong results when given against the revenue growth that we experienced in investment management and investment services. Our capital position remains strong even after giving effect to the repurchasing of 11 million shares during the quarter for $431 million. Interestingly, we have repurchased about 3% of our shares outstanding this year.","Now we also delivered an outstanding return on tangible common equity of 18% for the quarter. So all-in-all, good fee momentum, good progress in reducing the growth rate of expenses and an enviable capital position.","Now at our Investor Day Conference on October 28th, we\u2019ll discuss in more detail how we plan to enhance our revenue growth, continue to control expenses, manage to the new liquidity and capital standards and how we intend to deploy the significant level of excess capital that we generate. And much of the focus will be on the work underway to maximize returns and create value for our shareholders, above and beyond what we\u2019re delivering today. And importantly we\u2019ll also share the key performance targets that you could hold us accountable too.","And before I turn it over to Todd I want to highlight two recent actions that we\u2019ve taken as we continue to optimize our business mix. First, we repositioned our market group exiting derivative sales and trading. This will improve our operating margins and return on capital. We simply were not large enough player to get an adequate return on capital and bare the increasing risk management and over say cost. Second, last week we announced an acquisition that we will add new specialized fixed income solutions to our diverse portfolio of capabilities.","We agreed to acquire Cutwater Asset Management which is a U.S. based fixed income and solution specialist. They have a 20 year track-record and approximately $23 billion of assets under management. Cutwater will operate as part of our investment management unit and we\u2019re closely with Insight our highly successful LDI specialty boutiques. It will allow us to extend our LDI and fixed income specialist strategy into the U.S. marketplace so we\u2019re very excited about that acquisition and also the repositioning of our markets group.","So with that, let me turn it over to Todd.","Todd Gibbons","Thanks Gerald, and Page 5 of the financial highlights document details of our reported results. As Gerald mentioned, we had EPS of $0.93 that included $0.29 per share for those previously disclosed gains net of litigation and restructuring charges. As you look at our numbers, you will note that we had a $0.01 benefit related to our loan loss provision credit so we see it as a $0.63 quarter.","Now given the significant asset gains in the quarter, I think it\u2019s best that we start with the summary of our adjusted results which are on Page 6. Revenue was down year-over-year as strong growth in investment management and investment services fees was offset by lower investment and other income and lower net interest revenue. However, if you look at our revenues excluding the volatile investment line, it was up about 2%. I will provide more color on the revenue drivers shortly.","Expenses were flat year-over-year and up slightly sequentially representing the continued progress on expense control. Our operating leverage was up 245 basis points year-over-year if you exclude the impact of the investment and other income. Our pre-tax margin was 29% and our return on tangible common equity was a strong 18%. On Pages 7 and 8, we will call out some business metrics and I think help explain our underlying performance.","In terms of our investment management business, on Page 7, you can see that record AUM of 1.65 trillion was up 7% year-over-year driven by higher equity market values, as well as net new business. During the quarter, we had net long-term inflows of 13 billion and short-term inflows of 19 billion. On Page 8 you can see that assets under custody and administration at quarter end were 20.3 trillion that\u2019s up 3% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher market values.","Linked quarter AUC\/A was down 1% due to lower market values as the Footsie, MSCI and the Barclays bond index were all down in the quarter. We had an estimated 115 billion in new AUC\/A wins during the quarter. Now many of our key metrics showed growth on a year-over-year basis as well. The market value of securities on loan at period end showed strong growth. Average loans and deposits in wealth management and as well as in investment services continued their trend upward. Our key broker deal and metric of average tri-party repo balances was also up. Our clearing metrics were also good, although DARTS volumes were off slightly as we typically see in the third quarter, active clearing accounts were up and long-term mutual fund assets showed especially strong growth. The number of DR programs declined in the quarter, reflecting an increase in the number of terminations that exceeded the number of new issuers. In addition to that, we continue to maintain our pricing discipline in this business.","Looking at fee and other revenue on Page 9, asset servicing fees were up 6% year-over-year and up slightly sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects organic growth, higher market values, net new business and higher collateral management fees. Sequentially organic growth was partially offset by seasonally lower securities lending revenue. Clearing fees were up 7% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Both increases were driven by growth in clearing accounts and mutual fund positions and by overall higher asset levels. The sequential increase also reflects higher DART volumes.","Issuer service fees were down 2% year-over-year and up 36% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower Corporate Trust fees, partially offset by new business and DRs. The sequential increase is primarily due to seasonally higher dividend fees partially offset by lower Corporate Trust fees. When you look at our investment services you will see that our investment services fees as a percentage of non-interest expense, what we call the coverage ratio was 100% in the third quarter. That\u2019s up approximately 300 basis points from the year ago quarter primarily reflecting strong fee growth with little changes in our expenses.","The impact of the currencies for the full quarter had a neutral impact to our pre-tax income, but it's worth noting that it caused a slight revenue increase that was offset by an equal expense increase, most of that impact in investment management. Investment management and performance fees were up 7% year-over-year and down slightly sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily resulted from higher equity markets, the currency impact and higher performance fees. The sequential decrease was driven by seasonally lower performance fees. FX and other trading revenue was down 4% year-over-year and up 18% sequentially. FX revenue of 154 million was unchanged year-over-year and up 19% sequentially. Year-over-year, higher volumes offset lower volatility. As Gerald mentioned the enhancements we\u2019ve made to our FX platform helped us capture more client activity. The sequential increase reflects higher volumes.","Turning to Page 10 of the financial highlights, you\u2019ll see that net interest revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was down 6% versus the year ago quarter and essentially flat to the second quarter. The year-over-year decrease primarily resulted from lower asset yields and lower accretion that was partially offset by higher average interest earning assets and of course those assets were driven by higher deposits. The net interest margin for the quarter was 94 basis points it is down 22 from the year ago quarter and 4 from the prior quarter.","Now we also point out here that euro-denominated for deposits now make up approximately 15% of our average deposit liabilities. During the quarter as you\u2019re probably aware the European Central Bank lowered the rate it pays on funds left at the bank to minus 20 basis points. To mitigate the impact of that move, we\u2019ve taken a number of actions. As of October 1st we began charging for deposits. We\u2019re also continuing to reduce our interbank placements and as we mentioned before we are increasing high quality liquid assets with the cash related to that. For the quarter, our securities portfolio increased by $10 billion, that\u2019s about 10%. We added agencies, treasuries and severance so that\u2019s increasing our high quality liquid asset portfolio.","Turning to Page 11, you\u2019ll see that non-interest expense decreased slightly year-over-year and was up 1% sequentially. We have reduced staff expense year-over-year as lower pension expense and the impact of technology in-sourcing and streamlining actions offset higher professional legal and other purchase services, the currency impact and the annual employee merit increase. The sequential increase primarily reflects the incentive reduction recorded in the second quarter that was related to an administrative air, as well as the impact of the factors that I just noted. You will notice that headcount increased by 100 year-over-year, it was down by 200 sequentially. I want to remind you of our technology talent strategy of in-sourcing developers to reduce our application development cost. Year-over-year, we have eliminated more than 700 contractor related roles in technology and replaced them with permanent staff. Despite this our employee count is only up 100 position and compensation expense is lower, clear evidence that the strategy is working.","As we indicated last quarter, we continue to believe that our operating expenses for the full year should be about flat.","Turning to the capital ratios on Page 12, they were unchanged despite the growth in capital. This was largely driven by an increase in risk weighted assets, that\u2019s associated with the calculation for operational risk. Our estimated supplemental leverage ratio was down 10 basis points to 4.6% due to the increase in our balance sheet in the third quarter. A few points to factor into your thinking about the fourth quarter, we would expect a reduction in depositary receipt fees and there will be a limited offset in expenses on that. Seasonally higher performance fees in the fourth quarter will somewhat mitigate the DR drop-off but will cause the related expense increase.","Net interest revenue is expected to be approximately flat to the third quarter. Expenses should be up sequentially driven by seasonally higher business development, legal and consulting expense as well as the higher staff expense reflecting to rise in performance fees. The effective tax rate should be around 25%-27%. And finally we intend to continue to execute on our CCAR capital plan, of course subject to market conditions. All-in-all a strong quarter, good fee growth in our two segments, good expenses control and we continue to execute on our capital plan.","With that let me hand it back to Gerald.","Gerald Hassell","","Alright, great, thanks. And Wendy I think we can open it up for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","Thank you. At this time, we are ready to begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. Our first question comes from Glenn Schorr with ISI.","Gerald Hassell","Hi, Glenn?","","Glenn Schorr - ISI Group","","How are you?","Gerald Hassell","","Good.","Glenn Schorr - ISI Group","","So, I guess the question has is, it\u2019s not a big move but capital ratio is down a little bit, SLR down a little bit. I wondered if you could just get a little color on that?","Todd Gibbons","","Sure Glenn, this is Todd. In terms of the risk weighted asset ratios you did see a little pop in our capital. It was somewhat offset. It would have been larger but there was an OCI adjustment related to the accumulated transaction account, largely driven by the change in the dollar value over the quarter. And if you look in the denominator on the risk weighted assets there was a pretty significant increase related to operational risk. And what happened to those models are informed by external losses and there have been quite a few external losses even though they are not losses that we have incurred when others take large provisions it can inform those models and drive higher operational risk calculation. And that\u2019s what we have seen.","Glenn Schorr - ISI Group","","And what is ops RWA as a percentage of total?","Todd Gibbons","","I don\u2019t think we disclose that, but it is a substantial percentage of the total for the advanced approach, it doesn\u2019t apply to the standardized approach.","Glenn Schorr-ISI Group","","Okay.","Todd Gibbons","","If you notice Glenn that\u2019s why you will see the standardized approach actually increase.","Glenn Schorr - ISI Group","","Yes, yes I got it. Okay, you said limit it to one. I appreciate it.","Todd Gibbons","","Thanks Glenn.","Glenn Schorr - ISI Group","","Thanks.","Operator","","Thank you. The next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","","Hi, good morning. Todd I was wondering if you could expand a little bit upon the pushes and pulls within NII as it relates to LCR the final rules. You addressed the commentary about extending placements and charging for the deposits. But just on LCR and just how much more you need to go. And then how you will be adjusting to the final rules? Thanks.","Todd Gibbons","","Sure. As you know we got the final rules earlier in the September. And they were a little more favorable for the treatment of operational deposits. And they are below top on Muni assets for example. So we look well positioned our estimates right now on these our estimates and obviously we -- it is easy to compute the high quality liquid assets, it\u2019s still fairly difficult to compute the actual denominator. But our estimates are that we are well in excess of the 80% that we need to be on January 1st. Given that we still are looking to do a little restructuring and some of that you might know in what we did this quarter the municipal was down a little bit. That\u2019s still open for discussion. There is a possibility that that position on municipals could change. And agencies, treasuries and some severance we increased as we brought down some of our placements. We are actually kind of -- we are going to give a lot of detail on this on the Investor Day. But I think the good news is we are meeting the standard. We are well positioned to meet the future standard. And it\u2019s not having a dramatic change in our portfolio or in our estimates around our net interest income.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Okay, thank you Todd.","Todd Gibbons.","","Thanks Ken.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","","Hi, good morning.","Todd Gibbons","","Good morning.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","","So, I just wanted to understand the methodology and process for charging for deposits over there in Europe. Just wanted to make sure I understood how you were doing that is it a one side that\u2019s all is it how you\u2019re dealing with how people paying you via soft dollars, if you could just give us a little color there?","Gerald Hassell","Betsy, why don\u2019t I and Brian Shea address that, so Brian?","Brian Shea","Hi, Betsy, generally, what we\u2019re doing is essentially passing through the 20 basis point fee that we\u2019re absorbing from the European Central Bank clients understand that we are actually not initiating this but actually passing through the fee that we\u2019re absorbing. We\u2019re working collaboratively with our clients to help them manage their cash in a way that reduces their exposure to that and to the extent we can find other short-term investment vehicles or off balance sheet cash management vehicles we\u2019re helping them do that to reduce their exposure to that cost.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","So if you have had people leaving excess deposits as a form of paying you for services. Does that then drive some higher hard dollar fees if they\u2019re moving off of soft dollar pay?","","Brian Shea","Well generally with rates being so low there has really been no earnings credit on the deposits to start with. So there really isn\u2019t that issue and that hasn\u2019t been for some period of time. We\u2019re really just trying to work with the clients to make sure that they have, there is limited amount of deposits on our balance sheet that they are subjected to that cost. And so in some ways we\u2019re seeing some of our euro deposits come down not surprisingly which is good because we don\u2019t have to hold capital against that item. So we\u2019re really trying to work very collaboratively with our clients to mitigate that cost and there really hasn\u2019t been any earnings credit on the deposits to start with.","Gerald Hassell","And typically that\u2019s not something that takes place much in Europe it\u2019s nowhere near like in the U.S.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Got it, so in your two weeks into it, I mean I guess the question is how much impact do you think this is likely to have on being able to shrink the balance sheet?","Gerald Hassell","I think the -- not a whole lot Betsy because we\u2019re seeing everybody else do it. So this is becoming a fairly common practice. We have seen and we\u2019ve indicated that we had about 15% of our total deposit base is in the euro it\u2019s denominated in euro. We\u2019ve probably seen that come down a little bit.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Alright, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Thanks. Good morning everyone. Just another follow-up I guess on the balance sheet. We\u2019ve seen the deposits kind of continuing to balloon across the system for some time. Are you guys, in particular, do you guys have a slightly better sense the source of these deposits is essentially the same clients are you starting to see different mix shift within that? And I guess Todd just as a follow-up to your point on moving some of the cash and securities portfolio. Can you give us a sense of the pace at which you guys are willing to do that and does the current moving rates change that strategy for you at all?","Gerald Hassell","Sure Alex. Why don\u2019t we start with where the deposit growth has come, I think there were some dislocations in the third quarter. And I\u2019d say there are a couple of drivers to that. I mean one of the things that you saw is that the Fed put a limitation on its total amount of reversed repo that is intended to do at quarter end so it reduced it from really no cap to 300 billion. That meant that towards the end of the quarter that there were substantial money market funds that had nowhere to place the fund. So the likely recipient of that is going to be the custodian for those money market funds. So, I think that\u2019s a little bit of a temporary distraction if you will or disruption.","I think also you\u2019ve seen the large dealers take down their matchbooks which had a similar impact. And there was a particularly important period and this is, I think this is a permanent reduction but right now the impact of the reduction is ending up in the banking system and it kind of needs to I think work its way through. So we do think we\u2019ll probably see a little bit more of this before we see this cash kind of find a permanent home. In terms of your other question I think we\u2019ve made substantial. We did increased the duration of the securities portfolio in the third quarter a little bit. I think now the repositioning is going to be what we wanted to do within the H2 ally.","We do have a fair amount of Central Bank deposits they\u2019re low risk they\u2019re low yield. And really the only action that you could take would be to extend duration within that portfolio if you wanted to increase the NIM. And I think we\u2019d be a little bit defensive about that. There is potential capital risk to it and I think the opportunity cost to taking on very low yielding securities at this point is pretty high.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Got you, make sense. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Good morning guys. So, a quick one, could you, do you see -- it just may be helpful to try to think about how much of these restructuring and litigation is environmental and how much is management action? Is it possible to break those two out or at least give us some color on how those break down? And then also why the litigation and restructuring drove up the tax rate like was there an accrual for fines are something in there. Just maybe help us understand some of that?","Todd Gibbons","There is about $60 million of restructuring expenses and $160 million of litigation expenses. When we look at the restructuring that\u2019s largely around the actions that Gerald mentioned around the markets group and we think that\u2019s going to have some long-term positives on us, for us. I would say that when we think there is appropriate actions like that to take in the future we will taken them. In terms of the litigation we apply a tax rate that\u2019s reflective of the jurisdiction related to the matter. And that\u2019s why that tax rate was relatively low and the after tax impact relatively high.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Got it. Okay. Thank you. And then thinking about volatility here we\u2019ve seen not only last quarter the reflected results but quarter to-date. A lot of the investment banks had walked through how the volatility we\u2019ve seen here this current quarter is not really as helpful to drive revenues. Is that, well also what you\u2019re seeing or is volatility, volatility and you\u2019re going to benefit on either side. In other words are the trends that we\u2019ve seen so far sustainable here into the fourth quarter from your perspective?","Todd Gibbons","Yes just a quick comment on that some level volatility is generally as we said it is helpful to most market participants. That being said, with more and more going to electronic trading and more and more within time spreads and more and more within a very, very, very narrow range, the volatility benefits that we\u2019ve all experienced in the past are less, but volatility generally helps more important for us since most of our foreign exchange trading is really on the backs of our servicing businesses. It\u2019s more important for us to capture volumes. And so we\u2019re a volume driven shop and that\u2019s why we feel pretty good about the level of volumes increases on our FX electronic platforms associated with our investment services businesses. So generally it helps but it\u2019s not nearly as impactful as it once was.","Gerald Hassell","And I would add to that, the volatility we look for primarily since we\u2019re not a big fixed income or equity trading shop it\u2019s really around the FX, our FX business is related to FX. And we do print a volatility index number that I wouldn\u2019t say it is perfectly correlated but it\u2019s correlated to what we\u2019re looking at and you can see in the third quarter versus the second quarter it\u2019s basically flat down substantially from last year but basically flat, so recent events have tended to move that a little bit.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Okay, thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","First, just a clarification, the new asset manager that you bought Cutwater Asset Management you said they\u2019ll be working with Insight. Will that be a new investment management boutique or it will be folded in to an existing one?","Todd Gibbons","Mike it\u2019s going to be a new boutique as part of our own enterprise. It\u2019s Cutwater.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Okay, thanks, okay. And then just my main question for the Investor Day on October 28th which I\u2019ll ask now, but I am guessing we\u2019ll get a bigger answer. If you look at investment -- in the servicing fee for this year relative to assets under custody when you look at that ratio overtime it\u2019s one of the lowest levels that it\u2019s been if you go back 10, 15 even 20 years. And that\u2019s despite additional market share by BNY Mellon especially but by all the largest players. So, why don\u2019t you have better pricing given increases in market share overtime and given all the scale benefits that you guys talk about?","Todd Gibbons","Mike I think this quarter is a good example where we actually saw the fees rise faster than the assets under custody. So some of our other services our so called value-added services like collateral and some of the other things are starting to kick in. So, this is a good example this quarter and I can\u2019t promise that every quarter but this is a good quarter where we actually are seeing this fee increase and some other pricing discipline we\u2019re putting in place around the transactions and clients that we do business with are starting to pay off. So assets under custody were up 3%, asset servicing fees were up 6% for the quarter, so we\u2019re trying to accomplish exactly what you\u2019re suggesting.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","And looking ahead I guess this is a preview of October 28th the main reasons you think that might continue would be what?","Todd Gibbons","Well again some of the collateral services, some of the value-added propositions we\u2019re offering our clients are fee-based irrespective of assets under custody and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to drive.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Okay, alright. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse.","Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse","Good morning. I had a two part question on interest rates, as far as how you\u2019re thinking about the current reinvestment environment and what your reinvestment yields look like and I was hoping you could contrast U.S. versus Europe given the very different rate dynamics, and the second given the recent move down into 10 years and long-term rates, how should we be thinking about pension costs next year?","Todd Gibbons","","Sure, Ashley, a couple of things. In terms of reinvestment typically what we model is we look at the market and the forward rate curve and we estimate around that, we\u2019ll also model whether rates are just flat that they don\u2019t change. Given they are extraordinary low levels, we don\u2019t typically model them going down a lot more but we obviously do sensitize to that as well. So, when we look forward we are assuming that we will reinvest and when we show our sensitivity in our Q, we will assume that we\u2019re reinvesting at the existing market levels.","In terms of the discount rate and the lower interest rates and the lower tenure, the discount rate is a corporate credit discount rate, so it's not quite as severe as the drop that should speak to in the tenure. But it is down a bit from where we saw it last year and obviously that means retention obligation would increase in the costs associated with the pension expense would also increase. We give estimates in our Annual Report and what those numbers might look like depending what that discount rate is. So you need to get a good handle around the discount rate.","Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse","","Thanks for taking the question.","Todd Gibbons","","Thanks, Ashley.","Operator","","Thank you. The next question is from Adam Bedi with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Adam Bedi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Thank you and good morning. Just one question, what is your thoughts are around trends in LDI, I know there were some new outflows, last quarter inflows this quarter given some of that recent market volatility has there been anything about a rush to the exit on behalf of some clients who may have hesitated for one reason or another, how do you see it tracking versus pension plan funded status and maybe any quick color on the strategic role on the capabilities of Cutwater versus what Insight already has? Thanks.","Todd Gibbons","Sure, Adam it is a great question. The LDI business still has very robust pipelines as mentioned broadly are looking to derisk. In fact if you remember last quarter we actually had one sizeable outflow net of that we had pretty meaningful inflows. So the business is robust, the pipelines are strong and I would tell you that it has obviously been a very big business for us in the UK specifically and around the world generally, but we see the U.S. opportunity to really continuing to expand. Your question about how are pensions thinking about in the current environment, when we saw that the tenure approached 3% yield here in the U.S. last time and the stock market was doing really well, funded status levels actually got to a point where more people were interested in it and I think the general view was rates were going to continue to move higher. There were obviously two sides to every market, but I think there was a view that maybe rates would continue to move up and the funded status would even be better in the LDI move in our pension plan might become even more attractive. This last move down I think has made people more thoughtful about looking at the opportunity to derisk their plan and to take advantage of it when it make sense to them to do it and to, we do think that people will, people who have made the decision, pension planners who have made the decision to derisk their plan will be more active in doing so as the opportunity to the exists.","So, and another thing I would you just to extend that point, the skills involved in doing LDI and every plan is different. And in the UK you have an inflation component and that can be more complicated than some of the plans in the U.S. But the skills involved really are about being able to create a solution around a liability. So buying assets against a match liability that looks a lot like and is actually absolute return investing generating risk adjusted returns for clients and I would tell you that the skills there really can be to other large growth opportunities for us. One is around the retirement space for individual, so a lot of the techniques and capabilities are quite similar for creating retirement solutions for individual investors. And then also there continues to be a lot of interest both on the institutional end broader investor front, four absolute return strategies that look like these strategies. So absolute return, real return, investing that you hear a lot about is going to leverage those same capabilities. And so Cutwater brings a much deeper capability in U.S. fixed income markets. Again we have the LDI businesses in Spanish and Mellon Capital as well. But Insight as now largest LDI driver in the world continuously winning awards for the great capabilities they have being able to have the intellectual capital sharing from our Insight team with our Cutwater extended capabilities in that new boutique it really is going to position us quite well we think to continue to benefit from pension derisking trends.","Adam Bedi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Appreciate the detail. Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. The next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank","","Hi. Good morning, folks. Could you talk a little bit maybe expand a little bit on the collateral management business. You say you\u2019re obviously getting some traction there now, if you can opine a little bit about some of the discussions on tri-party repo in the marketplace including potential centralized clearing of that? And then if -- I don\u2019t know if there is any way to frame that contribution as we model that and that growth for you overtime. Is that something you\u2019re thinking about maybe starting to disclose in terms of the actual revenue as opposed to just the balances? I don\u2019t know I\u2019ll stop there and I\u2019ll ask the other one if you let.","Gerald Hassell","Sure. So I will start with part of that the collateral services I think we said in our commentary that the traction we\u2019re seeing is really on the optimization and the segregation side of it. We\u2019re beginning to see the early signs as equal to transformation where someone has the wrong collateral in the wrong place and also as more and more transactions are required to be collateralized all around the world there is more increasing activity. It has been slower over the last eight years than we thought it but it\u2019s now picking up pace and it is showing up in our numbers and some of our growth rates. And that\u2019s one of the contributors to solid investment services fees growth for the quarter.","Tri-party repo and tri-party repo reform certainly the technology expense that we have put into that is largely behind us. We have a couple of more waves to complete but they\u2019re really very-very technical in nature. And generally as you can see our tri-party balances are going up they\u2019re probably shrinking in the U.S. and growing outside the U.S. with the others in the U.S. are getting smaller in their positions but it\u2019s being taken up by the secondary the others and the non-U.S. players. So it\u2019s a global business for us not only in tri-party but collateral services broadly. So we are actually quite encouraged with the potential growth rates of the business. Your last point or question should we give more clarity around it, that\u2019s something we\u2019re thinking about. But we will to be continued as they say Todd I don\u2019t know if you want to add?","Todd Gibbons","Or Curt you want to add anything to?","Kurt Woetzel","No I just maybe Brian a little color of what\u2019s maybe some of the activity that are really driving the growth and it\u2019s really the equity securities financing that is going on around the globe it\u2019s one piece of that puzzle. The other is, is that the collateralization of things like ETFs that need collateral underneath them and third is really the OTC market having to be now collateralized and segregated and we are a natural place for that to happen between two parties. And lastly we\u2019re helping the CCPs around the globe in segregation capabilities whether it be providing our technology, our knowhow or being a custodian on behalf of those of those segregation activities. So really those are the underlying drivers to the growth that we\u2019ve seen over the last year and even a little longer.","Todd Gibbons","Brian, probably also worth noting that, the FSB put out a proposal this week around required minimum margins for transactions done with the banking system. At this point I don\u2019t know Curt if you want to comment on that, we don\u2019t really see that having a tremendous effect. It will take a little bit of leverage out of the market but we don\u2019t see it either as a positive or a negative at this point.","Kurt Woetzel","Well, the one thing it will drive is people have got to be smarter about their collateral and how to optimize it and make sure it\u2019s in the right place to reduce the capital cost associated with the margin cost associated with it. That\u2019s where I think our technology and algorithms are great vehicle for being able to do that. And we\u2019ve always said that our benefits in the marketplace is really our technology not the margining that we do. So, if it\u2019s a standard margin across the world, we don\u2019t see any impact to us in terms of strength of our business model. We believe in technology and algorithms and solutions.","Todd Gibbons","And Brian in response to the disclosure and we have components of this is in net interest income and the securities finance some portions of it\u2019s in our securities lending activities some of it\u2019s in our asset servicing fees and the tri-party itself the custodial function that we show there it\u2019s not a huge number. So this is hard for us to break out something like that.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank","And then just maybe talk about Investor Day a little bit more deeply would help since it is a good growth area but that\u2019s helpful. And then two tiny clarifications I think Todd did you say that tax rate was 25 to 27 or did you say 27?","Todd Gibbons","No, I meant to say 27 and I slipped 20 some and I would like it to be 25.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank","And then just if you could confirm the corporate trust run off is it still an 18 months drag on the fee revenues? And then I just want to squeeze in one there on the money in motion on the fixed -- on the active income side Blackrock said they thought they can gain about something in the 10s billions of over about a year or so in terms of market share. Maybe Curtis if you could opine on that.","Curtis Arledge","We\u2019ll let you know with all of those follow-ups we\u2019re trying to restrict it to one follow-up.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank","I am sorry, yes okay.","Todd Gibbons","I think the first question was related to corporate trust I would say that that\u2019s consistent. We still -- we feel pretty confident that that\u2019s starting to slow and we\u2019ll turn over that time period. And then I will turn the other one over to Curtis.","Curtis Arledge","So that there clearly money in motion as you pointed out we\u2019ve already seen it. We have both funded wins and to be funded wins as well as verbal commitments that we\u2019re seeing both in the U.S. and beginning to happen globally as well. We do think this is something that is going to play out overtime. A lot of commotion right now, but we actually think it will be sustained and do think that money in motion is always on to our benefit. I will tell you that we feel very well positioned here both because we have strong performance an array of vey deep capabilities and very importantly a tremendous amount of capacity. A lot of people who are thinking about whether they should put their own in motion are evaluating just how large any centralized investment thing can be. And so because our multi-boutique model is perfectly suited for those people who are looking for deep capabilities but not too big, so that\u2019s a big part of our focus.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank","Thank you very much.","Todd Gibbons","Thanks Brian.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jeffery Elliott with Autonomous Research.","Jeffery Elliott - Autonomous Research","","You mentioned the decline in large broker\u2019s matchbook, what do you think is behind that? Is it this daily reporting of the Form SLR 2052 to the Fed do you think that what has prompted them to bring down the matchbooks or do you think it\u2019s growth of assets?","Todd Gibbons","I think it\u2019s very simple. And you have said supplemental leverage ratio and cost-to-capital being applied against this, and the cost of financing has significantly increased so the cost of them to carry that matchbook is much greater than what it once was.","Gerald Hassell","And Jeff the other thing I would add to that is. The leverage ratio even before you get into the SLR the leverage ratio could be a constraining factor in somebody\u2019s CCAR analysis. So that the very low yield and very low return treasury type of repo really doesn\u2019t make sense for them to continue to hold in a matchbook if it\u2019s going to put pressure on their CCAR performance.","Jeffery Elliott - Autonomous Research","","And then just one quick bit of clarification, you mentioned flat expenses for the full year. What\u2019s the base we should be looking at for that, should we be taking out any of the one offs in year-to-date 2014?","Todd Gibbons","Yes. The way we disclosed operating expenses it excludes M&I litigation and restructuring. So that\u2019s what I mean by flat operating expenses on a year-over-year basis. We would expect those to be flat.","Jeffery Elliott - Autonomous Research","Great, thank you very much.","Todd Gibbons","Thanks Jeff.","Gerald Hassell","Thank you, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you. Good morning. Todd you mentioned that you extended out the duration of the securities portfolio with the change in strategy. How far out is that duration and how far out are you willing to go with the rate environment the way it is?","Todd Gibbons","Yes, not much Gerard. We are bold and we are buying two and three year types of securities. So the duration of that portfolio would have just inched up a little bit. The contraction and interest rates that we have seen on the securities that have negative convexity has probably brought that duration back to flat over the past few days actually. But where there is a huge opportunity cost for us to do that. And we don\u2019t think that getting a little bit of current income at that that kind of an opportunity cost makes a heck of a lot of a sense right now.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, thank you. And then on the operating expense side, the quarter expenses you guys have done an amenable job in keeping that down. Can you share with us from a regulatory cost standpoint, I don\u2019t know if you want to give us the dollar amount but what percentage of your operating costs would you define as regulatory related today versus three or four years ago. How much has it -- obviously it\u2019s gone up and we are just trying to frame out how much has it gone up?","Todd Gibbons","","Gerard it\u2019s a substantial number. It\u2019s hard to tease out with any real procession. Because you might have some areas for example that have got more efficient but they have had take on a lot more regulatory. So we can certainly look at projects and the costs associated with executing projects whether it\u2019s compliance with the LCR, the new BASAL standards, the resolution recovery back and so forth. When we look at some of our key functions we are seeing substantial rises. We also had indicated that specifically in our tri-party reform efforts that our cost in operating that business went up as much as $80 million for all of the broker dealer and tri-party clearance business. So we have not reported anything more specific than that but I would say it is substantial.","Gerald Hassell","That $80 million is just one example for one narrow business. So you can project that across all of our businesses. And put a multiplier factor on that. And it\u2019s a big number.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets","Would you guys say that regulatory costs are cresting? Obviously there has been a big ramp over the last five years. But are we near peak where they will just stabilize I know this is still just an onward and upward number?","Todd Gibbons","Gerard the statement that we have made is we don\u2019t think that the rate of increase is increasing. So I wouldn\u2019t say that is necessarily cresting. We are still seeing we have new items coming on. You have the NSFR that we are going to eventually have to report. There is going to be more work around resolution and recovery planning so you have a number of new items that we face. We\u2019re putting some things behind us some things are still in the developmental and so there are some things that we\u2019ll probably see in the future and it is hard to project if there might be additions. So that\u2019s what we know. So it seems like our spend rate is stabilizing, the growth rates not nearly as significant as it was but it is on a bigger base.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets","","Thank you, I appreciate the color.","Operator","","Thank you. The next question is from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","","Hey. Good morning. Just a quick question on the asset management business, I mean LDI have seem some good flows. But if you look at the equity side of the equation you\u2019ve had net outflows for the last four quarters is that a performance thing or can you just kind of help us think through the flows on the equity side?","Todd Gibbons","","Yes, absolutely. I think there are a couple of things going on in there. One is we absolutely saw re-bouncing, as you saw at the end of last year markets have done well, a lot of the activity there was from clients who had come to us and invested when the equity markets were at lower valuations and were taking money off the table. Through this year has been a continuation of that there had not been any significant outflow from any one place. Again we have an array of equity investment firms and each of them had experienced some level of outflow across some of their product offerings. Where performance is always going to be differentiated across our entire platform and where performance had been on the softer side close have absolutely been more in those areas. So, there is absolutely some linkage when a client is taking money out of the equity market that they think about what performance has been. So there is some linkage but it is nothing that I would say is systemic in any one place. I will tell you that where we one of the things that a number of our firms do is focus a lot on generating returns against the risk that they are taking so very focused on TARP ratio and also in managing against downside scenarios. And the last month some of the strategies that might have lagged a bit during the past year or so have actually done exceedingly well so you have the broad story.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","And has it been mostly concentrated in institutional or across both retail and institutional?","Todd Gibbons","Better to the size of institutional it's much more institutional.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","","Thank you. The next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","","Thanks. Sorry for a follow-up here it is a quick numbers question. But Todd I just did double check on the expense comment you made I mean it looks like if you take your core number last year and you\u2019re seeing kind of the same and back into the fourth quarter you got a pretty meaningful step up closer to like a $2.9 billion run rate which is like a two, six and change you\u2019ve been doing it is a lot or what kind of over the course of the year. Is that the right way to think about it and then if so like what essentially would cause the step up in the fourth quarter?","Todd Gibbons","That sounds a little bit high Alex, take a little sharper look at it and we are excluding M&I restructuring and litigation.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Okay. So you are saying like 267 is still the number essentially for the next quarter?","Todd Gibbons"," ","I would expect again we had indicated that we would expect it to increase from the third quarter for all the seasonal factors that I mentioned. Important for example DR revenue doesn\u2019t have a lot of expense with it, it can be likely but not all of that will be replaced with lower margin business that will be one of the drivers that you have to take into consideration. The other driver is that we have quite a few of our business development conferences and so forth in the fourth quarter that will step up and also our consulting and legal expenses we would expect to be higher in the fourth quarter. So making adjustments for those you will see them up but in aggregate for the full year, I think you\u2019ll see it flat maybe for, maybe a little bit down.","Gerald Hassell"," ","And Alex just adding, I think we have a line item in the statements for you where the third quarter of last year was 2.682 versus the third quarter of this year 2.673 and that\u2019s why, and that\u2019s the way we look at it in terms of the core operating expense to the company was actually down slightly year-over-year and we want to try to hold expenses flat for the entire year.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Got it. Alright. Thanks we can follow-up offline.","Gerald Hassell","Okay. Thanks, Alex.","Operator","","Thank you. Our final question today is from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse.","Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse","","Hi, guys. I just wanted to get back in, and just ask your broader bigger picture question. Just given that your influence in the fixed income markets, I was just hoping to share some color on any of the portfolio the liquidity challenges or investment options you\u2019re seeing out there today?","Gerald Hassell"," ","There is not a whole lot of investment opportunities in a very-very low interest rate environment and they are negative interest rate environment in Europe. So we can let the equity challenges are Todd sited in earlier, you look at money market funds trying to find places to invest when the dealer book is shrinking you have got to reverse repo market that has a demand much greater than the $300 billion cap. The demand was 407 billion. At the end of the third quarter I suspect the demand is going to be even higher than that in the fourth quarter, so if that sort of photonic plates working against each other the dealers the dealer books their balance sheets are shrinking by design for capital and cost purposes. And the liquidity that\u2019s in the system is even higher. So there is a lot of search going on for some plates to put the liquidity and get some yield. And it\u2019s a really hard equation right now.","Curtis Arledge","","And actually it\u2019s Curtis. I would add it has been a lot of chatter about market liquidity has resulted in change in regulation, change in repo markets. And I do think that there is nervousness among market participants about the idea that if there were a rush out of asset classes that we would see limited liquidity. We saw a little bit of that I think over the past couple of weeks where markets were more volatile and there were some balances on the liquidity. One of the things that\u2019s interesting about that period is it was while interest rates were falling. And so generally the valuations and fixed income markets in aggregate we are not as stressed. I think that periods of that liquidity in a rising rate environment are the ones where a lot of scenarios get drawn out and that\u2019s actually if you sit here at BNY Mellon and you watch the entire evolution of market structure from both investment services and investment management perspective. We really do believe that the electronic platforms are being put in place, and that the all the work around collateral for all our transactions are going to occur critical. And we thing it is actually a pretty big opportunity for us to help recreate the tools of liquidity that the markets are going to need with whatever market environment we are in, so Kurt I don\u2019t know if you want to.","Gerald Hassell","","Okay. Well thank you everybody for dialing in. Just again to summarize we are encouraged by our results in the third quarter. However, we strongly believe we can in fact improve our financial performance even greater than what\u2019s reflected in this quarter and we will be discussing more of that in the -- and our upside at our Investor Day later this month. So look forward to talking to you all and seeing in person at the end of the month. And just as a reminder if you have additional questions please follow-up with Izzy Dawood. So thank you very much for joining us today.","Operator","","Thank you. If there are any additional questions or comments you may contact Mr. Izzy Dawood at 212-635-1850.

This morning BNY Mellon released the results for the third quarter of 2018. The earnings press release and a financial highlights presentation to accompany this teleconference are both available on our website at bnymellon.com. Charlie Scharf, BNY Mellon\u2019s chairman and chief executive officer will lead this morning's conference call. Also making prepared remarks on the call this morning is Mike Santomassimo, our chief financial officer. Following Mike's remarks there will be a Q&A session.","Before we begin please note that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release, the financial highlights presentation and in our documents filed with the SEC available on our website bnymellon.com. Forward looking statements made on this call speak only as of today October 18, 2018. We will not update forward-looking statements.","With that I will now turn it over to Charlie.","Charlie Scharf","Thank You Scott and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining our third quarter earnings call. Before asking Mike to walk you through the financials let me frame the quarter with some thoughts on how our businesses are performing. In terms of the headline numbers earnings per share of a $1.06 was up 13% from last year's third quarter. These results included two significant items approximately $0.05 from litigation charges and a $0.05 benefit in our tax line. Year-over-year revenue grew 1%. Expenses grew 3% though 2% of that was related to litigation and we continue to benefit from reduction in our tax rate related to the new tax law in the U.S. and from strong capital return. While we are not pleased with our total revenue growth for this quarter there are some areas with modest strengths and others that are weaker several of which we believe will strengthen over the time. Our investment services revenue growth was 3% and investment management revenue growth is 2%. These were partially offset by lower revenue in the other segments. Mike will cover that later.","As I said since joining the company we're not satisfied with our growth. As we've been too reliant historically on the impact of the markets, our focus on organic growth will take time to show up in the revenue line across our businesses and though small there continue to be signs of positive momentum in some areas which we'll cover. With the reality that it will take time to see the impact of our growth activities show up in the revenue growth line, we are disciplined on expenses and will continue to be. Though our expenses increased 3% I mentioned that 2% of the increased related to litigation. So excluding litigation charges we at minimal expense growth. You also know that we've been significantly increasing our investment in technology and infrastructure to get to minimal expense growth all other expenses in total were lower than the prior year. I will discuss this a little more later but we will continue to focus on improving our structural operating leverage while continuing to invest for growth.","Looking at our businesses let me first start with asset servicing. Asset servicing revenue growth is 3% and we had a reasonable fee that interest revenue and FX growth. We again saw steady performance in our core custody, middle office and fund accounting revenues on-boarding more than $450 billion of AUCA across a number of investment managers and other clients. Additionally, we have a mandate to provide middle office outsourcing for significant private credit manager where we're investing in new capabilities.","Securities lending benefited from the increased demand for highly liquid assets primarily U.S. treasuries and we're benefiting from new clients and expanded business with existing clients and our growth in client driven foreign exchange revenue was driven by new business wins, higher session range volumes and market spreads. Our global pipeline remains strong across all major assets servicing products. As asset managers continue to look for ways to reduce their costs we're seeing increasing consolidation of global operations and technology which is driving demand for outsourcing managed services and data management solutions. In Pershing while we saw a reduction in revenue last quarter from two previously disclosed client losses our total revenues were flat to last quarter and up 3% from the prior year.","So this means growth is offsetting these losses. As a reminder we've been awarded multiple mandates that will begin to positively impact results starting in the second half of next year and more significantly into 2020. Timing aside we're confident as ever in our ability to continue to build Pershing over the long term.","In issuer services, revenue growth of 2% was driven by mid-single digit growth in corporate trusts partially offset by a decline in depository receipts. Quarter-by-quarter performance in depository receipts as episodic and several significant client events have been pushed from the third quarter into future quarters. Although, the DR markets are weak we're winning our fair share now while remaining disciplined on structure and full-year revenue growth should be strong.","Corporate trusts revenue growth was driven by the repositioning of our front office sales and relationship management teams and by better coordinating with our firm wide global client management team to leverage our relationships for deals that our financial institutions and asset management clients are bringing. This is yielding opportunities and mandates and I should add that our pipeline remains strong particularly for CLOs and corporate debt. We have had good momentum with clients although market share stats are imperfect in this business it appears that we've gained some traction in the first half of the year.","We've also started to deliver new digital capabilities that give clients better transparency into their loan positions, compliance data, cash activity and trade information and it's been well received.","In treasury services, Paul Camp joined us this quarter as the new leader for this business. Paul has tremendous experience and has already brought a renewed sense of urgency and has some great ideas for building our business into a stronger growth engine for the company. Having said that we continue to see growth albeit less than we like in our payment volumes from existing and new clients and are focused on growing the liability balances from our treasury services clients.","We're continuing to invest in capabilities such as real-time payments which should help differentiate our offering. In clearance and collateral management we reported 8% revenue growth. We again saw strong revenue growth from the on-boarding of the remaining former JP Morgan government clearing broker dealer clients, higher clearance volumes related to record issuance levels and strong demand for U.S. government debt and treasury issuances and growth in collateral management activity from new business and increased client activity. Here we're seeing interest from new entrants to the collateral market such as corporates in alternatives investing their cash in repo as well as the continued rollout of rules requiring segregation of margin related to derivatives.","Our capabilities in clearance and collateral management are a clear point of differentiation. Once such point of differentiation is our collateral optimization engine, it has significant growth potential as collateral management business becomes increasingly important part of the investment process. Turning to investment management, the environment continues to be difficult for the industry and we achieved 2% revenue growth this quarter. We continue to focus on investment performance drive to scaling our business, invest in product development and distribution capabilities and strengthen our wealth management franchise.","Net flows return positive this quarter with $15 billion in net inflows. We saw strong flows in LDI as well as positive flows and fixed income and multi assets in alternatives and our U.S. multi asset manager which we've rebranded Mellon has had good activity across a range of asset types including entering into a new sub advisory partnership. In our wealth management business Catherine Keating joined us as CEO and is already identifying opportunities to strengthen this business. We have lot more to say about this in the future.","In terms of talent we are continuing to attract great people at all levels of the company. We are working to develop and capitalize on the deep knowledge and specialized expertise that exists across our company and complimenting that with new outside perspectives. In addition to appointing Catherine we added a number of other senior leaders this quarter who expect to play the major roles in increased growth and profitability. These include Roman Regelman who joined us as head of digital he will lead and coordinate our thinking as he set the strategic direction for additional future including data management, analytics, artificial intelligence, machine learning and robotics. Akash Shah has joined the company in the newly created role of head of strategy.","Akash joined us from McKinsey where he called at the capital markets and investment banking practice. And has a strong background focused on exactly what were the [indiscernible 00:58-3] transforming businesses for the future and positioning them to drive organic growth and innovation. Emily Portney joined us as our new head of assets servicing for the Americas and will help drive our business forward in the U.S., Latin America as well as overseeing our interest in the CIBC Mellon Assets Servicing a joint venture in Canada. And we announced two key technology hires after quarter end Sabet Elias has joined us as chief technology officer bringing extensive experience in building and operating global high performance machine critical technology environments and Avi Shua was appointed technology lead for wealth management helping us build technology platforms to grow our wealth management business which as I said is a key priority.","We are thrilled at our ability to attract such an outstanding group from top tier institutions. So as we look forward, we will continue to methodically build out our capabilities and teams. We have been investing in technology both to improve our existing operations in infrastructure and to build new capabilities for clients and we will continue to invest. We will remain keenly focused on expenses. We continue to believe there is meaningful opportunities to become more efficient which will help fund the technology investments we need to make as well as provide improved service for our clients and we are highly focused on driving that efficiency in both the short and long term. And I will close by describing how I think you would feel if you are inside the company. As I have said we are proud company and we are strong company with exceptional client relationships and we have great subject matter expertise inside the company.","But we are not performing as well financially as we would like. We believe our franchise is capable of delivering more organic growth than we delivered thus far. And we are focused business-by-business on changing our thinking developing capabilities, improving the quality of our work and aligning internal resources to achieve this end becoming more efficient is important part of the puzzle. We believe that increased efficiency improves the quality of our work, allows us to invest in what's important for our clients and its pro growth. Importantly, there is a shared understanding that we will hold each other accountable for higher standards of performance and proceed with the strong sense of urgency. Given the nature of our business all the work we are doing will take time to come through in our numbers but I want you to know that every day we are challenging ourselves to get there faster. With that let me turn the call over to Mike.","Mike Santomassimo","Great. Thanks Charlie. Good morning everyone. Let me run through the details of our results. Then provide some thoughts on the fourth quarter. Note that all comparisons will be on year-over-year basis unless I specify otherwise.","Beginning on page 3 of the financial highlights document, in the third quarter we had earnings of $1.1 billion and earnings per share of a $1.06 up 13%. There were two significant items included in the quarter. We incurred litigation charges that increased expenses 2% which negatively impacted earnings per share by approximately $0.05. The charges related to new development for the quarter are previously disclosed matters that we anticipate resolving shortly.","And we had a net benefit of approximately $0.05 per share resulting from adjustments to our provisional estimates for the impact of the U.S. tax legislation from last year and other tax changes with decreased the effective tax rate by approximately 4.5%.","Year-to-date we had earnings of $3.3 billion or $3.20 per share up 21%. In terms of shareholder capital returned year-to-date we have returned $2.7 billion to common shareholders through $1.9 billion of share repurchases and approximately $800 million in dividends. That includes actions taken during the third quarter where we repurchased 12 million shares for $602 million and paid $283 in dividends. ","Now turning to the third quarter highlights on page 4. During the third quarter total revenue was up 1%, we did have a couple of items that impacted the revenue growth rate. Securities gains in the third quarter of 2017, lowered foreign exchange currency hedging revenue and the pre-tax impact of our renewable energy investments negatively impacted growth by almost 1.5%. Just a reminder that we get the benefit of our wind investments or renewable energy investments in the tax line but have pre-tax costs that are included in investment in other income. Fee revenue was up 1% to $3.2 billion growth in the quarter benefited from higher equity market values, collateral management and clearance volumes and performance fees. We saw reasonable growth in our assets servicing business including the client driven foreign exchange fees as well as in our corporate trust and clearance and collateral management businesses.","Investment management and performance fees together grew 2%. Fees and purging were essentially flat despite the impact of the previously lost clients. Third quarter net interest revenue increased 6% to $$891 million driven by higher interest rates partially offset by lower interest earning deposits and other borrowings. As expected our deposit balances were down year-over-year and sequentially. Year-over-year our average interest-bearing deposits increased 4% while our average non-interest bearing deposits declined 14%. As we have consistently said for our clients that deposit pricing is continually becoming more competitive. With betas increasing as rates rise.","On page 7 of our earnings release you can see that the rates on our interest bearing deposits increased from 45 basis points in the second quarter to 63 basis points this quarter. On the surface this would imply deposit beta of approximately 72% globally but when you get to the underlying data for interest-bearing U.S. dollar client deposits which excludes wholesale funding, it is really in low to mid 80% range.","The net interest margin increased 12 basis points to 1.27% sequentially the, NIM was up one basis point. Our expenses grew 3% to $2.7 billion as I mentioned earlier litigation increased expenses approximately 2%. The remaining growth in the quarter was due to the continued investments we were making in technology which was partially offset by declines in other areas. As Charlie mentioned we are focused on delivering on our technology investments and driving efficiency across everything else we do. All these items resulted in a 2% decline in pre-tax income to $1.3 billion. The litigation charges negatively impacted pre-tax income growth by approximately 4% and a 9% increase in net income applicable to common shareholders to $1.1 billion which benefited from the lower tax rate.","This performance coupled with the reduction in our share account translated to a [13%] increase in earnings per share to $1.06. Our pre-tax operating margin was 33% down 1% from the prior year period. Again the litigation negatively impacted the pre-tax margin by approximately 100 basis points. Our capital position and returns continue to be strong. Our CET1 ratio with 11.2% and our return on tangible common equity was 23%. Before we go deeper into the quarter on page 6 are the year-to-date results which track well with the discussion we had at investor day.","Total revenue was up approximately 5% and expenses were up approximately 3% generating solid operating leverage. Foreign exchange translation increased old growth rates by about 100 basis points. Net income applicable to common shareholders was up 17%. Earnings per share was up 21% and return on tangible common equity was up more than 200 basis points to more than 24%.","Page 8 highlights our investment services business results. Investment services revenue was $3.1 billion up 3%. Within investment services assets servicing revenue grew 3% to 1.5 billion primarily reflecting higher equity market values, securities lending volumes, net interest revenue and foreign exchange volumes. This includes a reasonable increase in assets servicing fees and a 27% increase in securities lending revenue driven by increased demand for U.S. government securities and some new client activity. Purging revenue was up 3% to $558 million a result of higher net interest revenue, equity markets, long-term mutual fund balances partially offset by the impact of previously disclosed lost business.","As I mentioned fees were flat despite the impact of their previously disclosed lost business. Issuer services revenue was up 2% to $453 million primarily reflecting higher interest revenue in corporate trusts. Corporate trusts related revenue was up mid-single digits offset by declines in depository receipts. The sequential increase of 5% reflects seasonality in depository receives.","Treasury services revenue increased 3% year-over-year to $324 million primarily reflecting higher net interest revenue and transaction volumes. Clearance and collateral management revenue was up 8% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially to $264 million. The year-over-year increase reflects growth in collateral management clearance volumes in net interest revenues. These increases are primarily due to the on-boarding of the new government clearing clients which was substantially completed in the quarter. As a result of the clients onboard and other increases in activity average tri-party collateral manager balances were up 18% and are just under 3 trillion.","Non-interest expense within investment services increased 8% year-over-year and 3% sequentially to $2 billion. The litigation charge negatively impacted expenses by approximately 3% year-over-year and sequentially. The remaining expense growth was primarily driven by increased investments in technology offset by lower staff expense. ","Also foreign exchange and other trading revenue increased 5% from higher volumes. Assets under custody and\/or administration grew 7% to $34.5 trillion and in pershing despite the lost business average long-term mutual fund assets were up 5% year-over-year and average clearing accounts were down just 2%. So some key metrics are showing positive momentum at point to higher organic revenue over time.","Turning to page 9 for investment management highlights. Asset management revenue increased 2% to $704 million benefiting from growth in the equity markets and higher performance fees which were partially offset by the impact of net outflows in prior quarters and by lost revenue associated with the sales center square.","Wealth management revenue was up 1% to $311 million and down 2% sequentially with the sequential decline a result of lowered interest revenue partially offset by higher equity market values.","Assets under management increased slightly year-over-year and increased 1% sequentially to 1.8 trillion. Asset flows improved in most asset classes with net flows of $15 billion. Our actively managed strategies experienced 18 billion in net inflows with $16 billion in LDI inflows, $2 billion in multi asset and alternative inflows and $2 billion in fixed income flows partially offset by active equity outflows of $2 billion. Index had outflows of $3 billion primarily due to outflows from clients for whom we supervised on their index strategies. Cash was flat.","Turning to our other segments on page 10 fee revenue decreases year-over-year sequentially primarily reflecting the pre-tax impact of our investments in renewable energy as I mentioned before we get the benefit from these investments in tax line and foreign currency hedging. Non-interest expense decrease primarily reflecting lower staff cost.","Turning to capital and liquidity on page 11 our capital and liquidity ratios at September 30, 2018 improved since the end of the second quarter. Common equity tier 1 capital totaled $18.5 billion at September 30, 2018 and our CET1 ratio was 11.2% under the advanced approach. The supplementary leverage ratio was 6.4% and our average LCR in the third quarter was 121%.","Now page 12 details our expenses. On a consolidated basis expenses of $2.7 billion increased 3%. The litigation charges negatively impacted the expense growth by approximately 2%. The remaining growth is primarily due to investments in technology partially offset by lower staff expense and lower distribution and servicing expenses. Note that the technology expenses are included in staff, professional, legal, and other purchase services and in software equipment. Expenses were down slightly sequentially primarily reflecting lower net occupancy staff and business development expenses partially offset by higher litigation. The decrease in net occupancy expense is primarily due to the expenses associated with the relocation of our headquarters that was recorded in the second quarter.","Now looking ahead to the fourth quarter there are a few things to factor in your modeling. As a reminder our results in the fourth quarter of 2017 included impacts from the U.S. tax bill and severance litigation and other charges. The total cost of relocating our corporate headquarters is estimated to be approximately $75 million of which $12 million was recorded in the second quarter and we expect to record the remaining expense in the fourth quarter.","Excluding the real estate cost we would expect the growth rate of our overall expenses in the fourth quarter year-over-year to be directionally similar to what you've seen year-to-date which implies in modest uptake from the third quarter consistent with prior years. As it relates to net interest revenue you should factor in the following. At this early point in the quarter overall deposit levels are slightly higher than the average for the third quarter with non-interest bearing deposits about at the same level.","As rates rise we expect deposit beta to continue to increase which we think is consistent with what is happening in the market. We are assuming that one month and three month LIBOR are slightly above the current level on average for the quarter but we have seen some compression and spreads between one month and three months LIBOR and the fed funds rate that will have an impact in the fourth quarter. If these assumptions play out it should result in net interest revenue being similar to what you saw this quarter.","Fourth quarter seasonal performance fees are expected to be in line with the fourth quarter of 2017 and excluding the significant items in the third quarter we still expect our full-year effective tax rate to be approximately 21%. With that operator can you please open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Good morning guys. On the asset servicing business so wonder if you can detail a little bit more the flattish kind of results but you said you had some benefits from the broker-dealer business. Can you walk us through how did collateral management act and just out of the core asset servicing act? You mentioned some pending potential wins and not sure if you meant that those were converted as well. So just if we can get the flush out color on what you're seeing currently and what you're expecting out of the core asset servicing. Thanks.","Charlie Scharf","Hey Ken are you talking about asset servicing or pershing?","Ken Usdin","Asset servicing. Didn't the broker dealer clients come in throughout the servicing are you saying they came in through clearing on the fee side? Somebody at the income statement.","Charlie Scharf","Asset servicing revenue growth was 3% overall and when you look at it the underlying fee growth was reasonable we had net interest revenue growth and FX growth. ","Mike Santomassimo","Yes, so I think so let me sort of dig in a little bit Ken for you. So obviously I will just pick it apart so tell me if I miss something but for the new clients that Charlie referenced that we on-boarded very little revenue in the quarter from them so far. So you'll start to see that kick in as you look forward. So that didn't contribute much to this quarter. I think for the where you'll see the new JP Morgan, the clients that converted over from JP Morgan that'll be in the clearance and collateral business line in our release and as you sort of think about the asset service seeing fee line as Charlie said when you sort of dig into the underlying businesses both an asset servicing and clearance and collateral we saw some reasonable growth involved quarter-to-quarter.","Ken Usdin","I got it. Yes there's a little mixing matching there between business line and income statement I think that's where my question was a bit confusing but thanks for clearing that up Mike. And then okay so then separately just on the balance sheet the beta's can you talk about \u2013 you talked about that you expect them to move up from here, can you do it \u2013 would you still anticipate as long as LIBOR is moving the right way can the NIM expand from here or is it going to be more of a function of just what the mix is looking like every quarter because obviously there's pushes and pulls between the dollars and the NIM spread.","Mike Santomassimo","Yes, I think on NIM Ken, I don't know that you can expect it's always going to be a straight line up right, but I think you sort of look at the various components of it that where we're sort of our biggest driver as you know well is sort of how we were reinvesting in securities portfolio and those deals continue to sort of move up each quarter.","So, all the we're seeing probably a 15 basis points sort of increase and sort of pay downs versus where we're reinvesting their votes. So, maybe a little more little less depending on an average depending on sort of where you are. So, I think you can see the NIM sort of grind up over time but I don\u2019t know that you can always expect it to be sort of a straight line up every quarter.","And I think when it goes to LIBOR, as we said in sort of my commentary, we're sort of expecting LIBOR to be slightly above, call it a few basis points above what you see one and three months today and that all sort of give you the result of which sort of highlighted in the release.","Charlie Scharf","The only thing I'd add is just remembering the timing of the change in days doesn't always align with the timing of the re-pricing of our portfolio. Yes.","Ken Usdin","Thanks guys, I appreciate that.","Charlie Scharf","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","Hi guys, good morning and thanks for taking the question. Just picking up on the last discussion. I guess, understanding that quarter-to-quarter the balance sheet could be a little volatile but as you look out to next couple of years and we continue to go through the rate cycle, how do you expect the balance sheet to perform.","Do you think there is any growth there or do should we think the balance sheet will continue to kind of shrink and then in terms of the mix between interest and non-interest bearing deposits, kind of similar so I guess that has been coming down a little bit, I think you guys have about 29% of non-interest bearing as a percentage of total.","When you look pre-crisis, I think that was somewhere in the mid-20. So, should we think of that as still kind of reasonable level toward non-interest bearing deposits will go?","Charlie Scharf","Hey Alex, it's Charlie. Let me start with just some broad comments and then I'll hand it over to Mike. I think one of the interesting thing is that we have as we've gone through this rate cycle, as I think we all believe that we can be far more proactive as we do of our clients in understanding what's going on with deposits and being more proactive without attracting the kind of deposits that we would like to attract.","I think its true and almost all the businesses that we have. So, I think the level of rigor that we have today about thinking about rates, thinking about conversations with clients, making our desires clear across asset servicing corporate trust, clearing some collateral management, treasury services, all of them.","I think over a period of time, we feel absolutely like we could do a better job at attracting balances as opposed to having balances just be something that happens to us. That obviously takes some period of time but it's a very different kind of discussion today than we were having six or nine months ago here.","Mike Santomassimo","And I would, I'll add a few things. So, I'll just add and as we sort of grow the underlying client franchise, that's going to bring deposits with us. So, that's another piece where you will see some grow overtime. I think, as you sort of think about the non-interest bearing deposits in the percentage of the total, I think we've been pretty consistent over the last couple of years that we seem to add that percentage will sort of grind down.","But it's been it bumps around a little bit quarter-to-quarter, a little lower last quarter to a little 29%. This quarter you can see that from the release. I will though just remind you a little bit about the nature of our deposit base. We don\u2019t just close non-interest bearing by line of business but when you sort of what we showed at the Investor Day was about half of our deposits in total are from asset servicing.","And the rest the next biggest pieces are corporate trust and treasury services. When you look at the non-interest bearing components of it, the percentage that come from the asset servicing business, that sort of traditional asset managers hedge fund private equity, the whole mix is far less than 50%.","So, the other pieces of the puzzle namely corporate trust and trading services drive the bigger piece of the overall non-interest bearing for us. So, that should sort of needs to be factored in and so sort of think about the trajectory of them over time.","Alex Blostein","Got it. Thanks for that, it's a useful color. And I guess my second question just around clearing fees and those are just the actual fees and not the entire business line item. So, down a little sequentially and I think it's largely a U.S. business for you guys.","So, I guess market should have been a little bit of a helper. Is it all due to just below our client activities, lower volumes, in the third quarter or is there something there going on underneath?","Mike Santomassimo","I mean, the third quarter typically is a little bit slower than the second quarter but so there's nothing there's no underlying trend there at all.","Alex Blostein","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning, thanks for taking the questions. Just actually wanted to follow up on that last point in question on the non-interest bearers and like there was thanks for enlightening us all of the different business mix which definitely leads to a larger portion and non-interest -- deposits.","Mike Santomassimo","Wait, see -- what.","Brennan Hawken","In the past we've heard that there were certain economic incentives provided to clients such as fee credits on some of those non-interest bearers. But that explanation was under the prior management team. So, kind of curious whether you all have sustained some of those incentives or whether the approach to those deposits has changed at all under your guy's plans and your approach.","Mike Santomassimo","Now, hi Brennan. I think that where you have earnings credits which is a pretty normal thing to do for some businesses has really focused on our Treasury Services business. You don\u2019t see earnings credits at any or not really prevalent than the other businesses.","And so, that's how which is a pretty consistent way that us and others provide value for some of those client deposits in treasury services.","Brennan Hawken","Okay, great. Thanks for clarifying that. And then, thinking about the portion of deposits that are in U.S. dollar, is it still around 70% for you all and if so was there just some kind of noise in the deposit cost this quarter or catch-up or what have you that worked out to about the 80% deposit beta that you referenced Mike earlier.","Because when I do the math, I get to a number that's a bit higher than that. So, just curious whether I need to make some adjustments to my calc.","Mike Santomassimo","I think you do. But the -- so, I think it's sort of highlighted in my commentary, Brennan. So, it's really the wholesale funding which is a very small piece of our overall funding mix, drives some of that surface level sort of a calc that you've got there.","So, when you dig underneath that though, it's what I refer to the 80% to 80% low 80% range, low to mid-80% range, which again I'll say is very consistent with what we're seeing and hearing from clients across in markets.","Brennan Hawken","Great, thanks. Well, I'll follow-up offline for some of the details on that wholesale funding adjustment. Thank you.","Mike Santomassimo","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. ","Steven Chubak","Hi, good morning. So, I just wanted to dig in and to your just on tax some of the commentary on deposits but more specific to the impact at QV online. I think the last fulsome update you gave was at 2014 Investor Day, you guide it to about 40 to 70 billion in of expected deposits run-off from that balance sheet normalization.","And since you gave that guidance, it looks like deposits have come down about 30 billion or so. And now that we does have better visibility in that process, I was hoping you could maybe help us frame how to think about the remaining run-off impact as the fed continues its process over the next couple of years.","Mike Santomassimo","Yes. Look Steven, its Mike. Like you were referring at some guidance that was provided I think back in 2014. It's a lot obviously has evolved since then. But I think when you think about wholesale deposits more generally, they are definitely correlated to what you're seeing in excess reserves as a fed.","And so, as that sort of grinds down, you're going to see liquidity come out of the system. And that all that's equal potentially drives deposits continues to drive deposits down a bit. But as Charlie mentioned, I think we think there's an opportunity to be more proactive, smarter, about how we sort of go after the opportunity with our clients as well as sort of the impact more how this sort of grow line franchise.","So, I don\u2019t think you can just take the fed QV online is sort of let's think it about it in a linear way as you think about our deposit base.","Steven Chubak","Okay. So, just as a follow-up, is there an expectation that there's enough of it organic growth opportunity where you could actually see the deposit balances increase even with the headwind from fed QV online only because the impact seems to be fairly pronounced and the correlation quite high around 96% between the two.","Your deposits and industry excess reserves.","Mike Santomassimo","We're not going to predict it at this point. Obviously time will tell but I think we feel like we could a better job at gathering deposits in any environment whether it's in an environment with the effects of the unwinding of QV rising performing rates, any of the above, how those two interact, we'll have to see.","Steven Chubak","Got it. Thanks very much for taking my questions.","Mike Santomassimo","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Mike Carrier","Right, thanks guys. First question is just on the asset servicing and this is just on the fees. When I look at it sequentially, it seems like that was a bit more muted. You've just given what we would have expected just from the market returns.","Maybe just a little color if you can provide on what else is included in that line, is there some seasonality from like a transaction standpoint that can limit the growth in like the third quarter?","Mike Santomassimo","Yes, like I think would -- hey Mike its Mike. I think we said I think at one point a year or two ago, like that it's you can't think about it just based on what's happening in the market. The asset servicing fee line I think what we've said a while ago, let's call it 25% or 30% of it's influenced by overall market levels or the -- and that will sort of move up and down.","But you've got impacts from transaction volumes that go through there and a whole series of other little factors that may drive it sequentially in a quarter or two, quarter-to-quarter.","Mike Carrier","Okay, that's helpful. And then, just on the expenses, on the legal item, just any color around that and if it was like a one-off versus would be kind of ongoing legal cost. I'm just trying to understand that just in a relative to like going forward for a run rate there?","Charlie Scharf","Yes, this is Charlie. Listen, I think we have a fairly clear disclosures about what the litigation we have in progress. This one related to approaching conclusion for two of those items that were mentioned. So, we obviously have the remaining items to go.","Some might get results sooner, much some other might go around for a long time but they were known cases that moved along I would say quicker than we probably would have thought a couple of months ago and that's what happens when you have settlement discussions in there are other things going on with others in the industry as well.","Mike Carrier","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Thanks, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just go back to fourth quarter seasonality. Maybe, Mike if you could just touch on a couple of different areas. Clearly, we have the performance fees from investment management but maybe if you can flash out the deposits where you receive come in and the delay of revenue into fourth quarter from what typically is seasonally strong third quarter.","And then, any other areas clearly volumes tend to be strong in the fourth quarter but maybe just to clarify what you think can be the improvement on the Pershing side and then also the contribution from JPM on the clearance and collateral management side.","Mike Santomassimo","Okay. I'll try to pick that and maybe hopefully that go all your pieces Brian. Thanks for the question. As you sort of think about PRs, these events that cause bigger fees in any given quarter or not in our control, so it's sort of corporate rigor or dividends, splits, things like that.","And so, I think coincidentally a bunch of that stuff historically happened in the third quarter. And there's a couple of items that got pushed out of the third quarter and the future quarter. So, whether it happens in the fourth quarter or in a quarter or two, I think that will be dependent upon the clients finalizing their activities.","And so, you will sort of see that come through. But there are one or two of those as Charlie sort of mentioned. As you sort of think about Pershing on a go forth basis, I think you saw over the last two quarters that things sort of stabilize post the client losses.","We did highlight last year that there were some termination fees related to the losses in the fourth quarter. So, that will have a bit of a impact on the sequential results. But overall, we're seeing good activity in that business, pretty consistent and pretty consistent activity in that business over the last number of months.","Then I think those are the items --.","Brian Bedell","JPM clearing --.","Mike Santomassimo","Yes. So, we did finish the conversion of JPMorgan clients into the business, probably a later part of the third quarter. So, you will see a little bit of an uptick as we go into the fourth quarter, so you'll see that in the run rate as we go.","Charlie Scharf","And this is Charlie. I just want to just maybe just make a couple of comments about revenue growth look beyond next quarter. So, I think first, I guess the way I would characterize it is I think when you just think I mean look at the businesses and the way they're performing today and our expectations for opportunities are.","Within the investment services business which produce 3% revenue growth this quarter in total, asset servicing was 3% growth. When we sit here and think about the opportunities that sit in front of us versus the pressures, we think there are more opportunities than there are pressures.","We think whatever pressures exist will continue but we have opportunities to grow that business faster than we have. And as I've said that is a long cycle of business from the sales perspective and it takes time but we feel very good about our position in the opportunities.","Pershing, we've talked about multiple times, we have these, we have two specific losses that we've known about for a long time, it effects the numbers in the short term, we know we have a series of winds that were in the process of on boarding which take a long time to do the work.","We have the expenses embedded in our results or at least a big part of it to do that, we have no revenues from it, we know they're coming but more importantly we love our position in the business. We believe we got significant opportunity in the RIA space. And so, again we're not going to put timeframes around it necessarily but relative to the quality of the business and the opportunity we think it's significant.","Issue or services space, corporate trust, that is one where you start to see progress more quickly and that's a little bit lock intact going its better technology, it's a better Salesforce, that's better organized, leveraging the relationships across the franchise and we're starting to see that impact.","DRs as we said very seasonal quarter-to-quarter, lot of volatility year-over-year I think the numbers will be pretty strong relative to what we saw last year. Treasury services, new leader meaningful opportunity for us in a much more significant way than we've had in the past.","And I put wealth management in that category as well. So, I just think I know obviously there is lot of focus on quarter-by-quarter, I say this consistently hard to move these businesses in a single quarter. But as we think about what the opportunities are given the market positions that we have and the type of people that we're bringing in with the ideas that we have.","It's we certainly feel good about the opportunity, it's just going to take some time.","Brian Bedell","That was exactly my second question, Charlie through we anticipated it. Thanks for that. Maybe just one little area on middle office that you need to cover. You guys really start to ramp that up when you order the T. Rowe deal and I think you would to an another mandate coming soon.","Maybe just talk about your strategy there, obviously stage two is in the big fish in the pond on that one. Do you guys plan on being more aggressive in that space?","Charlie Scharf","Yes. I think middle office is it's complicated as you all know. It's complicated because there's no one middle office solution out in the market place. Historically, they've been very bespoke. Generally more complicated than people think when you decide to take something on. And so, I'm not sure when you look at the profitability across the industry the idea of we don\u2019t look to middle office to be a gigantic profit contributor to the company.","Having said that, it is a very it\u2019s a paying point for our clients. We think over a period of time we can't help build scale which means we have to create some more consistency in the industry. And if we can do that for clients that gives you the opportunity to talk more broadly about other pieces to the equation.","So, that's something that we are interested in doing. It has four more important deeper relations for us. And so, we'll continue to do that. Longer term more broadly, we all as an industry there's opportunities to figure out how do simplify middle office dramatically and that's something that we're equally focused on over the much longer term.","But in the short term, it is an opportunity for us to help our clients.","Brian Bedell","Great. Thank you, for the color.","Charlie Scharf","Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.","Charlie Scharf","Hi, Mike.","Mike Mayo","Hi. Charlie you spent a lot of time on the new hires. Where are you in terms of changing the culture, how long should that take and what do the new hires bring to the table?","Charlie Scharf","Yes. Obviously it's a hard question to answer where are we. I think and I tried to in my remarks talk about the way you feel if you're inside the company to get to that point. I think this is a company of 53,000 people that's done certain things a certain way and it takes time.","And when I takes time, I don\u2019t think it's a question of winning the hearts and minds of people here. I think as I said before it's a very objective group of people that come in genuinely every day and want to do a better job for the clients which ultimately should translate to better result for ourselves.","It's a question of what does that mean, how do we operate, do we have enough people role-modeling behaviors and things like that. And so, if I had to say where we were, I would probably in the earlier innings rather than the later innings but I also feel like if you were to talk to people inside the company we've been here, they would say I hope I think they would say it's fairly substantially different.","We have I think and I've seen this in my prior lives I think this question of bring accountant from the outside, it is a question of balance. And I really genuinely mean this, I've said this in my remarks, we have great subject matter expertise here.","As I've said we've got people that deeply care about clients but you can't be two inwardly focused in an environment which is changing dramatically around you. And so, the idea of bringing in people that have just been at different companies that think about the businesses differently, operate with a different sense of urgency than we've operated in the past had experienced a growing businesses.","Those are all additive to the discussion when you're sitting around the table along with that consistency. So, you will not and I had say call individuals out because it puts a lot of pressure on them and also it's a little bit unfair on everyone else. But I mention Paul Camp who joined us to run treasury services.","We have a strong treasury services business today which is high quality. But we think that we can do much more than has been done with it. I think if you were to talk to people inside the company what has Paul brought to it in the short time he's been here, you walk into a meeting with Paul and you got energy, you got excitement, he has huge respect for what's been built here in treasury services but then will talk about all the opportunities in front of us both in terms of how we organize, in terms of where we want to get more aggressive, in terms of kind of products we need to build.","So, it's just it should be a shot in the arm for business or areas that complement the great talent that we have here. So, this is not a question of replacing every job with someone on the outside but and I -- we don\u2019t usually go out and call out peoples name specifically but this it's a substantial list of people in very senior jobs which we think will be very important not just in their areas but helping shape the mind-set of what growth means.","Now, I said this before, growth has not, we just don\u2019t come in one day and decide okay we want to grow today. So, let's just tell everyone and make it happen. Growth is about teaching how to go about doing that, it's you need to think about do you have people in place that actually can think about the strengths of the organization, what products we should be building, how we should work more closely across the organization.","Do we have the right product set, do we have the right people in product development, are we incenting people properly for it. I mean, the list goes on and on. And so, having some people that have done that before that think that way, helping role model those behaviors for people here that are very open minded about it.","I hope over a period of time it just continues to build on the transformation that's in progress here. I hope that was helpful.","Mike Mayo","All right. Yes, that was very comprehensive, thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Jim Mitchell","Hey, good morning.","Charlie Scharf","Good morning.","Jim Mitchell","Maybe just a question on expense. -- good morning. A Question on expense. As you talked about a meaningful opportunity to get more efficient in the short and the long term. Can you maybe give us a little more detail on where you see the biggest opportunities to get more efficient?","Charlie Scharf","Yes. So, I think -- and thank you for the question. Because we do get a lot of questions from people saying well we've done a good job of controlling expenses over a period of time, is there more to go. I personally think there is a lot more to go and it's not because we've done a bad job, it's because it's like peeling an onion back.","The more you peel the onion back, you start to see the next layer. And I think that's what we're experiencing. And it's the short term and its long term. It is tactical and it's structural. Examples: we've done a very good job here if you look at real-estate costs.","If you look at what's driven our ability become more efficient over the past four years or so, a lot of it's been driven by being smarter about consolidating and moving the lower cost locations. Having said that, we still have more we can do. We've highlighted the fact that we relocated corporate headquarters.","The building where we're sitting in now which is our corporate headquarters, we probably have 3000 on grounding, 3000 or so people in it at the beginning of the year. We got out of 325,000 square feet couple of blocks away. Some of us are here, the rest will be here by November. We're going to get paid call it forget about the accounting for a second, we're going to get $15 million to $20 million a year by someone to sublet that space.","We have 3800 or so people in it by the end of the year. We think we can get 5000 to 6000 people in this building. And by the way, again we can go back historically and so and it's not as if that wasn\u2019t happening but as these things happen you get more and more clarity and more and more opportunity.","We think about how we manage the company. I many, pretty basic things; layers in the company. When you think about and then think about the layers between me and the most junior people inside the company. And across the company consistently it's 10 to an 11; which is far more than I've experienced in other organizations; average spends of controls.","And then you go through some of the more structural things and we just think about the physical manual work that we do that should be automated. And so, as we think and as we think about this, we're focused on really two different dimensions. 1) In the short term, we are going to spend more money on technology. That is the livelihood of who we are; we need to do it; we need to improve our basic operating infrastructure; and we need to build products and capabilities for the future.","That will take more to do. And so, we need to continue to drive these efficiencies in the shorter term, not because we needed to fund that stuff but because it will fund that stuff. And as you walk around the place, it becomes more obvious what these things are.","At the same time, over the longer term, we do need to build capabilities that allow us to become much more structurally efficient, those are multi-year projects that relate towards automating tasks that are manual today using technology and things like that.","So, as we look over in a multi-year period, it's something that we think is there's still plenty of opportunity left.","Jim Mitchell","All right. That's great for the color. And maybe just a quick clarification question on 4Q. On the modestly up expenses, I think you noted that excludes the real estate charge but does that the comparisons include the legal charge in 3Q or should we pull that out as well. Just want to make sure I'm getting that right.","Charlie Scharf","I would pull it out.","Jim Mitchell","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Geoffrey Elliott","Hello, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. You touched last time on the efforts around CCAR and capital planning. And looking at the mid-cycle resubmission, the mid-cycle DFAST that you submissively published. Your company run stress capital ratios have improved quite a bit.","What does that leave you in terms of any efforts to accelerate the process of getting some of that excess capital out?","Charlie Scharf","I think we said last time that we're highly we are -- our constraint is our model, not the Federal Reserve's models. It's something we've been and continue to be highly focused on. And if we got something to say, we'll say it.","Geoffrey Elliott","Okay. I guess we'll leave it at that. Thank you.","Charlie Scharf","Okay, thanks Geoff.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl from KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Great, thanks. A quick question on the non-interest bearing deposits. Before you've said that they're historically averaged about 30% of your total deposits. Could you go back much further in time and look at the end of the rate cycles, both in the 90s and the 2000s. So, its non-interest bearing deposits really troughed out around 20% of total deposits.","So, is that what we should be thinking about this time, it that on average over cycle of 30% but really we should be dragging more closer to 20% as they have in the past?","Mike Santomassimo","Brian, its Mike. We haven\u2019t said that that's sort of the historical average. I mean, I think that's the experience over the last few years. But as you point out that number was lower or sort of in history. A lot sort of changed since then in terms of the business stakes and stuff so.","So, like I think we would stay with sort of what we've been saying consistently right is that they're going to bounce around quarter-to-quarter but we think that number will sort of grind down a little bit over time. Where it bottoms out we'll see.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. And a separate question on investment management. If you kind of look at the flows years to day and let's exclude LDI which is still in a strength in the business. I mean, long term active is flat, you look at your index it's down 23 billion and your cash is down 25 billion.","I mean, what it takes to get those to turn it from outflows really to inflows from here. When can we expect to start seeing better traction and close in the business?","Mike Santomassimo","Yes. I think when you look at our business, I mean it's hard to put it altogether and think about it as one. We have Walter Scott which is an active asset management company in the equity space which over a period of time with differing performance levels inside the market should differentiate us presumably more in difficult markets than in very strong markets.","It is they're long term holders, not focused on the technology sector, have a great track record and so again depending on what happen in the markets over a period of time, you should see stronger performance there.","In our asset manager here in the U.S. we're going through a restructuring as you know of combining the three into one called Mellon. We've been pretty clear that our performance historically hasn\u2019t been great. We are strategically making a significant change and putting serious capabilities there to create a multi-stat asset manager which we have to prove to the market is more attractive than the separately managed firms that didn\u2019t have the appropriate scale inside the market.","And so, that hopefully over the next year or so we'll start to see more progress there. So, it's some again they're all very different that have different drivers to them but I can assure you when we think about each one we're focused on driving improved performance in each of them but that two will take time just given the nature of the business.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And it does appear we have no further questions in the queue at this time.","Charlie Scharf","Thanks everyone, for joining. Thank you, I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you.

I will briefly highlight the fourth quarter and the full year financial results and then focus most of my comments highlighting the progress we made in 2019 as well as outlining our priorities for 2020. Mike will then go through the financials in much more detail.","For the fourth quarter, we reported earnings of $1.4 billion and earnings per share of $1.52. This includes a positive impact of $0.50 per share from notable items, which Mike will discuss. For the full year, on an adjusted basis, EPS of $4.02 on revenues of $15.7 billion, full year expenses were down slightly as we identified and implemented efficiencies to more than offset the increase in technology investments. What that means is we actually delivered hundreds of millions dollars of real productivity and we had solid operating margins of approximately 32%. We generated over $5 billion of capital in 2019, returning more than 100% of earnings to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, while at the same time maintaining a strong capital position, investing for growth and achieving a solid return on tangible common equity of greater than 20%. This year was not without challenges however and notably those included interest rate cuts in the U.S. and while some equity markets hit new highs, client activity levels were constrained in many of our business.","Despite the fees in investment services, we are resilient and we saw some modest organic revenue growth. We also delivered strong operating margins and capital returns for our shareholders. We built a solid foundation in 2019 including substantial investment in technology and talent, while operations executed a significant number of strategic programs in 2019 that will drive efficiency, reduce risk and enhance the client experience.","Looking at our progress across our business portfolio, let\u2019s start with asset servicing. We are taking action to ensure we consistently provide excellent service quality, the pipeline is growing and we announced important new wins in 2019 across different geographies in both asset owner and asset manager segments. We created some exciting partnerships with leading front office system providers namely Aladdin, Bloomberg, and most recently, SimCorp and these will provide our clients with open architecture that gives them choice and flexibility. While still early, these partnerships are strengthening our offering and they are helping us win new business. We enhanced our capabilities and alternatives and ETFs, which have strong growth prospects and we are expanding new range of data and analytical applications available to our clients, where our strong position in data management, accounting, performance and distribution analytics position us to deepen our relationships.","We made good progress in monitoring and measuring client relationships and improving the quality of work and services we provide day-in and day-out for our clients. This is already driving improved client satisfaction and lower attrition rates. In Pershing, we are seeing fee growth coming through and are excited about the future to this business. The industry is evolving and we are confident that our market leadership and strategy will position us well going forward. We ended the year with strongest pipeline in many years with both institutional broker dealers and in the RIA space. We continued to onboard these new clients each quarter and to build the future pipeline. Across the industry, consolidation is helping make Pershing\u2019s open architecture increasingly attractive to our clients. We are accelerating investments in the advisory segment, strengthening market leadership in the broker dealer\u2019s segment and continuing the development of front-end technology, including integration with third-party providers to deliver state-of-the-art experiences and analytics to advisers and investors. All of these are making us an even better partner to our clients.","In clearance and collateral management where we are the clear leader, we delivered strong financial performance in 2019. We saw organic fee growth over the course of the year driven by existing clients and new business as well as clients on-boarded in 2018 they will increase their business with us.","We see continued growth opportunity in this business from structural and regulatory changes that provision our services to bilateral repos and for modernizing our platform to give our clients the ability to seamlessly move their collateral globally. We are enhancing our platform to allow clients have access to more real-time data and self-service tools. We also continue to automate manual processes to reduce risk and improve operational efficiencies and we are improving the client experience by introducing new digitally enhanced capabilities.","In issuer services, we are building out capabilities, which is broadening our relationships. We gained market share in corporate trust and drove new business across a number of our key products, such as structured and muni debt as well as insurance-linked securities. Our ongoing rollout of the new loan servicing platform is enabling us to be more responsive to our clients and deliver them more functionality. We are investing in automating capabilities and digitizing workforce tools to offer clients simplified access to services and data to help them minimize risk, increase control and gain efficiency.","Our Treasury Service business has scale and reputation for excellent service and relationship coverage, which are the result of the investments we have made in talent and our product offering. With over $2 trillion of institutional payments per day, we are very meaningful partner to our clients. In 2019, we successfully refocused on higher margin businesses such as liquidity and payments. Our deposit initiative grew high-quality stable balances by around 18% in 2019. Our technology investments in Treasury Services have been centered on advancements in real-time solutions and operational efficiency to increase straight-through processing rates, both of which further enhance the client experience.","In asset management, the financial results were negatively impacted by outflows over the last year. Performance, however, has been solid across many of the largest strategies, including equities and multi-asset classes. That combined with the investment in new products across the platform is helping to improve the pipeline. We have seen improved performance in Newton, Walter Scott and Alcentra and we continue to believe that there is an important role for active strategies, including LDI going forward. Our wealth management business will benefit over the long-term from our increased investments as well as strong leadership. We are expanding our sales force, strengthening our banking and investment product set and delivering digital tool to benefit both our advisers and clients and create a leading experience. So, overarching all of our business is our consistent investment in technology. Our technology priority is centered on improving quality, developing innovative products and services and enhancing efficiency for our clients, which in turn creates cost savings for us as well as for them.","We are transforming our infrastructure, and expanding our data and analytics solutions and the use of APIs to continue to create an open platform. We are deploying artificial intelligence and machine learning to simplify processes and proactively deliver additional insights to clients, such as improved analytics to increased distribution of their own products. We are embracing partnerships in November. For example, we hosted a well received and inaugural Fintech Connect conference. We recently announced new collaborations with a number of fin-techs to expand our capabilities, including one this week, that will enable us to deliver a new suite of oversight and contingent net asset value calculations solutions for clients. This is just the beginning.","In operations, we have numerous initiatives in play across the businesses that are already yielding efficiencies that we are able to reinvest to support new business initiatives and further efficiency and automation efforts. For example, in corporate action elections, increased automation has significantly reduced the number of transactions that we process manually while offering our clients best-in-class cut-off times. In the payment space, we continue to enhance our straight-through processing rate. We reached a record 97% in the month of December, that\u2019s up from 94% a year ago. And in fund accounting, we have deployed self service capabilities for reporting when we have automated over 2,000 client reports.","One of the recently announced partnership enabling us to launch an AI-based reconciliation and data control solution into better serving our clients complex data needs. Other partnerships are helping us do things such as re-imagine the billing process and employ AI to resolve client inquiries faster. Across the company, we have been disciplined about the investments we are making and are focused on driving efficiency in our technology spend. As an example, we are simplifying our infrastructure and we are reducing the number of applications, which are now down 10% over the past 18 months or so, in the next 12 months will be reduced by another 10% plus. So, total reduction of 20% plus in applications over a 2 to 3-year period.","So to summarize 2019, while we have more work to do, we are on the right path. We are beginning to see the benefits of the investments made over recent years and we will continue to invest and we made progress on a host of initiatives while maintaining strong operating margins and capital returns. As we look to 2020, our priorities are unchanged. They are centered on one, driving sustainable revenue growth through the strong performance culture, focused on improving service quality as well as faster innovation; two, improving every aspect that we can within our operations. Maintaining our investment in technology is key to this. Our overall technology spend for 2020 is expected to exceed the $3 billion we spent in 2019. Three, we are continuing to drive efficiency throughout the organization through automation as well as good expense discipline and four, ensuring we continue to deliver strong capital returns to shareholders.","In closing, we are confident in our plans and our ability to execute on them while always looking for opportunities to improve. We have a great team and a great foundation, and we are excited about the future prospects for the firm. With that, I will turn it over to Mike to review the financial results in more detail.","Mike Santomassino","Thanks, Todd and good morning everyone. Let me run through the details of the results for the quarter. All comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless I specify otherwise.","Beginning on Page 4 of the financial highlights document, in the final quarter of 2019, net earnings of $1.4 billion and earnings per share of $1.52 and both the current and prior year quarters included a number of notable items. The notable items in the fourth quarter of 2019 were costs related to severance, the relocation of our corporate headquarters and litigation expenses partially offset by some tax adjustments reducing our earnings by $0.16 per share. And in the fourth quarter of 2019, we benefited by $0.50 per share from the gain on sale of an equity investment partially offset by severance, net security losses and litigation expenses. Total revenue was $4.8 billion. Fee revenue increased 26% with nearly all of that from the gain on the sale of the equity investment. Underlying that, investment service fees were up, foreign exchange and other trading was down and most other line items were relatively flat. Net interest revenue declined 8% to $815 million. Expenses were down slightly, but excluding the notable items were up 2% with the increase driven by technology. We generated $1.4 billion in net income applicable to common shareholders or $931 million excluding the notable items. We continue to have a strong return on tangible common equity and maintained a solid pre-tax margin.","In terms of shareholder capital returns, we repurchased approximately 22 million shares for just over $1 billion and paid $286 million dividend in the fourth quarter. We have reduced the number of shares outstanding by a little over 6% since the beginning of 2019. For the full year of 2019, we returned $4.4 billion to common shareholders, which is over 100% of earnings through $3.3 billion of share repurchases and approximately $1.1 billion in dividends.","Moving now to capital and liquidity on Page 6, our capital and liquidity ratios remained strong. All of our key ratios were strengthened since the third quarter. Common equity Tier 1 capital totaled $18.5 billion at the end of the year and our CET1 ratio of 11.5% under the advanced approach. Our average LCR in the fourth quarter was 120% and our SLR was 6.1%. Including the impact of the recent change to the rule, our SLR would have been approximately 120 basis points higher.","Turning to Page 7, my comments on the balance sheet will highlight the sequential changes. Net interest revenue was $815 million, up almost 2% versus the lease-adjusted net interest revenue in the third quarter. As we have mentioned previously, we have been focused on growing and optimizing our deposit base for the last 18 months or so. For example, we have been working with wealth management clients to convert their cash from off-balance sheet investments to on-balance sheet deposits. Our sales teams have been focused on attracting additional client deposits in other businesses and we have been targeting escrow and other opportunities while being disciplined about pricing. All of these initiatives and some of the macro factors contributed to the result. The activity that drove the outperformance versus our expectations came in the last few weeks of the year and some of it was episodic.","Now as you look at the drivers, both non-interest bearing and interest-bearing deposits increased across our businesses. Some of the non-interest bearing and interest-bearing deposits related to some targeted activity that was including episodic corporate actions and other activities, which we do not expect to repeat in Q1. Margin and non-margin loans in our securities portfolio balance increased modestly. The loan balances were driven by increased client demand. The yield on interest earning assets continued to decline as expected due to the decline in short-term rates as the Fed cut rates at the end of the third quarter and again in October. The increase in intermediate and long-term interest rates is helpful, but the overall yields on the securities portfolio, loans, and other interest earning assets declined and short-term rates had a bigger impact sequentially. We also made minor adjustments to our securities portfolio that should modestly enhance the yield going forward. The reduction in asset yields was partially offset by lower deposit rates and other funding costs.","Lastly, at the end of December, we did benefit modestly from higher spreads activity levels in our credit retail business and from the money we deployed in reverse repo at year end. Although repo rates over year-end ultimately normalized, we were able to lock in some trades and reverse repos were between 3% and 4%. We don\u2019t expect year aend pricing to repeat again in Q1. All of this activity resulted in our net interest margin remaining flat at 109 basis points versus the lease-adjusted NIM in the third quarter. As we\u2019ve said in the past, we\u2019re focused on driving higher net interest revenue and we will continue to take advantage of low risk opportunities even if they are not NIM accretive.","Page 8 gives some more detail about the drivers of the net interest revenue increase versus the third quarter. You can see how the increased client deposit volumes, higher interest earning assets, and lower funding cost benefited our net interest revenue. This more than offset the decline in interest earning asset yields.","Page 9 details our expenses. On a consolidated basis, expenses of $3 billion were down slightly. The decrease is mostly due to the impact of expenses associated with the relocation of our headquarters in the fourth quarter of 2018 and lower litigation. And excluding notable items, expenses were up 2% primarily reflecting the continued investments in technology.","Turning to Page 10, total Investment Services revenue was down 2%. Assets under custody and administration increased 12% year-over-year to $37.1 trillion primarily reflecting higher market values and client inflows. Although the higher market levels were a bigger driver, we did see good organic AUCA growth throughout the course of the year. Within asset servicing, revenue was down 3% to $1.4 billion, primarily reflecting lower net interest revenue and volatility impacting foreign exchange revenue, partially offset by the impact of higher equity markets. Asset servicing fees in this business were up slightly. Foreign exchange and other trading revenue, was down 7% due to lower foreign exchange volatility and volumes. The pipeline continues to remain healthy. Dialog with clients remains active and we are not seeing an acceleration in pricing pressure.","In Pershing, total revenue was up 2% to $570 million. Clearing fees were up 6% reflecting growth in client assets and accounts from new business on-boarded and from existing clients, which was partially offset by lower net interest revenue. Issuer services was down 6% to $450 million on lower depository receipt revenue which was partially offset by higher client activity in corporate trust. The decline in depository receipts revenue was due to the timing of fees and cross-border settlement activity, as well as lower net interest revenue. Treasury Services revenue was flat at $329 million as higher client activity and payment fees were offset by lower net interest revenue. Fees were up 6%. Sequentially, Treasury Services revenue was up 5% driven by higher net interest revenue. Clearance and Collateral Management revenues up 1% to $280 million, reflecting growth in collateral management and clearance volumes, which were mostly offset by lower net interest revenue. Average tri-party collateral management balances were up 12%.","Page 11 summarizes the key drivers that affected the year-over-year revenue comparisons for each of our investment services business. Now turning to Page 12 for investment management, total investment management revenue was up 1%. Asset management revenue was up 4% year-over-year to $688 million, primarily reflecting higher market values and the impact of hedging activities, partially offset by the cumulative AUM outflows since the fourth quarter of 2018. Performance fees of $48 million were down from the fourth quarter of 2018, which was one of our stronger quarters in a while. We had outflows of $13 billion in the quarter and overall assets under management of $1.9 trillion were up 11% year-over-year due to higher markets and the favorable impact of the weaker U.S. dollar partially offset by net outflows. The sequential market impact is negative due to lower UK fixed income market values, which more than offset the impact of the increased equity market values of managed assets. Wealth management revenue was down 5% year-over-year to $287 million, primarily reflecting lower net interest revenue partially offset by slightly higher fees that benefited from higher market values and client assets grew 11% year-on-year.","Turning to our other segment on Page 13, total revenue increased, reflecting the previously referenced gain on sale of the equity investment, partially offset by the net security losses that were due to a small portfolio rebalancing. Now before we open it to questions, I will spend just a few minutes on how we are thinking about the first quarter in 2020. As I mentioned earlier, net interest revenue in the fourth quarter was better than expected in part due to some episodic balances. So at this point in the quarter, both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposit volumes are lower than the elevated levels in December. We expect that the yields on our securities portfolio will continue going down with lower reinvestment yields, and therefore we expect net interest revenue to be down a little less than 5% sequentially in the first quarter.","We expect that net interest revenue would stabilize later in the year if the forward curves remain stable and steepen a little and mix of deposits don\u2019t change significantly and as the impact of lower rates and the balance sheet become more fully incorporated into the results. And just a reminder that approximately 30% of the securities portfolio re-prices each quarter. We will continue to actively focus on growing deposits, optimizing the mix between on and off balance sheet offerings, and being disciplined about pricing. The Fed actions to increase excess reserves should be helpful as they\u2019ve been historically correlated to the level of our deposits, just to keep in mind that the relationship may not hold in the short run or in any given quarter. We would expect that investment and other income would be between $25 million to $35 million per quarter for the year. With regard to expenses, Todd spoke about the importance of consistently investing in technology. We expect that the level of technology investment will be up from 2019. We can calibrate the pace of that investment if we need to. This will lead our overall expenses for the full year of 2020 to increase by up to 2% year-on-year, excluding the notable items. Included is approximately 50 basis point impact from accounting related to higher pension expense.","Now keep in mind that the charge we took in the fourth quarter for severance reflects the actions that will take place over the year, so we won\u2019t see the full run rate impact until 2021. And note that in the first quarter, staff expenses will be impacted by the acceleration of long-term incentive compensation expense for the retirement-eligible employees, the impact of which will be similar to last year and will effect sequential expense growth. At this point, we currently expect the full-year 2020 effective tax rate will be approximately 21%. And lastly on the regulatory front, we are quickly entering this year\u2019s CCAR process and are awaiting next steps on the capital reform proposals. We continue to be encouraged by the direction of the proposals being discussed, but we will all see the final outcome and impact when they are complete.","With that, operator, can you please open up the lines for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Brian Bedell","Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Maybe just back on the expenses real quick, if you \u2013 I didn\u2019t see it in the press release the bifurcation between severance and litigation in the fourth quarter. And then as we think about the expense trajectory into 2020 and even \u201821, can you just talk about the investments in technology and how you expect that to reduce the structural cost base over the next couple of years?","Mike Santomassino","Yes. Hey, Brian, it\u2019s Mike. So, on the first piece we didn\u2019t disclose the exact number in the split between the two. I think you can get a pretty good sense of the magnitude of the severance by looking at the staff expense and the difference versus the third quarter. So that will probably give you a good sense of the magnitude there. The bigger piece by far was severance in the number. As you just sort of think about overall expenses, as both Todd and I mentioned, we would expect to invest even more this year than we did in 2019. And really it\u2019s across a range of items both continuing to build out the infrastructure that is important for operating our businesses. We are building new capabilities and you are seeing some of those get announced and released even over the last couple of weeks. And then there is a large chunk of it\u2019s going into sort of the efficiency agenda on the cost side as you have sort of suggested there. And I think working with Lester Owens, our Head of Operations, we have got a very long list of those programs that we are just clicking down the list and executing. And as you can imagine, benefits of those continue to come in the P&L over a period of time. So, we will get some of them in 2020 and we will get some of them as we sort of exit \u201820 into \u201821. And I will just sort of reinforce what Todd said in his remarks, you can see the benefits of those investments in efficiency agenda coming through the P&L already as we sort of increased the technology spend significantly in \u201819 and overall expenses are down and that\u2019s a result of that focus.","Brian Bedell","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then on clearing, just on the actual clearing service fees of $421 million, just given the way the markets have moved in DARTS and the online brokerage industry at least have been pretty strong. If you want to just \u2013 I would have expected that line to be a little bit stronger in the fourth quarter on a sequential basis. So, if there is anything that you can call out what maybe depressed that? And then maybe longer term you talked about within Pershing in the RIA strategy, maybe what are your expectations of potentially picking up market share given the industry consolidation that\u2019s upon us here?","Todd Gibbons","Okay. I will take some of it. In terms of the \u2013 why don\u2019t I take the second piece? In terms of the industry consolidation and how we kind of look at that, I mean we are a little different, because Pershing is more B2B and we serve broker dealers and corporate RIAs. And we have also kind of differentiated ourselves, because we provided choice whether that\u2019s related to the open investment platform that we have got or the ability to integrate best-in-class kind of front office system. So our clients have the choice as far as that goes and I think that will in the long-term be the preference. Right now, the desire for choice seems to make it more of an opportunity. What I mean by that is just the consolidation. Probably as we look at it, it makes it more of an opportunity. There is a lot of interest in alternative providers and that just puts us in a better position. As to the revenue growth, I think we are seeing some pretty decent positive there as we have won some meaningful new business that we are implementing. Mike, I don\u2019t know if you have any...","Mike Santomassino","Yes. And I am just \u2013 yes, Brian, on our revenue stream we are not a commission-based revenue stream. And so most of the revenue that we see come through the clearing services fee line is not based on the number of transactions that are getting executed. It\u2019s actually a very small piece of the puzzle there. So you won\u2019t see the same correlation between transaction activity, revenue stream as you might in some of the online brokers.","Todd Gibbons","And we have got a pretty strong pipeline there. We continue to win new business. We are differentiated on the institutional side with some of our capabilities and we are investing on the advisor side both in the sales as well as the sales team, the branding as well as the technology that we are deploying. So, we feel pretty good about the business.","Brian Bedell","Yes. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask a couple first on expenses. You guys guided to an expense growth of 2% or less. So, is the expectation that you are going to be able to deliver operating leverage and therefore you expect there to be a revenue growth picture that\u2019s going to be at least 2%, maybe a little greater. And can you help us understand why there is such a big delay on the severance benefit? Thanks.","Todd Gibbons","Yes. Thanks Brennan. I will take the start of that and then Mike can provide a little more color. In terms of the environment delivering positive operating leverage is really going to be driven by revenue mix as much as anything right now as we continue to make investments in the technology that we think will have longer term benefits to us. So, I think it would be \u2013 it\u2019s certainly not impossible, but challenged in the very near term. I don\u2019t know if Mike had\u2026","Mike Santomassino","And I do think though Brennan, once we sort of get through the NIR stabilization, we feel very confident still sort of the model where little bit of revenue growth drives significant amount of earnings growth. And so we think that\u2019s still \u2013 we feel very confident that, that still holds. And once NIR stabilize which as I mentioned we think under, I mean, the assumptions that I sort of gave you, we think that happens later this year, then you should start to see some of that coming back into the picture.","Brennan Hawken","Great. That\u2019s fair. And on that point, Mike, there were some encouraging signs here on the non-interest bearing deposits. Can you talk a little bit \u2013 give us a little more color on trends there in that line this quarter and how sustainable should we \u2013 I know you think you said that they are down from December levels, which is probably pretty seasonally typical? But like with the interest rates coming down in the market, is that \u2013 are those trends now like more durable, some stability there and maybe even some growth and do you have some deposit efforts specifically intended to help support growth in that line as well?","Mike Santomassino","Yes. And I think I will start with the last piece and so trying to make sure I hit all of the points. But as I said in my script, we have been sort of focused on this for a while now and that includes going after opportunities where there is non-interest bearing deposits. And part of the episodic activity that we saw in the fourth quarter, was very targeted activity that we go after related to escrow as an example where there were some significant sort of transactions there. It\u2019s hard to predict when they are going to come and how they are going to come, but it\u2019s an intentional act on our parts to go out and target those opportunities. As you sort of think about the path forward, I think the macro environment certainly should be helpful and we are encouraged by sort of the level of dialog and the activity we are seeing. And we will have to let it play out a little bit longer to sort of call a sustainable trend, I think.","Todd Gibbons","Yes. And you guys have picked up on the correlations that Fed\u2019s balance sheet and the impact is likely to have on us and that could be somewhat on the positive. And then the rest of it is going to be also rate-driven. So, if there is a change in the rate environment, it could potentially move in that category as well.","Brennan Hawken","Okay, thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning.","Todd Gibbons","Good morning, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","Todd, at the beginning you highlighted a variety of areas that should be able to deliver growth. I wondered if you could give us a sense as to what is the most important one or two areas that you are looking forward to deliver growth this year? And I am asking the question in part to understand the context for the investment spend and where it\u2019s most critical for you?","Todd Gibbons","Okay. Well, I think the investment spend is kind of coming across the board. So, we are spending \u2013 I talked a little bit about just building stronger and stronger infrastructure for resiliency, which just provides an increase in the quality of our services. We are investing in integrating third-party capabilities, which I think is a bit of a differentiator. We are investing and improving operations and we are starting to see the positive feedback from that in the scorecards that our clients keep on us. The most important thing is to retain business and by providing great service and covering an increasingly better capabilities around that service. It\u2019s difficult for clients to leave. In terms of initiatives that might drive future revenues, there are really kind of three areas \u2013 three to four areas, where we are most focused. One is the things that we have talked about in the Clearing and Collateral Management. So we are building an interoperable tri-party system, which we think will make our clients much more effective in managing their collateral globally. And as a result, we can pickup some of the global market share and also provide some of those services to what have traditionally been in the bilat space. That\u2019s probably another year or two before I think that really \u2013 that kicks in but we are starting to see some of the benefits from that now. One of our other focus area is around data and analytics. And I think this is going to be an increasingly competitive advantage for us as we build. We currently with the \u2013 under Eagle have approximately $24 trillion of assets under management. Eagle is the old brand name of our data and analytics capability. As we have built on that platform and what we call a data vault, we think we have got an exciting capability where we will see growth this year and we will provide the ability to do \u2013 for our clients to do deep analysis around the structured data that\u2019s on our platform. We are investing in our wealth management platform, that\u2019s more long-term as well. And we have already talked a little bit about the investments that we are making at Pershing. So, I would say those four are in terms of business growth are where my key focus is.","Betsy Graseck","Got it. Okay, that\u2019s helpful.","Mike Santomassino","Yes, I think I\u2019d echo what Todd said on the bigger priorities, but I think the good part is that each of the \u2013 we really do feel that each of the businesses still have some opportunity to grow. Some of them require bigger investments. Some of them require smaller investment. And so I think we are focused really on each of them to make sure we take advantage of those opportunities.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, thanks. And then Mike for you specifically or Todd can chime in too, but on the capital you highlighted that the SLR under the new will be up I think to what 7.3% or 7.2% something like that. I know I have asked on this call many times about prefs and what your intentions are there. Now that we have the final rule set in, maybe you could speak to what opportunities you have to become a little bit more capital efficient there. And I am not sure if it has to wait until the CCAR given where the SLR came in?","Mike Santomassino","Yes, look I think SLR, as you know, Betsy, is sort of one piece of the puzzle in terms of the rules that are sort of being discussed and contemplated. And so, I think we really do need to look at all of the rules that are still a work in process around stress capital buffer and all the related pieces of it before we have a complete picture on how we are going to optimize the capital stack.","Betsy Graseck","Yes. And is it better to do a call of the pref or is it better to utilize the full capital stack you have in increasing the balance sheet size, for example, for sponsored repo?","Mike Santomassino","Well, for sponsored repo, that doesn\u2019t have any impact on the size of our balance sheet. And so to take advantage of opportunities like that, we don\u2019t need capital to do that. So I think we are going to look at all of the options to figure out what our opportunity is on the revenue side to sort of grow and keep the balance sheet where it is to grow the balance sheet and we are going to look at sort of our opportunities given sort of the new capital rules. And I think you will hear more from us on that as the CCAR and stress capital stuff comes into focus hopefully over the next few months.","Todd Gibbons","Yes, it\u2019s a little bit challenging, because we just don\u2019t know exactly what the rules are going to be, we hear lots of different things and we obviously follow discussions. But at this point, we just don\u2019t have enough precision to say what the actual impact is going to be to us.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, alright. Do you think you are going to get that at CCAR rule set or you have to wait for June?","Todd Gibbons","Who knows, I think that\u2019s the honest answer. I think we are all going to find out when the rules come out in CCAR, how much of it\u2019s clear and then we will see as they finalize the notice of rule \u2013 the NPRs that they have got out there, so\u2026","Mike Santomassino","They got lot to get on...","Todd Gibbons","In a short period of time.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, alright. Appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alex Blostein","Good morning, everybody. So just a couple of follow-ups. So one I guess on expenses, Mike, let me just to clarify the base of what you guys are talking about 2020 expense growth is about $10.8 billion kind of the core number that you report in 2019?","Mike Santomassino","Yes. Yes, it\u2019s what\u2019s in the press release on Page 3.","Alex Blostein","Yes. And then when we talk about the tech spend, do you guys had $3 billion or so in 2019. I just want to make sure is that all running through the income statement and again it sounded like that was a 10% growth in 2019. How much of a growth rate do you guys expect to see there for 2020 basically just kind of trying to get a flavor for how much you need to reengineer in savings to keep the overall expenses below the 2% range?","Mike Santomassino","Yes, I think \u2013 most of it\u2019s running through the P&L already, Alex. So look for 2019, so most of it\u2019s kind of through P&L. So I think we are not \u2013 I don\u2019t think we have given you the exact percentage increase that\u2019s going to go up, but we are continuing to deliver consistent sort of efficiency gains as we go. And as you and I and others have sort of talked about over time like we still think there is a long road ahead of efficiencies that we can generate through these investments we are making sure we feel pretty confident that we are going to get out those over the next couple of years.","Alex Blostein","Alright. My second question around the asset management business, so when I look at the flow dynamics, fixed income LDI was a little light this quarter again despite what has been a really strong trend in the industry and then cash management also I think had some outflows. Can you provide a little bit of color kind of what\u2019s been driving that and then the market performance also sizably negative number which obviously surprising given what the market had done, so maybe kind of help flush out what\u2019s driven both the flows and the market delta in this quarter?","Todd Gibbons","Yes, look and I know we are \u2013 it\u2019s not going to be a straight line sort of up as you sort of think about flows in that business. And there has been lot happening in through the UK pension market that sort of \u2013 people sort of make sure they were sort of thinking about sort of how to manage their liabilities in the right way and we feel really good still about the pipeline and the unfunded commitments that we have got in that business in the UK plus they have been continuing to invest in bringing their capabilities outside of their core market. So I think we still feel good about the LDI space. We feel good about what they are doing. Performance has been good. And so we don\u2019t really, we don\u2019t really have any concerns in the LDI space really at all. And as you know just more broadly about our asset management business, it\u2019s largely institutional set of clients. And so you are going to have some chunky flows from time-to-time for various reasons as you sort of look at any given quarter. And so there is nothing underneath the fixed income side, but obviously the point to that it\u2019s a core issue or core trend that we are concerned about.","Mike Santomassino","Well, then you also had a question around market and I think one of the things to keep in mind, we have a fairly substantial exposure to the UK where they were \u2013 I mean, the currency impacts and the equity impacts are a little bit different than it would have been domestically. So that\u2019s one thing I would throw in there. In terms of the cash, I would say that\u2019s a little disappointing and I think we need to work to do a little better there.","Alex Blostein","Got it. Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will next go to the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Yes, good morning. Quick question on the deposit optimization that you talked about, just trying to get a sense of how far along you are in that process, it sounds like you did that over the course of 2019 or is it like there is still a long runway to deposit optimization from here?","Todd Gibbons","I think, Brian, it\u2019s a \u2013 we are continuing to optimize. So, I think this is a dialog that, it\u2019s a very granular conversation with clients and it\u2019s a client-by-client sort of dialog. And so I think we have made some progress, but we have got more to go to continue to make sure that we are optimizing sort of the pricing and footprint we have got there so.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. And then separately, is there any way to kind of give an update on how the Aladdin offering is moving forward, still some concern across the industry, whether or not proprietary versus third-party solutions? That is the way it\u2019s moving. Do you have any update there? Thanks.","Mike Santomassino","Sure. We have been building on a number of partnerships over the past 6 to 9 months. And I would say they are really coming in two flavors. The first it where it is one of the ones that you are referring to is where we have connected with some of the leading order management systems, Aladdin, Bloomberg and SimCorp. Many of our mutual clients already have signed up and many are in the process of signing up. So, we got a very high success rate where we have got common clients. The other thing to that is doing for us is opening doors for other conversations where we see our clients able to gain efficiencies because of this. So, I think it\u2019s got \u2013 right now the benefits that we are seeing is its initiating discussions, opening doors and giving us more opportunities to bid on new business. And secondly it\u2019s strengthening the relationships with the businesses that we have already got, because it is integrated, it is single sign-on, the client is able to look it down into their custody activities, it\u2019s near real-time, it\u2019s \u2013 I think there is the real benefit to our clients here that are paying off. And I mentioned that they are really as we think through the partnerships, they are really coming in two flavors. The other type is everything that we are doing with fin-techs. And so we have announced quite a few, just this week we announced one where we are working with the fin-tech to provide independent alternative NAVs for funds. So this provides both an oversight function as well as \u2013 and enhances the control and in addition it serves as a contingency if there were a problem in construction of the NAV. So we have partnered with them. Some of our clients have actually looked to use them, but they found the implementation would have been too difficult. And so by partnering with them, implementing we are gaining scale from doing that as well as it\u2019s providing as a service rather than just as a piece of software. So we are pretty excited that\u2019s already attracted quite a bit of attention this week.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Yes, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Robert Wildhack","Good morning, guys. Just wanted to ask question on the balance sheet and the impact of \u2013you have said injecting reserves into the system. Are you seeing significant impact there and you know either way, how long until we can kind of see that quite how many numbers? Thanks.","Todd Gibbons","Let me probably take that piece. It\u2019s so difficult, Robert, for us to be able to identify any single particular incident on a day-to-day basis or even. But if you just look back at historical trends and you look at the balance sheet and you look at the Fed\u2019s balance sheet and you look at our balance sheet related to deposits, you will see that there is a correlation, but depicting why that took place whether it was a money market fund that decided to leave a little extra cash into countering like that is very, very hard to determine. We are still out of it. Is there anything to add to that?","Mike Santomassino","No.","Robert Wildhack","Thanks. I think that\u2019s all I had.","Todd Gibbons","Okay. Thanks, Robert.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan Chase. Please go ahead.","Vivek Juneja","Hi, Todd. Hi, Mike.","Todd Gibbons","Good morning, Vivek.","Vivek Juneja","Two questions. Which businesses need the most catch up, if you can aim at talking from a business standpoint, I know you are spending into lot of different areas, lot of businesses, but where do you think you need to do so more either from a competitive standpoint or business need, can you give some sense of \u2013 because you have got obviously a lot of businesses?","Todd Gibbons","Yes. I actually think we are in pretty good shape. What we are trying to do in the back is trying to get ahead of the game. And if you think about some of the things that we are going to just walk through the whole list of partnerships and kind of differentiating capabilities and this willingness to integrate with best-in-class. We are not always going to be able to deliver the best application and we would want to provide our clients flexibility. So that holds when we look at Pershing, it holds when we look at asset servicing, we made some very good investments in our corporate trust business and we are able \u2013 we are starting to gain back market share. We had lost a little market share over the years.","We continue \u2013 I like where we are in wealth management, I think we can continue to do better there. So, I think we are \u2013 I think this is a matter of trying to breakout, non cash out.","Vivek Juneja","Yes. Is there room to improve the efficiency of tech spend, what we are hearing from others is they are trying to flatten it, shift the mix of what they are spending on? We are hearing that from competitors and peers of yours, is there room for you to do that and if not, when can we start to see that flatten out?","Mike Santomassino","Hey, Vivek, it\u2019s Mike. I think Todd highlighted a little bit about in his script where we are as focused about driving efficiency in our technology spend as we are anywhere else in the company and we reduced the number of apps by 10% and there is another 10% coming, so over 20% reduction of our apps. And as we sort of make these investments in the underlying infrastructure and application, it makes the next set of investments we want to make that much more efficient, cheaper, faster and so it\u2019s something you are already seeing in the spend that we are making.","Vivek Juneja","So, do you have a range or something on operating margin where you think you can get to with all of this tech spend as we look out a year or two?","Mike Santomassino","Yes. Look, we haven\u2019t given you a view on go-forward operating margins, Vivek. But as I said earlier, I think as we sort of get through the short-term \u2013 medium-term on net interest revenue we do feel confident that the model still holds where we will be able to deliver for a little bit of revenue growth, a pretty significant amount of earnings growth then and I think that implies expansion in operating margin at that point. So I think I would just sort of model that way. I think the guide we gave you a while ago now at Investor Day a couple of years ago is probably a good sense \u2013 still a good way to think about it still.","Vivek Juneja","One last one for you, Mike, your reverse repo yields fell pretty sharply, the ones \u2013 the way you have it on the balance sheet, the lowest level we have seen in five quarters. How should we think about that, is that \u2013 that drop?","Mike Santomassino","Yes. The Fed reduced rates and the September \u2013 the peak in reverse repo spreads in September didn\u2019t happen again, those two drivers.","Todd Gibbons","I know you like to do the arithmetic there, Vivek, but we look at that since it\u2019s novated down, the size matters, the spread matters and then the overall rate matters, but ultimately we are generating a spread that\u2019s been [no way but] down. That spread has been reasonably consistent, but in the third quarter, we saw the spike with an unusual activity in the repo market.","Vivek Juneja","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Mike Mayo","Hi. You mentioned retiring apps and you retired 10%, 10% more to go, what\u2019s the total number of apps that you have? And I don\u2019t think this is completely related, but what percent of apps on desktops are web-based versus having old versions of code support them?","Todd Gibbons","I am going to turn this one over to Mike, Mike, but in terms of the \u2013 we don\u2019t disclose the total number of apps or I don\u2019t believe we have disclosed the total number of apps that we have got. But we have obviously got a pretty careful inventory of those actions. And part of what we are doing in our resiliency build-out in infrastructure investment is also making ourselves more efficient by really sun settling with some of those applications. And so I am pleased that we are down 10%, probably closer to 12% now and we have got another 10% or so that will probably kick out over the course of the next 12 to 18 months. So, I can\u2019t really get into the specifics of where those apps are in terms of what base.","Mike Santomassino","Yes. Mike, I am not \u2013 I think that \u2013 I am not sure that\u2019s the right way to think about it, not all modern apps are web-based apps, but I think you should assume that many of the tools that our folks are using are continually \u2013 are always getting better and we are always investing in those and that gets \u2013 we have every weekend of the year, there is something that\u2019s being rolled out across our product suite to either internal folks or external folks and that improves the way they work. So, we have...","Todd Gibbons","Yes. In terms of productivity tools, we are rolling out the most \u2013 the office \u2013 the cloud version of Microsoft\u2019s Office 365. One of the things that we are also doing is our operations. We get over 1 million client e-mail inquiries each year and we are developing AI around making that much more productive in responding to it. So, we are continuing to invest a lot in productivity and the infrastructure build that we are making I think will help us do that as well.","Mike Mayo","And then just one follow-up, so just generally speaking, you said you are spending more in technology, it was at $3 billion going up to what number I am not sure if you said that if you are willing to do so? And when do you think that turns like if you think of it going down the J curve, when do you come up the other side with these investments? Is that like a year or 3 years or 5 years?","Todd Gibbons","Let me make one comment and Mike might want to get through more of the detail. As we have really picked up the tech spend over the past 3 years, I would say the rate has come down slightly although the total amount continues to go up, because it\u2019s on a little bit of a bigger base, but the rate of growth has probably come down. I don\u2019t know, Mike, if you want to share where the J curve is meaning you think through how quickly we amortize infrastructure?","Mike Santomassino","Yes. I mean, look Mike, I think the way we think about the tech spend is it\u2019s not we are shooting to spend a certain number. What we are doing each year is looking at how much can we actually execute, what are the business cases, how do we think about like the return we are going to get on them. And most importantly like can we successfully sort of execute it and we have people in place to do it. I think that\u2019s driving \u2013 and that\u2019s going to be the constraint that we have got in most years is making sure that we can execute it well. And I think right now we feel it\u2019s important to continue to make those investments, because that\u2019s what\u2019s going to differentiate us going forward. And keeping in mind that we have got to deliver bottom line \u2013 on the bottom line as well and so we are trying to find the balance there to make sure that we are doing the right thing by all of our stakeholders. And so that\u2019s the way we sort of go about how much we are going to spend in any given year.","Todd Gibbons","Yes. So it\u2019s a really good point. So as we look out to next year, I don\u2019t want to predict this, because if it was not an ROI on the spend we will bring it down, but right now we believe there is.","Mike Mayo","Alright. Thank you.","Todd Gibbons","Thanks Mike.","Mike Santomassino","Alright. It looks like that\u2019s the last question. Thank you everyone. We will talk to you next time.","Todd Gibbons","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call webcast.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent.","I will now turn the call over to Ms. Valerie Haertel. Ms. Haertel, you may begin.","Valerie C. Haertel - Global Head-Investor Relations","Thank you. Good morning, and welcome, everyone, to the BNY Mellon Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Gerald Hassell, our Chairman and CEO; Todd Gibbons, our CFO; as well as members of our executive leadership team.","Our second quarter earnings materials include a financial highlights presentation that will be referred to in the discussion of our results, and can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.","Before Gerald and Todd begin, let me take a moment to remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release, the financial highlights presentation and those identified in our documents filed with the SEC that are available on our website, bnymellon.com. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, July 21, 2016, and we will not update forward-looking statements.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Gerald Hassell. Gerald?","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Valerie, and welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results. This quarter demonstrated the value of having a well-diversified, lower-risk business model which provides stability to our revenue base during periods of global market uncertainty and volatility. We remain focused on the execution of our long-term strategy to drive future growth by continuing to invest in strategic initiatives to support our client's success while maintaining the safety and soundness of our enterprise.","We continue to aggressively control expenses through our business improvement process, which enabled us to maintain a strong adjusted pre-tax operating margin of 33%. In a challenging revenue environment with a flattening yield curve on an adjusted basis, we delivered second quarter earnings per share of $0.76 and we achieved an adjusted return on tangible common equity of 21%.","Now, I'll let Todd address some of the market-driven and seasonal revenue dynamics in this quarter as well as our continued progress on reducing expenses. But first, let me discuss our progress against our strategic priorities.","Driving profitable revenue growth remains our first priority. Growing revenue remained a real challenge across our industry. And while we were down somewhat year-over-year, our diversified business model positions us to deliver consistent results regardless of the market and certainly solid risk-adjusted returns.","We continue to believe our distinctive capabilities in areas such as collateral management and liquidity services, middle-office outsourcing and liability-driven investments, as well as our efforts to build a digital enterprise, will drive revenue growth in the future. We are growing synergies between wealth management and our Pershing platform. Wealth management loans are up 20% year-over-year, and our combined banking and brokerage solution has driven over half of this growth.","We're also realizing increased synergies between investment services and Dreyfus. Nearly 60% of the assets under management and our Dreyfus and BNY Mellon money market funds are from our investment services clients, evidencing the benefits of our dual focus on investment management and investment services.","On a technology front, last year we created a technology solutions team to accelerate our ability to deliver market-leading solutions through internal development and partnerships with third-party technology companies and content providers. So, for example, we've leveraged NEXEN to build an application to help fund managers manage their expenses more effectively. This is something we use internally in our mutual fund processing area and we are now making it available directly to our client as an application on the NEXEN platform.","We've also used NEXEN APIs to help a large global fund by integrating a third-party market analytics application with our underlying portfolio holding. It's providing improved insights and analyses into their investment.","In investment management, Mitchell Harris has made a number of changes to his organizational structure, designed to improve the quality of our execution and prioritize what is most important to our clients. Now, those changes include managing our global distribution organization in two parts, North America and international. In a manner, their balances are distribution-focused among wealth, institutional and intermediary clients, helping us provide targeted investment solutions for their specific challenges in any given market or region.","Now, we've also made changes to strengthen our investment boutiques by further supporting them with market insights, analytics, and product information to power their investment success and continue to build out their infrastructure needs. This new structure will allow us to more quickly adjust our strategy and business priorities to the evolving client needs and market dynamics.","Our second priority is executing on our business improvement process, and it's been paying nice dividends for us and our client. It's creating efficiency in quality benefits for them and reducing technology, operations and top-of-the-house costs for our company. These savings are enabling us to fund regulatory change and revenue initiatives. And we've been meeting or exceeding our business improvement process goals, or on target to achieve the transformational-related structural cost reductions that we stated on Investor Day, and are meeting or, in some quarters, exceeding our operating margin goals.","Now, some live examples of actions that we've taken include: our procurement and technology teams are driving down our IT vendor expense. We've renegotiated large vendor contracts to our benefit and see more opportunities to do so as contracts come up for renewal. We've eliminated more than 200 market data terminals for $13 million in annual savings run rate.","We fully implemented our Bring Your Own Device program, eliminating more than 90% of our company-paid handheld devices. We've been piloting robotics and machine learning processes to automate work and eliminate repetitive manual tasks. And while it's still in the early days, we have put robotics into production in several areas and believe there are excellent prospects to roll this out more broadly and further reduce our costs. And in our business partner groups, we are leveraging our location strategy, negotiating to reduce vendor costs and automating or eliminating low-value activity.","Our third priority centers on being a strong, safe, trusted counterparty. The UK's decision to exit the EU was and remains an opportunity to demonstrate our ability to navigate through real-life market stresses. Amidst the market volatility and increased transaction volume, in the wake of the referendum vote, we and our clients were able to continue to transact business without incident. We believe our UK and European legal entity structures, licenses and infrastructure, which includes a passport European bank in Belgium, creates a competitive advantage and positions us well to manage the potential impact of the new arrangements.","Now, an exit from the EU is likely to take several years, and the final establishment of the terms of the UK market access between the UK and the EU could take much longer. Throughout this period, we will continue to conduct detailed business and risk assessments, and we'll work with our clients to respond to any changes in their needs and the market infrastructure. At least at this very early stage, we do not envision a significant impact to our operations and business.","Now, our fourth priority involves generating excess capital and deploying it effectively. During the second quarter, we repurchased $509 million in common shares and we distributed $185 million in dividends. As we mentioned last month, the Federal Reserve did not object to our 2016 capital plan as part of CCAR. Our board has approved the repurchase of up to $2.14 billion of common stock over a four-quarter period, and that compares to last year's five-quarter authorization of $2.4 billion. We will begin the buyback program this quarter and continue through the second quarter of 2017.","They've also approved the additional repurchase of up to approximately $560 million of common stock during the period, contingent upon us issuing $750 million of preferred stock. And I'm pleased to report that we have increased our quarterly dividend by approximately 12%, beginning in the third quarter of this year.","Now our fifth priority is attracting, developing and retaining top talent through our holistic people strategy that directly supports our business. Over the last quarter, we added several new people to our organization as we increase our bench strength. Some of these additions include Adam Vos, who joined us from Deutsche Bank, to head up foreign exchange trading. Adam is a proven industry leader and will help build out the market's management team under Michelle Neal. Bob Colby (11:11), an industry veteran in asset management, has joined us as our Global Head of Risk and Compliance for investment management, further strengthening our risk and compliance organization. Michael Santomassimo has joined us from JPMorgan as CFO of Investment Services, where one of his charges will center on improving profitability and return on risk-adjusted capital in these businesses.","And we've also promoted and stretched a number of our talent leaders internally, including Hani Kablawi, who has been named Head of Investment Services for EMEA; Susan Revell, who is now General Counsel and Chief Controls Officer for EMEA; as well as a number of leaders in investment management related to the organizational changes that I referenced earlier.","So in summary, we are executing against each of our strategic priorities and controlling what we can control. We are well-positioned to navigate through the uncertain market conditions, and the lower for longer interest rate environment, while producing strong results for our clients and our shareholders.","Now with that, let me turn it over to Todd.","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Gerald, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will follow the financial highlights document, starting with slide 4, and that's the one that details our non-GAAP or operating results for the quarter. Our second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.76. That's $0.01 lower versus the year-ago quarter, but up 3% sequentially.","On a year-over-year basis, second quarter revenues and expenses were each down 2%. The year-over-year revenue decline was largely driven by the gain on lease sales in the second quarter of last year, as well as the impact of the stronger dollar. Sequentially, revenue was up 1% and expenses were flat. While operating leverage on an adjusted basis was flat on a year-over-year basis, we have maintained a long-term trend of generating positive operating leverage, fueled by the success of our business improvement process, and we expect to continue this trend.","As we have noted in prior quarters, the strength of the U.S. dollar continues to impact results negatively for revenue and positively for expenses. However, the net impact from currency translation is minimal to our consolidated net \u2013 excuse me, pre-tax income. Income before taxes was down 2% year-over-year on an adjusted basis and up 5% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, our adjusted pre-tax margin remained at a healthy 33% in the second quarter. And return on tangible common equity on an adjusted basis was 21% for the quarter.","Now moving ahead to slide eight, I will discuss our consolidated fee and other revenue. Asset servicing fees were up 1% year-over-year and they were up 3% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects net new business, higher money market fees that were partially offset by lower market values and the unfavorable impact of the strong dollar. The sequential increase primarily reflects higher market values and net new business.","Clearing services fees were up 1% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher money market fees, partially offset by the impact of lost business. Sequentially, higher average balances and the increase in the number of trading days were offset by lower volumes. Issuer service fees were unchanged year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. Both comparisons reflect lower depository receipts revenue. Year-over-year, issuer service fees also reflect higher money market fees in corporate trust.","Treasury service fees were down 3% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects higher compensating balance credits provided to clients. Now, what that does is shift revenues from fees to NIR. The sequential increase primarily reflects higher payment volumes due to an increase in the number of trading days.","Second quarter investment management and performance fees were down 5% year-over-year, or 4% on a constant currency basis. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects outflows in 2015, the unfavorable impact of the strong dollar and lower performance fees. These were partially offset by higher money market fees and the April 2016 acquisition of the assets of Atherton Lane Advisers. The sequential increase of 2% primarily reflects higher equity market values and the impact of the Atherton acquisition partially offset by net outflows.","FX and other trading on a consolidated basis was down 3% year-over-year and it was up 4% sequentially. FX revenue of $166 million was down 8% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects lower volumes partially offset by the positive net impact of foreign currency hedging activities. The sequential decrease primarily reflects the continuing trend of clients migrating to lower margin solutions.","Other trading revenue of $16 million compared with $6 million in the year-ago quarter and $4 million in the first quarter. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher fixed income trading. The sequential increase primarily reflects lower losses on hedging activities in the investment management business. Financing-related fees declined 2% to $57 million versus the year-ago quarter and they increased 6% sequentially. Distribution and servicing fees were $43 million, that's 10% higher year-over-year and sequentially. Distribution and servicing fees were favorably impacted by higher money market fees.","The year-over-year increase was partially offset by fees paid to introducing brokers. Investment and other income of $74 million compared with $104 million in the year-ago quarter and $105 million in the first quarter. Both decreases primarily reflect lower lease-related gains that were partially offset by foreign currency remeasurement gains. In summary, our total fee revenue is a little stronger than it appears, as the lower lease-related gains, currency translation and the hedging activities impacted revenue by about 3%.","Slide nine shows the drivers of our investment management business that help explain our underlying performance. Assets under management of $1.66 trillion was down 2% year-over-year, reflecting net outflows primarily in 2015 and the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar principally versus the British pound. That was offset by higher market values. Sequentially, assets under management were up 2%. Total net outflows were down to $1 billion, continuing the improving trend we've experienced over the last year, which is in part a reflection of stronger investment performance in many of our boutiques.","Long-term outflows were $5 billion, which included net long-term active inflows of $12 billion, mainly driven by continued strength in liability-driven investments. These were offset by $17 billion in index outflows. Active equity outflows were relatively modest and the lowest in seven quarters, once again helped by stronger investment performance from our active equity managers. Additionally, we had $4 billion of short-term cash inflows. Wealth management continued to deliver year-over-year pre-tax earnings growth, which is now a multi-year trend, and our successful banking expansion with Pershing continued to drive strong loan growth. Investment management loans and deposits were up 20% and 6%, respectively.","Turning to our investment services metrics on slide 10. Assets under custody and administration at quarter end were a record $25.9 trillion, that's up 3% or $900 billion year-over-year, reflecting net new business and higher market values partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. Linked-quarter AUC\/A was up $400 billion. We estimate total new assets under custody or administration wins were $167 billion in the second quarter and we continue to have a solid pipeline of opportunities.","Looking at the other key investment services metrics you can see that most are down year-over-year, and that reflects the impact of us proactively managing the balance sheet as well as certain client relationships with a focus on optimizing capital, liquidity and profitability as well as the previously disclosed impact of lost business in clearing.","Turning to net interest revenue on slide 11, you'll see that on a fully taxable equivalent basis, NIR was down 2% versus the year-ago quarter and flat sequentially. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the negative impact of interest rate hedging activities and higher premium amortization that was driven by the sharply lower rates we saw at quarter end. The yield on interest-earning assets was up 6 basis points year-over-year and it was down 2 basis points sequentially. Our net interest margin for the quarter was 98 basis points, 2 basis points lower than the year ago and 3 basis points lower than the prior quarter. The impact of hedging and the higher premium amortization drove the net interest margin a bit lower than our expectations.","Before I cover expenses, let me provide you with an update on our resolution plan. While we are still evaluating our plan after receiving the Fed's guidance, we believe that changing to a single point of entry strategy rather than a bridge bank strategy will more likely result in a credible plan. Implementing this SPO (21:21) strategy will likely result in some additional expense and may require us to issue additional TLAC eligible debt.","Now turning to slide 12, you'll see that the noninterest expense on an adjusted basis declined 2% year-over-year and was down slightly sequentially. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower expenses in nearly all categories, primarily driven by the favorable impact of a stronger dollar, lower staff and legal expenses and the benefit of the business improvement process. And that was partially offset by higher net occupancy and distribution and servicing expenses.","Staff expenses decreased year-over-year, reflecting lower incentives. The increase in net occupancy expense reflects the cost to exit leases and that's consistent with our global real estate strategy. The savings generated by the business improvement process primarily reflect the benefits of our technology insourcing strategy as well as the benefit of renegotiating some large vendor contracts.","The sequential decrease in non-interest expense primarily reflects lower staff expense, offset by higher sub-custodian, net occupancy, legal and business development expenses. The decrease in staff expense primarily reflects incentives. The increase in sub-custodian expenses primarily reflects higher client activity. The increase in net occupancy expense reflects that cost to exit certain leases. The increase in business development expense was driven by the timing of client conferences. We tend to do those in the second quarter.","Turning to capital on slide 13, our fully phased-in advanced approach under common equity Tier 1 ratio on a non-GAAP basis decreased 30 basis points to 9.5%, as capital generation in the second quarter was more than offset by increases in operational risk-weighted assets. That measure is driven by external loss events that we incorporated into our model.","Our supplemental leverage ratio on a fully phased-in basis was 5%. Now, we expect to see significant improvement on our supplemental leverage ratio in the third quarter as we execute on our balance sheet strategy, which is expected to reduce some of the less LCR-friendly deposits and shrink some of our lower-yielding repo activity. Additionally, as Gerald noted, our capital plan includes our intent to increase our Tier 1 capital, which would also be helpful to the SLR.","Couple of other notes about this quarter. Our effective tax rate was 24.9%, which is roughly in line with our previous guidance. On page 11 of the release, we show some investment security portfolio highlights. At quarter end, our net unrealized pre-tax gain on our portfolio was $1.6 billion, that compared to $1.2 billion at the end of the first quarter.","Now, let me share a few thoughts to factor into your thinking about the third quarter and the rest of 2016. Third quarter earnings are generally impacted by a seasonal slowdown in transaction volumes and market-related revenue, particularly in foreign exchange, collateral services and securities lending, offset by the seasonally higher activity that we usually see in DRs. We expect NIR for the third quarter to be flat as we implement our balance sheet strategy that I just mentioned to cover both SLR and resolution plan compliance and as we manage through the lower long-term rates. We expect total expenses as adjusted for the full year to be flat to lower than they were in 2015. And lastly, our tax guidance for the full year remains unchanged at 25% to 26%.","With that, let me hand it back to Gerald.","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Todd. And, operator, we can now open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Thank you. As a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up question. [Operation Instructions] Our first question will come from Ashley Serrao from Credit Suisse.","Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning.","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Gerald, I was hoping you could elaborate on the potential for robotics across the organization as you look out a few years. And then also, perhaps, touch on the cost of data. I know you noted a reduction in market data terminals, but hoping you could give us a sense of how much the firm spends today and how the firm is thinking about procuring data, especially as you strive to deliver more analytical solutions to clients.","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, Ashley, I think your first question was about Brexit. Is that correct?","Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Oh, no. Sorry. The potential for robotics across the organization.","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Robotics.","Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah.","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sorry. Sorry. Yeah, robotics. So right now, we have three bots \u2013 30, I'm sorry \u2013 30 bots in production right now across six different processes. We're very encouraged by the results. It's really taking some of the manual mind-numbing exercises out of the process and doing it at a lower cost.","So we started with a couple of bots in one process and we since expanded it. So we're actually pretty encouraged by the upside associated with this. We think we're in the early stages of it and we see other applications across other processes. So, I'm actually encouraged by it and think it could be a real potential upside for us.","On market data, as we pointed out in the opening comments, we've reduced terminals, we're reducing data feeds. If you think about our company, we have lots of market data feeds in so many different business areas. We actually have an effort underway to look across the enterprise to see if we can either reduce the number of feeds, consolidate the number of feeds or certainly negotiate the cost of those feeds a heck of a lot better than we've done on an individual business-by-business basis. So again, we think there's some further upside to reducing those costs associated with market data inputs.","Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks for the color there. And a question for Todd. It just seems like this typical uplift you see in securities lending was a little bit more muted this year. I was just hoping you could share any color on what's going on in that business.","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I think on the equity front, you're seeing less of the tax arbitrage than what you had seen in previous years. And so that was typically a second quarter event with dividends. And if you look at the increase in the spreads that we did see in the quarter, I think there were more specials in government securities, so we did benefit a little bit from that.","So if you look at the total securities lent, they're down slightly on a year-over-year basis, but you can see the spreads are improving quite nicely as we, I think, manage down some of the risk-weighted asset implication to it and are a little more selective on what we're lending and generating a little bit higher yield out of what we are lending.","Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","And our next question will come from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Thanks, guys. Good morning. A question around resolution and the expense outlook that you guys just highlighted. Todd, can you provide a little more color, I guess, how much more an elevated reg spend getting compliant will cost you guys as you go through this process and maybe the timing of that? I mean, it sounds like a lot of that is going to be kind of second half of this year and then it should probably phase down into 2017.","And I guess more importantly, it seems like you're keeping your overall expense guidance in line with what you said in the past kind of flat to slightly down. So what are the areas where you're finding incremental savings to offset the more elevated regulated spend?","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Alex. So the guidance we did give, so I'd say it's a little bit improved from what we had previously given, and that is on a year-over-year basis. We do expect to be flat, perhaps down a bit on total expenses. And that includes a number of headwinds.","We have the higher distribution fees related to fee waivers. It's kind of a good expense. So as the fee waivers abate, we incur that expense.","The government assessments are going up substantially. So, the Single Resolution Fund in Europe, the bank levies and increased FDIC expense is up substantially. And then, we've mentioned the higher regulatory cost associated with compliance with the resolution plans as well as the demands around CCAR. So those are all incorporated into the run rate that I just mentioned.","All other expenses should more than offset what I just mentioned. So our staff expenses are going down for a number of reasons. Some of the automation, some of our location strategies are paying off. We've been able to manage down our legal expenses substantially. Some of that is because of the number of matters, and some of that is because of some of the actions that our legal team has taken to reduce those costs.","We've been able to manage down even in front of all of that, did a lot of consulting expenses where you see a lot of the regulatory compliance come in. But despite that, we've been able to manage down some of our consulting expenses. Our real estate strategy is a paying off and we expect real estate and occupancy expenses to be down for the year. So it's really almost across the board. It's no one thing, Alex; it's a very large number of small items.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got you. And then a clean-up item on net interest income. Can you give us what premium amortization was in the quarter? I mean, it sounded like it was a bit of a drag sequentially last quarter. You guys had a hedging loss, which I think was expected to kind of revert back in 2Q. So as we're thinking about kind of the headwind that was created by premium amortization, can you just give us a number?","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Sure. So there are two things that are going on there: one, the hedging loss. That is a net gain. And so, geographically, it's a gain in trading and a loss in NIR.","We didn't expect it to happen two quarters in a row, but it did and it's related to hedging the company's debt issuance. And that \u2013 and the combination of the increased amortization, and that was just largely driven by the very sharp drop in rates that we saw right at the end of the quarter when we make that adjustment. The combination of the year-over-year basis was about $25 million, so it hit the NIM by about 4 basis points.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","And now we'll take our next question from Brennan Hawken of UBS.","Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. The NII guide in the back half, does that \u2013 I know that you had indicated your expense outlook would be reflective of potential headwinds from living will. But does the NII guide also include the potential headwinds that you flag onto a HQLA?","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","So what we guided in the third quarter, assuming that the Fed doesn't take any action in the third quarter, that we would expect NIR to be flat with the number that we just posted. There could be some additional debt issuance that we would incur in the quarter, as well as I had mentioned that we are going to reduce the balance sheet with some of the unfriendly \u2013 what we call LCR-unfriendly \u2013 the liquidity coverage ratio-unfriendly deposits as well as some of the lower-yielding repo that we have on the books. That combination should substantially improve the SLR ratio and I think put us in a good position for next year's compliance. And there's a possibility there could be additional TLAC post that.","Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. But it's too early to determine, I guess, exactly how that would shake out.","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","It really is, Brennan, because we have not \u2013 we've simply not been able to complete the financial analysis at this time. And I probably should give you a little more color.","Effectively, if we need to issue TLAC to preposition so that we could support, say, the institutional bank in the time of crisis, what we would do is we would issue debt and we'd probably invest it in a similar duration, high-quality liquid asset. Let's just say it was treasuries. That costs us about 100 basis points. So we end up doing $5 billion of that. It's going to cost us about $50 million over the course of the year.","Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's great. Thanks for clarifying there. And then, is it possible \u2013 could you give us in constant dollar operating leverage both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year?","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","It's possible, but I don't have it at my fingertips. It's almost not impactful. There was more noise within the currencies, so you saw a move between sterling and euro but the net impact was relatively modest, less than 100 basis points to revenue or expenses for the entire company. So net-net in operating leverage, that doesn't do much.","Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","So you...","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The reported...","Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Sorry.","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The reported operating leverage numbers will essentially be \u2013 they're pretty currency-adjusted ones.","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah.","Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Okay, great. So, effectively, even though you highlighted and included the currency translation in the noise impacting your fee revenue, when we think about it on a net bottom line impact, that really didn't have an operating leverage impact this quarter.","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Well, think about it. It's 1%. It's approximately 1% of both. So, net-net, that's not going to do too much to operating leverage.","Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Yes. Yes, got it. Thank you.","Operator","And now we'll move next to Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good mornings, folks.","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just to do a quickie on expenses. The lease exit costs I think, Todd, you referenced the increase sequentially to that. So, should we imply about of $10 million of lease exit costs that are sort of onetime in nature?","And then also on your expense guidance on flat to possibly down for this year, do you have distribution expenses related to money market fee waivers going up, I guess, in terms of like factoring when you have the Fed raising rates?","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Brian, in terms of the \u2013 it's a little less than $10 million, but somewhere approximating that...","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","...and on the lease exit costs. And from time to time, you're going to continue to see us do this as we manage our real estate portfolio. So, it just makes sense for us to get back some space to consolidate and just improve our workspace in general.","And in terms of the fee waivers, we do reflect what our projection is throughout the rest of the year and that's incorporated \u2013 excuse me, our distribution fees. That's incorporated into that number. The assumption that we made in the number is that there's no additional Fed tightening.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Okay, that's clear. And then maybe just switching gears on maybe either Gerald or I don't know if Brian's on the call as well, if you could just give us an update on the T. Rowe mid-office contract onboarding. I think there were some more revenues coming in later this year on that. And then just in also the $167 billion of new wins, the timing of that and the client mix there.","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I'll let Brian handle that. Brian is on the call here.","Brian Thomas Shea - Vice Chairman & CEO-Investment Services","Okay. Thanks, Gerald. So, Brian, taking the new wins first. New wins tend to be bumpy in asset servicing, so you see volatility in that number. But we had a pretty good quarter, with $167 billion in AUC new wins.","About $100 billion of that was from one large insurance company client that we're excited about bringing on board. And we still see longer term secular trends in the asset management space, where asset managers really do want to focus on their core value proposition in the investment process and they're looking for lower, more variabilized capital-light solutions. So we see real opportunities in the middle office space for asset managers for hedge funds.","And we obviously are now signing up our first third-party clients following the lift-out of the Deutsche Bank real estate and private equity admin business last year. We have actually signed six clients year-to-date, new clients, so that's going to start to be a source of revenue. And so overall, we feel good about the long-term prospects for asset servicing growth.","And what was the first part?","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","The T. Rowe.","Brian Thomas Shea - Vice Chairman & CEO-Investment Services","So on T. Rowe Price, we're moving along well with T. Rowe Price. Last August we actually lifted out their middle office team and we're operating their middle office and fund accounting services every day. And the service levels and the relationship are strong and we continue to work through the implementation plan to convert them to our fund accounting technology platform and our middle office services platform.","So we're still moving along nicely. There always are some technical things that have to be resolved along the way, but we are moving along well with T. Rowe Price.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And is there a revenue lift as you implement that through this year?","Brian Thomas Shea - Vice Chairman & CEO-Investment Services","I would say there's been some \u2013 we obviously are getting revenue from the middle office services since the middle of last year. I think you should think about that more like in 2017. Not any real growth in the revenue this year.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Okay, great. That's helpful. Thank you.","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And now we'll go to Ken Usdin of Jefferies. And, Ken, your line is open. If you could please check your mute function.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks. Todd, I was wondering if you could elaborate more on the activity side of the business. The core FX was down a little bit; less seasonality in sec lending, which we know is a little bit more on the changing dynamics in Europe. And then clearing, you mentioned lower volumes. Can you just talk about kind of how the quarter progressed in terms of the activity side? And did Brexit have an impact at the end? And then how do you see the markets behaving now?","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Sure. So in terms of Brexit, a little bit frustrating. It was probably a negative for us for the quarter. So what we saw was a little bit of an increase and a little flurry in FX activity at the end of the quarter, but that was effectively given back by the hedge that we have on investment management because of the very low interest rates. And then the fact that the amortization of the premium against the NIR was driven by the very low interest rates, I'd basically say it cost us about $0.01 as we look back to it.","So far this quarter, I think the activity has been a little elevated in FX, so a pretty good start. Whether that's going to sustain itself or not, we'll have to see.","In terms of activity across the investment service, Brian, you're probably better suited to answer that. Clearing activity I guess was a little bit softer for most of the quarter. But generally activity is not bad.","Brian Thomas Shea - Vice Chairman & CEO-Investment Services","Yeah, I would say that. Clearing services, as we've said, has been affected by some lost clients and some client business exits, particularly from some U.S. wealth management clients. But overall, the clearing services fees were up 1% year-over-year and 1% sequentially, which is pretty strong performance considering the lost business.","It's owed to the fact that we've got a pretty diverse client base and we've got very diverse fee revenue sources, so we're not as exposed to transactional revenue. And we're benefiting from the restoration of fee waivers driven by the December rate increase and we had some good retirement fee growth. And we have benefited from bringing on board the JPMorgan clearing clients in the second half of last year, which is less fee-driven, but a combination of fee and NII that's helping the clearing services line overall. And we're focused on growing, particularly in the RIA market. And we continue to see interest from self-clearing firms that are trying to lower their costs and variablize their costs to reduce their capital and regulatory change investment.","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, and I also mentioned DRs tend to be a little episodic, so I think there was some softness there when you look at our sequential and as well as our year-over-year numbers. And typically the third quarter will be good for that. That pretty much directly hits the bottom line, so that's something where we saw probably a little bit softer activity.","One of the areas that's looking stronger is in collateral management. And as we now look at uncleared margin requirements, we're right in the middle of benefiting from that and segregating the collateral and acting as custodian in those transactions. So, we're starting to see that activity pick up pretty much in line with the guidance that we've given you for a while. It's been slower for the regulations to actually get into place, but now that's developing as well.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Okay.","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Ken...","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Yeah.","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Ken, I just would like to add, when you look across the markets, whether it's emerging markets' interest rates, whatever the case may be, our core underlying businesses I think are performing reasonably well. Issuance in the Corporate Trust area in DRs has actually been down, but we've had a higher-than-market share gain in those spaces. And so while it's flat, when you look at the overall market activity, us being flat is actually a positive.","When you look at asset servicing and you think of some of the things that we've won here, I think the core underlying business has got some pretty decent solid momentum. In clearing services, even though we've lost business on a year-over-year basis, to fully recover that and show a little bit of increase, again, I think the core underlying business is performing well.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Fair point, Gerald. Just a follow-up on capital and the preferreds. So you got the preferred kind of aligned with the CCAR, as you said, and also I think presumably as part of your further SLR build.","So can you talk about just the expected timing of when you might get the market for preferreds? And bigger picture is, should we expect that the preferred as connected with CCAR is an annual thing and now it's part of rightsizing the capital structure? Or once you get this last one and get SLR compliant, are you done?","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Ken, I think that when we look at our capital stack in the nature of our risk, we probably could do some additional preferred relative to common equity, especially when you think that it's the Tier 1 that drives the SLR ratio, which is our binding \u2013 what I'll call spot capital constraint. I can't really speak to the timing of any issuance.","But if you look at what was disclosed in the CCAR, we did get approval to do $750 million and buyback a substantial part of that, but not all of it. So that will generate some additional Tier 1. And with interest rates down as low as they are, it's a pretty attractive form of capital.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, guys.","Operator","And our next question will come from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI","Hello there. Todd...","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Glenn.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI","Hello. Could I get a clarification on just two things you mentioned earlier? One was curious on what external loss events got incorporated in this quarter for the ops risk RWA that would have the capital ratios fall sequentially. And the other one was within FX trading. You talked about clients migrating to lower margin products. I'm just looking for an example of what that is and if you see that as a sustainable trend.","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Okay. I'll answer the question on the operating losses. Effectively, what happens is when large losses, and a lot of these are settlement types of losses, go into an external database, it helps to inform our \u2013 if you think about this, we distribute a potential \u2013 there's a potential distribution of losses. There's a probability of them occurring.","That distribution is informed by those large losses, so I can't identify specifically which one it was, but they keep coming, if you will. And they don't fall out of that database for 10 years or so. So that's what's affecting it. So it keeps picking up on some of these litigations.","There is some consideration to taking a look at how operational risk is computed and it's likely that this will change in the not-too-distant future. There are some big discussions within the regulatory bodies right now. We do expect that there will probably be some relief coming within the next couple of quarters on how that's computed, but I can't really confirm that at this time. So, that's what drives it and you'll see it in \u2013 I don't think it's exclusive to us, where you've seen some of that noise around operational risk losses and the addition to risk-weighted assets.","Now, it's kind of interesting, Glenn, because if you look at the CCAR test, the CCAR test is not against the advanced approach. The advanced approach is the one that includes the model for operating losses. It's using the standardized approach. And so, if you look at our ratios on a standardized approach, they didn't go down into the quarter.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI","Right.","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","And in fact, they have now a substantial \u2013 they're substantially higher than the advanced approach. So the good news is, this is not really a constraining issue for us because when we go through the CCAR, we're testing against a much higher ratio.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI","Makes sense. I appreciate that.","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And then, Glenn, the answer on the foreign exchange, as we've commented in the earnings release, we continue to see \u2013 and it's been a relatively long-term trend \u2013 a shift in client activity from either the old standing instruction type of activity to negotiated rates and electronic platforms as the market continues to become more competitive on a price point of view, and that's been absorbed in our foreign exchange results. And we, of course, have built out additional options for our clients and they're utilizing those options, but we did want to call out the fact that there's been a shift in the activity.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI","Got it. Last quickie, LDI is now 34% of AUM. Maybe the best acquisition is never in asset management. But curious how that progresses when we live in this world of low rates and a flatter curve, like I thought growth was getting tapped out and waiting on higher rates, but I guess that's wrong.","Mitchell Evan Harris - Chief Executive Officer-Investment Management","Yeah, no. This is Mitchell. It's the pipeline, the conversations we're having with our clients and prospects. We're still showing a very robust and very healthy pipeline, quite frankly, in the UK. We're looking to obviously extend that success into the U.S. That will be slow. But, no, the client behavior has not changed at all and the interest is still as high as it's ever been.","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","But, Glenn, if you think about it with a lower-for-longer interest rate environment and pension liability is not declining, these firms need to come up with a better solution to match the liabilities against the returns on the assets. That's exactly what our firm does, what Insight does. It really knows and tries to understand the liability structures and develop investment returns to better match it. Pension funds all over the world are struggling with this.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI","Yeah, I appreciate it. Thank you all.","Operator","And our next question will come from Mike Mayo of CLSA.","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi. On expenses, you're making progress year-over-year linked quarter, but head count is still up and if you can reconcile that. And then, separately, you're guiding now for better expense guidance flat to down, is that simply reflecting the progress you've made in the first half of the year? Because it looks like that's where you're headed, anyway.","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, Mike, on head count, yes, we've added some head counts in the technology sectors. We finished insourcing the contractors and have application developed largely in-house now. We've added some folks in the asset servicing and operations areas to support the new business we've taken on and some of the strategic initiatives that we've taken on with clients. But I think I'd really point you to the fact that the staff expense has been down.","So we're putting people in the right locations at the right levels to offset the increase in the head counts. So we're really trying to manage staff not just purely from a head count point of view, but from an overall cost perspective. And I think that's the more important way to look at it. And yes, we have additional people doing certain things to match the activity on the client and the initiative side. So...","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","And the regulatory side.","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And the regulatory side. We've insourced and are building a more sustainable capability to deal with the regulatory items that we're being asked to deal with. So instead of using consultants and a lot of third parties, we are building sustainable teams to be able to handle whether it's CCAR, CLAR, resolution plans, whatever the case may be, and we think we're doing it in a more cost-effective way.","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","And so, Mike, when we have temporary staff, they don't show up in the head count numbers, but they do show up in the salary numbers. So one of the big things we've been doing is replacing them by more cost-efficient permanent staff, as well as the insourcing of some of the developers that has continued.","So the head count is not necessarily a good reflection, that's why we keep saying let's take a look at staff expense. But we've also got the initiatives that we've had to accommodate with T. Rowe and some of the other ones that we've discussed this morning, as well as significant increases in regulatory and compliance-related staff.","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And the final part of your question, we do see an ability to garner additional gains out of our business improvement process to offset these cost increases, to be able to sustain a flat to decline in expenses through the course of the year.","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","And then just one follow-up.","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Just to be clear.","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","Yeah. For the business improvement process, can you just summarize like where are you in that process? Are you one-fourth done, one-half done, three-fourths done, I mean, because you're relying on this to navigate a tough environment? How much more do you have?","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","My colleague, Brian Shea, is biting at the bit on this one. He wants to speak as we'll never be done.","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We're never done, Brian.","Brian Thomas Shea - Vice Chairman & CEO-Investment Services","Todd and Gerald said it well. I echo that. It's a continuous \u2013 we're calling it a business improvement process on purpose. It's not a project or a program; it's a process. We're going to drive continuous improvement in our operating efficiency, our productivity, our service quality, in every aspect of the way we operate. And so we have a pipeline, Mike, of other initiatives and other process improvements that we're going to drive across the company.","So more to do on location strategy, more to do on technology, more opportunity to reduce vendor costs, more opportunity to shift traditional servers to the cloud. And so, we really think we have a sustainable, continuous process improvement approach and it's really a cultural change in the way we're operating and I think it's really gaining more traction every day.","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","I can't help it, what is the BYOD policy?","Brian Thomas Shea - Vice Chairman & CEO-Investment Services","Bring your own device.","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah.","Brian Thomas Shea - Vice Chairman & CEO-Investment Services","In other words, all employees buy their own device, it's their choice. We will reimburse them for company-driven activity. But essentially, everyone chooses their own device and their own carrier, then we put our applications that are company applications up on it in a secured manner for them to use.","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And next we'll go to Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","Oh, hello. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. On the initiatives around reducing some of those LCR-unfriendly deposits, I wondered if you could quantify the scale of deposits that you're looking to reduce.","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","So there are two elements. One is we think we can encourage some of our clients rather than to leave the money on our balance sheet to sweep it into money market funds so that we can continue to earn some margin, maybe a little bit less than what we would have earned on balance sheet, but the capital benefits far outweigh that.","And then, there are some of the, what I'll call, the hotter money that doesn't get positive LCR treatment, which we're going to \u2013 we still have some on our balance sheet which we are going to discourage off of the balance sheet.","And then, we have some repo activity where occasionally, we will basically run what looks like a matched book. The scale of that, every $10 billion is about 15 basis points to the SLR. So it wouldn't \u2013 we could do $20 billion or $30 billion relatively easily and fall within the guidance that I gave you on NIRs is our current estimate.","We also generate from intangible amortization and employee compensation issuance of the common stock about 5 basis points a quarter or so. So that's kind of the scale that we're talking about.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","And then just a quick follow-up. Money market fee waivers, how much of a potential upside is still left from those going away?","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, we have recovered. It's a little bit different in our various businesses, but in aggregate for the company, we've probably recovered a little bit over 50% of the fee waivers with the first 25-basis-point move. There wasn't much of a change. We got it in the first quarter and we got it in the second quarter, so it's really not much of a change quarter-to-quarter. And we had indicated that a 50-basis-point move would give us about 70% and we \u2013 I'd still stick with that estimate for now.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And now we'll go to Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Betsy.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I had a question on money market funds and the transition that's going on in the industry. We've got the prime, non-prime transition happening in October. Could you talk a little bit about what you've done so far? I know you've moved some of your funds to govies, but could you talk about what you've done so far? What's left to do, if any, and if there's any impact that we should be expecting on either gross margins or any other relevant metrics as we go into the third, fourth and first quarter?","Mitchell Evan Harris - Chief Executive Officer-Investment Management","It's Mitchell, Betsy. I think that from a transition point of view, we're prepared for the move and we've made all the regulatory changes already. So I don't see any expense or any related issues there.","From a yield perspective, we're all trying to continue to increase yields, but what you see happening is a couple of things in the market. First off, prime funds have already started industry-wide to decrease. There's been about a 28% shift in asset moves from prime to treasury. In addition to that, the overall market is down about 4% where we've been down about 1%. So we're doing a bit better on that front. And that prime has also decreased a little less than the industry and that only 24% of our assets have moved.","We still expect about a third to a half of prime assets to move out into treasury funds over the next quarter. Exactly how much, we're not sure. But we've got the products and we are continuing to look carefully at yields in order to make sure that the shift goes into our treasuries.","Alternative products such as insured deposit accounts are also possible where people will move funds, too. It's still a little bit wait-and-see and quite frankly, it's going to be this third quarter where we're really going to see how the movements play out, but I think we're very well-positioned for it.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And you're basically taking liquidity into liquidity. You're not seeing a trend of investors moving from liquidity product into maybe a bit of a barbell strategy to try to maintain yields.","Mitchell Evan Harris - Chief Executive Officer-Investment Management","No.","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No.","Mitchell Evan Harris - Chief Executive Officer-Investment Management","No, not at all.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And I think the volatility uncertainty in the market, there's a lot more cash being held in general.","Mitchell Evan Harris - Chief Executive Officer-Investment Management","There's a lot more cash being held and their funds are holding a lot more cash in anticipation of a shift between funds.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right. And I guess what I'm surprised that is that only a third move. So you're saying two-thirds of the funds are willing to accept the higher risk associated with the prime fund structure.","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think they're waiting till the last minute.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Mitchell Evan Harris - Chief Executive Officer-Investment Management","Yeah.","Brian Thomas Shea - Vice Chairman & CEO-Investment Services","And, Betsy, it's Brian. From a servicing perspective, we've invested in the changes we need to make to our systems to support a floating NAV institutional prime money funds and we are on track to be ready to serve our clients in October seamlessly.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Because that's a flip of the switch day out, right?","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah.","Brian Thomas Shea - Vice Chairman & CEO-Investment Services","Yeah.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Brian Thomas Shea - Vice Chairman & CEO-Investment Services","Thanks, Betsy.","Operator","And next we will go to Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research.","James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hey. Good morning. Maybe just a quick follow-up, but if you could help us think through more specifics around Brexit, if there's shifting you need to do in terms of client assets or people. And if we should think is there any material impact on you guys in terms of your UK presence from the declining pound? Any specifics that you can share with us?","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Great question. Thank you for it. We are extremely well positioned. We already have in place and have had in place for a long period of time a Belgian Brussels bank. It is well established. It's an operating center. It has capital liquidity, governance, management, everything that a European bank is required to have. And it's already passportable across all of Europe.","In addition, we have a UK bank and we have a branch of our institutional bank in the UK. We also have a bank in Luxembourg that's also fully registered and then we have operations in Ireland as well. So we think we have lots of choice for our clients as they go through this. And, particularly, the fund managers, when they have to think about the jurisdiction of their funds, if they have to move them from the UK to a European-passported location, we are very well positioned to help them get there. So we think we're in good shape operationally to help our clients deal with whatever impact Brexit offers.","James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","So no real incremental expense for you guys. Do you see any impact on your clients that could be adverse, or is it just really just shifting AUM around and no real net outflow?","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","One, I think it's early to tell. I think our clients are all going to go through is does it make sense to make the shift. They're going to go through the process of is there marginal activity that warrants continuing to make the investment and\/or shift versus shutting it down. I think we're very early in the process, but we have the expertise and the legal entities and the structures to be able to help our clients navigate those decisions.","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Right.","James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","And any impact from the pound on you guys that's material?","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Not really.","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","We have some pound\/euro cross-exposure, but I don't think it's substantial. And when we looked at our performance for the second quarter, there was a fair amount of noise in the currencies. But when it all came netted down, it was within $1 million of impact.","James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Adam Beatty of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you and good morning. First for Mitchell on the distribution strategy in investment services. Obviously, it's a pretty broad topic with your different geographies and market segments. But just was wondering, maybe get some highlights on the strategic thinking behind that. Where you would expect the greatest leverage in the relatively near term and how the boutiques will play a role? Thanks.","Mitchell Evan Harris - Chief Executive Officer-Investment Management","Thanks for that. There's several things. You have really institutional retail and wealth, so you have several different distribution points. And then you have with the institutional, we've traditionally been focused on the U.S. and I think we've broadened it because we've had opportunities out in Asia.","So we're strengthening Asia where there are more immediate opportunities. And clearly pockets are growing, both specifically on the sovereign wealth, but on the institutional side. Japan has some terrific opportunities there and we've certainly been focused on those.","On the retail side, when you think about the DOL and the changes taking place there, I think all we're doing is rebalancing both how we interact with the intermediary side, given the changes. The RIAs and the private banks, we haven't had enough focus, particularly on the RIA segment, which is the fastest-growing segment from a distribution perspective.","And then on the wealth side, we've continued with the build-out of Atherton to focus really on where pockets of wealth in the southern part of the United States and out West have been growing. We've been more focused on the traditional, I'll call it the industrial, belt of Detroit, Chicago and those kind of \u2013 and the East Pittsburgh, New York. So it's where the pockets of wealth are. It's segmentation of what segments of wealth are growing, and that are the women, the Hispanics in particular. So we're looking both geographically and on a segmentation basis.","And with respect to the boutiques, the boutiques are focused primarily on the institutional markets and the center is focused primarily on the retail markets. So I think we've clarified or cleaned up where each of our responsibilities lie.","Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. So the boutiques are basically going into the institutional market on a stand-alone basis somewhat.","Mitchell Evan Harris - Chief Executive Officer-Investment Management","Yes, in their home markets. In Asia, we're representing all of them. It's much more efficient to do it that way out in the Asian markets. And the servicing that they require, particularly the Japanese, it's a very high level of service, so it's best done on a consolidated basis.","Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. That's great. Thank you. And then on Pershing, just wanted to step back a little bit, a lot of crosscurrents with some doing self-clearing, some competitors exiting, probably a net headwind in the recent past. But just comparing a multi-year growth trajectory and then looking out, would you expect higher growth? Lower growth? Same? And also maybe a comment on some of the RIA price cuts at Schwab. Thank you.","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I would say a couple things. We've had two of our large U.S. wealth management clients owned by FIs exit and we still have one more to go. We've been obviously offsetting that fee pressure with new business from competitors in transition and pivoting more of our resources toward growth in the RIA market.","We think the Department of Labor fiduciary standard is going to obviously continue to accelerate the secular trend from traditional brokerage commission-based relationships to advisory-based relationships. And Pershing is well-positioned with managed account platforms, advisory tools and an RIA custody business that's growing high-double digits to benefit from that perspective.","We're also continuing to extend the prime services business in a modest, controlled way. And so there's a variety of I think longer-term trends, including those self-clearing firms that can drive reasonable growth in the clearing services business.","The pressure is on the broker-dealer model overall, which is a headwind. There are 800 fewer broker-dealers in United States today than they were pre-financial crisis and there are still more pressures on their business model. So that's a headwind, but we're pivoting toward serving larger firms and the RIA market and other services, which I think will offset that.","Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's great. And maybe on the competitive action from Schwab.","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","We focus on professionally managing large advisors. So our targeted market in the advisory space tends to be a much larger advisory firm rather than an individual practitioner and we tend to focus also higher net-worth investors at the end of the day. So we've got some differentiating factors.","For example, and this is a combination of Pershing and BNY Mellon at its best, we've integrated a bank and brokerage custody platform that enables us to deliver both of those options through a seamless front-end technology solution.","Another example where we're creating distinction is through delivering private banking services to introducing broker-dealers and RIAs. We've talked about this before, but at the end of the second quarter, we've now reached $3 billion in outstanding credit facilities driven from our private banks to those RIA and broker-dealer intermediaries and over $2 billion of those facilities have been drawn and used.","So that's creating a stronger competitive value proposition for those independent advisors and broker-dealers, and it's also creating sort of another virtual private banking capability for our private bank. And it's a great example of enterprise teamwork.","So Schwab's obviously a market leader in what they do. We're focused on leveraging the best of BNY Mellon to distinguish ourselves in the RIA market.","Operator","And our final question will come from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, guys. I had a question regarding \u2013 there was a story in this morning's paper about direct repo loans are gaining traction as the large global banks step back. Is this an opportunity for you guys to get more business from some of your existing clients or create new clients? Or could it work against you?","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's an interesting question. We always want to maintain great credit standards before jumping into something like this. We also have to be mindful of the effect to the balance sheet. And so, there is opportunity for us to be direct with certain clients. And so, on a client-by-client basis, we're looking at it carefully.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then second as a follow-up, Gerald, to your comment about the issues with the pension funds around the world with the rate environment, the way it is, and the unfounded liabilities, have you guys tried to quantify how much you could help them shrink that gap versus having to structurally change the pension fund, whether lowering the payout or raising the contributions by the municipality, the corporate or the entity that has it?","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would say in the UK, we're very, very active. We're just beginning in the U.S. and just beginning in other parts of the world. And we actually have an initiative going on here in the U.S. extending the Insight business model here. We did a small acquisition last year that's integrated into Insight to address that very issue. So, we're moving around the country and having that dialogue as we speak.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Is it fair to say that your reception is probably very good from who you're talking to?","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would say generally, yes. There's lots of accounting challenges associated with pension liabilities and pension accounting in company's balance sheet in the U.S., so it's not an easy answer. We want to help manage to the returns, the pension funds we're looking for. We don't want to assume the pension liability.","Some insurance companies are actually buying the liabilities. We don't have an interest in doing that. But we are interested in working with either the companies or those who are taking on the liabilities to manage to a prescribed return.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you for the color.","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Well, thank you very much everyone for dialing in. Sorry, we had to cut off the questions, but we're over time. But I know Valerie Haertel and her whole team are available for additional questions and thank you very much.","Operator","And once again, ladies and gentlemen, if there are any additional questions or comments, you may contact Ms. Valerie Haertel at (212) 635-8529.

Ms. Haertel, you may begin.","Valerie Haertel","Thank you, Wendy.","Good morning and welcome everyone to the BNY Mellon fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With us today are Gerald Hassell, our Chairman and CEO; Todd Gibbons, our CFO; as well as our executive management team.","The fourth quarter earnings materials include a financial highlights presentation that will be referred to in our discussion of results and can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.","Before Gerald and Todd begin their remarks, let me take a moment to remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors.","These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release, the financial highlights presentation and those identified in our documents filed with the SEC that are available on our website bnymellon.com. Forward-looking statements in this call speak only of today, January 23, 2015, and we will not update forward-looking statements.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Gerald Hassell. Gerald?","Gerald Hassell","Thanks, Valerie, and good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us today. Our performance in the quarter caps a solid year of delivering for our shareholders.","Throughout 2014 we demonstrated our focus on and commitment to controlling expenses to create positive operating leverage. We were disciplined in our efforts to continue to drive profitable revenue growth.","We maintained our strong capital position and executed on our capital plan. And we created value added solutions for our clients and good returns for our shareholders.","So looking at the full year, earnings per share were up 5% on an adjusted basis. We generated significant positive operating leverage even while absorbing elevated regulatory compliance costs and investing in our business to support future growth. Approximately 79% of our earnings were returned to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","If you exclude a couple of the sizable gains that we had, our payout ratio was 94%, which is in line with our targeted payout ratio objective of 80% to 100%. And from a total shareholder return perspective, we outperformed the trust banks, the S&P 500 financials and a median of our 11 member peer group in 2014.","We also achieved that same feat over a three-year period, which is really nice to see. So all in all a good year. We got a lot done.","Now focusing on the fourth quarter in comparison to the same quarter a year ago, I'll provide you with some high-level overview and Todd will take you through the financial details.","Earnings per share were $0.70, which included $0.12 per share primarily for a previously disclosed tax benefit net of litigation and restructuring charges.","Importantly, on an adjusted EPS basis, we were up 7% year-over-year. We believe we did an excellent job in demonstrating our expense discipline and we are confident that it is sustainable.","Now just as a reminder, some of the actions that we've taken include rationalizing staffing levels, insourcing application development, reducing our real estate portfolio, simplifying our operating environment and focusing on all of those little items and big items in the discretionary expense category.","Now these actions are paying off as total adjusted expenses were down 5% year-over-year and 1% sequentially.","Now as we pointed out at our Investor Day conference, we are committed to EPS growth in all environments as we work through the challenges of low interest rates and increased regulatory compliance requirements, which are impacting the industry at large.","Now looking at investment services, during the quarter we delivered solid growth in asset servicing, which was up 4%, clearing services was up 7% and treasury services was up 6%.","Now those areas of strength more than offset the decline in issuer services, which was down 19% due to seasonality in depositary receipts and the episodic nature of that business as well as the ongoing maturation of high-value securitizations in corporate trusts.","Now the good news is we are increasingly confident that we are near the inflection point for the improved revenue growth in corporate trusts.","Now I should add that assets under custody or administration were up 3% to $28.5 trillion and we had $130 billion in new assets under custody and administration wins in asset servicing.","Now turning to investment management and performance fees, they actually declined 2%. However, investment management was most impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar. If adjusted for currency swings these would have been up 2%.","Now also impacting our business results were lower performance fees versus a strong quarter a year ago. Now assets under management increased 8% to a new record $1.71 trillion benefiting from improved equity market values and net new business.","During the quarter we had a long-term inflow of $27 billion reflecting continued strength in our liability driven investment strategies and we also had short-term inflows of $5 billion. Wealth management fees were also up 5%.","As you know we've been investing and expanding our wealth management sales force and entering new markets. Those efforts are starting to generate revenue, which we are very pleased to see. And we've also been working to position investment services and investment management for long-term success by focusing on several areas for growth.","Within investment services collateral services is a great example. Usage of our optimization, segregation and securities financing solutions have been increasing and as a result the revenue contributions from these services have been growing very nicely.","Now another example is foreign exchange where we have enhanced our platform. We are now capturing more volume as clients are increasingly utilizing our electronic trading capabilities.","In investment management some of the strategic initiatives we've discussed are coming through in the results. I have already mentioned wealth management growth initiatives and now how that's beginning to generate revenues.","But we've also focused on expanding distribution of our investment solutions through the intermediary channels and further accessing our Pershing platform that services broker-dealers and financial advisors.","Now these are just a few examples of where we're investing in growth to leverage our strength and business synergies to further extend our competitive advantages.","Turning to capital, it remains very strong even after investing in our businesses to fuel future growth. And also importantly, we repurchased 11 million shares during the quarter for $432 million. And we also delivered a strong return on tangible common equity of 16% on an adjusted basis for the quarter and 18% on the same basis for the full year.","So turning to 2015, we remain confident in our ability to execute on the strategic priorities we shared with you back in October. They include driving further improvement in productivity and service quality while reducing cost and risk throughout the organization, investing in opportunities that will help us deliver innovative solutions and differentiate our service offering, achieving profitable revenue growth and maintaining a strong capital position while returning significant levels of excess capital to our shareholders.","And we continue to look for ways to deliver even greater value to clients and shareholders. And we've implemented processes, capabilities and organizational enhancements that are making us more efficient and effective. And we've added new executive talent to our leadership team and to our Board to complement our existing expertise that will help drive the execution of our plan.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Todd.","Todd Gibbons","Thanks, Gerald, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will follow the financial highlights document starting with Page 6 that details our non-GAAP results for the quarter.","As Gerald noted, reported EPS was $0.70. That includes the $0.12 benefit related to the tax carry-back claim. And it is also netted of litigation restructuring charges in the quarter.","We had a number of items impacting our fourth quarter and our full-year results, the larger of which we've listed on Page 21. So as I go through this report, I will focus on the numbers adjusted for those items.","Revenue in the fourth quarter was down approximately 3% year-over-year as strong growth in asset servicing, clearing services and treasury services was offset by lower issuer services fees and performance fees.","Expenses were significantly lower year-over-year and down slightly sequentially, representing our continued expense discipline and the progress on driving efficiency and transformation.","Our strong commitment to expense control resulted in us generating 232 basis points of positive operating leverage year-over-year on an adjusted basis. Income before taxes was up year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, our pretax margin increased approximately 200 basis points to 28% from 26% in the fourth quarter of '13.","Return on tangible common equity remained strong at 16%. We had a modest negative impact to pretax income from a stronger U.S. dollar, that's for the whole company. It reduced, and this is in the fourth quarter, it reduced our revenue and expense each by approximately 1%.","At the business unit level, the currency impact was unfavorable to investment management and slightly favorable to investment services. Our capital ratios were not affected by the currency moves.","For the full year shown on Page 9, revenue declined slightly and expenses were down even more enabling us to generate 87 basis points of positive operating leverage, or 190 basis points if you exclude investment in other income and securities gains. Income before taxes was up slightly and our operating margin remained unchanged from the prior year at 28%.","EPS for the full year was up 5%. Return on tangible common equity for the full year was approximately 18%.","Page 10 shows the drivers of our investment management business that help explain the underlying performance. In the fourth quarter we achieved record AUM of $1.71 trillion that's up 8% year-over-year, driven by the equity market values, new business and it was partially offset by the dollar impact.","During the quarter we had long-term net inflows of $27 billion and that reflected the continued strength in the liability driven fixed income and alternative investments. Short-term net inflows were also positive. They were up $5 billion.","For the full year we experienced net long-term inflows of $48 billion. We had net outflows in equities in the fourth quarter and we also had them on a full-year basis. And that has been consistent with what we've seen elsewhere in the industry.","Our wealth management business continues to perform well. Average loans and deposits continue to trend up nicely.","Turning to Page 11, you can see our financial results for investment management. I will touch on just a few points before I move on to investment services.","Performance fees were $882 million which include -- excuse me, investment management and performance fees, which includes the performance fees of $44 million. Investment management fees reflect the dollar impact, also benefited however by higher equity market values.","Compared to the third quarter of 2014, our performance fees doubled from $22 million. That is a seasonal event for us. And as Gerald noted performance fees were lower versus a much stronger than average year-ago quarter.","Other revenue was $7 million in the fourth quarter compared with $43 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 and $16 million in the third quarter. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects lower other revenue related to hedging activity within a boutique and then also lower seed capital gains. The hedge is designed to mitigate the impact of market movements in future fee revenues.","Given the substantial growth in related AUM, we would expect future revenues to more than offset the loss on the hedge. Income before taxes excluding amortization of intangible assets and the charge related to investment management funds net of incentives was 8% lower year-over-year and essentially unchanged sequentially. If you adjust for the other revenue and currency impact the earnings would have been up 7%.","Turning to our investment services metrics on Page 12, you can see that assets under custody and administration at quarter end were $28.5 trillion. That's up 3% year-over-year primarily reflecting higher market values and net new business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. Linked quarter AUC\/A was also higher.","Many of our other key investment services metrics show growth on a year-over-year basis. The market value of securities on loan at period end again showed strong growth, especially as compared to the fourth quarter of '13. Securities on loan were up 23% to $289 billion, largely due to higher levels of equity collateral as well as higher value of fixed income and equity securities.","Average loans and deposits were both up. Our key broker-dealer metric of average tri-party repo balances also grew. All of our clearing metrics recorded solid gains with DARTS volume and average long-term mutual fund assets each showing double-digit growth.","Looking at the DR program metrics you will see that we had a focus on exiting low activity programs and programs that did not meet profitability criteria. This combined with routine disclosures due to corporate actions has resulted in a net decline in the number of DR programs in our portfolio.","On Page 13 you can see detailed segment reporting for investment services. The key variances are reflected in fee and other revenue in our consolidated results on page 14.","Moving to that page you will see that asset servicing fees were up 4% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects organic growth and net new business partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.","The sequential decrease primarily reflects the impact of the dollar. It was also offset a little bit by new business.","Clearing services fees were up 7% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. Both increases were driven by higher clearance revenue reflecting higher DARTS volume. The year-over-year increase also reflects higher mutual fund and asset-based fees.","Issuer service fees were down 19% year-over-year and 39% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower corporate actions and dividend fees and depositary receipts. The sequential decrease is primarily related to seasonality in depositary receipts but that was partially offset by slightly higher corporate trust fees.","We are pleased to see signs that corporate trust revenue is stabilizing as expected. Treasury services fees were up 6% year-over-year and 2% sequentially as we saw higher payment volumes. FX and other trading was up 3% year-over-year and down slightly sequentially.","For this line item you can also refer to the table at the top of Page 8 in the earnings press release to see the details I'm going to go through right now. FX revenue of $165 million was up 31% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially and that reflected higher volumes and volatility in both periods.","In the fourth quarter we did see a seasonal drop in DR-related activity that offset some of the effect of the higher volatility. In other trading we had a loss of $14 million, which compared with revenue of $20 million in the year-ago quarter and a loss of $1 million sequentially.","Both period comparison decreases and other trading revenue primarily reflect lower fixed income derivatives trading since we are exiting our derivative sales and trading businesses as well as losses on hedging activities within one of the investment management boutiques that I discussed earlier.","Partially offsetting this was the favorable impact of interest-rate hedging activity, which was offset elsewhere in net interest revenue.","Turning to the net interest revenue on Page 15 of the financial highlights, you will see that NIR on a fully taxable equivalent basis was down 7% versus the year-ago quarter and down slightly from Q3. The year-over-year decrease primarily resulted from lower asset yields and higher premium amortization on agency mortgage-backed securities.","As you may recall in the fourth quarter last year a sharp rise in interest rates temporarily slowed the amortization of premium mortgage-backed securities. The year-over-year decrease also reflects lower accretion and the impact of interest-rate hedging, which is primarily offset in other trading.","The decrease was partially offset by a change in the mix of assets and the higher average interest earning assets driven by higher deposits, so we did see a little bit of growth in deposits.","The sequential decrease in NIR was driven by the impact of the interest-rate hedging of approximately $13 million and that is offset in the other trading revenue. In the fourth quarter we completed our plan to reduce interbank placements and increase our high-quality liquid assets in the securities portfolio to better and more efficiently comply with the evolving liquidity requirements.","On page 16 you will see that non-interest expense decreased by 5% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Both comparisons reflect lower staff expense, lower asset-based taxes and the favorable impact of a stronger dollar. That was partially offset by higher professional, legal and other purchase service expenses.","The increase in that line item was primarily related to the implementation of strategic platforms to support future revenue growth. Both comparisons also reflect the fluctuations in business development expenses which was higher quarter over quarter and lower year-over-year.","Turning to capital on Page 17, capital ratios were flat. That is largely driven by an adjustment in the other comprehensive income related to pension liabilities, reflected changes in the discount rate as well as the mortality assumptions there.","Our estimated supplemental leverage ratio declined by 10 basis points to 450 and that was driven by a modest increase in quarterly average total assets. One final note about the quarter, as you will see in our release our effective tax rate was 9.4% which includes the 16.5% benefit related to the previously disclosed approval of a tax carry-back claim and the impact of a consolidated investment management fund.","Now a few points to factor into your thinking about the first quarter. We would expect total staff expense to increase sequentially by approximately $100 million from the fourth quarter and that's driven primarily by the acceleration of long-term incentive compensation expense. As you recall that typically takes place in the first quarter of each year.","Occupancy costs should rise by about $7.5 million related to the sale of One Wall Street as we are planning to move into our new headquarters. That will result in double rent in 2015. That will more than reverse itself in 2016 when we begin to see the quarterly benefit from consolidating our New York space.","We also need to note that we are subject to the European resolution fund in 2015, although we are not certain of the actual expense that might create. We believe the impact of all of these items offset somewhat by our expense management efforts should result in expenses up around 1% to 2% in the first quarter of 2015 versus the first quarter of 2014. This is as expected and well within our Investor Day guidelines.","Net interest revenue should be about at the level we saw in the third quarter. The effective tax rate should be around 26% to 27%.","So to summarize we had a good quarter. Overall, we are pleased to see the results of the expense control efforts falling to the bottom line and creating significant positive operating leverage.","As we look ahead we are focused on creating value for our clients and shareholders by driving organic revenue growth and by continuing to be relentless in the pursuit of additional efficiencies and the savings as we execute on the strategic plan that we discussed at Investor Day. We are also focused on maintaining our expense discipline to reduce costs and maintaining our strong capital position.","With that let me hand it back to Gerald.","Gerald Hassell","Great, Todd. Thanks a lot. And Wendy, I think we can open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we're ready to begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.","Glenn Schorr","Hi, thanks very much. So looking through all the disclosure I'm not sure I missed it yet, but have you disclosed what you think your TLAC ratio is and where you need to be?","Todd Gibbons","Yes, we've not, Glenn. We would estimate that we're probably around 20%. We do have a fair amount of debt at the holding company, as you can see.","I think the talk out there -- the ranges are 16% to 20%. At this time there is a proposal, but I don't think it's adequately defined to really go much beyond that.","Glenn Schorr","And just making sure, the 20% does not exclude the buffers, which for you guys isn't as big as most, but that's another 3.5 off? Okay, the bottom line is you are in a reasonably comfortable range is the bottom line?","Todd Gibbons","From what we can tell at this point.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. And then I apologize, I missed all the commentary on the $14 million loss and other trading related to the fixed income trading.","So one, if you could just repeat what was it specifically related to and then two, am I reading too much into -- exiting the business that should not repeat. Is the balance sheet related to that business all closed out? Just curious on where we are at in that process.","Todd Gibbons","Okay, well there are really three unusual items in there Glenn. One is that the exit did and certainly on a year-over-year basis had an impact because we had pretty decent revenues there in the fourth quarter of last year, but we did incur some losses in the exit process.","We could see some little impact on a go-forward basis. We wouldn't expect it to be much one way or the other.","Obviously we're not going to see an increase in revenues as we exit. To answer the second question there, it has had some modest reduction in our trading assets at this point and we will continue to see that reduce going forward.","So A, it was the derivatives exit. The second thing that went on in there is we had a hedge in one of our boutiques against fee revenues. That hedge actually had a loss.","And those two things were partially offset by gains on our interest-rate hedging which actually was a negative to interest rates but a positive to other trading. That's where the minus $14 million came from.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. I appreciate it. That's my one and one.","Todd Gibbons","Okay, thanks Glenn.","Gerald Hassell","Thanks Glenn.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Hi. Good morning, guys. I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit more detail in terms of magnitude when we try to separate what the impact on investment management fees and servicing fees is from the FX translation and then the underlying growth that we don't quite see on the surface because of it.","Todd Gibbons","Yes, so if you look at it, Ken, it's about probably a little bit over 1% on the overall revenue growth rate and a little bit over that on the expense rate. So that puts you you're talking around $40 million or so in the quarter.","Ken Usdin","On total revenues?","Todd Gibbons","Yes. And so if you really look at the drivers of the revenues in the quarter it is a combination of that and what we saw in issuer services. So issuer services was down substantially both sequentially on a year-over-year basis. That's almost all DRs. That tends to be episodic.","And so last year we saw quite a few transactions that fell -- or we saw some transactions that fell into the fourth quarter. We didn't see any of that in this fourth quarter. So that is our most capital markets transactions-like business that is a little bit less predictable.","Ken Usdin","Okay, got it. And then my second question is just you guys did a really good job certainly relative to how you had talked about expenses at the third-quarter conference call and adjusting to the revenue environment here, but Gerald I was wondering if you can just take us a step further?","I know expenses will be up 1% to 2% year-over-year. Are there other things that you are contemplating now from an expense control perspective that we might not have heard at Analyst Day in terms of your view of the overall revenue environment and any incremental need to just tighten things up even more?","Gerald Hassell","Well Ken, it's a great question. I think that the continuous process improvement program, if you want to call it that, that we have all throughout the Company in every expense category it is really taking hold. And it is an operations, it's in technology, it's in business partners, it's in every single line item in the Company and we see further opportunities to continue to ratchet those expenses down as we get more efficient and more productive.","And so that's why we are very confident that our expense control environment is very sustainable going into the future. A lot of the regulatory costs that continue to rise, the rate of rise is flowing down, so we've gotten a lot of that in the run rate.","So I think we feel very good about the ability to continue to control and manage expenses into the future, certainly within the guidelines that we gave you at Investor Day. That being said, we are very cognizant that it is a very tough revenue environment. And so we are going to be even more diligent on the expense side to offset any potential slowness in the revenue side.","Ken Usdin","Understood. Thanks, Gerald.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning. Couple quick questions on the revenue side, just a follow-up on one of Glenn's questions and thinking about the derivatives, the bond derivatives trading.","That $34 million year-over-year revenue delta, is that the sort of run rate we should be looking for a headwind for the next three quarters as that rolls off, or was that comp particularly difficult? Can you give us an idea about what kind of run rate we should look to reduce?","Todd Gibbons","Yes Brennan, I think that comp was a particularly difficult one. We weren't making a whole lot of money in the derivatives business.","As we went through the course of the year there was probably one good quarter and it was a little bit of softness and some of the unwinding in the fourth quarter. So I think that is not something that I would factor into your model.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. Great. Thank you. And then, what do you think drove -- FX was certainly good versus history but when we look at what State Street and Northern printed this quarter you came in comparably a little weaker.","Is there something that happened in FX that prevented you from capitalizing on the environment to the same extent that competitors appear to, or can you help us maybe understand the delta there?","Todd Gibbons","Sure. I think we outperformed a bit in the third quarter. That's not unusual for us because we have a lot of ADR activity in the third quarter that we don't see in the fourth quarter.","And in fact we saw almost zero ADR activity in the fourth quarter, so that is probably the differentiator for us. If you look at us on a year-over-year basis we are up strongly.","Brennan Hawken","Terrific, thanks very much.","Todd Gibbons","Thanks Brennan","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hi. Good morning. I don't know if I missed it, but I know you went through the SLR ratio at yearend at 4.5%. Could you just give us the plan to get to 5% and can you get there without a rate rise meaning does getting to 5% require some of the excess deposits to come out?","Todd Gibbons","Yes. It would certainly be easier to get us, Betsy, if the excess deposits ran off. We think that could generate as much as 100 basis points on its own. We will have to be a little more aggressive, so the downside is if we don't see any rate movement we will probably have to generate 20 or 25 basis points or so on the way we manage deposits.","We mentioned on Investor Day that one of the things that we would be doing is if we are in the 90% to 100% on our payout ratio we still get pretty significant capital retention, as you saw this year. That generates about 70 to 80 basis points by the time this gets implemented.","We have a matched book that is run out of treasury that is consuming about 25 basis points or so that we could unwind. That would come with a little bit of expense, not much, we do earn a little bit on that matchbook. But that would be something that we might be able to take down.","We do think that we're going to be able to deconsolidate our variable interest entities. That is another 10 basis points or so.","The trading book that we have talked about, that is coming down. That is probably going to create another 10 basis points. So there is a lot of things that are underlying this that will slowly grind its way up to the 6% to 7% where we think we will be.","We also have the ability to issue preferred, which would be a lower cost of capital. We haven't made a decision around that but those are the steps. We printed them in the Investor Day and we are going to move along that course.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And then just on the managed deposits point there, can you give us some color on how you are thinking about that especially given what is going on in Europe recently with the Swissies going to negative 75%, etcetera?","Todd Gibbons","Sure. With the negative interest rates, as you know, not only in Europe but Swiss and Denmark, we are passing that impact on through charging for those deposits and we will adjust as the markets adjust. We saw a little bit of a decline in euro deposits over the course of the quarter, not much but a little.","So there was -- and I'm not sure that's directly in reaction to that. But we can get more aggressive as we feel -- as we might need to be in order to charge for the use of the balance sheet.","Betsy Graseck","Right. And even with you charging for the use of the balance sheet directly like that you really haven't seen that much movement in deposit as a result?","Todd Gibbons","We did see some.","Betsy Graseck","Some. All right. Thank you.","Todd Gibbons","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Hi. Good morning, folks.","Todd Gibbons","Hi Brian.","Brian Bedell","Just a little bit more on the balance sheet. Can you talk about what you view as your excess deposits -- I'm sorry if I missed this -- the excess deposits level and trends coming into 2015 I guess in conjunction, Todd, with being able to pass through the lower central bank rates and just how you think that might play out as we move through the year?","Todd Gibbons","We probably see it if we look at what happened to us mostly in dollars from the quantitative easing in the U.S., most of that came through institutional depositors so the trust banks were big recipients of that. Our estimate that that is probably in the $50 billion to $70 billion range, Brian, so if we were to see a normal drain that we would see that money go away.","Brian Bedell","Consistent with what you have outlined on Investor Day still?","Todd Gibbons","Yes. I don't think that has changed. Now the mechanism for the monetary policy change is still a bit uncertain, so it might have to be done through pricing.","Brian Bedell","Right. Okay. As we move through 2015 you are expecting only part of that to move through, this is more of a two-to-three-year evolution, is that correct?","Todd Gibbons","Well it would actually depend on the course of monetary policy. If nothing happens we wouldn't expect any of it to move. And eventually we will start to, like I had mentioned earlier, we will just start to charge more and more and drive some of the deposits away based on the cost.","Gerald Hassell","Brian, it's Gerald, we're managing the company assuming that there is no rate rise and therefore both on the revenue and the expense side and the balance sheet we are really trying to make sure the expenses are in line with a slow revenue growth environment.","And if we need to be more aggressive on the deposit side to make sure we achieved the capital ratios that are expected of us we will be more aggressive there, too.","Brian Bedell","Okay. That's great color. And then just on a couple of revenue items, maybe just the outlook into 2015 within issuer services the DR side, it looks like the corporate trust, like you said, is beginning to inflect.","So maybe what your view is on depository receipts coming into 2015 on a year-over-year basis versus 2014. And then also on the collateral service side it sounds like you are gaining good traction, in there any kind of color on revenue growth in collateral services?","Gerald Hassell","Brian, why don't I ask Brian Shea to take that one?","Brian Shea","Okay, hi Brian. Look, the depository receipts business, as Todd mentioned, tends to be volatile, high-margin revenue for us. And what you saw in the year-over-year comparison is we had a large corporate action activity last year and not this year.","So it didn't repeat itself in the fourth quarter this year and the rest of it in the sequential quarter is really the seasonality. The third quarter tends to be a high dividend quarter. And the fourth quarter in falls off, so that is pretty typical.","But overall we are still winning more than our fair share of new depository receipts assignments. I think we had a significant increase in new programs year-over-year and the net issuance in the fourth quarter was up.","So I would say that while it is seasonal\/cyclical we don't have any structural concerns about the DR business and we feel like the year-over-year comparison will be solid in 2015.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo","Hi. I'm looking at third quarter to fourth quarter and the expenses didn't decline quite as much as the revenue declined. So on the expense side you had a $67 million increase in professional fees and I am guessing that is somehow related to retiring one of your platforms and if so shouldn't a retiring of a platform help to reduce expenses?","And on the revenue side, I hear what you are saying corporate trust is at an inflection point, you are winning more than your fair share in the DR business but the issuer services line, the revenues look like the worst since 2007, so what can you say?","It seems like you are confident yet the results are down, so can you talk about the backlog? What do you think about the first quarter for that business, so just I think those two items would help with this expense to revenue relationship?","Todd Gibbons","Okay, Mike. It's Todd. I'll take that question. You asked two questions, so I am not sure we will give you a follow-up here. But the first question on the quarter to quarter, so from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, we typically see exactly that because there is a very sharp decline in DR revenue. And DR revenue is the cost of basically fixed associated with that.","It gets offset somewhat by the increase in performance fees that we -- the seasonal increase that we see in performance fees but that comes with quite a bit of compensation expense attached to it. So that's not unexpected. Your point around us being at the lowest level since 2007, I haven't looked that up but it sounds accurate.","As we have been pointed out since the crisis, corporate trust has been contracting but it has been contracting at a slower rate. It has been painful and it has been a differentiator for us. We now see and actually saw it flat to slightly up from Q3 to Q4.","We actually now see corporate trust turning the tide. So rather than contracting at a 5% to 10% type of level it is actually going to be flat to showing some growth.","DRs, I think Brian just gave you -- DRs tends to be a cyclical business. As you see flight to risk, that is a good thing. If you see a flight to quality it is typically not a good thing but we have been through that cycle and I don't think there is anything structurally different in that business.","I think your other question was related to the increase and where did the increase in consulting and professional services and legal. We did see a sharp increase -- we do typically see a seasonal increase in the fourth quarter in that line. Some of that is in the business partner.","Some of that is investment in our risk and finance systems. Most of it is related to the buildout of our platforms that we have discussed at Investor Day and then some of that is related to higher legal costs.","We would expect that run rate to decline somewhat in the first quarter. Actually, it should decline substantially in the first quarter but all within the rates -- the growth rates -- that I had mentioned to you in my comments that is that I think we will be up 1% or 2%, primarily because of the acceleration we have. We are going to have a little more cost to do the acceleration of long-term incentives in the first quarter of this year than we did last year.","Mike Mayo","And just the last point was the custody platform, did you actually retire a custody platform and when do you see the benefits from that and can you talk about headcount reductions in the recent quarter?","Brian Shea","Mike as you know, we had three -- it's Brian Shea, we had three custody platforms. We have consolidated that down to two. We completed that over the summer by the end of the third quarter of 2014.","And we're now working on consolidating the remaining two to one and we are deep into that process and that will carry us into early 2016. And as we've mentioned at Investor Day, we are in the process of simplifying our technology infrastructure overall so we have other platform consolidations under way.","Overall we have retired a couple of hundred applications in the last couple of years and we have a roadmap to do more. And that is why, I think Todd and Gerald have said, we are not only managing discretionary expenses carefully, which are kind of short-term things, the transformation process that we laid out at our Investor Day includes technology simplification, insourcing, real estate and facilities actions and other actions which are long-term contributors to the structural costs \u2013 reductions, which is why we have confidence that we can sustain good expense discipline over the long term.","Todd Gibbons","And Mike, I'll take the -- in terms of headcount we were able to manage headcount down for the year. As you know we took some actions in the second quarter and that helped us to do that.","I think you'll see the headcount is down about 800 for the full year. That also includes the fact that we were insourcing into our technology, our application development team.","So that insourcing process is now over or pretty much completed and so on a sequential basis you also saw a decline in headcount. Part of that is because we are no longer insourcing the other heads that were offsetting some of the benefit from reductions we had made elsewhere as we make ourselves a bit more efficient.","Mike Mayo","All right. Thank you.","Todd Gibbons","Thanks Mike.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","Great. Hey, good morning, everyone.","Todd Gibbons","Hey Alex.","Alex Blostein","So a couple of quick follow-ups here. So I guess on NIR as we kind of take a look at in 2015 the moves and rates we are obviously seeing this year are pretty onerous.","I was just curious how you guys think about the prospects for NII into 2015 and if we do not see much move in rate until kind of the end of the year, maybe an update on where you guys are in terms of remixing the composition of the balance sheet out of cash into securities to help sustain the same level of net interest income.","Todd Gibbons","Yes, our estimate for that is that we will see a little bit of growth in net interest income for the year even with this difficult backdrop. It is not great in Europe and it is not great in the US either.","We have moved a fair amount of cash into the securities portfolio so it has grown by about $20 billion over the past six months or so and we expect to see some additional growth over the next few months in that as well, so we are putting more cash to work.","We discussed at Investor Day how we are going to work through the HQLA, so you are seeing a continued growth in our HQLA assets. And that will I think be able to offset some of the lower rate environment.","So we think the fourth quarter was a bit of an anomaly because of the way the hedging worked itself out. But we think that we are running at about 725, 730 and we should be able to see a little bit of growth to that.","Alex Blostein","Got you. That's very helpful. Thanks. And then just another follow-up I guess on the DR business and understanding the seasonality and the choppiness of it, but if we take a step back, can you guys help us understand the impact of just maybe a structurally stronger dollar and maybe a little bit of weaker emerging markets on that business over the course of the cycle? So if U.S. dollar continues to strengthen does that matter for the issuance?","Todd Gibbons","Yes, I think for all of our businesses if we see continued flight to quality, less transaction, less cross-border transactions, that is not good for us, Alex. It reduces volumes. It moves things into treasuries and banks rather than in the capital markets.","We went to see capital market activity. Where that is displayed somewhat is in the ADR business.","The ADR business has a fairly large energy component to it and there's a lot of action there and that is somewhat helpful. It has actually been kind of interesting, we've seen interest in it and some growth in issuance rather than contraction. So with prices and the dollar down it is actually brought -- in some ways it has made it more attractive.","Gerald Hassell","And again Alex, DRs in some ways a luck of the revenue growth is around corporate actions and episodic events. So if you see or believe there is going to be increasing either merger and acquisition activity, particularly in the energy sector, that could actually be beneficial to the business.","Alex Blostein","Yes, understood. Thank you so much for the color.","Todd Gibbons","Thanks Alex.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Adam Beatty with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch.","Adam Beatty","Thank you. Good morning. Question on wealth management. You're good enough to give the overall flows for the asset management business, just wondering if what you are seeing in wealth management is similar suggestive of maybe a risk off and how your clients are reacting?","Are they spooked by volatility, or encouraged by what is still at least domestically a rising market year-over-year? Thanks.","Curtis Arledge","Hi, it's Curtis. Adam, how are you doing?","Adam Beatty","Hi Curtis.","Curtis Arledge","Our wealth management experience has been that low rates have had an impact on the amount of income that clients are getting from their portfolios. And some clients are absolutely looking for ways to increase the overall return on their portfolios but within the framework of definitely aware of the risk environment being challenging.","I would tell you that we -- I think our wealth clients have generally had a view of the equity markets being reasonably positive and have not been afraid of risk in the U.S. equity markets generally.","But as you think about expanding portfolios and making them were global, some of the things that they are reading and hearing about they have definitely taken a bent to be biased away from it. So again, it's hard to describe an entire client base all in one answer, but generally I would say that there definitely is still sensitivity about volatility in markets in those portfolios overall.","Adam Beatty","But a search for income too, yes?","Curtis Arledge","The search for income is real and it's one of the great things about the business we have is the breadth of clients that we are dealing with. As rates are falling there continues to be -- income continues to be the thing that people are increasing their search for whether they are sovereign wealth funds or wealth clients or any other array of our client base.","Gerald Hassell","And Adam, just as a reminder as a business, it's a business -- it's a terrific business. We like it a lot. The fees are growing nicely. Loans are up. Deposits are up.","We are utilizing the Pershing platform and the advisory network to source business. It's a terrific business and that's why we're investing in it. So it's very good margins, very good growth rates on a relative basis and while the clients may have different investment strategies and concerns, as a business overall it is very attractive.","Adam Beatty","Agreed. Thanks for a much. And then just a quick follow-up on collateral management and where that stands; is it living up to your expectations so far? As regulations get layered on, are clients kind of holding off to a steady-state or are they trying to get out in front of it?","Just where you see that and what inning you are in right now? Thanks.","Gerald Hassell","I think I will have Kurt Woetzel answer that, who is running our markets group now.","Kurt Woetzel","Hey Adam. So great question. The business still is performing as we outlined in the Investor Day. We are actually at all-time highs in our balances in our program.","It is really being driven by three factors. One is equity financing is still a strong business in the sell side; secondly, as you pointed out a little about regulation, regulation continues to drive the fact that synthetic structures need to be collateralized; and the third component of that really is that the OTC derivatives market is now a market that you need to segregate, if you will, the initial margin and we're the likely place for that to occur.","So those factors really continue to drive the business. And I would say a fourth component -- again, this goes back to regulation -- is that there is a shifting of the sell side's books around to places that may be more efficient from a capital structure standpoint.","That shifting is also playing well into our global program as we have a program that's very much global in nature and allows us to take advantage of where that shifting may happen.","Adam Beatty","So not just collateral but capital efficiency?","Kurt Woetzel","That is correct.","Adam Beatty","Excellent. Thank you very much. I really appreciate it.","Gerald Hassell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse.","Ashley Serrao","Good morning. Sorry to come back to DR activity but I thought in your prepared remarks you said that you were proactively exiting certain portfolios that didn't meet your profitability thresholds. I was wondering if you could size that and if both on the revenue side and also the expense benefit?","Gerald Hassell","Yes Ashley, that's why we point out to the number of programs. It's really not very material on either the revenue or the expense side. It is just the fact that we are having to carry the positions and actually have some staff or people looking at them.","It's really not material to the overall business. We are generally just focused on the profitable business and making sure we are applying the best resources to the prophet end of it. So I wouldn't look at it as a material event for DRs.","Ashley Serrao","Okay.","Todd Gibbons","And Ashley, this is Todd. Just one other comment. We've struggled to find a metric that is helpful to project where you might be able to expect performance to be because it just is so episodic. But ultimately if you look at issuance and cancellations and you kind of look at the number of programs you've got, that is some basis but it's not greatly correlated to revenue.","Ashley Serrao","Okay. I think just one quick one on expenses. So what is your outlook for pension expense next year -- this year, I mean?","Todd Gibbons","We do expect pension expenses. We had talked about on Investor Day to increase could be by as much as $60 million or so. And in directions that I give you around the expense increased for the first quarter that would reflect that as well.","Ashley Serrao","Okay. Thank you.","Todd Gibbons","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning, Gerald and Todd.","Gerald Hassell","Hi Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","Question on the strength of the U.S. dollar. Is it right to assume obviously it's a negative drag on revenue but you get the positive benefit on expenses, so the net of it is it is not a negative for the bottom line? And if that assumption is accurate, is there any environment of the dollar going forward by strengthening even further as it has since the first of the year that concerns you?","Gerald Hassell","Well your first statement is pretty accurate. Net, net it really didn't have a tremendous bottom-line impact because as you suggest, the strengthening of the dollar had negative impact on revenues and positive impact on expense. So the net, net was pretty marginal for the Company broadly but the further strengthening, Todd, that's you.","Todd Gibbons","So almost all of the impact from the dollar took place in the fourth quarter. When we talk about the impact on revenues and expenses, so when you look at the full year it is about the same -- not exactly -- but it is about the same number.","So we talked about a 1% move and for the fourth quarter so you can figure it is not too meaningful for the full year. I guess there is a correlation to the strengthening of the dollar as a flight to quality and less transactions, something I had mentioned on one of the earlier questions. That would be my concern.","My concern is that there is less issuance, less cross-border transactions other than flight to something like U.S. treasuries. That's not great for our business model, if that were to persist.","Gerald Hassell","And in this strengthening is it primarily against the euro that you are referring to, or is it a basket of currencies?","Todd Gibbons","I would say it's a basket of currencies. One offset to that, Gerard, is this is coming with quite a bit of volatility and volatility has always been healthy for us. So we are seeing the benefits of that in the first quarter.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. And then as a follow-up, Gerald, you mentioned in your opening remarks about the inflection point for improved revenues in the corporate services area, can you share with us some of the improvement -- what type of products are doing better now? What are some of the actual numbers that you are seeing that gives you that comfort to say that it's working?","Gerald Hassell","Yes sure. In corporate trust, as you know, we've suffered the last few years from the high-value securitization has been rolling off, that is coming closer to an end so that is one step in the process. Secondly, we are seeing new issuance.","With low interest rates you are seeing traditional new issues on the debt side. We have seen growth in the CLO marketplace again. We are not seeing as much traditional securitizations although some asset-backed securitizations are starting to reemerge, plain vanilla ones.","So we are starting to see that, we are getting our fair share. I will say that for a good part of 2014 with the rumored sale of corporate trust in the marketplace we were not getting as much revenue as we would like.","Now that that is over and done with I think people realize that corporate trust is a key component of our business and we are back in the growth mode. So I feel pretty good about both the new issuance market, the decline in the old business and us being able to get back into business is giving us the feeling that we are at that inflection point.","And I would say Europe continues to see more debt issuance and as bank balance sheets can't support whatever development occurs, and bank balance sheets have to come down, the securitization market is the place to go. So all of those factors are giving us a lot more confidence that we are reaching that inflection point sooner than we perhaps said to you earlier in the year -- earlier last year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein.","Luke Montgomery","Good morning. Thanks. So just a quick question on the money market fee waivers. I think you said the impact is roughly $0.06 to $0.07 per quarter split 50-50 between asset management and clearing? So maybe an update on those estimates.","And then do you calculate that against the contractual rate or some effective rate before you start weighting fees? And along with that has there been any change to your thinking about possible competitive pressures as rates rise and you try to recapture those fees?","Todd Gibbons","Why don't I take some of this, and then I'll ask Curtis to fill in some of the other color. So the net relationship it is not quite 50-50 between investment services and investment management. It's a little bit more in investment services, Luke.","In the year-over-year and the sequential it really hasn't changed. We have been running at about the same rate, so we have indicated the net income hit to us is about $0.06 to $0.07. What's going to happen competitively from here, I think Curtis, maybe you can answer?","Curtis Arledge","Yes, I will make a couple of comments and then I know Brian Shea also has the view from all the business at Pershing and across investment services as well. We have talked about this a lot. There is no question that there are actually are now lower fee money market funds in the market and they are typically delinked from the intermediaries and the sources of a lot of the cash.","So remember a lot of money market fund assets actually are connected to client accounts where there are significant other services being provided and distribution fees are a component of the overall fees that are earned in the money market fund business. So a lot of these products that exist now with lower fees actually don't gather assets in any significant way as a percentage of market share.","So I completely understand your question. We are in a world where passive products and lower fee products and asset management across many asset classes are growing in more the norm, so the question makes sense.","But I do think that understanding the distribution and the relationships with distribution partners to gather assets is a really important component of this. Brian, I don't know if you would add anything to that?","Brian Shea","I would add, we still see significant cash balances in money market funds and FDIC in short sweeps-type products. So I think particularly in the fourth quarter there was a little increase in cash management balances on the Pershing platform, for example.","Having said that, as Gerald mentioned, we are running the business as if the rates aren't going to rise. But we do think eventually there will be some increase in short-term rates which will help restore yield and fees in the money market fund business.","So I guess my one comment -- summary, is the fundamental agreements and structures of the arrangements have not really changed between the money market providers and the distribution platforms.","And so my expectation, which is not 100% necessarily right, but it's my expectation is that since the fundamental structure hasn't changed and everyone has shared in the fee waivers on the way down that I think you'll see a sharing of the restoration of fees and yields on the way up. And so we feel pretty good about -- that we will have some improvement as rates rise.","Luke Montgomery","Great, thanks. Very helpful. I think I'm going to leave it there.","Gerald Hassell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott","Hi. Good morning. The shift within the investment management business towards liability driven investment continues for another quarter. So could you discuss as that mix shift takes place how it impacts profitability, how the profitability of LDI compares with the other major elements of AUM on the investment management side?","Curtis Arledge","Yes, hi Geoff, it's Curtis Arledge. So first of all let me tell you that one of the things that is happening -- one of the most significant trends that is happening in the investment landscape is the de-risking of pension plans globally.","And so the growth of our LDI business has a lot to do with the fact that pensions -- changes in accounting, substantially lower tolerance for pension surplus volatility has caused pension plans, again on a global basis, to look to de-risk and there are cases where they are hedging that through LDI strategies.","And actually as you may have seen, there have been an increasing number of pension risk transfer transactions where pension plans have actually purchased risk insurance and effectively eliminated their pension risk from a market perspective.","And that is a major trend that BNY Mellon was very early on playing a pretty important role in, Insight specifically an investment firm that was acquired several years ago is a market leader there. We have other LDI products at Standish and Mellon Capital and really work closely with pensions globally on this.","I like the way you asked the question about the profitability. It's a very profitable business. Sometimes in the marketplace people use the fee and the word fee and the word margin interchangeably.","The fees are generally lower but the margins are attractive. It's a great business. Also in the fact that you are not just providing a product to a client, you are actually evaluating their entire asset liability framework and truly the word solution that gets used too much I think in the marketplace.","You do help them with the overall portfolio solution. So for the portion of their portfolio that they don't hedge you still have to help them think about how that should be invested and that has actually led to follow-on capabilities that we have being used by those clients. And so it has been a great springboard into other businesses with those clients.","So it's a very large trend. As you are seeing with falling rates, pensions are once again experiencing falling funding ratios.","Funding ratios had gotten into the mid-90s. They are kind of back into the high 80s, sort of on average. And it is just continuing to be one of the things that private corporate plans are very focused on and increasingly public plans also.","Geoffrey Elliott","So if we think about it as basis point fees then it is lower than some of the other products. But if you kind of look at the overall profitability of the relationship it's something you think is very attractive?","Curtis Arledge","Yes, it's very attractive. Again, the fees per AUM are lower. The AUM is quite large, generally.","We are talking about some clients will actually hedge the majority of their plan and then again it also leads to a broader relationship. I will tell you that some of the -- some clients will pay a slightly higher fee and others want to pay a lower fee and have a performance element to it, and some of our performance fees actually come from that.","So the management fee is not always the entire fee. You have to look at the total fee dynamic.","Gerald Hassell","And it is a scale business, so therefore as a business it is a very nice one and it's growing very healthy. And so we like it a lot and the team does a fantastic job in servicing our clients.","Geoffrey Elliott","Great. Thank you very much.","Gerald Hassell","Okay. Well thank you very much, everyone, for dialing in to our call. If you have any further questions, please give Valerie Haertel a call and we look forward to catching up with you real soon. Take care, everybody.","Operator","Thank you. If there are any additional questions or comments, you may contact Ms. Valerie Haertel at 212-635-8529. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

(Operator Instructions) Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent. ","I will now turn the call over to Ms. Valerie Haertel. Ms. Haertel, you may begin. ","Valerie Haertel ","Thank you, Joey. Good morning and welcome everyone to the BNY Mellon second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With us today are Gerald Hassell, our Chairman and CEO; Todd Gibbons, our CFO; as well as other members our executive management team.","Our second quarter earnings materials include a financial highlights presentation that will be referred to in a discussion of our results and can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.","Before Gerald and Todd begin, let me take a moment to remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release, the financial highlights presentation and those identified in the documents filed with the SEC that are available on our website bnymellon.com. Forward-looking statements on this call speak only as of today, July 21, 2015 and we will not update forward-looking statements.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Gerald.","Gerald Hassell","Thanks, Valerie, and welcome everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning. Our results reflect the successful execution of our strategic priorities to achieve the three year target we shared on Investor Day. We are growing our earnings, investing in next generation operating platforms and risk management controls, attracting new clients, and improving the long term value of our firm for the benefit of our clients and shareholders.","Now turning to earnings, earnings per share were $0.73, or $0.77 per share after adjusting for the previously announced litigation expense and restructuring charges. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share were up 24% year-over-year. ","Now focusing on our year-over-year comparisons on an adjusted basis. Total revenue was up 3%, as we saw strength in Asset Servicing, Global Collateral Services and Clearing and improvement in our market sensitive businesses. Our markets group in particular had another excellent quarter, helping to drive growth in investment services and the improvement in our return on tangible common equity. ","Net interest revenue was also a strong contributor to results this quarter. Total expenses were down 1% and we delivered more than 460 basis points of positive operating leverage and improved our pre-tax operating margin to 33% by executing on our revenue growth initiatives and through continued expense control. Our return on tangible common equity in the quarter increased to 22% and we continued to deliver significant value to our shareholders by returning more than $1 billon in dividends and share repurchases during the quarter.","Now looking at our progress against certain strategic priorities. Our first priority is driving profitable revenue growth. We are laser focused on leveraging our firm\u2019s capabilities to strengthen and expand our existing client relationships and selectively building new ones. Investment Services revenues benefited from the areas where we\u2019ve been investing, that is Asset Servicing, Global Collateral Services and clearing. ","Now the investments we are making in strategic technology, platforms and applications are clearly paying off and our solutions are resonating with clients. We won a significant middle office contract to service $770 billion in assets for a prominent investment manager. That win was part of a strong new business quarter for Investment Services. Now, while our costs will increase in the short run as we prepare to onboard this new business, our platforms are designed to be leveraged by a broader client base and to take advantage of our economies of scale. ","Foreign exchange revenue was also up strongly year-over-year, as we continue to benefit from both higher volatility and volumes captured through the expansion of our services. ","Now we also strive to deliver a great client experience, which is critical to driving revenues. Third party recognition of our capabilities continued. We took the top spot in this year\u2019s Global Investor ISF Global Custody Survey in EMEA and single custody weighted categories. We also topped the weighted rankings for clients with assets under management greater than $3 billion in the Global EMEA and Asia Pacific categories. We were named the best ETF service provider in the Americas for the ninth year in a row by Exchangetradedfunds.com. And we were named custodian of the year for Latin America in the Custody Risk Americas Award which recognized the growth in quality of the custody service we launched in Brazil less than three years ago. ","Now turning to Investment Management, we continue to make progress on several key initiatives. We are already seeing positive results from expanding our reach to the US retail investors as our investment strategies to becoming more visible on third party platforms. In addition, we are connecting with our Pershing financial advisory clients. In fact, the private banking growth we\u2019ve seen in Wealth Management with Pershing clients is a powerful example of our ability to leverage the synergy between investment services and Investment Management for the benefit of our clients. Our initiative to grow our Wealth Management presence in attractive new locations is beginning to add to our revenue growth there as well. ","Now switching to Asset Management, our LDI strategies continue to see strong inflows as do inflows into alternative assets, continuing the trend of the last few quarters. Both are areas where we are working to expand our presence. Now, while we\u2019ve made significant progress on those fronts, it was not enough to offset the industry-wide impact of active institutional equity outflows. In fact, while we had a total net long-term outflows of $15 billion, two non-US institutional clients drove $20 billion of the outflows as they liquidated holdings to address cash needs and changes in in their investment strategies. ","On the investment performance front, during the quarter, the strength of our capabilities was recognized through a number of awards. Insight Investment was named LDI Manager of the Year and Fixed Income Manager of the Year and Newton the SRI Provider of the Year by the European Pension Awards. Insight was also named LDI manager of the year for the third consecutive year by the CIO European Innovation Awards. And ARX was named Top Brazilian Managers by the Standard & Poor\u2019s for the fifth consecutive year. ","Now, our second broad priority is executing on our business improvement process. Our success on this front is reflected in lower expenses in nearly all categories. We are making continued headway on reducing structural costs and risks while improving the productivity and quality and it\u2019s clearly showing up in our results. From a structural standpoint, we continue to optimize our business mix. We shut down our central securities depository and began to reposition our UK transfer agency business because they simply did not meet our return criteria. ","We made progress in streamlining our Investment Management operations in APAC and also made a tough decision to shut down our separately managed account offering for now. It\u2019s a solution that we were really excited about and we are not ruling out the possibility of re-establishing it down the road. But when we didn\u2019t gain the traction on the market that we expected, we held to our discipline.","During the quarter, we renegotiated certain vendor contracts and made progress in reducing data storage costs in our real estate footprint as we continue to improve the profitability of our business. Now our third priority centers on being a strong, safe, and trusted counterparty. We\u2019ve reduced and simplified our counterparty exposure by exiting the derivatives business. We practically eliminated the intra-day credit risk within the US tri-party repo market and we submitted our fourth annual global resolution plan to the FDIC and the Fed. ","Now, we are one of the few banks that propose a tried and proven resolution strategy involving the use of a bridge bank run by the FDIC, something we can do because of our inherently smaller and more liquid balance sheet versus other G-SIBs. Now, to be able to deliver on this plan, we have made commitments to fund more than 30 initiatives over the next two years. It\u2019s expensive, but it will make us even more resilient company in the future. ","Our fourth priority involves generating excess capital and deploying it effectively. We are focused on ensuring our capital ratios are compliant with evolving regulatory requirements. During the quarter, we successfully issued $1 billion in preferred stock, which further strengthened our capital position and enabled us to repurchase more than 800 million in shares and distribute almost $200 million in dividends. ","Our fifth priority is to attract and retain and develop top talent. During the quarter, we had a talent and corporate trust to position us to capitalize on the increased debt issuance market and regain some momentum there. We added staff to support our strategic growth initiatives and we also continued to insource the people who power our technology, productivity, cost and speed to market initiatives. As we look ahead, we are confident in our ability to achieve our three year investor day goals and to deliver even more value to our clients. ","With that, let me turn it over to Todd.","Todd Gibbons ","Thanks, Gerald, and good morning, everyone. As in the past, my commentary will follow the financial highlights document, so if we start with page seven that details our non-GAAP, or what we call our operating results for the quarter. As Gerald noted, EPS was $0.77, up 24% from the year ago quarter. ","Revenue in the second quarter was approximately 3% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, and that reflected growth across most of our business, with particular strength in asset servicing, especially global collateral services, as well as in clearing services, foreign exchange and our financing related activities. ","Expenses were down 1% year-over-year and 1% sequentially as our business improvement process and the stronger US dollar are driving lower expenses in almost every category. Our ability to grow revenue and control expenses resulted in more than 460 basis points of positive operating leverage year-over-year. ","As you can see on page six of the earnings release, the pound was down 9%, and that\u2019s on a year-over-year basis versus the dollar and the euro was down 19%. We\u2019ve estimated that the stronger US dollar reduced both our revenue and expenses by approximately 300 basis points and had a slightly negative impact on net income. Now the business that was most impacted was Investment Management, while currency had less of an impact on Investment Services. We expect the strength of the US dollar to continue to impact Investment Management more than Investment Services, since about 43% of Investment Management revenue comes from outside the US and it\u2019s non-dollar, while the impact to the overall company is expected to be nominal. ","Income before income taxes was up 14% year-over-year and 12% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, our pretax margin increased approximately 300 basis points to 33%, and that\u2019s from 30% in the second quarter of last year. Return on tangible common equity was over 22%. ","Now page eight shows consolidated fee and other revenue. Asset servicing fees were up 4% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects organic growth, especially in Global Collateral Services and net new business, partially offset by a stronger US dollar. The sequential increase primarily reflects organic growth and seasonally higher securities lending revenue. ","Clearing services fees were up 6% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The increase from the second quarter of 2014 was driven by higher mutual fund and asset based fees, clearance revenue and custody fees. ","Issuer service fees were up 1% year-over-year and also 1% sequentially. Both increases reflect higher depository receipt results, partially offset by lower Corporate Trust fees. As we\u2019ve noted previously, the Corporate Trust revenue decline has stabilized and we actually are encouraged by the current pipeline. ","Treasury services fees were up 2% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. The year-over-year increase reflects higher payment volumes, while the sequential increase reflects the fact that there were three additional business days in the quarter. ","Second quarter Investment Management performance fees were down 1% year-over-year, but on a constant currency basis they were up 5%. And that was reflecting higher equity market values, the impact of the first quarter Cutwater acquisition, which was partially offset by lower performance fees. We had performance fees of $20 million compared to our very strong $29 million last year. ","FX and other trading revenue on a consolidated basis was up 44% year-over-year and down 18% sequentially. FX revenue of $181 million was up 40% year-over-year, 17% sequentially. The year-over-year increase reflects the higher volatility, higher volumes and higher DR related activity. The sequential decrease primarily reflects the benefits of unusually high market volatility in the first quarter of this year.","Financing related fees were $58 million compared to$ 44 million in the year ago quarter, and $40 million in Q1. Both increases reflect higher fees related to secured intra-day credit provided to dealers in connection with their tri-party repo activity. Now, these fees probably won\u2019t grow beyond Q3 as we expect clients to moderate their usage or possibly find alternative sources for this financing. ","Investment and other income of $104 million was $38 million lower year-over-year and $44 million higher sequentially. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects lower other revenue, equity investment revenue and asset related gains and that was partially offset by higher leasing gains. The sequential increase reflects the higher lease residual gains offset by lower seed capital. ","Looking ahead to future quarters, given the sale of Wing Hang and some other actions that we\u2019ve taken, we expect investment in Other Income on average to be in the range of $60 million to $80 million. However, we would expect there to be some volatility in this particular line item. ","Page nine shows the drivers around Investment Management business that will help explain our underlying performance. You can see the 5% year-over-year AUM increase and the $15 billion of long-term outflows in the quarter. As Gerald noted well, we in the industry have been experiencing outflows in active equities over the last few quarters. We have seen a few very large non-US institutional clients both rebalancing and liquidating parts of their portfolio which has magnified the impact this quarter. Partially offsetting the activity, the active equity outflows were flows into higher fee alternative assets and LDI, a trend we\u2019ve seen for the last few quarters and has been a continued focus for our business -- will be for our business going forward. At this time, the higher proportion of active equity outflows versus the alternative in LDI inflows has resulted in a lower fee mix.","Our Wealth Management business continues to grow, benefitting from our expansion initiative. We\u2019ve now completed the investment phase of this initiative and are beginning to see revenue growth as well as an associated increase in loans and deposits. ","Turning to our Investment Services metrics on page 10, you can see that assets under custody and administration at quarter end were $28.6 trillion. That\u2019s up $100 billion year-over-year and that\u2019s reflecting higher market values, organic growth and it was partially offset by the stronger US dollar. On a linked quarter, AUC\/A was in line with last quarter. Adjusted for currency, year-over-year growth would have been roughly 3%. ","We had estimated total new assets under custody and administration business wins in the second quarter of $1 trillion. Now that does not include a recently announced expansion of services to an existing client that has about $140 billion in assets, a deal which closed after the quarter end. We were pleased to see that our investments in our services to clients have been paying off and is being recognized in the marketplace. ","The market value of securities on loans at period end was up slightly year-over-year. Average loans and deposits were both up significantly. Our key broker-dealer metric of average tri-party repo balances grew 8%. All of our clearing metrics recorded nice gains, DARTS volumes in particular and the net decline in sponsored DR program reflects our focus on exiting low activity programs. ","If you turn to net interest revenue on page 11, you\u2019ll see that NIR on a fully taxable equivalent basis was up 8%, versus the year ago quarter and 7% from Q1. We benefited year-over-year from a shift out of cash and into loans and securities and increase in deposits, nice to see a lower interest expense incurred on those deposits and also the positive impact of interest hedging activities. The yield on interest earning assets decreased to two basis points year-over-year while the yield on interest bearing deposits decreased four basis points. The decline in the deposit yield was driven by our efforts to charge clients on Euro denominated deposits primarily. ","The net interest margin for the quarter was 100 basis points, two basis points higher than the year ago quarter and three basis points higher than the prior quarter, driven by the reduction in rates paid on interest earning deposits.","On page 12, you\u2019ll see that non-interest expense on an adjusted basis decreased by 1% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower expenses in all categories except business development. The lower expense primarily reflects a favorable impact of the strong dollar and the benefit of our business improvement process. ","Total staff expenses essentially flat year-over-year, reflecting the impact of the dollar, lower headcount and the impact of curtailing our US defined benefit plan, partially offset by higher performance driven incentives. The year-over-year decline in headcount reflects the progress of our business improvement process. The sequential increase of 200 employees reflects insourcing and revenue initiatives as well as new hires to support new business and asset servicing and Corporate Trust and strategic platform investments in asset manager, alternative asset manager and Global Wealth Programs. ","Our occupancy costs have not risen as we expected. The additional costs such as paying double rent for our move out of One Wall Street have been offset by a number of factors, including the strength of the dollar, lower utility costs, we sublet more vacant space and the reduction of maintenance cost. We\u2019re on target to vacate One Wall Street before the end of the third quarter and expect an improvement in the occupancy line beginning in the first quarter of 2016.","Now turning to capital on page 13. With respect to our capital ratios, as we highlighted in our last earnings call, we adopted the new consolidations accounting standard during the second quarter which require retrospective adoption to January 1, thus requiring us to revise our Q1 reported numbers. The adoption resulted in a benefit to Q1 of about 75 basis points increasing it to 9.9%. The Q2 2015 ratio is flat at 9.9. ","A few notes about the quarter. As you\u2019ll see in our release, our effective tax rate was 23.7%, 1.4% lower than the income statement presentation of Investment Management funds. On an adjusted basis, our tax rate was 25%.","Also in the earnings release on page 11 are some investment securities portfolio highlights. You will see that -- I'm sorry, I'm losing my voice here. You will see net unrealized pre-tax gain on portfolio of $752 million, ending up with a hit to our capital of about $300 million. ","Now, I'd like to factor in a few points about the second half of the year. Third quarter earnings are generally impacted by seasonal -- I'm going to turn it over to Izzy.","Izzy Dawood ","Following on our third quarter earnings. As you are aware, third quarter earnings are generally impacted by a seasonal slowdown in transaction volumes and market related revenues, particularly foreign exchange, Global Collateral Services and securities lending, offset by seasonally higher activities in DR.","We see expenses coming in flat to slightly down to 2014 for the full year, which will entail an increase in the run rate in the remaining quarters, reflecting the investment in our strategic platforms, increased regulatory compliant costs and the annual merit increase with respect to July 1. ","Net interest revenue is expected to be slightly down to Q2, assuming no change in monetary policy. The full year effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 26%. We anticipate proceeding with our capital plan, enabling us to return up to $3.1 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends subject to market conditions and other factors. ","In summary, we are executing against our strategic priorities. We\u2019re continuing to improve our bottom line and generate significant positive operating leverage and we remain confident in our ability to hit our three year investor day target. ","With that, on behalf of Todd, let me hand it back to Gerald.","Gerald Hassell","Great. Thanks Izzy for finishing up. Todd is alive and well, trust me. With that -- well he\u2019s certainly alive. With that, why don\u2019t we open it up to questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is coming from the line of Luke Montgomery from Bernstein Research. Your line is open sir. Please go ahead.","Luke Montgomery","Good morning, guys. So broadly I'm just wondering how you're feeling about the sustainability of the progress you\u2019ve made on expenses in operating margin. I think clearly some of that is driven by FX translation, but you've now exceeded the high end of the range of your 30% to 32% longer-term operating margin target and that was in a normalized environment. I'd say the same for your 20% to 22% target and we have yet to see rates increase. At this point would you feel comfortable revising these targets a bit higher? Have you considered that at all?","Gerald Hassell","Let me start with that. We do feel good about the progress we are making on our business improvement process and pulling it through into the income statement to the bottom line. We are onboarding some new clients and there\u2019s some upfront cost associated with that. We do have increased regulatory costs that we are facing in the second half of this year. I think we are going to stick with our guidance of having expenses essentially flat versus last year. And we are going to work to continue to improve upon that, but we do have some opportunities to bring on some clients that have some upfront costs associated with it. We feel good about hitting the targets that we laid out for investor day. We are within the ranges and we are going to keep driving forward on meeting those targets.","Luke Montgomery - Bernstein Research"," Okay, thanks. ","Todd Gibbons ","Hey Luke, I would add one thing. We\u2019ve had the benefit of a good revenue mix here. So some higher margin businesses improved faster than we had anticipated at investor day.","Luke Montgomery","Okay. And then maybe if you could give us a rough indication of the additional expenses for the T. Rowe outsourcing mandate you won and then when do you expect that business to convert and be reflected in revenue? Also maybe talk about whether that deal reflects any change in the trends in the marketplace for fund accounting or was it more of a one-off opportunistic deal?","Gerald Hassell","A couple of questions in there. We will start to -- we\u2019ve already started to incur some of the expenses associated with T. Rowe as we speak. We are talking on board some of their staff, which we are delighted to do. You\u2019re seeing some of the upfront costs associated with the onboarding of that business now and you\u2019ll see it through the course of this year. And then you\u2019ll start to see the revenues kick in towards the end of this year, first part of next year as we convert over the assets. We do actually see it as a long term trend where investment managers in general are really trying to focus on their investment management process and less focused on providing -- doing the mid-office and back office services internally. We do see it as a long term trend. We want to be very thoughtful about which clients we take on and make sure we\u2019re leveraging our platforms and driving profitable revenue growth for ourselves rather than just taking on any one at any time. T. Rowe is a fantastic client. It\u2019s a great partnership. We worked on this together for well over a year and we think we have a good rapport with them and a very similar culture. We feel good about this one.","Luke Montgomery - Bernstein Research","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercare ISI. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Glenn Schorr","Hi. Thank you. I'm just curious if you can give some sort of summary comment on what happened to asset sensitivity during the quarter. It's great to see all the growth on balance sheets, both deposits and loans. I think you were in the process over the last two quarters of extending duration a little bit, but if you could just tie that all together, that would be super.","Todd Gibbons ","Sure, Glenn. I\u2019ll try to take it. It\u2019s Todd. The sensitivity, NIR sensitivity is going to be about flat from where we were in the first quarter. We had put a fair amount of securities on late in the first quarter and we got the benefit of the NIR mostly in the second quarter and actually securities at the end of the period were down slightly. I think you\u2019ll see the asset sensitivity to be basically unchanged where we were in the first quarter. There\u2019s a lot of things that went on with NIR. Actually the duration of our available for sale accounts declined slightly and we\u2019ve used the held to maturity account. That\u2019s where most of the duration of the assets now is. About half the risk is in each so that we can protect the capital account. ","But we saw a lot of things go on in the quarter. We saw higher balances. We did see the loan growth that you talked about. We saw a sharp drop in the interest that we paid on deposits. We also had the benefit that accretion on the non-agency securities did not decline as the performance of those securities increased, so we would have expected that. We had some hedging gains. So we don\u2019t anticipate that NIR is bumped up to this level. We don\u2019t expect to grow. In fact we expect it to contract a little bit unless interest rates change.","Glenn Schorr","Okay, that's great. Thanks. And then curious on even after the restatement of the capital ratios, let's call it a function of 10%, your buffer is now officially 100 basis points. Even with a very wide 200 basis point AOCI buffer on buffer, that brings you to right about where you're at now. Do you still feel the 11% to 12% is the right range or could we see that work down over time?","Todd Gibbons ","Yeah. The binding constraint for us, Glenn is not the risk weighted assets. It is the SLR. So as we build the SLR; we would expect the CET1 to grow. We will stick with the previous guidance.","Glenn Schorr of Evercore","Got it. Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead, sir.","Alex Blostein","I'll try to keep this quick, Todd, to save your voice. A couple of follow-ups on NII. A, could you just define the hedging gains to get us a cleaner run rate for NII for the quarter to think for the third quarter? And then just kind of bigger picture question, when you continue to see growth in your deposits, maybe a couple of comments on where do you guys think it's coming from and again do you still think that there's not a ton of room to reinvest them into securities alone. So this has a positive mix shift in the balance sheet that we've seen from you guys over the last couple of quarters is probably a full in run rate. Is that a fair way to summarize the NII picture?","Todd Gibbons ","Yeah. I think the answer to your last question is yes. I think that\u2019s a fair way to summarize it. In terms of the hedging gains, accretion had been contracting at about $3 million to $5 million a quarter, so it didn\u2019t. So the combination of accretion and hedging gains is probably in the $10 million ballpark and we expect the balance sheet to be about flat.","Alex Blostein","Got you. And then just my follow-up on expenses, just to step back again, when you guys talked about expenses being flat on a year-over-year basis, given the amount of new business you picked up this quarter and the timing of the onboarding, is it still fair to think that 2015 expenses are going to be in that $11 billion run rate?","Todd Gibbons ","Alex, the guidance we\u2019ve given, I would say it\u2019s going to be flat to slightly down from our operating expenses in 2014. That does mean the run rate will pick up in the second half for all the items that we discussed, whether it\u2019s the merit increase, the onboarding. We are taking on a couple of hundred people soon, to the regulatory costs that we\u2019ve been talking about. All and all, we would still for the full year expect to be flat. Previously guidance was made flat to slightly up. We are a little more optimistic it might be flat to slightly down.","Alex Blostein","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Ashley Serrao from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Ashley Serrao","Good morning. First question just on Investment Management, I appreciate all the color you gave on the positive attraction of your various growth initiatives. But wanted to get a sense of where you are versus your plan as far as the investment curve goes. And then how should we be thinking about the payoff to the plan laid out at Investor Day?","Curtis Arledge","Ashley, it\u2019s Curtis Arledge. Can I just ask you what you mean by investment curve? I want to make sure I understand the question.","Ashley Serrao","That would be the investment of the margins that you outlined.","Curtis Arledge","Yeah, okay. At investor day we described [indiscernible] our Wealth Management business in our US intermediary distribution platform and some other initiatives. And as Gerald mentioned, those are actually going quite well. Our Wealth Management expansion is now complete. We\u2019ve added about a 50% increase in our sales force and we\u2019ve seen revenues that have actually come in above our original plans. On the US retail side we\u2019ve made a number of investments and changes and our sales there are actually pretty attractive. We\u2019ve seen a boost north of 50% in growth sales in our US retail intermediary platforms, which includes the real exciting part about being connected to Pershing, because Pershing obviously their relationships with financial advisors is important to that effort as well. The private banking piece of our initiative, as Gerald also mentioned, is really starting to work. We feel pretty good about getting the revenues that came with the investments that we were making that we talked about at investor day. ","Ashley Serrao","Okay, appreciate the color there. And then during the quarter JPMorgan exited its third-party broker-dealer clearing business. I just wanted to get your sense on how are you thinking about the business. Should we expect Pershing to pick up share? And then in a similar vein, how are you thinking about your stake in ConvergEx?","Gerald Hassell","Brian, why don\u2019t you take the JPMorgan Pershing Question?","Brian Shea ","Okay, sure. You can see from Pershing\u2019s metrics overall that we have pretty good momentum in revenue. In terms of our new business pipeline, we are certainly benefiting from JPMorgan\u2019s decision to exit and we are attracting quite a number of those clients to our platform, some of which we\u2019ll be converting, quite a few of which we\u2019ll be converting to our platform in the third quarter. If you look at the overall metrics, the fundamental asset gathering statistics, mutual fund positions, total client assets in custody, prime brokerage lending and margin balances, are a custody all the way through. We have solid growth in the Pershing business unit, so we feel good about that business. ","Gerald Hassell","Regarding ConvergEx, we just have a small equity piece in that firm and it\u2019s something we\u2019ve had for a long period of time and we just continue to track it.","Ashley Serrao","Okay, thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter.","Operator","The question is coming from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead, sir.","Ken Usdin","Hi, good morning. Todd, I was wondering on the capital front now that SLR is pushed out of CCAR for another year and given the potential for rates to go up, I was wondering can you talk to us about how much excess deposits you had on hand and then your trade-off of considering your more preferred issuance in the capital structure.","Todd Gibbons","Yeah. We would estimate, Ken that there\u2019s probably about $50 billion to $70 billion of excess deposits, but what ultimately will happen with those deposits is going to depend on the course of monetary policy. So we are poring through our balance sheet to prioritize where we are most efficient with it and actions that we might take against the balance sheet. If those deposits -- if rates were to rise and those deposits were not to lead, we think we would be a heavier issue of preferred and would get a pretty reasonable return on that preferred. We may be in a preferred market as we were this past quarter where we issued $1 billion. We have a fair amount of space to do more. It really will depend on how things play out. It just means that for 2016, the CCAR will not have to consider the SLR, but we still have to prove to ourselves the path to compliance, because we are still 40 basis points below the 5% target. We need a cushion above that.","Ken Usdin","And so where's the fine line between go, no go on that? Is it a rate of Fed funds, so like the earnings capacity on that excess deposit if they stay around? Like where's your break even decision tree on that?","Todd Gibbons","Yeah, it\u2019s a fairly low yield. Fed funds go to six year 70 basis points and you\u2019ve got that kind of a margin it\u2019s a very attractive return on your equity.","Ken Usdin","Okay, got it. And then second follow-up, issuer services. You mentioned just the stability that you've started to see. Can you just give us some underlying trends inside those businesses? And I know we do see the typical seasonality, but the last few years have been anything but typical. So just help us understand what kind of lift we should expect to see in the back half.","Brian Shea","Yeah, this is Brian Shea. The issuer services business includes both corporate trust and DR. As Todd mentioned and we\u2019ve been signaling for some time that we thought we see a moderation in the run off of high value securitizations and corporate trust and that the revenue decline that we\u2019ve experienced over the past few years would moderate and flatten out and that\u2019s exactly what we are seeing happen at this point. On the DR side, that business is obviously a capital markets driven business and it has volatility associated with it, but it\u2019s had good year to date performance and we expect a similar seasonality possibly in the third quarter this year. So far so good.","Ken Usdin"," All right. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead. ","Brian Bedell","Hi, thanks. Good morning, folks. Maybe just to start on the T. Rowe deal. In looking at that I guess more strategically as you think about the longer-term operating margins on either that deal or that business in general, you\u2019re obviously starting to bring it revenues by year-end. When do you expect that that particular investment to be, or that deal to be operating margin positive? And then how do you think about that deal and\/or that business from an operating margin perspective, longer term versus your overall Asset Servicing business?","Brian Shea","This is Brian Shea. The transition of the T. Rowe Price team, about 225 people to BNY Mellon we expect to take place in August, so starting next month. That will be followed by a fund accounting conversion nine to 12 months out and then a middle office platform conversion roughly a year after that. It\u2019s a long term arrangement and it\u2019s the largest middle office client, asset manager client that\u2019s committed to us. But you should know that we are driving a shared economy to scale model and a much more standardized leverageable platform. We have about 40 middle office clients today. This is the single biggest one we have and we think it\u2019s a real validation of our strategy in the platform that we are putting in place to serve more. ","Fundamentally, we feel that there is a way to create shared economies of scale in this model that haven\u2019t historically been created by custodians and we are executing a strategy to bring technology strategy to create that leverage. But there is a fundamental trend where asset managers, just like other financial institutions in a high regulatory change, lower growth environment, are getting back to basics and fundamentally focusing on the investment process as their value proposition and relying more on firms like us to verbalize their middle office costs and actually their front office technology cost. ","We are going to be driving a strategy to drive more end to end solutions for investment managers and alternative investment managers and I think it will be a positive driver of our long-term results and we have a very significant pipeline of middle office clients and we\u2019re being careful and selective about which assignments we take on. ","Gerald Hassell","The other thing I would add, Brian is that we\u2019re not relying on foreign exchange securities lending, other quote high margin business to make this transaction profitable. We have priced it and we\u2019re building the operating platforms such that it is profitable on its own. ","Brian Bedell","Great, that\u2019s really helpful color. I appreciate that. And then maybe just on the \u2013 just to verify the expense outlook again, making sure I have the base right, it is $11 billion for the guidance for 2015 for flat expenses? ","Todd Gibbons ","What we\u2019ve guided is that our operating expenses last year were about $10.7 billion, $10.65 billion. And Brian, what we\u2019ve guided is that we\u2019ll be relatively flat to that number. ","Brian Bedell","Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead. ","Betsy Graseck","Hey, thanks, good morning. A couple of questions, one on the Investment Management metrics page. You\u2019ve got your AUM outflows as well as inflows listed on the page and net currency market and acquisition impact. I noticed liability driven investments have continue to be positive, but maybe a little bit slower paced. Can you just speak to what's going on there? And then your market impact was actually better than what I've seen at other shops and maybe could help us understand how much of that was acquisitions versus market.","Curtis Arledge","Betsy, it\u2019s Curtis. I would say our LDI business still has a very healthy pipeline. Quarter to quarter, there are dynamics around the funded ratio for our clients. So if interest rates rise and equity markets remain stable, then the funding ratio improves and clients are generally compelled to move forward with launching a de-risking of their plan and vice versa. And so there is some dynamics of how markets are moving in a quarter. We do have clients occasionally who add to their existing strategies. Maybe they de-risk some portion of portfolio when they add. It makes some quarters stronger than others and when that doesn\u2019t happen, it\u2019s a bit weaker and then clients -- we\u2019ve also had clients who have unhedged portions of their portfolio in the past as well. So quarter-to-quarter fluctuations are somewhat related to what\u2019s happening in the marketplace. ","But I can tell you that the pipeline is still very healthy where as funding ratios improve, there is continued interest in removing that volatility or that risk from pension plans overall exposure. So generally the business is very healthy. In terms of marketing, I think one of the things that it\u2019s important to appreciate is that various assets we have across different markets and LDI is actually a really good one. It\u2019s a very long duration asset and it links not only to interest rates, but also to inflation rates. So as inflation rates and interest rates fall, the value of the liability and therefore the value of the assets we manage rises. And so that\u2019s contributing to some of what you\u2019re seeing. ","We have a very diversified portfolio of assets that we manage when we look at it versus many peers, our US and non-US mixes is very diversified. If you look at equity markets, you also need to appreciate that we have assets. We are showing AUM on a spot basis and because of what happens in some currency markets, our spot rates move right at the end of the quarter based on currency movements and we saw a little bit of that in the year-over-year dynamics. So I would say it\u2019s both currency and duration of some of the assets we manage. ","Betsy Graseck","Got it. Okay, that's helpful color. Thanks very much. Just Todd, just an overall question for you on the FX impact on revenues and expenses and I'm sorry if I missed it. I noticed throughout the presentation you talked about the impact there, but do you have an FX adjusted revenue and expense overall for total BK or how it impacted the growth rates in revenue and expenses?","Todd Gibbons","Yeah. I had indicated that it\u2019s about 3% negative on revenues and it\u2019s about 3% positive on expenses, meaning lower expenses. Net-net, it was very slightly negative to us so there\u2019s some rounding in those calculations and that\u2019s about what we would expect going forward, Betsey. There could be -- we\u2019re pretty well hedged in Euro and Sterling. There could be \u2013 we are short one or two other currencies. So if the movements change, it could be a little bit different, but we would expect if the dollar were to get stronger or weaker from here, it shouldn\u2019t have a meaningful impact to our pre-tax. It just might change the geography a bit. ","Betsy Graseck","Okay. The currency you're not hedged to, the biggest is the yen, is that right or?","Todd Gibbons","No, it\u2019s going to be Rupee. ","Curtis Arledge","No, with Indian Rupee.","Todd Gibbons","Indian Rupee.","Betsy Graseck","Got it. Okay, got it. Okay, that's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mike Mayo from CLSA. Your line is open. Please go ahead, sir. ","Mike Mayo","Hi, just a clarification of what you've said so far. The results in the first half of the year have exceeded expectations and you're in your target ranges, but it doesn't seem like you're changing your guidance for the full year. So should we think of these results as simply frontloading some of the benefits in the second half of the year or if you can just give us some more color on this?","Gerald Hassell","Generally, Mike we put out three-year investment targets during Investor Day. We\u2019re sticking to those and we\u2019re executing against them. The first half of the year, we\u2019ve done some level of outperformance. We want to continue that and not let the targets restrain us, but we certainly want to keep performing well. ","Todd Gibbons","The targets weren\u2019t meant to be annual targets. They were compounded growth rates over the three-year period, Mike. And so we\u2019ve certainly gotten off to a good start. We\u2019ve gotten much more market benefit than we would have anticipated at that point in time. But that\u2019s not to say that\u2019s going to continue. ","Mike Mayo","Okay. Perhaps as a follow-up to that, Gerald you mentioned your three-year targets and your five priorities and I think you guys had a board meeting in June where you talk about strategy and topics like that. Can you highlight what was talked about at that Board meeting or any perhaps nuanced changes that you have in the strategy or other areas for additional emphasis that came out from that meeting?","Gerald Hassell","Mike, we have a Board meeting every other month, so that\u2019s just part of the standard fare. We share with our Board obviously not only what we share publicly, but the ups and downs and the positives and negatives throughout all our businesses. So we\u2019re sticking by our strategy. We\u2019re sticking by our business model and we\u2019re sticking by the Investor Day targets we laid out there and I would say we\u2019re executing against them and we\u2019ll continue to drive value for shareholders and clients. ","Mike Mayo","Last follow-up. We've had a few months since Investor Day. Now that you've had this period and you've gone back a little bit more aggressively, which areas would you say you're more confident about or perhaps less confident about?","Todd Gibbons","From a financial perspective, I think there are a couple of positives. As you\u2019ve seen, we\u2019ve seen probably a little stronger revenue growth, especially when you take into consideration currency. I think our business improvement process continues to work well. I think the balance sheet grows and the need to retain additional capital may be higher than we had anticipated. And net-net I think we\u2019re still comfortable with the ranges that we had established. The course to get there will never be the direction that we initially anticipated, but I think we\u2019re still pretty comfortable with the direction we\u2019re going. ","Mike Mayo","All right, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Your line is open sir, please go ahead.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning. So one follow-up on the onboarding expense for the back half of the year. How much of that should we consider ongoing and how much of that would be one-time charges?","Brian Shea","It\u2019s Brian. We signaled at Investor Day that we have over year-over-year growth in expense as we build out these strategic platforms for asset managers, alternative managers and the Global Wealth platform and that is going to be the case as we suggested obviously. And then over time, the revenue comes on as the clients start to leverage the platform. And so ultimately we think these are really strategic -- good strategic investments that are going to create long term client shareholder value, but there\u2019s obviously a drag year-over-year on expense this year and then it moderates next year and in 2018 these investments are significantly positive for the shareholder.","Gerald Hassell","I would add it's in our running rate expenses today, those investments.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. I guess what you're saying is they are ongoing but we see the revenue pickup which enhances the returns. Is that a fair way to paraphrase it?","Gerald Hassell","Yeah. That\u2019s the right way to think about it.","Brennan Hawken","Great, thank you. Then a quick one on the excess deposits. So can you help us maybe understand why you would, if we get higher rates and we don't see the behavior anticipating, why you wouldn't explore pricing changes as opposed to raising preferred in order to just provide motivation for those $50 billion to $70 billion to move off the balance sheet?","Gerald Hassell","First of all, it's not one or the other. As you can see, in this particular quarter, the second quarter we just finished, we actually did manage our deposit rates down. You can see that we are in fact charging for deposit, particularly in Europe or in Europe I should say. And so the cost of our deposits is actually declining. We are proactivity managing the cost of our deposit base. But as Todd said earlier, if the return on those deposits in a rising interest rate environment are such with little or no risk associated with them, then we should think about whether additional capital is warranted and making sure we get good return on that capital. There\u2019s also as you know as our businesses grow, we tend to get more deposits, frictional deposits associated with our businesses. It's going to be interesting to see when rate rises what happens to those excess deposits, not only here but in the industry at large.","Brennan Hawken","Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open, sir. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. As a follow-up on the deposit commentary that you guys have made, what percentage of your European depositors now are paying you interest for you to hold those deposits? The second, how many have decided to leave or take some of the deposits out because they didn't want to pay the fee?","Brian Shea","Most of them where we can pass through the fees are paying them. We did see some behavior when we initially started charging for deposits where there were some out flows and those have come back, so we are about flat through the beginning to where we are now in the actual volume of European deposits.","Gerard Cassidy","Would you say the experience has been a pleasant one for what you had to do to convince folks to pay for you to hold their deposits?","Brian Shea","I look around at my relationship people, I'm not sure they feel exactly that way.","Karen Peetz ","Yeah, I would say -- it\u2019s Karen Peetz. I would say clients understood it, that we weren\u2019t going to pay them to keep the money with us, but it was a series of difficult conversations. Many of our peer followed suit so we weren\u2019t alone.","Gerard Cassidy","Good. And then a technical question. On the buyback, you guys were quite successful this quarter in buying back just over 19 million shares. I see the average share count dropped only about, I think 4 million shares from 1.126 billion to 1.22 billion. Could you give us some color why it didn't fall further?","Todd Gibbons","Average share count is -- so you start this period and at the end of the period, so it's -- it would be the timing of it, Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay, just a timing issue then? ","Todd Gibbons","Yeah.","Gerard Cassidy","Great, okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl from KBW. Your line is open so please go ahead.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Great, good morning. I just had a quick question on the new business wins. Even if you back out the T. Rowe, it still was $254 billion in the quarter. Can you give us some color on the geography or service that's driving that and that compares to $131 billion last quarter?","Brian Shea","Yeah, I would say that\u2019s an asset -- that\u2019s a servicing metric and we are getting -- again we are getting a solid pipeline and some solid new business commitments. I think it\u2019s indicative of the secular trend of asset managers refocusing on the investment process and their core value proposition and leveraging us for more of those core back office, middle office and eventually front office services.","Gerald Hassell","As we\u2019ve said in the past, quarter to quarter we can have a couple of sizeable new pieces of business. And so it could be $150 billion, $200 billion one quarter, $250 billion another quarter but the pipeline is good and this was a good quarter for our new business wins.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Then just a second question on the Wealth Management business. You said that the Wealth Management growth was improving, but if you look at the revenues year-over-year they are only up 3%. Can you give us a little bit more color maybe on an AUM or some other metric that shows the improvement and also when you expect those revenues to inflect in the future?","Brian Shea","Yes, so it's a little -- Wealth Management also uses some of our mutual funds and when we look at our Wealth Management business, it also includes our private banking activities. The lines that\u2019s Wealth Management fees doesn\u2019t describe the entirety of our Wealth Management business. If you look at our loans and deposit growth on the investment management page, you can see that we are additionally having real success growing our balance sheet. The NIR here is up 18% and it's really helping the overall. Wealth Management is growing, not just within our current footprint. We\u2019ve opened new offices and so being able to go into those offices with both investment offerings and a private banking offerings is really where our revenue growth is coming from.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Good. Thanks. ","Operator","Thank you and the last question on queue is coming from Adam Beatty from Bank of America. Your line is open so please go ahead.","Adam Beatty","Good morning. A question on asset servicing, specifically collateral management, which you mentioned a couple of times. I was wondering if you could maybe size out of the contribution to growth or the growth rate of that service line and also let us know how far along you are in terms of penetrating your existing client base? What inning are you at with that opportunity? Thanks.","Gerald Hassell","Curtis, you want to take it?","Curtis Arledge ","Yes, so on the active servicing line, probably quarter over quarter growth, we probably approached 50% of the cloud services benefiting that after servicing lines. As far as where we are in, we are probably in still the early innings and I mean by the early innings is that the buy side really hasn\u2019t yet benefited fully from shifting some of their business to enjoy collateral as a means to help finance some of what they\u2019re trying to take and leverage or fully embrace or fully put in place the collateralization of margins, especially in Europe. We think we are in early innings still when it comes to collateral business and as far as the growth opportunities that exist around it. And so and our product set really fits well with those needs that those buy side clients have as collateral continues to be needed to pledge against obligation.","Adam Beatty","Excellent. It sounds like more to come. Thank you. Then on Investment Management, you mentioned some perhaps more acute funding needs from some international clients driving some of the outflows. How much risk do you see of maybe some additional drawdown across your client base? Thanks.","Brian Shea","We\u2019ve seen through the course of the past several months some clients re-balancing their portfolios. Equity markets over the past couple years obviously did quite well, especially in the US. I think understanding the US, non-US equity performance important to this when you think about what people are doing with re-balancing. We\u2019ve seen huge growth in our AUM and LDI as clients have reduced their exposure to equities. And I\u2019m drawing an inference that sometimes we actually see clients sell equities and move into fixed income or de-risk their pension plans. I think it\u2019s been overall a drawdown in assets is not what we are seeing at the moment. We are seeing a re-balancing from equity to fixed income. ","Again, there\u2019s a lot being talked about of the re-positioning of investor portfolios towards more risk and what I would say, we see really instead is really focusing on getting returns while being thoughtful about risk and that\u2019s why our alternatives growth \u2013 we\u2019ve had eight straight quarters of growth in alternatives and those have been strategies where clients are either getting uncorrelated exposures or they are getting absolute returns on asset allocations strategies that give them better diversified portfolios exposure. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an overall drawdown. It\u2019s more of a mix shift.","Adam Beatty","Okay. So it sounds like you're not seeing anything material in terms of funding needs that may be sovereigns or what have you driving those outflows?","Todd Gibbons","We\u2019ve seen \u2013 I think to Gerald\u2019s opening comments, we\u2019ve absolutely seen -- the thing about our client base is very significantly global institutions who from time to time do manage their liquidity needs across their portfolio. And again quarter to quarter we do see that happen.","Adam Beatty","Got it. Thank you very much. I appreciate you taking the questions. ","Gerald Hassell","Okay. Thank you very much, everyone for dialing in. If you have additional questions, which I\u2019m sure you will, please give Valerie Haertel a call. We\u2019d be happy to engage with you and thank you very much for your attention today.","Operator","If there are any additional questions or comments, you may contact Ms. Valerie Haertel at 212-635-8529.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted materials. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Andy Clark. Mr. Clark, you may begin.","Andy Clark","Thanks, Wendy, and welcome, everyone. With us today are Gerald Hassell, our Chairman and CEO; Todd Gibbons, our CFO, as well as several members of our executive management team. Before we begin, let me remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement on Page 15 of the press release and those identified in our documents filed with the SEC that are available on our website, bnymellon.com. Forward-looking statements in this call speak only as of today, July 17, 2013, and we will not update forward-looking statements. Our press release and earnings review are available on our website, and we will be using the earnings review to discuss our results.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Gerald. Gerald?","Gerald L. Hassell","Thanks, Andy, and good morning, everybody, and welcome. As you saw from the release, for the second quarter, we reported earnings of $0.71 per share. This included an after-tax gain of $0.09 per share related to an equity investment.","Now looking at how our business model performed, we believe we earned about $0.58, $0.59 per share on a core basis. And Todd will take you through the numbers in just a moment on how we get there. Clearly, the headline for the quarter was strong revenue growth across all of our businesses without exception. Total revenues reached a record $4 billion for the quarter. After excluding the impact of the investment gain, revenues were up 6%. It's a clear sign of how our business model benefited from better market conditions during the quarter. But more importantly, it's a sign of our success in collaborating across our businesses to deliver solutions our clients need.","Turning to Investment Management. It continued to have strong revenue growth again in the quarter. This quarter, Investment Management benefited from the 15th consecutive quarter of long-term inflows and improved equity value. We had net long-term flows of $21 billion with particular strength in the liability-driven investment area, certain equity and fixed income funds. Our success in attracting new assets helped drive a 10% increase in assets under management year-over-year to a record $1.43 trillion.","In Investment Services, fees also showed nice improvement across the board driven by growth in asset servicing, issuer services and clearing services fees. We also had a strong quarter for foreign exchange revenues, which benefited from improved market conditions as volatility and volumes increased.","In terms of our FX business, we're seeing some growth in our traditional products as well as our new product offerings. We're also beginning to see the early benefits of our FX technology enhancements, and we expect those enhancements to drive further growth.","Now that's a theme running throughout all of our businesses. We're making targeted investments to enhance our product capabilities, and it's starting to pay off. A good example is in global collateral services. Our investment in creating an end-to-end solution for our clients' growing collateral needs is starting to show up in our revenue numbers. Optimization and segregation balances have grown nicely. We were also awarded a U.S. patent for a key process enabling the secure management of collateral. It's a demonstration of our innovation and market-leading practices in this area, and it positions us well as new collateral regulations continue to kick in.","Within Investment Management, we made progress on a number of fronts. In the Asia Pacific region, we've been granted a license to establish a separately managed account business out of Hong Kong, and that's leveraging the partnership between Investment Management and Pershing. And we're already in the process of closing our first SMA client win. We're also investing in expanding a greater share of the U.S. retail market, where we just launched our first close-end fund in a number of years which has already attracted nearly 300 million of assets under management.","Now last quarter, I mentioned how we began expanding our wealth management franchise. During the second quarter, we officially kicked off the next phase of our multiyear growth strategy. We're proceeding with plans to increase our sales force by 50%, add private bankers, portfolio managers and wealth strategists, as well as additional sales support staff. The new hires will strengthen the sales teams in our current locations and establish offices in key wealth management markets. It's early days, but again, it's strong commitment to driving organic growth.","Meanwhile, wealth management is also focused on better leveraging the rest of our firm. For example, we recently started making private banking loans available to Pershing customers, and we're already seeing a nice level of receptivity. Now we're also investing in our brand to help raise awareness that we have a more complete investment solution. The message of our branding campaign is beginning to resonate as clients and prospects are recognizing that we are the only financial services firm that can provide solutions across the entire life cycle of a financial asset, and it's our sole focus as a firm.","We're working across the firm, whether it's wealth management partnering with Pershing or asset management partnering with Pershing or asset servicing, with everyone's focus on anticipating and satisfying clients' needs in thoughtful, creative ways that competitors can't match. That's the power of our brand and the power of our firm. The bottom line is, we're making significant highly targeted investments in our businesses, which come with some expenses, but they're critical to driving future revenue and profitability. It's an investment in growth.","Now a good way to sum up our quarter is this: We're pleased to see nice revenue growth across all of our businesses; We remain highly focused on driving organic growth, controlling expenses, returning capital to shareholders and growing shareholder value.","With that, let me turn it over to Todd to take you through the numbers and, importantly, talk a little bit about how we're thinking about the leverage ratio under the new guidelines. So Todd?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Thanks, Gerald, and good morning, everyone. My comments will follow the quarterly earnings review, and we'll start on Page 2. As Gerald noted, EPS was $0.71, that includes roughly $0.09 related to a gain on our equity investment on ConvergEx. It also includes the benefit of approximately $0.03 related to the accrual that we took in the first quarter related to administrative errors, and there was also a loan loss provision credit in the quarter. So that nets to core earnings of about $0.58 to $0.59.","Looking at the numbers on a year-over-year basis, total revenue was a record $4 billion, that's up 11% or 6% on a non-GAAP basis. Our investment services businesses, asset servicing, issuer, clearing and Treasury services, each showed nice growth. Investment management and performance fees continued their upward momentum. FX and other trading was up sharply. NIR benefited a bit due to higher rates. Expenses were down 7% and up 6% if you exclude amortization of intangibles, M&I, litigation and restructuring charges. So that 6% increase was primarily reflecting higher staff cost, which is related to improved performance and some meaningful branding initiatives. Our return on tangible common equity was a healthy 25%.","Turning to Page 4, where we call out some business metrics that will help you understand the underlying performance. You can see that AUM of $1.43 trillion was up 10% year-over-year. That resulted from net new business and higher market values. During the quarter, we had net long-term inflows of $21 billion, that was driven by strength in the liability-driven investments. We did see some strength in equity as well and some fixed income funds. Short-term outflows were about $1 billion. Sequentially, AUM was flat as net new business was offset by lower fixed income market values during the quarter. Assets under custody and administration were up 4% year-over-year to $26.2 trillion, and that primarily reflected the impact of higher markets and net new business. Linked quarter, AUC\/A was down $100 billion as the impact of higher equity values was more than offset by lower fixed income values and also the impact of a stronger dollar.","Many of our key metrics showed good growth on a year-over-year basis. Most clearing metrics were up. DARTS volume and average long-term mutual fund assets were, again, up quite significantly. Average loans and deposits in wealth management and investment services continue to grow. And average tri-party repo balances were up. The market value of securities on loan was down as a decline in short interest continue to negatively impact demand. And the number of sponsored DR programs declined as we've exited less profitable programs, but we did see a nice increase in global IPO activity.","Looking at fees on Page 6. Asset servicing fees were up 4% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects organic growth and higher market values, partially offset by lower securities lending revenue. The sequential increase primarily resulted from seasonably -- seasonally higher securities lending revenue, increased core asset servicing fees, all of which reflected organic growth. We had an estimated $201 billion in new AUC\/A wins for an estimated total of $1.1 trillion in AUC\/A wins over the last 12 months. Issuer services fees were up 7% year-over-year and 24% sequentially. Both increases primarily resulted from higher corporate actions and there were also expense reimbursements related to technology expenditures.","Clearing fees were up 4% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Both increases were driven by higher mutual fund fees and clearance revenue. The latter reflecting the strong increase in DARTS, partially offset by higher money market fee waivers. Investment management and performance fees were up 6% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. The year-over-year and sequential increase was primarily driven by higher equity market values and net new business and was partially offset by the stronger U.S. dollar and, once again, higher money market fee waivers.","And FX and other trading revenue was up 15% year-over-year and 29% sequentially. If you look of the underlying components, FX revenue was $179 million, that's up 14% year-over-year, 20% sequentially, as we benefited from higher volatility and increased volumes. The improvement was largely driven by the market, but there are early signs that growth initiatives are yielding some benefits. Other trading revenue was $28 million compared with $23 million in the third quarter a year ago and $12 million in the prior quarter.","Investment and other income totaled $269 million in the quarter compared with $48 million in the year-ago quarter and $72 million in the prior quarter. Both increases reflected a gain related to ConvergEx' recent divestiture of its technology business.","Turning to Page 8 of the earnings review, you'll see that NIR was up $23 million versus the year-ago quarter and $38 million sequentially. Both increases were primarily driven by a change in the mix of earning assets, lower funding costs, higher rates and higher average interest-earning assets. And the higher interest-earning assets are driven by the higher deposit levels.","The net interest margin was 1.15% compared with 1.25% in the year-ago quarter and 1.11% in the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher average interest earning assets, lower yields, partially offset by a change in the mix.","Turning to Page 9, total noninterest expenses, that's x amortization of intangible assets, M&I, litigation and restructuring charges, they were up 6% year-over-year and flat sequentially. The increase in staff expense year-over-year and sequentially was primarily driven by improved performance with the year-over-year increase also impacted by higher pension costs. The growth in software and equipment expenses versus both periods was primarily related to reimbursable customer technology expenditures. Now the reimbursement for these expenses is actually included in our fee revenue.","The growth in business development costs versus both periods was primarily driven by higher corporate branding investments and a number of client conferences. Lower other expense primarily resulted from a decrease in the reserve that we took last quarter that I mentioned earlier. In terms of any future liability related to this issue, the timing still remains uncertain. However, we have lowered the reasonably possible loss estimate. Currently, we're estimating a reasonably possible loss of up to $100 million, and that compares to our previous estimate of $175 million, and that is after the reduction in the reserve.","Turning to Page 10, you can see that our operational excellence initiatives remain on course to exceed the original target established in 2011. Our efforts during the quarter resulted in $150 million in quarterly growth run rate savings as the $13 million in incremental growth savings came with about $11 million of program costs. In terms of the savings this year, we continue our migration to global delivery centers and we realized the benefits from reengineering activities related to our boutique restructurings and real estate footprint consolidation efforts. We also generated some savings as our investment services group continue to optimize their organizational structure.","As you can see on Page 11, we generated $892 million in gross Basel Tier 1 common during the quarter. As you're thinking about our Basel III Tier 1 common ratios, our estimate of June 30 is based on preliminary interpretation of and expectations regarding the fed rules that were released earlier this month. At June 30, 2013, our estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio, and this is under the standardized approach, was 9.3% compared to 9.4% at the end of March, and that also reflects the impact of the rate rise in the portfolio.","As regards to the supplementary leverage ratio, we feel it's early to provide a firm estimate of the ratio because the final definition, mostly related to the denominator, is very uncertain at this point. But before I provide our estimate, let me give you some color on the rules. The agency has released a final rule that included a leverage ratio and then issued a draft or comment that increased the requirements for large banks and raised some important questions on how it should ultimately be calculated. Around the same time, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision released a consultative paper comment with a very different approach primarily to the denominator. So at this time, it's impossible to know exactly where we're going to ultimately be. That being said, however, as for the July 2 rule, we estimate our supplementary leverage ratio would be in the low-4s. We also believe that there are good arguments that central bank cash and certain government guaranteed debt should not be included, and that would have a major impact on us.","Just to give you a little background there, we have more than $200 billion of cash and government guaranteed debt on the balance sheet of $360 billion. So as we get more certainty, we will update you where we think we stand. However, we think it will be helpful for you to know that there are a lot of levers we can pull if necessary. So I'm going to walk you through a few of them now. There are a number of actions on the liability side where we could reduce certain deposits and payables, and we'd expect to be able to do that with only a modest impact to our clients and our earnings. We could also work to de-consolidate certain asset management funds. As monetary policy normalizes, now remember this is a 5-year implementation period, we expect our balance sheet, which is already bloated due to this rate environment, to normalize. So there's no need for us now to urgently pull the liability levers. Some of it should happen naturally over the time period anyway. We also have significant room to reduce unfunded commitments, again, with limited impact to clients and earnings. We could also issue other forms of Tier 1 if needed, such as preferred stock, which is significantly less expensive than common. Given our credit ratings, we were able to issue noncumulative perpetual preferreds this quarter at 4.5%, and that is a record-low coupon. And we did that to replace some of the trust preferreds that we redeemed in the quarter. We also generated a lot of capital. Let me illustrate it. Currently, our first call consensus for 2013, net income was approximately $2.6 billion. In addition to net income, we have over $200 million in after-tax intangible amortization that runs through the P&L on an annual basis, but it comes back into the capital account. So assuming our current dividend payout and CCAR buyback plan, this scenario would result in capital retention of approximately $800 million. So that includes the $1.35 billion of approved buybacks. Finally, our business can grow without significantly growing risk-weighted assets, that doesn't impact the leverage ratio but it does the Basel III Tier 1 common.","So let me sum this up. There may or may not be some impact based on the final rule. And if there is, we have many levers to pull and a lot of time available to us before we consider interrupting our planned capital actions.","Now Page 12 details the composition of our investment securities portfolio. You can see that at quarter end, we had a net unrealized gain in this portfolio of $656 million. The decrease from $2.2 billion at the end of the quarter was primarily driven by an increase in market rates. In order to mitigate some of the impact to capital due to changes in rates, we've increased the percentage of assets and to help the maturity portfolio over the past year.","Looking at our loan book on Page 13, you can see that the provision for credit losses was a credit of $19 million, which is identical to the year-ago quarter. The credit was driven by the continued improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio. The effective tax rate during the quarter was 27%. That primarily reflects the impact of the ConvergEx gain as well as the termination of investments in certain tax credits.","A few points to factor in as you're thinking about the current quarter. Now traditionally, third quarter earnings have been impacted by a slowdown in transaction volumes and capital markets-related revenues, particularly foreign exchange and securities lending, which is also have been offset by the seasonal increase that we've traditionally see in DRs. NII should be equal or slightly better than the second quarter as we benefit from higher interest rates, and we would expect lower securities gains in this environment. The quarterly provision should be around 0. Our merit increase was effective as of July 1. We expect the tax rate to come in the range of about 26%. In terms of any future liability related of the administrative area, we really don't know where the timing is going to be on that and ultimately where that will land. And finally, we plan to continue to repurchase shares during the quarter based on market conditions. So all in all, we had a strong quarter across all of our businesses.","With that, let me hand it back to Gerald.","Gerald L. Hassell","Great. Thanks, Todd. And Wendy, I think we can now open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question today is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of questions. One, on, Todd, what you were going through with regard to actions that you could take to manage the denominator. I was intrigued by your comments on your view that you could lower the deposits without impacting business, lower your commitments without impacting your business. Could you give a little more color on how you're thinking about doing that?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Sure. Well, some of it's going to happen naturally if we go back to the normal rate environment, and we'd expect that to take place, Betsy, over the next 5 years. But if we had to take more direct actions, we have, for example, encouraged some deposits to come on rather than be out in money market funds, so we could redirect some of that activity, for example, to reduce the deposit base.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And do you think that you can raise awareness with your customers as to the potential impact if this rule was kind of required by the market to get there sooner rather than end of 2018 as it's currently described? In other words, are you going to have any help on the comment letter process from the client base?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Well, I really haven't -- I don't know, Gerald, whether you -- whether we're going to reach out to clients.","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes, I think the client impact, Betsy, which I think relates to your unfunded commitment issue, is I think many of the institutions are going to look at unfunded commitments in terms of their capital treatment or their leverage treatment. And so perversely, it may cause the industry to lower some of those commitments or let them fall off because they don't pay a whole lot, and they have high capital traction particularly in the leverage ratio. So some clients may want to weigh into the -- as already said, they may see some negative impact on availability of credit as a result. We have not anticipated that in our discussions with the supervisors. Our -- the most -- the main points that we're going to talk to the supervisors and -- through the comment period is the treatment of cash at central banks. It's kind of perverse to think that we have to hold capital against cash that we hold at central banks. So the bulk of our discussion or comments are going to be in that category, which is a meaningful impact to us as it relates to the leverage ratio.","Operator","The next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just want to dissect the NII picture a little bit. I guess looking out for the next couple of quarters, a, wanted to see if you guys got any benefits from lower premium amortization this quarter, and if you didn't, how we should think about on a go forward basis, and maybe some sensitivity around that.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, Alex, we did get a modest benefit in this quarter, and we'll expect it to pick up a little bit going forward as the number of the securities extended and therefore, we amortized the purchase premium over a longer time period. It was a little bit of the reason for the benefit, for the increase in the second quarter, and we'd expect that to continue unless or until rates were to come down.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, but no way to size it. Because I think you guys, last quarter was a fairly sizable number, I think, 1 40. Any sense on where that stood, I guess, this quarter?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, I know what the number is, Alex. But it's a little bit misleading for me just to give you the number. The actual number is larger but it's because of the mix of assets. So the way to think about it, as the existing assets, if they got extended, the amortization of that premium is going to be extended, net-net benefit was about $5 million or so for the quarter. And we would think it would be more than that in the future quarters.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. And then second question on issuer services, I guess, a, I wanted to clarify the expense reimbursement comment. I'm not sure if we're able to size that, and how we should think about that, one-time in nature or maybe a more recurring event? And then just maybe the broader backdrop of higher interest rates on the issuer services business because it does look like the debt issuance activity around the world is likely to slow.","Gerald L. Hassell","Why don't I take the first part of that question, I can turn it over to Tim for the second part. As -- and now I forget what the first part of the question was?","Unknown Executive","It was about the reimbursement [ph].","Gerald L. Hassell","Oh, the reimbursement, I'm sorry. The reimbursement was about half of the increase in the issuer -- in the corporate trust component of the issuer services lines, Alex. And that's kind of an episodic, I think, for us. From time to time, we see it. So we agreed to take on whatever expenses are to meet the clients' needs, and then that gets paid through to us on the revenue side. So you see it, typically, matches up. It doesn't always match up in the same quarter. But typically it matches up in the same quarter. We called it out this quarter because it was uniquely large and we wouldn't expect it to be that large every single quarter. As regard to the impact of higher rates and issuance, Tim or maybe even Curtis could add to that.","Timothy F. Keaney","Yes, maybe I'll look at the new business pipeline. We've been encouraged, I think, particularly in the U.S., CLOs remain pretty strong. We've seen very good growth particularly this quarter outside the U.S., and the pipeline is surprisingly strong in corporate trust. Although as we've said before, I'd certainly characterize new business that's coming in being priced a little bit lower and thinner than what we see rolling off. And I know you didn't ask but I'd also say the pipeline in the DR business has picked up nicely. So I'm encouraged by the outlook on the issuer services side. Curtis, I don't know if you have a point of view on interest rates.","Curtis Y. Arledge","Yes, our pipeline going into the third quarter is as attractive as it's been in a very long time. I would tell you that we actually had a pretty decent pipeline in the second quarter that we're working through. And I think in mid-June when the said tapering dynamics played a role and people were thinking about where the rule might be going next, we did see people hesitate a little bit. But it does seem like the pipeline discussions we're having with clients are pretty promising. I will tell you that I think the other dynamic that's happening is that, as you know, we have a very large LDI business. And with higher rates, we actually have seen many people who were thinking about LDI being more interested in actually coming into it. So I know everybody wants a pretty great rotation, but I would actually tell you that there are absolutely flows both ways from clients as rates have risen.","Operator","The next question is from Josh Levin with Citi.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Todd, you lifted some leverage you could pull to help mitigate the impact of the supplementary leverage ratio. Could you sort of quantify what those levers in aggregate could be worth?","Thomas P. Gibbons","It could be pretty meaningful, Alex -- I mean Josh. So I think we could get there depending on which ones we pull. I think what we're trying to indicate, if the rule is as it's currently stated, we can get comfortably in place over a reasonable time period of a couple of years well ahead of when the final ruling, without doing anything too dramatic.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And on asset sensitivity, could you walk us through how we should be thinking about your sensitivity in different parts of the yield curve and the shape of the yield curve? What really matters most for you?","Thomas P. Gibbons","In terms of NIR, the biggest benefit we get is on the short end of the curve. So we get a little bit from the extension of the -- on the longer end of the curve from the extension of the unamortized premium. But the short end is where we get the biggest buck, and that would kick in -- the lending portfolio would kick in against a lot of our free deposits since most of our assets are shorter duration and a lot of it is in the form of cash, as we had just pointed out. And we'd also get a pick up from the longer part of the curve on our pension expense. So 100 basis point increase in rates is worth probably about $60 million a year in our pension expense. And if you put the combination of higher rates and good equity performance, then we could finally see some relief in pension expense starting next year. Also, as it pulls in the probability of an earlier Fed move, there's going to be some value reflected probably in the LIBOR curve, which helps a number of our businesses, including sec lending.","Operator","The next question is from Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Yes, so last quarter, you noted that you rarely lose a lot of business in the servicing business. But a back of the envelope analysis, using your quarterly disclosures on gross wins suggest that net new business is roughly flat over the last 3 years, if I back off market appreciation and deals. So I'm not sure what we might be missing in the calculations. I just thought if maybe you would comment on what you believe the organic trends would look like in the business and perhaps offer a little perspective on why you and your competitors are now a little more transparent around those trends?","Gerald L. Hassell","Tim, do you want to take that one?","Timothy F. Keaney","Yes, I would say we track a lot of things. I'd say we've been a net winner. We track net wins versus net losses. I think one good point for our industry is we see a lot more clients outsourcing, about 1\/3 of our pipeline in new business, is new business for our industry versus takeaways from the competition. I am encouraged if you put securities lending aside in our core asset servicing business, you'd see our fee is growing at 6% versus AUC growing at 4%. It's always good for us. If you look at a new client versus organic growth, new clients bring, generally, more expense with it. So I think it's actually a good sign that we see net new and organic tilting towards organic because it has less expense with it. And I think we're also seeing our investments in particularly collateral services, which Gerald outlined, is a big driver of our new business pipeline. So the things we look at, net new, are we winning more than we lose? Yes, we are. Win rate of 52%. But I'm encouraged by the organic flows and people coming back into the market.","Thomas P. Gibbons","And Luke, we don't provide a waterfall around our custody business. But we do -- it is more concentrated in fixed income. So it did benefit from some of the upside but certainly less than the equity markets have. So it's hard to decipher that just from looking at what you're -- just from estimating as I think you've done it.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then, I was hoping you might update us regarding the comments you made last quarter about the potential to announce some incremental spending to reduce the complexity of your technology infrastructure. And really just broadly, give us your latest thoughts on where you stand on the ongoing asset servicing technology race?","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes, sure. The -- it's Gerald here. It's basically included in the operational excellence initiatives, in the table, we've already outlined for you that we are continuing to produce quarterly. We are making further progress, as you can imagine, as part of our annual strategic planning process and getting ready for the budget cycle coming up in the end of the year. We are targeting further investments in simplifying the operating platform that will yield longer-term expense benefits. We're not ready to publish those numbers for you yet but it is part of our psyche to go after that even more aggressively than we have in the past.","Operator","The next question is from Howard Chen with Credit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Gerald, you highlighted the record revenues this quarter, we can certainly feel that as we review these results. But just for the unique gains you spoke to, it doesn't appear like operating margins are expanding as you progress through operational excellence. So when you weigh some of these targeted investments you're speaking about, how important is it for you and the management team to balance that with just achieving more positive operating leverage?","Gerald L. Hassell","Sure. It's a great question because we are in fact using some of those operational excellence savings and reinvesting in the businesses that aren't yielding necessarily bottom line income right now. But we are convinced, and we're seeing it empirically in ourselves, that the investments are starting to pay off. I cited some of the APAC platform, the Asia Pacific platform, of using the Pershing technology to introduce a separately managed account offering in the Asia Pacific region. We've gotten approval for it. We have our first client for it. We have several other clients lined up for it. And so we've been bearing all of that expense, of both the technology and enhanced distribution and sales capabilities in the investment management area. All that expense is being borne in our P&L today, and we think it's going to yield revenues and earnings in the future. So we are trying to do that delicate balance of reinvesting some of those savings in our future growth and delivering some profitability to the shareholders. We think we've gotten a pretty good balance here so far, but it's something we talk about everyday.","Thomas P. Gibbons","But, Howard, when we budgeted for this year, we recognized if we made these -- if we continue to invest in these initiatives, it was going to have a negative impact on our operating leverage over the course of the year. It just has to. And we decided that it was worth it.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right, understood. It makes sense. And then, Todd, just a follow-up for you. Thanks for all the thoughts on the leverage ratio. Appreciate a lot of this is not finalized. But I was just hoping you could just distill this conversation down to 2 main points for us. One, what do you see is the ultimate impact on how you all do business and from profitability as you pull these levers, if you have to? And two, do you think this will change the amount of capital you're returning to shareholders?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Well, that's why I kind of walked you through the numbers and that -- in the numbers that I walked you through in terms of the capital generation and the return don't even take into consideration any growth we might expect over the next couple of years. So before I go on speculate on something like that, Howard, I need to have a little more clarity around exactly what the rule is going to be. In the meantime, just like we did with the Tier 1 common, we're not going to take any knee-jerk reaction and change anything until we get a good sense of where the rules are. The other thing is we haven't been managing to it. So if you think about it, back when we -- when the Basel III Tier 1 common rule was introduced and we first disclosed, we've reduced our risk-weighted assets by 25% under that rule, under the advanced approach. We haven't had any impact on our business by reducing that 25%. It's just making -- it's just optimizing and being more efficient, and we haven't even begun that process around the supplemental leverage ratio or the new Basel III rule. So I'd like to be able to take some time, first of all, to understand what the rule is and to pour over the data before I answer that question.","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes, let me just add if I could, as a reminder, we do have a very different business model than everybody else where the supplemental rule is being applied. We are a very, very highly-liquid organization, which as Todd pointed out, we have almost $200 billion of either cash or a very, very high-grade government and agencies securities on our balance sheet. And so yes, our leverage ratio by absolute levels is relatively low, but it's relatively low because we have a highly -- and we have a very different business model that's highly liquid and very low risk weighted assets. We have to rethink some of the levers that Todd just described on deposits, unfunded commitments, the treatment of certain types of assets, et cetera. We think we have those capabilities within our tool set to be able to manage to the new requirements over the course of time that it's been laid out. So I do want to stress that we do think we have many tools available to us long before we consider interrupting our planned capital returns.","Operator","The next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask you about the servicing business, a little bit of a follow-on to Luke's question. Obviously, you guys have a bigger mix of fixed income assets and we saw that you still had really nice wins, $200 billion again. So can you guys help us understand the growth trajectory of the core servicing ex securities lending from here? And within that, just how do we understand the effects of the fixed income market selloff on revenues within that part of the custody business?","Gerald L. Hassell","Tim, that's all yours.","Timothy F. Keaney","Yes, maybe we start at investment services first. Todd mentioned the broad-based growth we're seeing in fees, where we're really pleased that, that's really across the board. Clearing has been leading the way. We're seeing some interesting drivers there. We're seeing a small and mid-sized brokers get out of self-clearing. We're seeing private banks looking to us for unique product set. You're seeing core issuer services, net wins and organic growth. We're seeing good uptick in our issuer business. So broad-based, one point is, we're delighted that the core business is growing, and we're seeing the new business convert. Todd mentioned, we are highly geared towards fixed income. So we continue to be aggressive on the equity mix. We didn't mention that we have about $350 million left to convert, which is about twice what we did this quarter. So it is a little harder. We're seeing less gearing to AUC in core asset servicing also, because outsourcing our collateral and our transfer agency and subtransfer agency businesses are playing an increasingly important role in the portfolio. But as I step back and look across all of that, we like the fact that the core businesses are growing, pipeline is incredibly strong, our win rate is high and the new things that we've been investing in are pulling through. And over that -- over the cycle, that portfolio should perform very, very strongly.","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes, and, Ken, maybe just to add, we do have a diverse set of businesses within Investment Services, which is a plus. And we're trying to rely less on fixed income securities as the driver for our businesses. And so as Tim pointed out, Pershing is a very good example where it's a terrific platform that serves the end investor, the end individual investors. The individual investor moves more into equities and more into other instruments, that's a plus for us. We see the DR business being more equity driven. A lot of our asset servicing wins have been more equity-based or more fee-based, not tied to assets under custody. So we are further diversifying our revenue streams and being less tied to fixed income securities. And that's a conscious effort on our part.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. I understood. And then my second question is just related to operational excellence. The program has continued to have a nice quarterly benefit where you're taking out more cost each quarter and you're already at a $600 million run rate on an annualized basis, well above where you're originally targeting for this year and even closing in on the total program cost. Just wondering, first of all, just should we continue to see every quarter that there's still incremental costs coming out. And then secondly, what's -- it looks like you're going to be well ahead of that original goal. Can any chance you can size for us how far ahead you might end up being at the end of the program relative to initial guidelines?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Sure, Ken. The -- we are a bit ahead. I mean, part of the reason was we took some more aggressive actions in the fourth quarter last year related to our real estate footprint, and we will start to reap the benefits of those. It does tend to be lumpy, so that there are actions that we're taking in a particular quarter that may pay off. So you may see a couple of quarters where it could actually be flat. And in fact, we would have thought that might have been the case, but we were able to do some more in the fourth quarter of last year. Hopefully, we're going to beat it, so we put out a target that we thought we can meet. We intend to meet it or beat it. But as Gerald said, we're also investing in our businesses elsewhere, and we've used some of that benefit frankly to drive -- try to drive the future revenue opportunities.","Operator","The next question is from Cynthia Mayer with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Maybe just a follow-up on the liabilities-driven investment. If the rise in rates spurs a lot of clients to do LDI, does that lead to sort of a one-time spike of inflows followed by a lull? And could some of those clients take those assets in-house over time instead of using outside managers?","Curtis Y. Arledge","So there's definitely been a trend towards LDI. The biggest part of our LDI business today is in the U.K. and one of our initiatives has actually been to expand. We have U.S. businesses as well, but we really are growing pretty rapidly in the U.S. and in other developed parts of the world, where our pension funds have not been as aggressive in using LDI strategies. So that definitely is a trend. And at some point when LDI is fully on play with clients who wanted to go that direction, I think you will see it leveling off. I will tell you that some clients have looked at moving it internally and in some cases have done that. I think managing their liability, liabilities across the world of different complexity. In the U.K., they have an inflation component that is sometimes complex to manage against and they work with us to do that. And I think clients make different decisions on whether to do it in-house or not. But so far, I would tell you that the trend has been more to work with investment management firms and we've been a real beneficiary of that. The firms that we -- our investment firms that provide LDI services, one of the great things that they do is they really do understand client liabilities. And those liabilities can be very defined as in the case of a pension fund or they may need a tremendous amount of analysis in the case of even individuals, high net worth clients in a broader range of institutions. And so a lot of the intellectual capital and modeling tools around the liability side, I think, can be applied much more broadly to the full universe of investing clients. I think it's part of what you see spawning the broader solutions movement that's happened in the investment management landscape. And we think we're extremely well positioned to be a leader in the solution space helping clients understand their liabilities and how to invest against those liabilities. So LDI is absolutely a very large trend, we expect to continue for a while and we think that we are also well positioned to evolve it as the market evolves. But that -- I really do believe that's years away.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then also I'm just wondering if you could give a little color on money market fee waivers, your outlook there. And more generally, just impact of the very, very low repo rate than short-term rates that you're seeing.","Curtis Y. Arledge","I'll give an investment management answer. This is Curtis Arledge again. I'll give an investment management answer and maybe Todd or Tim, if you guys want to talk more broadly. We absolutely had seen an increase in fee waivers in this quarter versus a year ago. Some of that actually is we have been working to -- the rules have been proposed by the SEC, we see clients starting to think about what their longer-term plan will be, and we have absolutely seen, I think, we're better positioned. We think that we're going to be one of winners in the new money market world. Institutional prime funds, we think, are going to end up taking less risk. The yields will be different -- will be less different, less varied across providers. And we're -- we think we're very well prepared to benefit from an environment where clients are more focused on sponsor that they work with. Being the safest bank in the United States, doing really well, all the stress tests and whatnot is definitely on our client's radar screen. We've seen where we work with other parts of investment services and increasing usage of us in our money market funds by clients that are coming to us either from asset servicing or from Pershing or other parts of our company. So part of the reason we have increased fee waivers is absolutely because rates -- part of it is also because we think our business is actually doing well. So there's a revenue offset to much of the fee waiver business. We've done a lot of analysis of our client base. We've looked pretty closely at options that may play out when reform actually is put into place. There essentially are 4 paths that we think make up the bulk of where clients will go in the money market world with institutional prime assets. For those that absolutely have to have constant NAV, many of them will choose going through treasury and government funds. Again, we will lose revenue on that institutional prime side, but pick up some share of that revenue in our treasury and government funds. Some subsegment of our client base have said that they will accept floating rate. It's not a large portion of it, but some will. Others will stay with the constant NAV with liquidity gates if both of those end up being -- going forward as proposed. And then finally, there will be some that exit that need to move to deposits or to other types of stable investments. When we look across the whole thing, we think it's going to have an impact but not an incredibly large impact. Some of that driven by the fact that we've already seen a diminution in our profitability from the low-interest rate environment. So again, if rates normalize, we actually think a lot of assets will come back to the money market space. We think we'll see meaningful growth there potentially. And it may not be what it would have been without reform, but we again think we're well positioned. Maybe the last thing I'd say, this whole leverage ratio discussion, to the extent that if cash and high-quality assets, treasuries and agencies are not excluded from the calculation and banks broadly end up owning fewer of them, you would think that, that would shrink the demand side of the equation and actually push short-term yields up, which would shrink our fee waivers. So there are some positive offsets to some of these leverage ratio discussions in our earnings profile.","Thomas P. Gibbons","And Cynthia, for the rest of the company, in fact, fee waivers are about consistent with the size of our businesses, about 25% to 30% of the impact is felt by the Investment Management side and the remainder by the Investment Services side. It's largely driven by very short-term rates and the best correlation is just to the fed funds effected, which inched it down a basis point or so in the quarter and it continues to trade at about that level. So we've indicated in the past that it's about $0.05 or $0.06 right now a quarter with where these -- where the fee waivers are running for the entire company in terms of the pretax income impact.","Operator","The next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Is there a little shift in terms of your emphasis on wealth management? It seems like you're talking about it more forcefully at the start of this call?","Gerald L. Hassell","Mike, wealth management has always been a business we love. And I've personally been a strong proponent of our wealth management business. I wish it was a larger percentage of our company, and we're just making good investments in people and in some of the infrastructure to make a more competitive and more markets across the countries. So it's a good business, it's a very sound business for us, it's a steady grower, it's got good margins, it has all the right attributes and utilizes our investment management capabilities. So we think it's got all the right attributes for further investment. So it's just one of the examples of many examples, where we're investing in our businesses for long-term growth.","Thomas P. Gibbons","I think I'd add to that, Mike, these investments, of all the things that we do, the ones that have the greatest probability of actually meeting our expectations will be this type of an investment. But the challenge is it's a long payback period. So you invest and you see it 2, 3, 4 years out. But we think it's -- we just need to continue because there's real value there to building this organically. It would be great if there was something that was a perfect fit, but if there's not, we're going to have to do it organically.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then my second question, I know I asked it last earnings call, but each time I go down to the court house for the Bank of New York hearing with the $8.5 billion settlement with Bank of America, I hear some lawyers -- I'll paraphrase, I think they say that Bank of New York rubber-stamped the $8.5 million mortgage put-back agreement. And I know you can't comment on the particulars of the case, but I just happen to be down there. It was, I guess, yesterday was the internal counsel and last time I was there, it was the external counsel for Bank of New York. And my question is, if the judge refuses to accept the $8.5 billion settlement, what would be the implications for Bank of New York? And my thought process, which I invite you to correct is that you only get a few basis points to act as custodian for a lot of these fees. You don't incorporate the possibility that you'd have to expand a whole lot of effort for the sort of problem asset resolution. And so if they deny this settlement, does that imply that you have a much higher level of duty to the certificate holders that you act as trustee for?","Gerald L. Hassell","Mike, we think we've managed this process and our role as trustee in these securities quite well. It's going through the typical court process. You're going to hear lawyers from all sides argue their case. We think we've handled our duties properly, and that's all I can say.","Thomas P. Gibbons","I'll just add one thing to that cost question, Mike. The agreements that govern the trust provided by BNY Mellon's trustee, we're indemnified for any losses, liability or expenses. So if there are higher expenses, we should indemnify them.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","What I'm kind of getting to, I mean, the price competition among the processing banks has been tough for the last many years. If you look at processing fees that's under custody, it's still very low. Each of the big players have talked about being more selective in how they price things. Are you seeing any change in the pricing when you act as custodian?","Gerald L. Hassell","Mike, for the very large clients, the largest investment managers or sovereign wealth funds around the world, continue to remain very price competitive and we try to win on service capability, value-added capability rather than win on the pure commoditized settlement of it. And that's why the diversified business model we have and the different solutions sets we have to offer, we think has put us in a competitive -- positive competitive position. The pure custody business is very commoditized. I will grant it. And that's why some of the operational excellence and some of the expense initiatives we have in place to constantly improve our operating platforms so that we can, in fact, maintain our operating margins as part of the nature of the business. Overall, the company's operating margins are quite healthy and we showed strong revenue growth, we improved our operating margins, and we're investing in our businesses for the future. So we like these businesses. There are elements of it that are clearly commodity driven.","Operator","Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Todd, I know you had given us some color on the supplemental leverage ratio. And I think many of us on this call would agree you guys are clearly different than our largest banks. If you're successful in convincing the regulators to allow you to deduct the cash and the government-guaranteed securities on your balance sheet, just that portion of it, would that put you over the 5% number do you think on the leverage ratio?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Gerard, I could barely hear you, unfortunately. I'm not sure what's wrong with the communications, but...","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I'll try again, maybe this is a little better. You gave us some color on the leverage ratio and clearly, you guys are different than the biggest banks. If you're successful in convincing the regulators that deducting cash in the guaranteed-government securities that you own and others would do the same from the denominator. Would that put you over the 5% by just doing that alone?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Well, if you deducted cash -- the way to look at it is we've got about a $360 billion balance sheet. And if you deducted cash and government-guaranteed securities that's $200 billion. So, yes, that throws us way over.","Gerald L. Hassell","The answer is yes.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Under the way -- and I always want to phrase it under the way they're currently proposing that it'd be calculated.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And speaking on the leverage ratio, your -- do you have an estimate for what the lead bank ratio is, which is going to be 6% for everybody?","Thomas P. Gibbons","It's about -- it's close to where we were at the holding company.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, Gerald, finally, coming back to the wealth management business, what kind of projections do you guys see in terms of future revenue growth from this initiative now to grow this business pretty dramatically as you pointed out. I think you said 50% types of increases in staff and people. What do you think you could -- 2 or 3 years down the road, relative to where you are today, how much higher could the revenue be?","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes, I don't want to give guidance and speculation, but we wouldn't be making the investment if we didn't think we could meaningfully increase the rate of growth in the wealth management business. We've -- as Todd said, it's pretty predictable when we make these kinds of investments, how the growth rate actually increases. You're starting to see some of it in things like loans and deposits, which is the easiest thing to point to, where we've had meaningful growth already. We had almost 20% increase on both of those categories year-over-year. So it's starting to show up in the numbers already.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Bedell with ISI Group.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Gerald, I think you mentioned in your earlier comments on the collateral management initiative beginning to show up in revenue. Maybe if you and\/or Tim could talk about the progress there that you're seeing so far. If you can quantify the revenue in the asset servicing number and then where you think maybe a type of range we can think about that in 2014. I think you had previously said that was more of a 2014 type of build. It looks like you're seeing some early returns there.","Gerald L. Hassell","Right. As I said in my opening comments, we're seeing it in the optimization and segregation balances, and then it's starting to show up in some of the fees. We're not breaking it out yet. It's basically included in the overall investment services fees. But one of the reasons for the year-over-year growth is then related to that. We're also seeing it in some of our secured loan category, which is part of the optimization. And so that's one of the reasons why our net interest income and our secured loans are up. But Tim, maybe you want to add some comment.","Timothy F. Keaney","Yes, Brian, thanks for the question. I mean, I still go back to Dodd-Frank, it's still about only 1\/3 written EMIR, the European cousin to Dodd-Frank about the same. These regulations continue to be phased-in. The buy side's claiming a more important role because they have to comply with these regulations as well, so we're doing a lot of education of the clients. I mean Gerald nailed it between secured term, loan financing, the number of accounts we're segregating. The amount of collateral we're reinvesting through our portal, all the vital signs there are very healthy. About 1\/3 of our asset servicing pipelines being driven by overall activity in collateral. But I think the 2 areas -- and so I think those services will continue to grow as clients are forced to put more the derivatives volumes through CCPs and collateralize them. So that will happen steadily over time. And then the 2 services that are going to become increasingly more important to clients probably in mid-'14 and later is segregating all of their collateral positions around the world and then providing optimization services on top of that, and we charge for both of those things. So I don't know if that characterization is helpful, but those are the areas that we've been reinvesting in our technology capabilities.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. Do you feel you're most of the way through that in technology investment, you mentioned that the patent that you ordered? Or is there still a significant amount of buildout to capture those revenues out in '14 and '15?","Timothy F. Keaney","Yes, I would say the majority of it is behind us, Brian. We're testing aggregation now with a couple of clients. Yes, so I would say most of that investment is behind us. It's now more the ground assault marketing effort in getting out and talking mostly to the buy side.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And just one more for Todd. On the unrealized securities losses, the change in the first to second quarter. Todd, how do you think about that on the go-forward basis in terms of capital management in context of your comments on the Basel III leverage ratio and your mitigation strategies? Or is it -- if we get a back up on the yield curve substantially faster over the next several quarters, would you move more securities to help the maturity, or are there other mitigation strategies to that in terms of your capital planning?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, we certainly take it into consideration. We model the sensitivity to it and we've become a bit more defensive in both what we're buying and which account that we're placing it. So that we could -- as we get closer to the ultimate days that the Fed actually does something, it will be less impactful. But securities are still a big part of our balance sheet. So as a percentage basis, it is something for us to keep an eye on.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Right. And would you shorten duration then as a potential mitigation strategy?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Certainly shorten the duration that would be exposed to the capital.","Operator","Our final question today is from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I just want to follow up on the net interest margin. You guys were up 4 basis points sequentially. You said it didn't really benefit too much from premium amortization this quarter. You talked about an earnings mix shift. But in the previous question, you're talking about potentially being more defensive if you need to be in shortening durations. So how do we kind of put all that together? What drove the NIM performance sequentially? Was it taking a little bit more duration or -- how do we think about that in the quarter and then going forward?","Thomas P. Gibbons","There are 2 drivers. One is actually cost of funds decline. So if you look at our interest earning deposits, they declined from -- 1 basis point. Now 1 basis point doesn't sound like a lot, but $140 billion and actually -- it actually adds up, so we went from 8 to 7 basis points. The other thing is we did -- we called our trust preferreds, which fell through the deadline, those were relatively expensive. So we got a nice kicker from a reduced cost of funds and the -- then the other driver is mix. So we did see an increase in our loan portfolio. We'd like it to be a little bit bigger, but we did see an increase in the loan portfolio. We saw a modest increase. Actually the securities portfolio from period to period was about flat. It was bigger on average. But from period to period, it was about flat. So we saw a decline on the available for sale and an increase, Jim, in the health of maturity as we use that a little more aggressively. So we think that as -- and then we saw a little bit of a benefit from the fact that the unamortized premium is going to slow down. So that helped us a few million dollars, or $5 million or $6 million as well. So you take that into consideration on a go forward, we're going to pick up the benefit from the -- the benefit from the unamortized premium and will be more than offset from allowing the duration to shorten a bit.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. So you'd expect sort of that core NIM to stabilize, but potentially getting more benefit from premium amortization?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, I think, that's the way to look at it. We think we can hang in here without doing a lot to the portfolio.","Gerald L. Hassell","Well, thank you very much, everybody for dialing in.

Good morning, and welcome to the BNY Mellon third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With us today are Charlie Scharf, our CEO; and Todd Gibbons, our CFO, as well as members of our executive leadership team.","Our third quarter earnings materials include a financial highlights presentation that will be referred to in the discussion of our results, and can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.","Before Charlie and Todd discuss our results, let me take a moment to remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release, the financial highlights presentation and in our documents filed with the SEC available on the website, bnymellon.com. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, October 19, 2017. We will not update forward-looking statements.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Charlie.","Charles Scharf","Thank you so much, and good morning and thank you all for joining us. I would like to cover a series of items before I turn it over to Todd, and then we will open it up for questions.","I'm going to be making some brief remarks about the quarter. I'm going to talk about the transition, share some views on our businesses, our challenges and our opportunities. Let me start with the third quarter performance versus the prior year.","Revenue grew 2%. Expenses were flat year-over-year and were flat from last quarter. EPS grew 4%. Looking at revenue in more detail, fees grew 1%, but DRs decreased by $54 million, which reduced growth by 2%. FX and other trading revenues were down $10 million. The remainder of investment services grew 5% and investment management fees grew 5%.","Todd will discuss this in more detail but we saw some reasonable growth in some areas that are core to our franchise. This includes asset servicing, clearing fees, asset management and performance fees and treasury services fees. ","Net interest grew 8%. On a segment basis, investment services grew revenue 2%. Again DRs reduced this growth rate by about 2% and FX and other trading revenues reduced this by 1%. Investment management grew revenue at 4%. When we look at pre-tax, investment services pre-tax grew 4% and investment management pre-tax grew 17%.","We also continued to strengthen our capital position which Todd will cover, and I will discuss my thoughts in more detail, but while the quarter showed consistent performance and some of our core businesses showed reasonable growth, we believe we can continue to build our franchise and ultimately increase our rate of revenue and EPS growth.","Now a few comments about the transition. First I want to take a few minutes and thank Gerald. He has been a terrific partner through the transition and I am grateful to have access to his advice and counsel. I also want to recognize the progress he has made and the foundation he has created during his tenure as CEO. When I talk about the opportunities that we have for the future we all know they are possible because of what he has accomplished here.","Also a few words about the [indiscernible] of our employees here at The Bank of New York Mellon. While Gerald provided the necessary leadership, the results have been driven by a large group of employees here. The effort has been tremendous; changing the profit profile of the company at the same time as dealing with all of the post-crisis requirements is an extraordinary achievement. We are a much stronger company today and our future is bright because of what you have all accomplished. So thank you.","Having said that we are at the beginning of a new journey. We are proud of our progress, but we are not necessarily satisfied with our performance. We want to continue to build stronger underlying margins, which we might or might not use to reinvest in the business and we seek higher levels of growth, and we will continue to be focused on keeping a strong capital base and high returns. For me personally it has been a busy three months. I have spent most of my time listening and learning. I have seen 42 of our top 50 clients around the world. I have met with many of our regulators globally, and I have had extensive internal discussions focusing on both our business and our people. Todd and I have conducted systematic business reviews to review our business strategies, performance, competitive environment, strengths and opportunities.","I have also done my best to meet with as many people as possible in both small and larger groups. People have been generous with their time and patience, and I have found my discussions invaluable thus far.","Now let me make some observations about our company. There are many things which excite me about this company, which I have seen. First, there are so many pieces of our culture which anyone would envy. We love working for this company. We love serving our clients. We take a long-term view of those relationships. We are extremely objective about our own performance, and the genuinely enjoy working as a team. In addition to these strong elements of our culture we play an important role in the global financial system. We have got deep relationships with our clients, which have been built over decades.","We talk about their needs before our needs. So many people here have great subject matter expertise as well, and we understand the importance of technology to our future. But I also see meaningful opportunities for us to improve our business going forward. With all the progress that we have made in generating strong results, I still believe we can improve our performance by changing how we manage the company.","We are not demanding enough of each other and this can stand in the way of disciplined management, which can drive us to stronger results. We do strive to be a high-performing company, and that requires crisper processes, streamlined decision-making, a clear sense of responsibility and most importantly we are beginning to drive a meaningfully different sense of urgency and clear accountability.","Ultimately I firmly believe this will drive better execution, better decision-making and ultimately better results. As we think about our future there is nothing more important than ensuring we have got the best operating environment and core technology platform to build from. It is important that everyone understands that this is a multi-year effort that has been in place. We have made significant improvements in improving our core platforms, but this is a journey and significant continued investment is necessary. With Bridget Engle joining us, we now have a new set of eyes to look at the priorities and we have a clear agenda here. We spend over $2 billion today a year on technology, and we will continue to devote an outsized amount of our resources here.","We have eliminated redundant platforms over the past several years, but still have more work to do. The continued platform integration is critical. Our operating environment is still too complex. As we continue to invest, we will ultimately become more efficient but more importantly we will have a better platform to serve our clients, and our investments in technology go beyond core platform improvement.","You have heard us talk about NEXEN. NEXEN is not one system or one platform, but a discrete set of activities, which are important for our ability to deliver our company as a platform. It includes the following. We are simplifying the ways clients access our technology by providing a common integrated portal rather than siloed solutions. Our APIs will allow clients a simplified and more streamlined way to access our capabilities. Our efforts to more holistically manage our data across the enterprise will continue to create meaningful ways for us to provide differentiated insights and capabilities for our clients.","And this year we launched our third generation container-based private cloud. Our private cloud platform hosts a growing portion of our non-mainframe applications and has significantly improved software delivery times from months to hours. Here too we are committed to this journey and as we sharpen our focus on our priorities and our implementation.","And while we made great progress reducing our expense base we are not done. We need to continue to drive efficiency throughout the company. This includes developing a multiyear plan to automate much of the manual work that exists today. I have talked about the strong client orientation that exists inside the company, but here I think we do have substantial opportunity to take the strong piece of our culture a step forward.","Our client focus by itself doesn't ensure that we consistently deliver great solutions to our clients. We become too product centric in some cases and at times have not worked as well across our organization. Simply said, we see a significant opportunity to do a better job delivering all of BNY Mellon to our clients in a clear and coordinated way. We are now engaged in sessions where we develop detailed client plans looking across the company at our current business relationships, their wallet, our competitive position, our solutions, where they are taking their company and put these all together to develop a coordinated plan to serve each client.","These sessions will drive management strategies for our clients, but also will drive us to create new solutions based on a deeper understanding of where we can help our clients grow. These tools then form the basis for a process to manage our business with clients truly at the center of our thoughts and activities.","Now let me make a few specific comments about our businesses. First of all we like the businesses that we are in. Like most businesses, some have more challenges and some have more opportunities. Let me start by talking about our investment services businesses and I will start specifically with our asset servicing and clearing businesses. Our positions are strong. These are core services for our clients, where we have true global scale.","We have high quality businesses, which are real competitive differentiators for us. The business environment is competitive for sure. And our growth has been impacted in some of these businesses by conversions and related issues over the past few years, but our asset servicing revenues grew 4% this quarter and our clearing revenues grew 10%.","We believe that we still have an opportunity to improve our performance. Pershing is a great brand; has created a great place for itself in the market and it is very well run. Our government clearance business is also one of our great strengths and should continue to be an asset for us going forward. And we are in a unique position in that we connect the buy-side and the sell-side here.","Our technology has been a differentiator and we continue to have opportunities to do even more with both the technology and the data we have. And remember these businesses are very often the anchors in our client relationship and we see opportunities to create even more leverage going forward. Our corporate trust business is a meaningful part of the company.","Our results have been disappointing over the last few years as we have not committed the required resources, but we did see mid-single-digit revenue growth this quarter. We now have a new leadership team in place and are focused on regaining our position as the high quality growing trustee.","In our treasury services businesses, we are a top tier US dollar clearer, US treasury management solutions provider and the payment services provider to the rest of the BNY Mellon enterprise. We see steady growth here, low double double-digit revenue growth this quarter and it is driven by service quality and GDP growth. It also produces healthy margins and high quality LCR friendly deposit balances.","In our DR business, we have significant share and are winning our fair share of new programs. Pricing has become more competitive but we remain disciplined on that, and also on structure and terms. Growth here is dependent upon emerging market equity issuances and episodic corporate actions and other issuance and cancellation activity.","Let me make some comments about our markets business. Our markets business is a very important part of our offering. Our goal here is to capture flows generated from the strong relationships elsewhere in the company. We have always been highly focused on core FX and other low-risk products and will continue to do so.","We have some of the best securities lending and collateral management capabilities in the world, important differentiators where we believe we can provide more liquidity, lower funding cost and lower capital requirements for our clients. This business benefits hugely from our scale, but also from our use of data and technology. ","Now let me move on to our investment management business. As you know, we have multiple brands and investment strategies and their pluses and minuses to the structure. There can be different points of view on the value of multiple brands, but some of our brands are clear differentiators for us. But the way we run the core of our business is actually not different from many other active managers out there.","We have highly focused investment teams. They have their own clear and unique investment processes, and they have got the drive, the focus and the incentive system based on their own performance to deliver the strongest results that they can. Where we have fallen short historically is that we have not achieved the benefits of common platforms.","Mitchell is very focused on doing this where it makes sense, and you are seeing it in our results with significant margin expansion and profit growth. And I do believe that there are real benefits to asset management, investment services and markets all being part of Bank of New York Mellon. Distributors of asset management products are some of our biggest clients. And as I visited many of our boutique CEOs, they have told me of the value they are beginning to see as we create access they would not be able to achieve on their own.","Again we have deep global relationships. Our Pershing platform is another important partner of the business. And lastly asset management is an important component of one of our best and least well-understood assets, which is our [precision] servicing and managing cash. Along with markets and investment services we have a fairly unique set of capabilities, which give us a unique set of offerings for both broker-dealers and asset owners.","Having said this, our asset management and asset servicing flows today are clearly suffering from not having scale in ETFs. This is a topic for another day. For now our focus is creating value by continuing to improve the profit profile of our business by leveraging BNY Mellon and common platforms.","These are just a few thoughts based on what I have seen and learnt over the past three months. We are currently deep into our planning process and we are using the process to dig deep into our businesses and develop a clear plan, which is both operational, financial but also strategic for the next several years. We plan on providing a detailed review of our findings and plans at an investor day, which we are now planning to hold on March 8.","With that, let me turn it over to Todd.","Todd Gibbons","Thanks, Charlie and good morning everyone. I will review the details of our third-quarter financial results on a year-over-year basis, unless I note otherwise. ","In the quarter, global equity [markets] resulted in record AUCA and AUM for us. The revenue increased 2%, investment management fees were up 5%, investment services 1%. As Charlie noted, our investment services revenue performance was impacted by a 34% decline in DR revenue and that also impacted our FX trading revenue on a year-over-year basis.","We experienced a little bit lower volatility in our FX results on a year-over-year basis. As you can see in the report it is down about 20% volatility, and that is where the market averages were, and somewhat offset by higher average trading volume. And IR increased as we recognized a full quarter benefit from the June rate increase, and did experience a modest decline in deposits and lower loan volume as we reduced some of our lower yielding loans.","Finally, from a currency translation perspective the fluctuations had an essentially neutral impact on revenues as well as on our expenses and the net income for the company on a total company basis. But it did have a slightly higher impact on revenues and expenses sequentially.","Charlie walked you through the highlights of the quarter. So I will move ahead to Slide 8 to discuss our consolidated fee and other revenue. Asset servicing fees were up 4% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The year-over-year change reflects higher equity market values and net new business, including growth in collateral management and that was partially offset by the impact of downsizing the UK transfer agency business.","The sequential increase was driven by currency and higher equity market values. Clearing service fees increased 10% year-over-year and that is primarily reflecting higher money market fees and growth in our long-term mutual fund assets. On a sequential basis, clearing fees declined and that is driven by lower volumes that we saw in the third quarter.","Issuer service fees declined 15% year-over-year and that is reflecting the lower depositary receipt fees and we experienced fewer corporate actions, some lost business due to pricing and structure and also had lower program shares outstanding. In net aggregate, those items reduced the fees relative to last year by over $50 million.","On a sequential basis, issuer service fees were up 20% and that is primarily due to seasonality in DRs as well as higher corporate trust revenue. Treasury service fees increased 3% year-over-year and 1% sequentially and that is reflecting the higher payment volumes that was partially offset by compensating balance credits that we provide to clients. So if you adjust for those credits, the fee revenue growth would have been an additional 3% higher or 6% in total.","On a sequential basis revenue would have been an additional 1% to 2% greater. Investment management and performance fees increased 5% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Unlike most quarters, the net impact from higher currency translation on investment management and performance fees was less than 1% this quarter. This quarter as part of our ongoing portfolio rationalization we announced the sale of our real estate focused investment boutique called CenterSquare.","We expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter or perhaps early next year, and that sale will have no material impact on our overall financial results. Also as a result of the improvements made over the last year to the cost structure of the business, our adjusted pretax operating margin for investment management continued to improve to 35%. This is an increase of 265 basis points year-over-year.","Foreign exchange and other trading revenue on a consolidated basis decreased 5% year-over-year and increased 5% sequentially. FX revenue was 158 million. That is 10% lower year-over-year and it is 5% higher sequentially. The year-over-year decrease was driven by lower volatility as well as lower DR related FX activity.","And that is partially offset by higher volumes. The sequential increase reflects those higher volumes as well. Investment and other income declined to $63 million from $92 million in the year ago quarter and $122 million in the prior quarter. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects lower other income driven by the impact of our investments in renewable energy as well as low received capital gains.","The sequential decline reflects lease-related gains recorded in the second quarter, which did not recur in the third quarter as well as lower income as well as lower income from corporate bank owned life insurance.","Slide nine shows the drivers of our investment management business which explain underlying performance. We achieved record assets under management of 1.8 trillion. It's up 6% year-over-year and it reflects higher market values as well as net inflows and the favorable impact of a weaker dollar and that's principally against the pound. In terms of investment performance against the backdrop of a relatively strong quarter for global markets our active strategies performed pretty well with 75% and 74% of assets above the three and five year benchmarks. We also experienced net inflows interactively managed strategies. We had long-term active inflows of 3 billion that was driven by continued demand for our fixed income, multi-asset and alternative strategies. These inflows were offset by outflows in active equities and LDI strategy which actually totaled $4 million. We saw inflows of 4 billion to fixed income, inflows of 3 billion to multi-asset and alternative investment strategies and those are key areas that we are looking to grow that have benefited from strong demand.","This quarter active equity outflows of 2 billion was about the lowest we have seen over the last few years and it was held in part by a strong equity market as well as improved investment performance and pricing. LDI outflows of 2 billion up were driven by one significant LDI client that shows to take the business in-house. Additionally we had $3 billion amount in outflows from low fee index products and that's again driven by a few large clients. Similar to last quarter weeks we experienced cash inflows of 10 billion this quarter. U.S. money market funds the largest segment of our cash business have not grown 19% year-to-date and that compares favorably to the industry trend of 1% organic growth this year. Our ability to maintain good performance in core money market funds and grow our customer base through synergies with investment services has been key to out-performance year. This is a business where we have scale.","We have got a strong reputation and we demonstrated good performance and where we continue to see growth opportunity as the sector solidifies around firms that are sharing these trends. Our wealth management business continued positive trends with wealth management fees up 4% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. Higher net new business from U.S. expansion initiative and continued loan growth which was 9% higher year-over-year helped to drive performance. That was offset by reduction in deposit that was primarily driven by a single client.","Turning to our investment services metrics on slide 10, we achieved record AUC\/A of 32.2 trillion this quarter that's up 6% year-over-year and 4% sequentially reflecting the stronger market values. We estimate total new assets under custody and administration business winds were about 166 billion in the third quarter looking at other key investment services metrics you will see average deposit declined 10% year-over-year and 1% sequentially and that reflects the impact of the June rate increase. Average loan balances declined 14% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Lastly average tri-party people balances grew 15% year-over-year and 1% sequentially as volume increased with the additional business we are on boarding.","Turning to net interest revenue on slide 11, you will see that on fully tax equivalent basis NIR of 851 million was up 8% versus year ago quarter and up 2% versus the second quarter; both increases primarily reflect higher interest rates and is partially offset by lower average deposit and loans. The sequential increase also reflects an additional interest earning day in the quarter. We experienced some moderate deposit runoff and interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposits. Average non-interest-bearing deposits declined 14% year-over-year and 5% sequentially and interest bearing declined 8% year-over-year but were flat sequentially. This was about in line with expectations following the June rate increase and deposits toward the end of the quarter were above the quarterly average.","Turning to slide 12, you'll see that the adjusted non-interesting expense was up slightly year-over-year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflect higher software and professionally and legal and other purchase services and that was partially offset by lower litigation expense and bank assessment charges. Sequentially higher staff expense was offset by lower other professional legal and other purchase services and lower business develop expenses as well as lower bank assessment charges. The increase in staff expenses was driven by higher incentives and that's just reflecting the strong performance as well as by the annual employee merit increase that comes takes place in July. The decrease in professional and legal and other purchase services was driven by lower consulting fees related to our resolution planning which we submitted at the end of the second quarter.","Turning to capital on slide 13, our fully phased-in supplemental leverage ratio increased to 6.1% and that now meets the upcoming 2018 regulatory requirements plus a reasonable buffer. We also remain in full compliance with U.S. liquidity coverage ratio requirements our LCR was 119% in the third quarter. All of our ratios are at or above our internal targets reflecting our continued capital generation and given for prospects for the relief of the SLR we no longer see a need to issue preferred equity. And now that we are at our targets it positions us well to increase buybacks in future years.","A few additional notes about the quarter on page 9 of our press release we share our investments securities portfolio highlights at the quarter end our unrealized pretax gain or portfolio was 257 million that compares to 151 in the last quarter and that's primarily driven by a slight decrease in long-term interest rates. And our effective tax rate was 25.4%.","Turning now to tax reform we currently support comprehensive tax reform as an important step both to achieve economic growth targets as well as to improve the competitiveness of U.S. businesses. We\u2019re encouraged by recent progress of the big six to define key parameters of tax reform. But because of the details reformer still remain unknown and uncertain it is difficult to estimate our effective tax rate post reform however, based on the available information that we have as we currently understand it, we would expect our effective tax rate to approximate the U.S. statutory tax rate post reform. Otherwise we expect that our effective tax rate may rise approximately 100 basis points in 2018 given our expected revenue growth as well as the mix of earnings we project for next year.","Before turning to Q&A, I would like to provide you with some color on how you\u2019re thinking about the next quarter and the full year to assist you with our modeling. First earnings are typically impacted by our seasonal decline in DL revenue with a limited offset and expenses, we estimate that the decline from the third quarter to be approximately $80 million. We expect performance fees and our investment management business in the fourth quarter to be similar to that as the fourth quarter of 2016.","Full year NIR is still expected to be at the high end of the 6% range that we had given you previously. Investment and other income for the fourth quarter and beyond is expected to be in the $40 million to $60 million range reflecting a lower leasing gains as well as the impact of our investments and renewable energy.","We expect total adjusted expenses for the full year to be in-line with our prior guidance by approximately 1% higher than last year, as I know last quarter there is \u2013 it could be impacted by improved revenue performance, higher stock price as well as the continuing weakness in the U.S. dollar. Our 2017 effective tax rate is still expected to be in the range of 25% to 26% and finally we expect to generate positive operating leverage for the full year.","With that let me hand over to the operator to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Q - Brennan Hawken","Hi good morning. Just a quick question for you on the funding cost side, you walked through some of the specifics on deposits which was really, really helpful. I guess the question would be, you seem like you said that non-interest bearing deposits ticked down this quarter which is what you said, was in-line with expectations. So if we see December hike that mean we should count on a bit more run-off on the non-interest bearing side and maybe even on the interest bearing side as well?","Todd Gibbons","Brennan, it\u2019s Todd, good morning. Couple of comments there, number one just as a reminder on a year-over-year basis, last year is when we took the proactive actions around the deposits and we took them down about $20 billion to $25 billion of net fee, interest bearing as well as the non-interest bearing.","As far as the quarter itself we saw a little dip in the non-interest bearing most of that took place in the month when there is relatively slow behavior and some of that recovered towards the end of the quarter. Our expectations is that we would continue to see moderate run-off in non-interest bearing especially if we see further rate increases and just to give you a sense of it, we went back and we looked historically. Non-interest bearing have averaged historically and much higher tax and much higher interest rate environments around 30% in our total deposits and are around 33 now. So if it retraces historical behaviors that seem to make sense to us. We could expect modest further decline.","Brennan Hawken","That\u2019s great, and that\u2019s very helpful historical context thanks for that Todd. And then, on the interest bearing side it looks like beta has increased probably about what most would have expected. What do you see in the marketplace, what are your expectations for betas if we do end up getting another rate hike, how is the competition for deposits out there in the market? Thanks a lot?","Todd Gibbons","Well, the betas did tick up a little bit and we had pretty much forecasted that on the interest bearing side as well and we would expect with each future rate increase that you will see an increase in the betas. I don\u2019t think competition has really changed too much but our expectation and what we forecasted as we gave you guidance around the net interest income for the full year is that we will see if there is another move, we will see more or higher beta with that move.","Brennan Hawken","Okay, great. Thanks for all the color.","Todd Gibbons","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","Great. Hi, good morning everybody. So Charlie, maybe I\u2019ll try this one and thanks for all the color and initial thoughts around the business. But BK is obviously a bit different and unique versus your peers just given kind of the diversity of the business. So taking a step as you look across everything that the firm does, what businesses do you think and deliver the most needle moving kind of organic growth going forward relative to exertion time in the past and understand it\u2019s too early, but given your name a lot of things \u2013 get a sense of kind of where they come out, anything?","Charles Scharf","I don\u2019t think I\u2019m just saying much more at this point then I said in the prepared remarks, I think if there were things that we were doing which we were particularly concerned about or didn't think had same kind of profile that we would want going forward at this point I think we would have said something about it. And so, as I said in the remarks we are spending a fair amount of time going to our planning process. The assumption is that we should \u2013 that we are in a position to grow the businesses that we have today. What those look like relatively to each other honestly I think that's something which we will look forward to sharing more about when we get together for our Investor Day.","Alex Blostein","Got it. Fair enough. And just the follow-up for Todd there has been some consolidation in the book at your space some firms going self-clearing recently maybe there will be more but help us understand I guess kind of how that impacts the clearing revenues for you guys and kind of any more explicit guidance would be helpful there.","Todd Gibbons","Sure. I think that's probably better for Brian Shea to take.","Brian Shea","Sure. Happy to take it. I think the headwind in the broker-dealer market in general is that there has been consolidation in the broker dealer market and pressure on the broker dealer revenue and business model as a result of the DOL fiduciary standard. We actually there maybe some firms going self-clearing but we actually see the opposite. We see more firms actually considering lowering the structural cost, lowering the capital investor and actually outsourcing their clearing. We actually converted a pretty meaningful side self-clearing firm, platform in the third quarter and we have a pipeline of few others that we are in discussions with which I can't tell for sure how it will turn out but it shows a higher level of interest in self-clearing actually lowering and verbalizing their cost. So the market overall is convincing. But we are actually holding our own and gaining share and growing into a little bit smaller market. The other big dynamic which is accelerated by DOL but it's a long term secular trend is that there has been a shift from the traditional brokerage model to an advisory model and we are growing our RIA custody business pretty significantly as it had double-digit growth and continues to have double-digit growth on a consistent basis. So we are seeing more of the growth in adviser model that's offsetting some of the pressure in the broker-dealer model.","Alex Blostein","Got it. Thank you both.","Charles Scharf","Thanks Alex.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.","Glenn Schorr","Hi, thanks. Question on issuer services. So down 15% you mentioned three things in the text of pure corporate actions, loss to business and the ERP, so the part we totally get the corporate actions we get. I wonder if you could explain a little bit on the loss business and just maybe bigger picture think about the linkage or should there be a linkage to big banks who had head great debt underwriting quarters and years past that would be great for banking yard as a service, Scharf us you can help us package there?","Charles Scharf","So Glenn just for clarity the issuer service line actually contains two of our businesses; one is the depository receipt business and the other is the corporate trust business. So as we noted DR was down 34% that's the entire in fact it's more than the entire decline in that line. The corporate trust business actual saw an uptake in revenues. And I will let Brian get some of the \u2013 if there is any detail he want to add to that Brian.","Brian Shea","No I think you have most of it. I think the single biggest driver of the decline in DR was fewer corporate actions which are episodic and spiky and they always have been. The loss clients were probably the second largest factor and they were really two large clients one really pricing and the other pricing is sort of a model driven and we have been trying really hard to maintain our pricing discipline deliver a solid margins in that business so that's reality so that\u2019s going to be in our run rate for little while longer but and the other stuff was really more lower shares outstanding and slightly lower transaction volumes which is more secular we think than secular but you know it all depends on the market forces.","But in terms of new business in DRs the issuance market is a little bit better than it was last year and although it's not softy and we are still gaining and wining more than our fair share while maintaining our pricing discipline so we are still the market leader I signing the new clients opportunities when they come to the market. And we are encouraged as Todd said by the corporate trust fee turnaround we had fee growth and corporate trust sequentially end year-over-year and so that's a good sign in terms of the longer term picture for issuer services.","Glenn Schorr","I appreciate that one. Little quick follow-up in investment management, apologizes if I missed it but average deposit is down call it 20% quarter-on-quarter \u201cyear-on-year\u201d?","Todd Gibbons","Yes Glenn there is one large client attributed to almost all of that move in the quarter. It was not unexpected for us, it was the repatriated funds for their own reasons. So we don't necessarily see that as a trend, I mean there is a trend that it's declining a little bit but not to that extent.","Glenn Schorr","Got it, okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Thanks very much. Good morning folks. Charlie also thanks very much for the run through of the businesses that was really helpful. Maybe just your view on you mentioned little bit, maybe your view on that platform obviously back in your \u2013 sort of needed differentiated move in that effort versus some peers and obviously, we all have been moving towards digitized platform but maybe just your perspective on how you see that differentiated versus peers whether do you think that was the sort of the right architecture or you want to change anything in that architecture in a major way or just more like leveraging the power of that platform to grow revenues?","Charles Scharf","Yes, I guess first time you start just by broadening the topic a little bit which is just because I have spent a bunch of time going to the historical context not just of NEXEN but our entire technology investment. And I just think it's, I have mentioned this in my remarks we spend over $2 billion on technology. If you look at the resources that Bank of New York Mellon has dedicated to technology both core infrastructure as well as the different technologies that we are looking at towards the future that's been aided by the in-sourcing of a tremendous numbers of people meeting thousands of people over the past three or four years. Our net resources are up in the technology space and those resources are in multiple locations across the world with different sets of talents focusing on a whole range of things.","So the focus on technology has been it's been deep and it's been broad at the company. So I hope what you took away from my remarks is that the focus that we all continue to have is to focus on both pieces and to continue to dedicate this outside the demand of our resources to the technology space. Specifically for the things that we described as NEXEN again in my prepared remarks I did go through the specific pieces, because I obviously just struggled talking very generically about NEXEN in its entirety. It\u2019s important is when you look at the individual pieces absolutely those are things that we are doing which will help us do a better job not just providing service for clients but it will enable us to move much more quickly in the marketplace, allow them to access additional capabilities that we are developing or third parties are developing in a way which it looks across the company at a common architectural solution. So it's kind of hard to look at that and say that that's anything other than something that makes sense.","The work that we are continuing to do is the work that's been ongoing which is to consistently to build [indiscernible] and ask the question are we putting all the resources in the right place, are we prioritizing things and that's ongoing work that we will do. So again I put this in the category of directionally absolutely supportive of everything that's been done, absolutely we believe that technology has to be a differentiator as time goes forward and we will talk more about it again when we get together in March.","Brian Bedell","Great. That's great color and then maybe just on your comments on improving operating performance. Banking has already been in the last three years scenario, the best achiever in terms of improving that performance from legacy banking [indiscernible] peers it's certainly an expense reduction. I guess I always have thought about how much there to go and I know Todd you have been fairly bullish on continued opportunity given that we had a lot of low hang fruit already so maybe you can talk about Charlie, you mentioned some more platform consolidation maybe you can talk about which platform and then continue the automation maybe just a little bit more color on your comments about investing you may or may not invest in more growth opportunities?","Todd Gibbons","No I didn't question whether we are going to invest in growth opportunities. What my remarks meant to say is as we find more efficiencies in the company the question is whether we will take those additional efficiencies and invest them or not. So we are investing a tremendous amount in the business today. That's going to continue. What I was trying to point out there was as we figure out how to become more efficient overtime that creates additional capacity for us. So that just want to make sure we are clear about that.","Listen I think when you look at the results that we have delivered over how much you have, I look back I guess going back to 2013 I don't know if it goes to back prior to that but the expense control that's taken place within the company is extraordinary in an environment where we are spending substantially more in technology, substantially more on regulatory requirements and kind of reasoning up the investments that have to take place to build the business. And so that's a lot of money that gets spent on those things and so yeah there has been a tremendous effort to reduce the things that don't make as much sense to free up capacity to spend money on those things.","Having said that I think that I put it to maybe two different categories, number one is there is always more efficiencies that we had in any company even the most efficient companies lock in the next day and say okay how are we going to get more efficient at what we do separately from volumes growing and additional money to invest. So I think that's just even if were the best in class at everything that we did we would say that's what we would come in and strive as we go through our planning process and forecasting process to push ourselves. I did go through some specifics in my remarks which would suggest that I do think that there are still a series of things that will allow us to create more efficiencies that will then create decision point for us about whether to invest in additional things or to do some other things with that and it relates to just basic locking and tackling of reducing some of the process and bureaucracy and the layers that exist within companies like these and the more you do the more exposure you get to the next level of things.","So I think it's a very natural progression from what's been done but you also mentioned something which really should be much more substantial which will take which is a multi-year project which is to figure out how we take \u2013 I want to say we have a tremendous amount of manual processes around the company. We have 52 or some odd thousands people I think we all believe that given the tools that are available today we can create more automation which will not just reduce the expense base that we can then figure out what to do with it but it will also improves the quality of our results. So part of the effort that we have got going on and we are going deep on is what does that multi-year effort look like what does it take for us to get from here to there over what period of time. It's not a one quarter one year exercise but it's something that we want to build into the long term plans and we know the opportunities are there, we just don't know the specifics yet.","Brian Bedell","Very good. That's fantastic. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","So I wanted to just dig in on two things, one Charlie you came from Visa global payments consumer but also have some corporate elements to it. You are here at BNY Mellon which has a part of the business is global payments, institutional investor, corporate governance. What are some of the similarities there that may have interested you in this and what are some of the opportunities on the payment side that you can speak to?","Charles Scharf","Sure. So let's just start with the basics first which is when you look at our client base across the globe, huge part of the client base are common clients that someone like these would have so just as I walk in the door in terms of understanding who your client base is how they think about things, what the priorities are and just who the individuals are there is a high degree of commonality there. When we look at the opportunities that we have here we see a tremendous amount of flows both on the security side as well as on the cash side. Figuring out how you can do that as efficiently as you can and then continue to add value added services around it with both additional capabilities but also capabilities focused on data and analytics it's exactly the way these are things about its business.","These honestly has a leg up because there is step ahead in terms of automation because that's just the way the business was originally built so we have got a lot of work to do here to put us in the position to be able to not just get those efficiencies but to create everything on a common platform in a way where it\u2019s digital where you can do something with it. So the things that we can do with that are very, very interesting and in here too there is a lot that we are starting to do with it whether it's in our collateral management business where we are using the information that we have to do a better job for clients they get elsewhere because of the things that we see in the marketplace and the work that we can do to help them reduce their funding cost and reduce their capital requirements but just the opportunities to think more broadly about it is pretty extensive. And payments honestly, I have actually spent less time on our payment franchise here than I have on our asset servicing businesses or corporate trust businesses, the market business etc. etc. So not, I just, I choose to defer that a little bit until the next quarter that's okay.","Betsy Graseck","I get that. And just the follow-up is on how you think about the competition that you face from new entrants perspective in particular I am sure, the block chain to be -- alive and well and lots proof of concepts but no golden ticket yet. That said there is several POCs that are getting a lot of attention like the ASX platform done in Australia so wondered what your thoughts are on block chain as a threat versus block chain as a solution for that you could leverage?","Charles Scharf","Yes, I think my point of view is the same as the company here has had which is block chain is very real. But like any new technology it has to solve a problem in order for it to make a meaningful difference. When I was at Visa people used to talk about all of those things that are going to do something to change the payment experience at the point of sale and there is all this talk about mobile and all these other things and everyone sits and wonders why mobile phones haven't dominated the payment space in the developed part of the world and the reality is because what exist today works. Same thing relative to the network infrastructure versus the block chain structure, it's effectively real time. There is real global inter-connectivity with the high degree of transparency where it's required so not that it won't have impact overtime but that's not where those solutions should initially go. There are other places where your processes they are highly inefficient or and there is very little lack of transparency or there is resiliency issues that these things can solve.","So as we think about our business we do have a fair amount of work going on inside the company that focus on block chain specifically we actually have a solution built, which I am sure Brian and Todd talk about in more detail in our government security clearance business where we are really using it as we have built it as a treasury back up so that we would both understand the technology but also potentially be in the position to expose it to the fed as well as our clients at a point in time that we are comfortable with it but the idea is that distributor ledger would be available with all the relevant information for the relevant counter parties if we had issues elsewhere.","So I think just on something like that though in order for us to actually move it from treasury into some kind of production environment forget about all the testing and all the things that you need to do to be comfortable to platform just have to believe that it's a better solution than what you have today and not just better for us but better for client. So as we look across the business that's the way we are thinking about it and our view is as I said it's real but all these solutions as you do as you know do need trusted counter parties that is what we do for living in addition to providing the technology that we provide and the only thing I would emphasis is that when you think about what we do in all of our businesses each little service we provide is not something that standalone which is very easily disaggregated. When we provide core custody with clients that gives us the opportunity to do a series of things which we call part of assets servicing but there are series of other services that we provide there. When you have the securities it puts you in a position to talk about collateral and cash and all those things and so the ability to show up as a firm with the reputation and the relationships like us and provide those solutions not that we have heading the sand, but those are \u2013 those integrated relationships mean a lot and again what we do is generally \u2013 it is mission critical for our clients. So it's not a light thing for them not just to switch between material providers but to think about going to something by a much smaller third-party who they don't really know stand behind us.","Betsy Graseck","Okay now that's helpful color. Just last quick question on the expense ratio side. You are indicating lots of opportunity to improve efficiencies. Do you feel like the current pace that BK has been able to generate sustainable or you need to invest a little bit up front to get a much larger expense reduction in the future. What's your sense and cadence there?","Charles Scharf","Again, I think we will stay away from any kind of forecasting and stuff like that until we finish going through the detailed plans and that's obviously something we will talk about.","Betsy Graseck","Alright great. Hey thanks so much Charlie.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Thanks good morning. Can I ask about the asset servicing business, it's nice to see the year-over-year growth rate up to 4% obviously helped by the newest 6% growth in the AAC and A but I am just wondering can you break up the components a little bit and just talk about how core servicing is growing versus collateral versus the broker-dealer and help us understand kind of those how three parts are trajecting underneath?","Brian Shea","Yes it's Brian, happy to take it. I mean I think it's a combination of all those factors, we are getting some growth from the collateral management for sure. We are getting some core underline growth, we are getting some lists from the market and all those things are contributing to few revenue growth and we are also still pruning some businesses which is pushing revenue out where we don't think it's appropriate for example we are working through the final stages of the UK retail TA re-positioning which is otherwise lowering the few revenue growth but improving the operating margins and profitability.","Charles Scharf","This is Charlie, the other thing I want to add is in my remarks I did talk \u2013 I did break out that our asset servicing revenues meaning our assets servicing revenue in the business grew 4% X clear which is 10%.","Ken Usdin","I am talking about specifically the investor services. So when we go forward then to your point Brian about the bar \u2013 as the UK transfer agency is that that effect now past and can you also remind us when the J.P. Morgan brokerage revenue start \u2013 clearing revenue start to come in to that line.","Brian Shea","Yes. So, the UK retail transfer is the process it is almost completed by the end of the year. It's actually completed and then the revenue run rate will stabilize and of course we are still committed to the institutional and global TA business in UK and Europe and so that a growing opportunity for us and we are actually getting new clients in that sense. From a broker-dealer clearing perspective we are \u2013 we have invested heavily in the tripartite report reform and technology and again we've re-platform our entire client base to a new state-of-the-art broker-dealer clearing platform and that positioned us well to bring on new clients. So we have begun the transitions of the former J.P. Morgan government clearing and tripartite reform clients. We have started with the smaller clients but we have already converted about seven of those clients so far this year and we have more to review this year and we will be completing those conversions throughout the course of 2018.","In addition we've on-boarded some new entrance from the marketplace and we continue to add new clients. So we see the broker-dealer clearing and domestic and global collateral services business as a core growth driver over the next couple of years. ","Ken Usdin","Okay, got it. And then just one quick one Todd you mentioned no need to do the preferred given the potential for SLR reform just wondering does that also mean that you won't do the contingent share repurchase at least in this C-cars you did mention obviously the ability to go do more in future C-cars but can you just kind of level set some what you are thinking about that and the potential for the reform?","Todd Gibbons","Yes Ken I can \u2013 that is exactly the point. So that authorization was contingent on additional issuance. We didn't think it would make sense for us to issue and then actually not need that form of tier 1 capital a year from now. And just put us in a better position to do just pure buybacks next year and beyond. So that's our thinking there.","Ken Usdin","Thanks a lot. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America.","Michael Carrier","Thanks guys. Hey Todd just one on the balance sheet and capital, bit of growth on this quarter, heading on the non-interest-bearing side deposits were relatively steady. So just wanted to get a sense you guys are active on a buyback side capital ratios are fine. Just in terms of the balance sheet when you are seeing client demand it seems on the deposit side we could continue to see that roll off. But any demand out there that we could actually see the balance sheet grow or should we expect it to be in this range?","Todd Gibbons","Yes I think it's kind of into -- it's all into, about a normalized range and we would see it grow as we see the businesses grow but probably in line and maybe a little less than in line with fee revenue growth, just for the balance sheet side itself. And one of the other things that we did is we did reduce some of our loan outstanding, some of those loans that were a little less productive than we wanted to and we actually will use that portion of the balance sheet to try to generate some more productive loan. So we do have a little bit of a \u2013 we certainly have room for growth and if the growth doesn't come we are going to have excess capital.","Michael Carrier","Okay, thanks and then a quick follow-up on [indiscernible] just wanted to get a sense on again the impact from asset management but then I guess probably more importantly just given that a lot of your clients are going to through that process are you seeing one much push back from like pricing and concessions has their businesses under more pressure I mean and then two, any services that you guys can offer to either help you manage some of these regulatory changes for the clients?","Todd Gibbons","So Mike you are asking from a servicing perspective, so I think Brian would probably be best to handle it.","Brian Shea","Sure. We have a whole cross enterprise team including investment services, investment management working on not only helping ourselves comply, but helping our clients comply with it too. I think depending on the asset manager there is no question that -- puts pressure not only the cost to compliance but some pressure on the business model in terms of the elimination of soft dollar commission-based research. So with that depending on the fund company that has more or less impact on their margins. I think, so that does put some pressure on the core fees and core cost structure for asset managers. I wouldn't say that we - there is always some pressure on the core and what we are trying to do is extend the solutions of creating the source of new revenue. A great example would be we have a growing pipeline of middle office solution clients and that's because asset managers is increasing lower their structural cost whereby is a cost structure and focus more of the time in energy and the investment process and to Charlie's point about NEXEN, the ability to have a platform that can easily integrate third-party solutions which help asset managers and other clients reduce the amount of time and energy investment they make on vendor management, data integration, vendor integration is also helpful in terms of helping them lower their structural cost and in connection with [MISIT] and other pressures that are secular trends in the asset manager model, that's what I would say and if [indiscernible] wants to add.","Unidentified Company Speaker","Yes, for just our own asset management perspective well we clearly have to absorb research costs and that's a headwind we actually see it as an opportunity since we all are under the largest global financial institutions both from an asset management and servicing perspective it gives us an opportunity to do more proprietary research rather than rely on the street. So I see it actually as positive. It's the transaction side that I think, Brian is also referring to which is an issues. We have to have more transparency and I think that's an opportunity on the servicing side.","Michael Carrier","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.","Mike Mayo","Hi, I thoroughly heard your comments saying that you would like to have the company accelerate revenue growth and I guess it's a lot tougher than these are, maybe, the revenue opportunities overall more specifically any thoughts on change in the mix from the servicing fixed income assets since BNY Mellon has higher percentage of fixed income firstly. Second would be acquisition in on US?","Todd Gibbons","Let me do the value, piece of the question. So on the first piece I mean the profile of the Visa businesses is it's versus what we do is it's different right I mean VISA is business where there is this continued secular movement from physical cash to electronic payments so you come in the morning and you got that to give you a tailwind as well as changes in GDP and many of you have got the question of what you doing to take your fair share not just from the other big competitors but all -- from all the other payment mechanisms that exist out here.","In our business you know we don't have that material secular shift. We do partake in the change in GDP and change in market level across most of our businesses but ultimately you know the real differentiator has to be are you going to be continue to provide increasing value to your clients and so that's the focus here, that was the focus there just come in and sit in which is kind of watch the cash register ring it's coming everyday and ask the question of how can you do more that's better, and you know the differences are in terms of growth rates just are what they are. You know I did say in my remarks I think you know there is a -- let me start with we do have areas that have in I am not sure the right word is I use the word reasonable you can call it good, we don't call it great but it's not bad just in terms the revenue growth that we are seeing.","Part of it's the market, part of it's the things that we are doing. I don't think I've been, put DR's aside for second because again I think that is there are material changes and things that drive that business better somewhere out of our control as you see into this quarter. Know the other businesses we believe there are things that we can continue to do to increase the rate of revenue growth but you know as well as I that you know not just this is a big company and it takes time to move a big company but the things that we do generally have longer lead times on it. They are longer at discussions. They can be RFPs. They can be things that you work on for a year or two or three or more.","So again I think when we spend more time together in March I think it's time for layout where we see those opportunities and how they can look somewhat different than they've looked in the past but again I want to emphasize that we are not exactly starting from scratch here. We are starting from a fair amount of momentum.","M&A I think first of all our, we come in every day and ask the question how do we grow this business and invest in what we do and so to the extent that there are things that add value to the core of the franchise those are things that we've always looked at, we will always continue to look at and right now that's the focus that we continue to have. And US, non-US the majority of the businesses US have spent a little time in Europe, I\u2019m going back, she is going back tonight and then through the Middle East and you know we have - I think we continue to have as big as an opportunity there as we have in any part of the world. We have got core global capabilities that are as good as anyone. We are very focused on using our structure that we are lucky enough to have were we have a meaningful presence in the UK and a meaningful presence on the continent to do the best job that we can and feeling as local as we possibly can and so as we look forward hopefully that will be something which we will talk more about. Did I answer everything Mike?","Mike Mayo","Yes. That was good.","Operator","And next question comes from the line of Geoff Elliott with Autonomous Research.","Geoff Elliott","Hello good morning. Thank you for taking the question. You touched on ETF as a shortcoming and I guess you said how you address that as a topic for another day but could you elaborate a little bit on how the -- from lack of a big ETF platform is kind of holding you back, where has that been a disadvantage for the business, which businesses in particular?","Charles Scharf","Yes. So I guess let me just start and then Mitchell and Brian and Todd can pipe in. I mean I think at the point of the comment that I made was, just the fact of life which is we do not have a sizable ETF business. My comment was specifically around the flows that people see not around the proper profile of our business necessarily or anything else like that. So just when you look at our flows versus others you're not going to see the same kind of low growth that we see elsewhere and we do have the same issue in the asset servicing side where you know our competitor has a much more sizable business themselves but some other business that they have out there as well.","So that is a fact of life that we have to deal with on the asset management side it's frankly I think it's more complex issue than it is on the asset servicing side because on the asset servicing side it's not as if we are not in the business. It's not as if we don't have to continue to build capabilities over period of time and that's kind of on us to do it. The asset management question is much more broader strategic question which is -- but so what. It's okay we are where we are we do remind everyone I think [indiscernible] in general not ETS but in passes but the question is what does that ultimately mean for your business, what's the future of the actives versus passives and we have a point of you on here that we had on that, that's also something I think we should talk in more detail about in March. Anything you guys want to -","Todd Gibbons","No I think you covered it really well. The Vanguard Blackrock own that business so it's not like anybody else is getting into it in reality but we do service ETF's both on even from an asset management we supply some of the intellectual content to some of the ETF providers and in addition to that we are in smart beta, we are in indexing, we are in the other elements of assets that are also growing and that's what we will continue to do.","Charles Scharf","And I will just add that while the ETF market is concentrated in a few top providers which drive most of the flow there are more providers coming in. They are not massive yet but we are focused on servicing them and we're trying to deliver enterprise solutions so it combines ETS servicing, the authorized participant services which we provide from markets. We have the purging no transaction fee ETF platform that's a differentiator in terms of asset guys. So we have a more sort of holistic solution strategy that we hope will create some momentum in the marketplace and then lastly I would say that will the ETF business in the U.S. is pretty well developed, in Europe and in Asia there's really good development opportunities over time and I think we are positioning ourselves to capture more of that going forward.","Mike Mayo","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning. Todd you touched on the SLR issue not issuing the [indiscernible] because the changes that could be coming in and the benefits that Bank of New York would seek aside from better positioning you for maybe stock repurchase if the SLR calculations are changed are there any other strategies you would use to lower the SLR ratio whether that's a re-levering and the balance sheet whether the types of assets or something else?","Todd Gibbons","Yes. If you look at our capital ratios and what our internal targets are and why they are internal targets are established to make sure they're adequate both for BAU and also through stress testing. They are pretty well-balanced. So anything that we would grow would have to - we would be happy to grow it if it will achieve our targeted returns on capital. Otherwise the best use of that capital if we can't achieve the targeted returns is to do buybacks or paid it out it in the form of dividends. So that's the discipline that we've applied and right my point here is that we are pretty balanced. There is no one ratio I mean the SLR would give us a little bit of relief in kind of BAU but there is no one real ratio that is becoming a major constraint, I kind of like how balanced we are across the capital stack.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good and then a follow-up question on the [indiscernible] issue that will be coming to head here in January maybe this is for Mitchell, you talked about how you could build out your internal research proprietary research and reduce the cost of the research that you pay for from the street. I know technically the SEC rules don't allow us in the U.S. to sell research like it was going to be the case in Europe. Can you clear with us Mitchell any strategies you can implement out to get the leverage to lower your research costs from the US-based providers of US research?","Brian Shea","Well, I think there is a couple I mean we are multi-boutique model but the more we coordinate some of our trading activities we could clearly drive down our costs of research. Secondly it's kind of an intriguing one to me because we are kind of lazy we take a lot of research from a lot of brokers sometimes up to 50 different ones and do we really need it where we are talking soft dollars because they were free. It's creating a just a much stronger discipline and as such a large asset manager with so much data available to us we really should be doing around.","So in many respects I don't see it being a significant cost, but I genuinely believe it's an opportunity that data we have in this organization is unbelievable and we don't leverage it where we use the street instead. So I think it inverts things in actually a positive way for large asset managers. I think it's and that's the other thing smaller asset managers are going to pay the price. The large ones, the big ones have an opportunity here. So it again I think is going to concentrate opportunity in the top few asset managers.","Gerard Cassidy","Appreciate the color. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instruction] We will take our final question from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Great, good morning. First question was on investment management you called out there outflows in the LDR businesses quarter but I think it was also in the fourth quarter that there was LDR outflows and there was a laid out so it's in-housing of the LDR is that an ongoing risk is it an increasing risk as rates are increasing?","Brian Shea","No, we don't see it as a \u2013 it's Mitchell, we don't see it as risk. When you look at the average of outflows in the LDI business we do have one or two or maybe three extremely large LDI clients that actually naturally should take it in-house. They are just incredibly dominated. You are talking over 5 billion in assets. So it's not a trend that you're seeing it at all. If you look at our average w are averaging about 9 billion a quarter in positive flows that slightly better than 2016. It's better than 15 and then it\u2019s better than 14. So the trend has been actually quite consistent at 7-8-9 billion for the last few three years. We don't see that trend changing. We see \u2013 we still see significant opportunity.","Todd Gibbons","And I should just point out that the kind of state the obvious which is the types of accounts that Michelle's referring to, whether big enough to take it in-house. The fee profile is very different than \u2013","Brian Shea","It's extremely low.","Todd Gibbons","It's extremely low.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. Great and then the second one is on the margin I mean this quarter, you had liability sensitive and you had three rating increases since the end of 16, we get the margins relatively flat I mean do you have \u2013 get that the margin expanding again from here either or on the liability side?","Brian Shea","Yes. I am talking about the net interest margin. It has expanded a few basis points so over the course of the year we would expect it to continue to improve modestly. So the answer is yes.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. Thanks.","Valerie Haertel","I think that ends the session for today. If you have any questions please feel free to call me. (212) 635-8529.

Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, January 19, 2017 and we will not update forward-looking statements.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Gerald Hassell. Gerald?","Gerald Hassell","Thanks, Valerie, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2016 performance. Our fourth quarter results cap off another solid year. Our financial performance reflects our focus on executing on our strategic priorities, the benefits of our well-diversified low-risk business model, and our ability to create value through all environments. ","Importantly, we continue to prioritize improving the client experience, delivering value today while investing in our people, capabilities and technology to deliver even more in the future. ","For the full year on an adjusted basis, earnings per share was up 11%. Total revenue was up slightly, while total expense was down 3% resulting in nearly 300 basis points of positive operating leverage. Net interest revenue was up 4%. We improved our pre-tax operating margin to 33% and our return on tangible common equity was 21%. So we remain on track to achieve or exceed the three year goals we set forth in late 2014. ","Turning to the fourth quarter, on an adjusted basis, we earned $0.77 per share, up 13% year-over-year. For the quarter, total revenue was up 2%. Total expense was down 2% and we generated approximately 350 basis points of positive operating leverage, mainly driven by higher investment services fees and the successful execution of our business improvement process and our return on tangible common equity was 21%. ","Now let me update you on our progress against some of our key strategic priorities during 2016. Our top priority is enhancing the client experience and driving profitable revenue growth. During 2016, we made progress on a number of fronts. We continued to enhance and introduce distinctive new capabilities where we see long-term growth opportunities. ","In investment services, we are investing in collateral optimization technology, derivatives margin solutions, liquidity services, middle-office outsourcing for asset managers and institutional asset owners, and servicing for real estate and private equity fund managers. We are also investing in ETF servicing to capitalize on the trend of retail investors, increasing allocations to passive investment strategies. ","We believe it is a trend that will likely increase post the implementation on the DOL fiduciary rule. We are also increasing investment in our Pershing Advisory Solutions platform for RIAs delivering an integrated bank and brokerage custody service, as well as private banking capabilities to RIAs, a segment which we also expect to grow more rapidly.","Our next-generation ecosystem NEXEN is proving to be a value-added marketplace differentiator. NEXEN will make it easier for clients to access a broad range of solutions from BNY Mellon through a single gateway, delivering a better client experience and driving future growth. ","While our investment management\u2019s results were a bit soft in the quarter primarily due to our exposure to the fixed income markets and the strength of the US dollar, we are encouraged by the progress we\u2019ve made on a number of fronts. In 2016, investment management continue to make progress against its strategic priority of repositioning its business, to focus on key products, performance and operational and technology efficiencies to deliver profitable revenue.","We are concentrating on our high-value active strategies. Part of this effort involves increasing our alternative solutions to meet the demands from clients and flows remains positive in this growing asset class. The number of businesses are attracting new flows including Alcentra's success in expanding its private debt offering and Insights continued momentum in growing their absolute return capability. ","In each of our areas of focus, we\u2019ve established competitive advantages that position us to capitalize on industry trends. In some cases, we are already seeing a positive impact on our earnings from our focused investments. In terms of investment performance, on a peer-relative basis, and against benchmarks, we continue to deliver strong, medium, and long-term performance in our top strategies.","Our effort to increase our exposure to individual investors is also paying off. Wealth management has sustained a multi-year trend of full year revenue and pre-tax earnings growth, the result of focusing on the high growth US markets, and on the ultra-high net worth segment. Our second priority is executing on our business improvement process. ","During 2016, we further reduced our real estate portfolio eliminating 400,000 rentable square footage in the fourth quarter and 700,000 rentable square feet for the full year. ","We drove down vendor expense and eliminated unnecessary demand and spending in areas such as market data and internal travel. We increased the deployment of robotics with more than 150 bots now in production. We reduced by 10 the number of locations where our client service delivery teams operate. We advanced our global location strategy which has improved our reliability and resiliency for reducing cost and risk. ","We reduced manual corporate actions processes by 14 percentage points to 16 percent at a total volume in 2016, thus improving straight-through processing rates, quality and the client experience now reducing operational allowances. We closed several non-strategic low-performing businesses and we advanced our technology efforts on many fronts including substantially completing the move to one custody platform in the US and harnessing robotics and machine learning to reduce costs and free up staffs to focus on higher value activities. ","And during the fourth quarter, we completed 100% of the client conversions of our new broker\/dealer clearing platform. This new state-of-the-art government\u2019s clearing platform will enable us to serve the market well and grow responsibly. And we have a full pipeline of initiatives to drive continuous process improvement forward enabling us to offset regulatory change costs, invest in growth and delivering value to shareholders. We are encouraged by our progress and we continue to find opportunities for further improvement across all of our activities. ","Our third priority centers on being a strong, safe, trusted counterparty. During 2016, we invested in and focused on compliance, risk management and control functions, made significant investments in our resolution recovery plan, which included submitting an updated resolution plan that adequately address the deficiencies of the federal reserve and FDIC had previously identified in our 2015 submission. ","We further rationalized our credit exposure to certain financial institutions and sovereigns, strengthened our risk identifications in operational risk control processes, delivered key new capabilities in cyber security and enhanced our capital adequacy process. ","Our fourth priority involves generating excess capital and deploying it effectively. We remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and follow with a strong capital and liquidity position while returning value to our shareholders. ","From a regulatory ratio standpoint, our supplemental leverage ratio now exceeds the fully phased in requirement. During the quarter, we repurchased $848 million in shares and we distributed $203 million in dividend. For the full year, we have repurchased approximately $2.4 billion in shares and distributed nearly $780 million in common dividends. ","And for the year, on a gross basis, we\u2019ve repurchased more than 5% of our shares outstanding and have repurchased more than 19% of our shares over the last five years. Our fifth priority is attracting, developing and retaining top talent. People are our ultimate competitive advantage. During 2016, we continued to strengthen our team by adding key leaders with valuable experience and outside perspectives while focusing on providing more growth opportunities for diverse talent within our company. ","In December, we welcomed two new independent board members, Linda Cook, Managing Director of EIG Energy Partners and a Former Senior Executive of Royal Dutch Shell. And Jennifer Morgan who is President of SAP North America. Linda\u2019s distinguished international career as a senior executive in the energy industry and Jennifer\u2019s leadership in client experience in the technology sector will provide valuable insights to our global businesses. ","Half of our directors have joined in the last three years evidence of our focus on bringing in outside perspectives to supplement the expertise of our existing Board Members. We have also made two significant leadership hires, Jeff McCarthy has joined us in the newly created role of CEO for Exchange Traded Funds. ","Jeff came from NASDAQ where he was Head of Exchange Traded Product Listing and Trading. We are bullish on the ETF Administration business and think the DOL standards will only accelerate its growth. Jeff\u2019s experience strengthens our very capable management team that is highly focused on executing for our clients and accelerating our growth. ","Geoff Massam has joined as Chief Administrative Officer for Client Technology Solutions, our technology group. Geoff has a long career in financial technology, having been a Chief Information Officer for Capital Markets at Deutsche Bank and CIO of Fixed Income IT at Merrill Lynch, as well as a tech industry start-up entrepreneur. So we see him playing a key role in advancing our digital strategy.","So in summary, another strong quarter of financial performance as we continue to further develop our high-performance client-centric culture. By executing on our priorities, we are showing a pretty consistent ability to manage what we can control through all environments. Now this is a New Year. So once again we look forward to continuing to demonstrate our ability to deliver for our valued clients, and our shareholders. ","With that, let me turn it over to Todd. ","Thomas Gibbons","Thanks, Gerald and good morning everybody. Our results demonstrate that we are continuing to execute our strategy and it\u2019s working. When you look at our results for the quarter there are few things that I think stand out. First of all, we experienced growth in all investment service business lines with fees up 4% in aggregate. ","Secondly, NIR grew nicely, third, performance fees and investment management were little softer than expected and that\u2019s reflecting our conservative positioning into the US election and finally, we generated significant year-over-year positive operating leverage of approximately 350 basis points. ","As we noted in prior quarters, the strength of the dollar continues to impact results, it\u2019s negatively to revenue and it\u2019s positive for expenses. However the net impact from currency translation continues to be minimal to our consolidated pretax line. ","Turning to the financial highlights document, and I\u2019ll continue my commentary on slide 4 which gives an overview of our non-GAAP for the operating results for the quarter. Our fourth quarter earnings per share were $0.77 that\u2019s 13% higher than the year ago quarter. On a year-over-year basis, our fourth quarter revenue was up 2%, expenses were down 2% and we generated 350 basis points of operating leverage. ","Income before taxes was up 9% year-over-year, also on a year-over-year basis, our adjusted pretax margin was up two percentage points to 32% and return on tangible common equity on an adjusted basis was nearly 21% for the quarter and that compares to 19% a year ago. ","Moving ahead to Slide 11, I\u2019ll discuss our consolidated fee and other revenue. Asset servicing fees were up 3% year-over-year and up slightly sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher money market fees, net new business from higher equity market values, that was partially offset by the impact of the stronger dollar, as well as the downsizing of our UK retail transfer agency business. ","Clearing services fees were up 5% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher money market fees.","Issuer service fees were up 6% year-over-year, that\u2019s primarily reflecting higher fees in depository receipts and higher money market fees in corporate trust. The sequential decrease of 37% reflects the typical fourth quarter seasonality we experienced in some depository receipts. ","Treasury services fees were up 2% year-over-year and sequentially and that\u2019s primarily due to higher payment volumes. That\u2019s a decent quarter for this business. As a reminder, as rates increase, some of our fee income shifts to net interest revenue. ","Fourth quarter investment management performance fees were down 2% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of the strong US dollar and that was principally driven by the weaker British pound, as well as lower performance fees and that was partially offset by higher market values and higher money market fees. ","The sequential decrease primarily reflects asset outflows, lower fixed income market values and money market fees that were partially offset by higher performance fees. The lower than expected performance fees resulted mainly from the positioning of our portfolios prior to the US elections. ","We were underweight sectors that rallied post-election, which led us to narrowly miss the high watermarks. The good news is we are currently close to the high watermarks now and as a result, we are positioned well to generate future performance fees. Importantly, we were able to keep our margin relatively stable as we continue to execute our strategy focusing on investment performance, aligning our products and solutions, working to optimize our distribution infrastructure and centralizing our business functions to reduce costs.","Now turning to foreign exchange and other revenue, FX and other trading revenue on a consolidated basis was down 7% year-over-year and 12% sequentially. FX revenue of $175 million was up 6% year-over-year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher volatility as well as higher sales and trading volumes. ","Other trading losses of $14 million compared with revenue of $8 million in both year ago and prior quarters. Both decreases primarily reflect the impact of interest rate hedging activities and those \u2013 the impact of those substantially offset in our net interest income. ","Financing-related fees of $50 million were down 2% versus the year ago quarter and 14% sequentially. The sequential decrease primarily reflects lower underwriting fees. Distribution and servicing fees were $41 million that\u2019s flat year-over-year and it\u2019s down 5% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects higher money market fees, while partially offset by fees paid to introducing brokers. ","Investment and other income of $70 million compared with $93 million in the year ago quarter and that\u2019s $92 million in the third quarter. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower other income related to termination fees that we received in our clearing business in the year ago quarter. This was partially offset by higher income from Corporate\/bank-owned life insurance. ","The year-over-year and sequential decreases in other income also reflect the impact of increased investments in renewable energy. Those investments generate losses in the other revenue category as those losses are more than offset by benefits recorded on the tax line. ","Slide 13 shows the drivers of our investment management business that have explained the underlying performance. Assets under management of $1.65 trillion was up 1% year-over-year, that\u2019s reflecting higher market values offset by the impact of the strong US dollar. ","Overall, active outflows reversed the recent five quarter inflow trend than the quarter down $10 billion. This was driven in part by one significant LDI mandate that was taken in-house by the client. Long-term outflows of $11 billion included outflows and liability-driven investments as I just mentioned, equity and fixed income strategies partially offset by inflows into our actively managed alternative investments. ","Outflows from index strategies were $1 billion, the lowest level in 2016 and we had $3 billion of short-term cash outflows. Excluding the loan loss provision, wealth management continued its multi-year trend of full year revenue and pre-tax earnings growth as we focused on high growth US markets. ","Additionally, our program to extend banking solutions to wealth clients through the Pershing channel continued to drive strong loan growth, up 17%. ","Turning to our investment services metrics on Slide 14. Assets under custody and administration at quarter end were $29.9 trillion, that\u2019s up 3% year-over-year. That reflects higher market values offset by the unfavorable impact of the stronger dollar. Linked quarter AUCA was down 2% and that\u2019s mainly driven by the dollar impact. ","We estimate total new assets under custody and administration wins were $141 billion in the third quarter. ","Looking at the other key investment services metrics, you will see deposits declined 3% sequentially and 7% year-over-year, and that reflects the impact of us proactively managing our balance sheet in the second half of the year. Lastly, tri-party repo balances grew a healthy 7%. ","Turning to net interest revenue on Slide 15, you will see that on a fully tax equivalent basis, NIR was up 9% versus the year ago quarter and 7% sequentially. The year-over-year NIR increase was largely driven by an increase in interest rates, partially offset by lower interest earning assets. ","Additionally, both increases reflect the positive impact of interest rate hedging activities, which positively impacted the quarter by approximately $25 million, substantially all this impact is offsetting foreign exchange and other trading revenue. NIR also benefited by approximately $15 million due to an amortization adjustment related to premiums for certain mortgage-backed securities. ","Effective October 1, we\u2019ve changed our accounting for the amortization of premiums on these mortgage-backed securities from the pre-payment method to the contractual method, which has become an industry standard and we believe is better aligned with our asset and liability management practices. ","Net interest margin for the quarter was 117 basis points, that\u2019s 18 basis points better than the year ago quarter, and 11 better than the third quarter. The NIM was positively impacted by the five basis points related to the interest rate hedging activity and the premium amortization adjustment. ","Turning to Slide 16, you will see the non-interest expense on an adjusted basis declined 2% year-over-year and was flat sequentially. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects lower staff expense and M&I litigation and restructuring charges that were partially offset by higher other and software and equipment expenses. ","The decrease in staff expense year-over-year is primarily due to the favorable dollar, as well as lower employee benefits and severance expenses. The increase in other expense primarily reflects the adjustments to bank assessment charges that were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. ","The sequential decrease primarily reflects lower staff expense and M&I litigation and restructuring charges and that was partially offset by higher professional, legal and other purchased services that\u2019s driven by the CCAR resolution planning, as well as higher software and equipment and business development expenses. The decrease in staff expense was primarily due to lower incentives and lower severance expenses. ","As a reminder, we run the cost associated with our business improvement process through our operating P&L on a quarterly basis, this quarter was no different. We absorbed the cost of additional actions in the fourth quarter which should continue to benefit us going forward.","Turning to page \u2013 to capture on Slide 17, the standardized ratios and those are the ones that are used for the CCAR exam were flat to up slightly and are fully phased in supplemental leverage ratio fell 10 basis points to 5.60 as reductions in capital due to the increased buybacks, valuation decreases in our securities portfolio and the impact of the foreign currency were partially offset by lower average assets. We also remain in full compliance with the liquidity coverage ratio. ","Two other notes about the quarter. Our effective tax rate was 24.3% and on page 11 of the release, we show some investment securities portfolio highlights. At quarter end, our net unrealized pretax loss on our portfolio was $221 million, that compared to a gain of $1.4 billion at the end of Q3, which was a change primarily driven by the sharp increase in market interest rates. ","Now let me share with you a few thoughts on themes that have been top of mind with investors, interest rates, industry regulation and taxes. As we look forward, we do expect some impact from the expected rise in interest rates. The net impact of which would be reduction in the size of our balance sheet, which should be more than offset by a higher NIM.","These changes are expected to be modestly positive to NIR for the first quarter and that will be adjusting the fourth quarter for amortization and hedging gains. In terms of fee waivers, as we\u2019ve indicated in the past, we saw it was a 50 basis point increase in the fed fund rates, we would recover about 70% of our fee waivers and that\u2019s above what we\u2019ve actually seen. With an additional move from here, we would we would expect to capture nearly all of it. ","Our regulatory compliance cost continue to be elevated reflecting the high cost associated with the CCAR process, as well as the investment in our resolution and planning process. With respect to our capital distribution plans, we are working through our CCAR cap model now assuming that we get regulatory approval, but we expect to continue our capital wealth management program consistent with our past dividend and common share repurchase goals with a total payout ratio that we would expect to be in the range of 90% to 100%. ","As a reminder, we will be paying for the first dividend for the $1 billion August preferred share issuance and it had a yield of $4.625, that\u2019s going to be paid in the first quarter. So it\u2019s important that you include that sub-payment in your models. ","Regarding taxes, we expect our 2017 effective tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 26% as we have previously disclosed. It\u2019s also important please note that tax advantage investments in renewable energy actually generate losses recorded in our investment and other income line, although they made up for the tax line. ","Therefore, in 2017, we do not expect our investment and other income line to be as strong as it was in 2016, but it should be in the range of $60 million to $80 million each quarter as we have previously guided. There are a couple of more factors to include in the modeling of 2017. As a reminder, staff expense will be impacted by the acceleration of long-term incentive compensation expense through retirement eligible employees that typically takes place in the first quarter. The impact that we expect in the first quarter of this year is similar to what we saw last year. ","And finally, we expect to once again generate positive operating leverage in 2017. So, with that, let me turn it back to Gerald. ","Gerald Hassell","Thanks, Todd, and we can now open it up for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. ","Brennan Hawken ","Hi, good morning. ","Gerald Hassell","Good morning.","Thomas Gibson","Good morning, Brennan. ","Brennan Hawken ","Good morning. One quick one here on the tax advantaged investments and the headwind to the other, Todd, that you referenced. Which geography are those investments in? And what kind of duration are we talking about for those investments here?","Thomas Gibson","So, Brennan, they show up in the asset investment and other income line and they can be longer-term investments up to ten years and so they are not \u2013 we are not quite fully invested, but we will be through the course of this year. So we would expect them to generate a negative revenue in the asset investment and other income and more than offset by the impact to \u2013 on the tax line. So they have an attractive return to us on an after-tax basis. But that\u2019s why we wanted to out on the call, my comments that it will be a little bit of a drag on asset investment and other income, but it\u2019s also the reason that we \u2013 part of the reason while we\u2019ve been able to accomplish a lower than expected effective tax rate. ","Brennan Hawken ","Yes. I am sorry, by geography, I didn\u2019t mean P&L geography, if you meant like map of \u2013 this great geography, I guess, no which country. ","Thomas Gibson","Hopefully, where the wind blows, Brennan, but it\u2019s primarily in the United States. ","Brennan Hawken ","Okay. Just, the only reason I ask that it\u2019s just because of the \u2013 can you help us understand about investing in something with the long duration right in front of some uncertainty around corporate tax fund?","Thomas Gibson","Well, we would structure these things, if there was a relation to the tax, we\u2019d have protection on that. ","Brennan Hawken ","Okay. All right, great. That\u2019s really helpful. And then, my follow-up on asset management and the outflows, with LDI, it\u2019s just sort of surprising to see continued outflow there with those strategies and interestingly, a rather large asset manager reported last week that they had strong indexed bond flows this quarter with liability-driven investing driving some of those tailwinds. So, is there some concern about maybe losing some share? Do you bump up against Blackrock in any bake-offs? How should we think about the market and how you guys are positioned there?","Mitchell Evan Harris","Brennan, this is Mitchell. A couple things. The outflow, as Todd mentioned, it was really one client. If you could look underneath that the annualized revenues quarter-to-quarter continue to be positive. The pipeline is as strong as it\u2019s ever been and it did have $26 billion in inflows over the whole year. I don\u2019t see Blackrock coming up in a lot of bake-offs. Most of our biz that says you might know is not in the US on LDI. It\u2019s outside the US. It\u2019s UK, it\u2019s Europe, it\u2019s common law areas, Australia and alike. We are just starting to move into the US and I think we\u2019ll have some momentum there. So a lot of the momentum you are seeing is really non-US LDI business. I think it will continue to build in Europe as interest rates are moving up a little bit and I think with our move into the US, we probably will see Blackrock more in a bake-off spot. The strategies are quite different and I think we\u2019ll do very well. So, performance is good. The outlook for LDI is strong. I am as buoyant as I\u2019ve ever been about the LDI business and our ability to continue to compete with it. ","Brennan Hawken ","Okay, thanks for the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. ","Alex Blostein ","Great. Hi, guys. Good morning. ","Thomas Gibson","Hi, Alex.","Alex Blostein ","First wanted \u2013 hi, so, first wanted to touch on NIR and just help us understand kind of the right jumping off point given the \u2013 there are couple of moving pieces here. So, as you look out, is a jumping off point kind of 806, so like including the gain from your NIM because it\u2019s more consistent or it is closer to 791, which obviously excludes kind of both gains is so just a clear up question there. ","And then just bigger picture, as you guys think about into 2017, given how the balance sheet is positioned today and what should we think about as a sensitivity from incremental increases and in rate and also the size of the balance sheet? ","Gerald Hassell","Sure Alex. Good morning, so, I think the \u2013 when you look at the fourth quarter NIR, I think the jumping off point is, I would tap it for the $40 million. So the $25 million of that or so was on the hedging activity. The hedging activity is just a geographic issue for us. So we had that \u2013 there was a offsetting \u2013 perfectly offsetting loss in the other trading income. So that has net impact to total earnings, but it does have an impact directly to NIR. And then the $15 million was an adjustment because of the change in the accounting methodology. So I think that is the right point. So, if you adjust for those two things, the NIM would have been more like 112 versus 117, still up a pretty healthy 6 or 7 basis points from where were in the third quarter. And that\u2019s had a tailwind of the benefit of higher rates as we have repriced a fair number of assets. And we do have deposit base acting about as we had expected. So we are adjusting a modest portion of our deposit base upward as well. As we look into next year, I mean, where interest rates are go is, anybody\u2019s guess, but we - and that\u2019s why the guidance I really gave was only for the first quarter. So knowing what we know, we would expect the balance sheet to come down a little bit, which it already has and we would expect NIM to more than offset the balance sheet move. So we would expect to continue to see some of the improvement that we saw in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. Not a huge run up, but a little bit. Sorry about that, we had some noise over the phone. But, does that answer your question?","Alex Blostein ","No, that makes sense. And then just, hello? ","Gerald Hassell","We are still here.","Alex Blostein ","No, sorry. And then just, as far as just the level of exited deposits, I know the balance sheet shrunken quarter-over-quarter. So, I think last time we talked about $20 billion, $25 billion was still on the balance sheet shrunk. So is it still kind of in the $10 billion to $20 billion range right now?","Gerald Hassell","Yes, that would be about where we are and so we are following it very carefully. We are not seeing any significant change, but it\u2019s probably declined slightly from year end.","Alex Blostein ","Got it. Great. Thanks so much.","Gerald Hassell","Thanks Alex.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin ","Hi, thanks. Hello, thanks. Can you hear me okay? ","Gerald Hassell","Yes. ","Ken Usdin ","Okay, great. Good morning. Hey guys, excellent job on the full year on the cost side and clearly with some help from the FX side. It\u2019s a busy morning. So I am sorry if I missed it in the release. But can you guys help us understand what the magnitude of input was from - to revenue growth, to fees and to expenses on the FX translation as we try to just think about how the core business is acting underneath? ","Gerald Hassell","Sure. The \u2013 for the quarter, this isn\u2019t for the full year, but for the quarter, we saw operating revenue growth of about 2%. I think the impact of currency and it was most significantly in our investment management business was about 200 basis points negatively. So, we would have seen operating revenue growth of about 4%. And on the expense side, it was also good for about 200 \u2013 little over 200 basis points. So we saw a negative, it would have been probably flat to slightly up on expenses and so we had recorded on an operating basis, 350 basis points or so of positive operating leverage. It probably would have been about 100 basis points less. So around 250. As we look at the full year, the numbers are not quite so impactful, so still about 2% on revenue, close to zero on expenses and our 280 basis points of positive operating leverage probably would have looked more like 220 to 225.","Ken Usdin ","Yes, so still a good result, and my second question is then just, as you put forward your - the rest of your plans and your execution on the cost side, how would you help to think about just expense outlook looking ahead given that benefit that was in the expense side to a modest extent, and also, I know you are driving for operating leverage, so with better revenues, I know you might not necessarily try to get expenses down again, but can you just help us think about what your just planning thoughts are around expenses?","Gerald Hassell","Sure, and I\u2019ll probably start at a high level and hand it to Brian to go through some of the key things that we are working on. But we do \u2013 when I had indicated that we do expect positive operating leverage in the full year for 2017 once again, that does assume some modest revenue growth and when you look at down at the underlying expenses, comp expenses is our biggest driver. It\u2019s more than half of our total expense. We would expect that to be up slightly looking at the number of programs that we are working on. Our legal and professional expense probably will be up slightly reflecting the ongoing requirements around compliance. Basically, the rest of the expenses should be relatively flat, probably a little higher software amortization as we put together a number of \u2013 as we implement a number of the applications that we have invested in. But everything else looking pretty flat. Brian, do you want to get into some of the detail on the business improvement process maybe?","Brian Thomas Shea","Yes, I would say that the business improvement process continues to yield the results we want, which is helping offset the global regulatory change cost enabling us to invest in long-term strategic growth areas and create operating margin improvement. So, a long list of accomplishments this year, but still a robust pipeline of activity, because we are driving this like a process, not a project. So we expect this to drive continuous value. Some of the areas to focus on in 2017 are continuing to work around the business portfolio, but also the product service solution portfolio and eliminating and reducing sub-scale or non-profitable activities, those things that don\u2019t hit our margin expectations. We continue to have a pipeline of client pricing initiatives that could align our interest with our clients in terms of driving efficiency and productivity end-to-end for both the client and for us. We have a number of initiatives to automate and drive straight through processing through traditional workflow and better technology and also through robotics process automation which was our first year, last year, but we are scaling that and getting more \u2013 we expect to get more benefits from that process over time. We are making progress on our technology strategy and exposing more APIs which not only make it easier for us to work with clients but they improve develop for productivity and we are sharing common technology services which also gives us a higher yield on our technology investment and we continue to do more around the global location strategy, the global real estate portfolio and reducing the number of locations we serve clients from all of which are shifting away at helping us drive continuous improvement in this area.","Gerald Hassell","Ken, one other thing I would add to that, Ken, is, is we are making investments to improve our efficiencies and we are absorbing that in our runrate and I noted in this particular quarter we made some \u2013 we absorbed into this earnings some additional investments to position us well for next year. So the whole point Brian has made that we had a list of items that we can \u2013 we think we can still execute and we are absorbing the cost to executing those through our regular runrate.","Ken Usdin ","Got it. Okay. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. ","Mike Mayo","Hi, this is Mike Mayo.","Gerald Hassell","Sorry, Mike. Go ahead.","Mike Mayo ","So, look, you are controlling what you can control with expenses and buybacks and it sounds like you have more of that, on the other hand revenue growth was flat for the year and I just want to know what about, you said modest revenue growth this year, but just a little bit more color, I\u2019d say in three areas; number one, the custody business has not seen much growth for you or for the industry, are you seeing an impact because you have more fixed income related assets than peer, it's been a tougher fixed income market from a valuation standpoint? ","Number two, as it relates to investment services, are you seeing risk-on or risk-off, our thought was when there is more risk-on and higher risk custody assets would generate more fees and then number three, as it relates to investment management, you said that ETFs are in their infancy, you have outflows in actively managed funds, are you able to turn the tide there?","Gerald Hassell","Mike, there is about a hundred questions in there. But I\u2019ll start and try to give an overview and then perhaps ask my colleagues to jump in here as well. I think you saw in the fourth quarter, every single one of our investment services businesses actually showed positive revenue growth. And that\u2019s even after taking in a consideration that about 30% or so of our asset servicing revenues are tied to fixed income market. So, 30%, 40%. So, we are still seeing growth in asset servicing and clearing services, treasury services issuer across the board. Would we all like to grow faster? Yes, and we are very focused as I said in my opening comments, about profitable revenue growth and really making sure we are constantly improving that client experience to give them a good reason to do more business with us. So, we think the pipelines in the investment services and asset servicing areas are strong and good and so we are encouraged by our growth rates there. The strength of the dollar also did have a dampening effect on our revenues overall both in investment services and in asset servicing and when you factor all those things in, I think it\u2019s above that 2% that you just cited. In investment management, we are repositioning some of the portfolio and strengthening some of the strategies. We are close to the high watermark which would have allowed for higher performance fees. Didn\u2019t occur in the fourth quarter but we are encouraged by our performance relative to our peers and relative to our benchmarks. And some of the strategies that we have invested in are gaining traction. So, clearly revenue growth is one of our key priorities and we would like to try to accelerate it. But it\u2019s 2016 was tough revenue environment. But we are encouraged by our performance in the fourth quarter.","Mike Mayo ","And your guidance for positive operating leverage in 2017, how many rate hikes are you assuming?","Gerald Hassell","Right now, what we typically do Mike, is we look at the forward yield curve and we factor that into our plan and when we struck it on December 31, there were two rate - two assumed hikes in those numbers. So, one in June and one in September.","Mike Mayo ","Okay, and then lastly, the risk-on or risk-off, are you seeing animal spirits filter through into your business or is that still more hope?","Gerald Hassell","Well, I think any time there is more optimism and more confidence in the market. There is more trading activity. More trading activity and higher levels of volatility help our business model. We are seeing early signs of it now.","Thomas Gibbons","And Mike just to give a little more clarity around what asset servicing revenues look like, remember that we are exiting our UK TA business. So those are revenues that are declining and the dollar impact was quite substantial in this particular quarter. So if you actually adjust for the fact that we are exiting a business that was not profitable, and giving up the revenues on as part of what\u2019s helping our margin expansion and the dollar impact, asset servicing revenues would have been up 6% on a year-over-year basis.","Mike Mayo ","All right. Thank you.","Gerald Hassell","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.","Gerald Hassell","Glenn, are you there?","Glenn Schorr ","Hello. ","Gerald Hassell","Hello, Glenn. Now we can hear you. ","Glenn Schorr ","Sorry about that. ","Gerald Hassell","That\u2019s all right. ","Glenn Schorr ","This might be oversimplified, but I am watching your asset yields go up every quarter as rates went up and you still have a slight negative rate on your interest-bearing deposits and that\u2019s an issue of geography, which is great for you guys. So I\u2019m curious, what exactly are you hedging when you are hedging and I am assuming the accounting for it is, just that\u2019s what the accounting rules are it would be nice if it was just inside the net interest income line and a clean hedge. But the question is what exactly are you hedging when you are hedging?","Gerald Hassell","Okay, Mike, so there is something called \u2013 I mean, Glenn, sorry about that. Glenn, there is something called the overnight OIS which is an overnight rate when you secure interest rate swap. So what we do is, we would take our debt and we would swap it to floating to LIBOR. But that is not a perfectly hedged swap. So we actually need to hedge based on the overnight collateral rate effectively. That basis swaps where we are now adding another swap hedging the LIBOR rate into an overnight rate, that does not get hedge accounting treatment. So it gets mark-to-market through the trading account whereas the offset to that is in the net interest account. It\u2019s a perfect offset. So effectively, what we are doing is we are converting some of our debt into an overnight rate and then managing it accordingly. But the move from three month LIBOR to overnight does not get hedge accounting treatment and that\u2019s what\u2019s creating that, it\u2019s on a quarter-to-quarter basis.","Glenn Schorr ","No problem. This is not a new line item, but just piqued my curiosity this quarter. In the securities portfolio, you have like $16 billion of sovereign debt, 20% of it is BBB. What BBB sovereign debt paper are you sitting on in the securities portfolio? I appreciate that market value is over its cost, but it\u2019s just a curious question.","Gerald Hassell","Yes, Glenn, I don\u2019t have that off the top of my head, but most of that \u2013 most of the sovereign debt that would be and there would be very high grade. So I\u2019ll have to take a look at that and get back to you.","Glenn Schorr ","Okay. No problem. Sorry for the phone troubles. Thanks.","Gerald Hassell","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell ","Hi, can you guys hear me?","Gerald Hassell","Yes, we can hear you fine. Thanks.","Brian Bedell ","Great, great. Good morning. Just, maybe back on expenses, Todd, that was great color as you went through the lines. Maybe if you could just clarify a little bit you were talking about 75% of the cost base being sort of up slightly if you go through the buckets. Would - should we interpret that as maybe the total expense base on the plan being up, say 1% or 2% based on your sort of up slightly comment and then maybe if you can talk about your flexibility on that in different type of revenue environments, whether you are able to trim that obviously if revenue is more challenging and whether you would actually look to accelerate some spending on growth initiatives if revenue is more favorable?","Thomas Gibbons","Yes, I think, I\u2019ll let you judge what I mean by up slightly, but I do mean positive operating leverage. And in terms of our ability to adjust, I think the fourth quarter was a reflection of that. So, based on the revenue mix, we can make some adjustments. But we can only do so much on the \u2013 in the short-term. The key is that we continue to progress with our sustainable cost reductions that Brian just laid out, we just need to keep executing on the opportunities that we see. ","Brian Bedell ","Okay, great. Thanks, and then, maybe for Brian. Two initiatives that Gerald mentioned in his opening remarks, maybe if you can shed little bit more color and then the ETF servicing initiative obviously the trends are very positive for ETFs. What are you exactly doing there to grow that business and attract ETF issuers? ","And then also on the RIA side of the business, encouraging, looking at some of the bigger competitors like Fidelity, Schwab and Ameritrade in terms of servicing RIAs. Do you expect - I guess what are you doing to try to compete more aggressively with those players? Or is that not quite the goal?","Brian Thomas Shea","Sure, okay. So, ETFs first, really Gerald mentioned it. We are just trying to figure there until the shift from active to passive and we expect continued growth in the ETF space. We are a significant ETF service provider today and we have relationships, strategic relationships with many of the big financial institutions that are the growers in that space and so we are hopeful that we can extend those relationships and do servicing overtime. We are investing in the technology to make it more scalable and to deliver better client experience and we are obviously investing in the talent as well to make sure that we have really the top team and the top solution in the industry. So, that\u2019s really what we are doing in the ETF space and we have a serious effort on the relationship team side to cover those opportunities more assertively. On the pershing front or the RIA side, again, just like ETFs will be advantaged by the DOL fiduciary standard, we think the RIA business model will definitely be advantaged by the DOL fiduciary standard as well it\u2019s been a long-term secular trend shifting from brokerage to advisory model in the industry. Pershing Advisory Solutions has had double-digit revenue growth and as you see growth for the last few years, and we expect to continue to drive significant growth. We focus on larger sort of more professionally managed RIA firms, so groups of RIAs not individual practitioners. So we tend to have less new clients than the others that our clients tend to be bigger more substantial, more managed companies in the advisory space and so, we like the profile of the clients we serve. Our value proposition is I think getting stronger in that space. Gerald has mentioned the integration of bank broker\u2019s custody. That\u2019s really important. Many advisors want to have a bank custodian and we are really the only provider in the marketplace that can deliver integrated bank and brokerage custody experience. We also talked about the private banking services. RIAs compete with major financial institutions that have a banking capability or a private bank capability. We are doing, leveraging our partnership with the wealth management team is delivering private banking services to the customers of the RIAs we serve and that\u2019s actually been a usually successful process. We have now $4.5 billion in credit facilities outstanding \u2013 credit facilities in place with our broker\/dealer and RIA clients and about $2.8 billion of those credit facilities have been drawn and used by the investors of RIAs initiatives and broker\/dealers. So, we are investing in managed account solutions, digital advice solutions and other technology solutions to continue to grow our share in the RIA space.","Brian Bedell ","And the initiatives that you\u2019ve done in terms of consolidating that on to one platform, do you expect that to really improve the results coming into 1Q in Pershing given that you\u2019ve done this quarter?","Brian Thomas Shea","Well, I think it\u2019s \u2013 unlike large broker\/dealers when you convert large broker\/dealers, you convert thousands of advisors at a time in the RIA space, it\u2019s - while we are doing larger firms, it\u2019s a slower process, but we have a strong pipeline of firms coming on and we spent most of 2016 getting the platform integrated and converting the existing clients we have between our bank custody and brokerage custody teams. But now, we are actually beginning to take on new clients on to the platform and we took our first new \u2013 absolutely, new client on in the fourth quarter, so I expect that momentum to continue throughout 2017 and beyond.","Brian Bedell ","Great, thanks very much for the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl ","Good morning. ","Gerald Hassell","Hi, Brian.","Brian Kleinhanzl ","Hi. I had a quick question on the investment management. If you could clarify what you were saying about the positioning going into the US election? I got that you were positioned one way ahead of the election, but how does that change in positioning post-election? What does that mean for both AUM growth rates, as well as the fee rates, is that going to offset - and are you going to see a snap back in the fee rates as a result of this? It was more of a timing issue or could you just clarify that please?","Mitchell Evan Harris","Hi, this is Mitchell. I think that, what we were saying is, short-term performance was negatively impacted by the US election as the equities rallied and sectors like financials took off. We were positioned in the first three quarters really more for slower growth which we significantly benefited by. We are not changing our overall position. We don\u2019t react to specific events, but we do see that overall performance is good. It was a one quarter related issue overall performance is actually still very strong. As just an example on a one year basis, six of our ten top strategies by revenues are still in the top two quartiles and even stronger on a three year basis. So performance on a long-term basis is strong. But some of our strategies were quote out as the change in market sentiment given the election. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to impact overall momentum given our one, three, and five year performance is actually very strong and I think we are positioned fine for the New Year.","Brian Kleinhanzl ","Okay. And then just a quick question following on the kind of branching out into the \u2013 more into the ETF space. I mean, does that give you - do you reconsider the multi-boutique model? And whether or not, I know you like the model, but I mean, is there additional efficiencies you think you could pull out of that model?","Mitchell Evan Harris","There are always efficiencies that we are looking at from the model. Anything we could do at leverage and scale were continuing to push through anything we can do with the company more broadly, Brian's group on ops and tech where we are looking to do when we think there is more particularly on the ops and tech side. And there is always tweaks as the markets change where we can continue to leverage the organization and we\u2019ll continue to do so. ","Gerald Hassell","Broadly, asset management like other businesses, scale is going to matter and we do want to use the scale benefits of the entire company for the benefit of our asset management boutiques help lower their structural costs and still have them focus on their investment performance and their distribution strategies. So we think there is opportunities to apply scale benefits to our asset management boutiques and still keep it in the boutique structure. ","Mitchell Evan Harris","Brian has mentioned in the past that asset managers in general, be it a multi-boutique or any model need to focus more on their core competency which is asset management and other things that are not directly related to the investment process. We want to give to third-party providers. In our case, third-party provider is in-house and we will continue to do that.","Brian Kleinhanzl ","Okay, thanks.","Gerald Hassell","Thank you.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy ","Thank you. Good morning guys. ","Gerald Hassell","Good morning.","Gerard Cassidy ","Recently, there was a story, Gerald, about the baby boom generation is going to be entering this year for the first time, the forced disbursements from defined contribution plans and that\u2019s obviously going to accelerate as more baby boomers hit this 70.5 year-old age. What are some of the challenges? Have you guys started to look at that? And how it might affect your business? And what are some of the challenges and opportunities that might present itself for both the custody side of the business, but also wealth \u2013 excuse me wealth management? ","Gerald Hassell","It\u2019s a great question. We look at it in a variety of different angles. One, starting with supporting the advisors on the Pershing platform, because they are in the midst of it on a direct basis every single day of the week, so, giving them the toolsets and utilizing our platforms and technology to help the advisors capture that wealth transfer is one of the most \u2013 one of the important elements. Our own wealth management area spends a lot of time thinking about this and making sure that multi-generational shift is one that they continue to service and service well. And on the asset management side, making sure we have strategies in place on third-party distribution platforms to help capture that as such shift inflows is also one of the areas of opportunity. So, it is a big shift. It\u2019s one of the reasons why we like our platform businesses and our wealth businesses as much as we do, because it is going to be a very significant transfer of wealth and assets into new hands and we have to be all over it. So we do think about it a lot. ","Gerard Cassidy ","Thank you. And then, maybe a quick question for Todd. On the negative rates that you guys are still experiencing in the foreign deposits, how has that moved since the election? I know the negative rate went down by 1 basis point, but are you seeing any acceleration where it may turn positive later this year in that category of deposits?","Thomas Gibbons","Yes, I mean, if you look at the total rate paid on deposits, on average it was slightly negative. About 15% to 20% of our deposit base is in non-dollar, a smaller percentage of that is in euro which is mostly what\u2019s driving that. So, in some instances, there is some pretty substantial negative rates. The US deposits are slightly positive and we do have deposit base and what that means is as interest rates go up, we will pass on some of the benefit of those rising rates to our clients. So the initial moves are probably a bit compressed and then our clients will start to get more of the benefits. So that\u2019s kind of how the betas work. So one would expect to see that crossover into a positive \u2013 a positive rate in the next quarter or two.","Gerard Cassidy ","Thank you. Appreciate it.","Gerald Hassell","Thanks, Gerard. Great. Thank you very much and everyone thank you for dialing in this morning. And if you have additional questions, please give Valerie Haertel a call and we look forward to engaging with you and thanks for your participation today.","Operator","If there are any additional questions or comments, you may contact Ms. Valerie Haertel at 212-635-8529.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call or webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Andy Clark. Mr. Clark, you may begin.","Andy Clark","Thanks, Wendy, and welcome, everyone. With us today are Gerald Hassell, our Chairman and CEO; Todd Gibbons, our CFO, as well as our executive management team.","Before we begin, let me remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement on Page 13 of the press release and those identified in our documents filed with the SEC that are available on our website, bnymellon.com. Forward-looking statements in this call speak only as of today, January 16, 2013, and we will not update forward-looking statements. Our press release and earnings review are available on our website, and we will be using the earnings review to discuss our results today. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Gerald. Gerald?","Gerald L. Hassell","Thanks, Andy, and good morning, everyone. As you saw from our release for the fourth quarter, we generated net income of $622 million and earnings per share of $0.53. Just as a reminder, we recorded $0.42 per share in the fourth quarter of last year, which included restructuring charges related to our operational excellence initiatives of $0.06 per share.","Now I'm pleased to report strong growth in a number of our businesses. Investment Management had another excellent quarter, benefiting from the 13th consecutive quarter of long-term inflows and higher market values. We've had $56 billion in net long term flows over the last 12 months, which included $14 billion during the quarter. Our success in attracting new assets helped drive assets under management to a record level of $1.4 trillion. In Investment Services, Asset Servicing, Clearing and Treasury Services all saw nice growth in fee income as well. Now that being said, the market environment continues to be challenging to some of our revenue streams as volumes, volatility, interest rates and tepid capital markets all continue to trend below normalized levels. These factors resulted in a decline in revenues in our lower variable cost businesses such as Depositary Receipts, foreign exchange and net interest income. And we were able to offset the decline in these revenues with growth in investment management and other investment services businesses, but the growth occurred in those areas that have higher variable costs. So the shift in the revenue mix was the principal cause of the growth in expenses year-over-year and sequentially above the level that you might have expected. In addition, we acquired the remaining 50% interest in the West LB Asset Management joint venture, which we renamed Meriten, that brought with it a higher expense base.  And finally, we had some seasonally higher expenses in the fourth quarter and we are investing in our brand, businesses and strategic initiatives to help our clients succeed in a very difficult market.","Now we have a relentless focus on creating organic growth, continuing to drive some of the opportunities we've outlined for you in the past. Some examples: accelerating our asset management growth strategies, particularly in Asia and the retail space; capturing opportunities through our global collateral services business; leveraging our Pershing platform and distribution capability and building out global markets to capture more order flow. And we recently received approval to launch our new Issuer Central Securities Depository based in Belgium, which will enhance our offering for investment services and collateral management for clients in Europe. All these initiatives will help drive our long term growth, but do in fact require investments today that are showing up in our expense base. So we are not standing still waiting for the markets to improve, and we are in fact taking actions to strengthen our revenue streams. In that regard, we announced several executive appointments to accelerate our progress. Karen Peetz was named President of the company, and she will focus on one of the 3 key pillars of our firm: our clients and employees. So client management, the regions, innovation, collaboration, employee training and development and some of our key growth initiatives will come under Karen. The second pillar is investment services, and Tim Keaney is now CEO of all our investment services businesses, and this brings together all of our capabilities under one manager, which will improve collaboration and enhance our ability to offer integrated solutions.","Brian Shea is now President of Investment Services and very importantly, Head of Operations and Technology for the company. These businesses are technology and operations intensive, and we want those attributes closer to the client and part of the fabric of any business decision. I also firmly believe that we have the opportunity to simplify our operating model and get better operational efficiencies across our businesses beyond the operational excellence initiatives we are currently tracking. That is one of Brian's challenges and I know he's up for it.  And finally, the third pillar of our firm is investment management, which Curtis Arledge continues to run. We have built some very nice revenue momentum here, and the team is executing on our important growth opportunities. So we have a broad deep leadership team. We're sharpening our client focus, better collaborating across our businesses and driving further productivity gains in our operating platform, all while maintaining a strong capital position and returning capital to shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Todd to go through the numbers.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Thanks, Gerald, and good morning, everyone. My comments will follow the quarterly earnings review, and we'll start on Page 2. Reported earnings per share were $0.53 this quarter. Our results included a $0.03 benefit related to a credit to the loan loss provision where we've seen some progress or continued progress in reducing the risk of the portfolio. It's really paying dividends. We did have a lower tax rate and some securities gains, but in the end, we don't think that they're really unusual and I'll talk about that in some detail in a minute. And there were also some seasonally higher expenses, not indicative of our core ongoing run rate. If you take all those items into account, we see this as about a $0.50 quarter. This compares with $0.42 in the year ago quarter, which as Gerald mentioned, included a negative impact of about $0.06 per share related to restructuring charges.","Looking at the numbers on a year-over-year basis, total revenue was $3.6 billion. That's up 2%, while fee and other revenue was up 3%. Investment management fees were up strongly, and we had nice fee growth in Asset Servicing, Clearing and Treasury Services, and those were partially offset by declines in FX, revenue and NIR, as well as softness in Issuer Services. While the current low interest rate environment continues to negatively impact net interest revenue, it has driven a significant improvement in the value of the investment securities portfolio, and that's given us the opportunity to realize some gains there. Expenses were up 7%, but if you look at it on a core basis, which was -- that is on a core basis, which excludes amortization of intangible assets, M&I litigation, restructuring charges and some direct expenses related to Shareowner Services. As Gerald had mentioned earlier, the biggest factor in the increase was the change in our revenue mix, and I'll give you some more color on that in a moment.","Turning to Page 4, where we call out some business metrics that will help explain our underlying performance. You can see that AUM of $1.4 trillion was up 10% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially, resulting from higher market values and net inflows. During the quarter, we had net long-term inflows of $14 billion and short-term outflows of $6 billion. It was our 13th consecutive quarter of positive long term inflows with long term flows of $56 billion over the last 12 months.","Assets under custody and administration were up 9% year-over-year to $26.7 trillion. Those were driven by higher market values and net new business. Linked quarter, AUC was up slightly. As you may see here, AUC in our prior periods is down about 4% to 5%, as we've restated, to reflect the correction of a double count of legacy Mellon assets. The restatement had no impact to our growth rate, our revenues or our earnings.","A number of key metrics showed growth on a year-over-year basis. All clearing metrics improved. Margin loans were up nicely and collateral management GAAP balances continue to grow at a robust rate, a trend that our global collateral services group is positioned to capitalize on.","Looking at fees on Page 6. Asset Servicing fees were up 7% year-over-year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects net new business, higher market values and higher collateral management revenue. Sequentially, those positives were partially offset by decline in securities lending revenues, and that was driven by slightly lower balances, as well as lower spreads. We had $190 billion in new AUC wins for a total of $1.5 trillion in AUC wins over the last 12 months. If you look at Issuer Services fees, excluding the Shareowner Services business, which we sold at the end of last year, they were down 12% year-over-year and 31% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease primarily resulted from lower DR revenue, as volumes are down quite a bit this year, also lower corporate trust fees, resulting from that continued net runoff of structured debt securitizations that we've mentioned previously. The sequential decrease primarily resulted from the $107 million decrease in DR revenues that we have indicated, which was largely seasonal. As you saw last quarter, this is a relatively high fixed cost business so a gain or loss of revenue doesn't have much in the way of expenses associated with it.","Clearing fees were up 6% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Both increases primarily reflect higher mutual fund fees, driven by increases in positions and balances, higher cash management balances and also an increase in DARTS. So all in all, not a bad performance considering the weaker volumes we are seeing on the exchanges. The year-over-year increase also reflects the higher impact of -- the impact of higher clearance revenue.","Investment management and performance fees were up 17% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. Both increases were impacted by the Meriten acquisition. If you exclude Meriten, investment management performance fees were up 15% year-over-year, and those were driven by higher market values, net new business and slightly lower fee waivers.  In FX and other trading, revenue was down 39% year-over-year and 24% sequentially. If you look at the components, FX revenue of $106 million was down 42% year-over-year and 12% sequentially. Both decreases reflect a sharp decline in market volatility, and that's consistent with the index that we show you on Page 5. That's the JP Morgan G7 Volatility Index. We also saw in the period a modest decline in volumes.  Other trading revenue was $33 million, and that compares with $44 million -- $45 million in the year ago quarter and $61 million in the prior quarter. Both comparisons reflect lower fixed income trading revenues, driven by lower interest rate trading. Investment and other income totaled $116 million into the quarter compared with $146 million in the year ago quarter and $124 million in the third quarter. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the pretax gain on the sale of Shareowner Services business, while the sequential decrease reflects lower seed capital gains and equity investment revenue.","Turning to Page 8 of the earnings review. NIR was down $55 million versus the year ago quarter and $24 million sequentially. The year-over-year decrease was principally driven by the elimination of interest on ECB deposits. We had lower accretion and there were lower yields on the reinvestment of securities. Partially, that was offset by higher interest earning assets as we saw a significant increase in deposit levels. The sequential decrease in NIR had all of the above. In addition, it was impacted by the decline on LIBOR after the Fed announced QE3. We have quite a few floating-rate assets that are linked to LIBOR, and 3-month LIBOR fell about 10 basis points on average for the quarter.","The net interest margin was 109 basis points compared with 127 in the year ago quarter and 1.2 in the prior quarter. During the quarter, the net [ph] margin was negatively impacted by the sharp rise in deposits that I mentioned, as that cash was primarily left at the Fed, where it earned only 25 basis points. Overall, the increase in deposits, we estimate, reduced the margin by approximately 6 basis points sequentially and about 8 basis points on a year-over-year basis.  Today, we have a $2.4 billion unrealized gain in the investment securities portfolio, and we have sold and we would expect to continue to sell in this environment, securities to rebalance the portfolio and manage our operation risk. As such, the gains realized on these sales should be considered along with net interest revenue in evaluating our overall results. In the fourth quarter, combined NIR and securities gains totaled $775 million. That compares with $770 million in the year-ago quarter -- excuse me, $777 million in the year ago quarter and $771 million in the linked quarter.","Now turning to Page 9. You can see that total noninterest expense x amortization of intangible assets, M&I, litigation and restructuring charges and also the direct expenses with Shareowner Services were up 7% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Both increases were primarily driven by the revenue mix as the low rate environment and tepid capital markets activity drove a decline in our fixed cost businesses. For example, DR revenue was down $107 million. FX and other trading revenue was -- declined $43 million. NIR was down $24 million sequentially. All of these have variable cost -- have very little variable cost associated with them, unlike the revenue that replaced them in investment management, asset servicing, clearing and treasury services. Expenses over both periods also reflect higher software and business development expenses, as well as the operating expenses associated with the Meriten acquisition. The M&I litigation and restructuring line item of our P&L included expenses related to our operational excellence initiatives, just as it did in the year ago quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2012, the restructuring component also included severance expense and lease restructuring charge, and these were offset by the gain on the sale of a property. The net restructuring charges totaled less than $1 million for the fourth quarter of '12.","For the full year, total expense was up about $220 million and that -- in terms of that increase, M&I litigation and restructuring offset the reduction that was related to the sale of Shareowner Services last year. The operational excellence initiatives ended up offsetting the headwinds in compensation and other operating expenses that we've spoken about in the past. As a result, the overall increase in expenses was largely driven by the impact of the revenue mix that I just described.","Turning to Page 10, you can see the progress of our operational excellence initiatives, which are improving our efficiency, helping to offset merit and benefit increases, and positioning us for an improved operating environment. You'll see that the full year, we exceeded our target on a gross savings basis with about $397 million versus the target of $360 million to $390 million.","For 2012, the incremental program cost total is $88 million, resulting in net savings of $309 million versus the $240 million to $260 million target. As you can see, our program costs were largely the driver for this, as they came in lower than expected, and the reason for that is a significant portion of the lease restructuring and severance expenses were allocated to the restructuring charge that I just mentioned.","As you can see on Page 11, our capital ratio has strengthened. Our estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio was 9.8% at quarter end. That compares to 9.30% at the end of the third quarter. This increase was chiefly attributable to lower risk-weighted assets, as well as some earnings retention.","During the year, we repurchased nearly 50 million common shares for $1.1 billion so we're executing on our 2012 CCAR plan, and our strong capital position provides us with the flexibility to continue to return capital to our shareholders.","Moving on to our loan book on Page 13, you can see that the provision for credit losses was a credit this quarter of $61 million. This compares to a provision of $23 million in the year ago quarter. The credit was largely driven by a reduction in the allowance for credit losses related to the residential loan portfolio, which has experienced better performance when you compare it to the industry's historical losses. During the quarter, we began using our actual loan loss experience rather than the industry data in order to get a better estimate for the allowance for credit losses and hence, the release.  The effective tax rate was 24.3%, which primarily reflects the benefit associated with the reorganization of certain foreign operations. But the good news here is the lower tax rate should continue, as we benefit from increased investment tax credits against a lower earnings stream, and we also have a larger tax exempt to municipal bond portfolio.","Before I provide some updates for your models, I wanted to give you another look at how the revenue mix is impacting our expenses. So if you turn to Page 16 in the earnings review where we break out investment services fees as a percentage of noninterest expense, I can walk you through this impact. The reported ratio was 90% for both the fourth quarter of 2012 as well as for 2011. But if you recall from our revenue commentary, Depositary Receipt fees are down year-over-year due to lower volumes. This decline in revenue only results in a minimal reduction in expenses. So if you adjust for the year-over-year impact of DRs, the fourth quarter of 2012 ratio would have been in the 92% range rather than 90%, and that demonstrates that we are making some progress in our operational excellence initiatives, particularly in Asset Servicing.","Now a few points to factor into your thinking about the current quarter. We don't -- and looking forward, we don't see -- foresee a significant improvement in interest rates and FX volatility in the near term. In terms of NIR and securities gains, we expect them to remain flat, and that's if we're able to execute on our loan growth related to our global securities services businesses. Operational excellence initiatives should be on plan. The quarterly provisions should be around 0. Our preferred dividends will be about $0.01 a quarter, and the effective tax rate should come in a bit lower than we previously guided, say, about 25% or so. During the quarter and all of 2013, we'll be focused on 4 main activities: creating organic growth, executing on operational and excellence initiatives, continuing to maintain our strong balance sheet and strengthening our capital position and returning some of that capital to our shareholders. With that, let me turn it back to Gerald.","Gerald L. Hassell","Thanks, Todd. And Wendy, I think we can open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Howard Chen with Credit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just throughout the commentary, you spoke a lot about the fourth quarter environment being one of which you had low client activity and low volatility. Just curious, given we had a couple idiosyncratic events, like the U.S. election and the fiscal cliff and we're into 2013 now, have you seen any meaningful changes across the business or early signs of re-risking, whether it's kind of a custodial and servicing side of the business or things like frictional deposits rolling off?","Gerald L. Hassell","Interesting question, Howard. What we did see towards the end of the year just as we saw in August 2011 was with the physical (sic) [fiscal] cliff looming, we saw a fairly significant increase in our deposits on our balance sheet, and so we saw a run-up of $20 billion, $30 billion in our deposits. Most of that has already moved back off the balance sheet, some of which has moved into traditional money market funds, some of which appears to be going into investments. I think we're going to be facing some ways a bit of a number of cliffs. I think the debt ceiling limit is going to put another potential concern in the eyes of investors. Hopefully, we'll get through that, but we are seeing people trying to put some money to work, but still there's an enormous amount of cash sitting on the sidelines, waiting for better certainty and clarity. I think some of the investment management flows, which maybe I can ask Curtis to speak to, he's seeing some activity pick up there, showing up in some of our numbers. So maybe, Curtis, you want to just touch upon that a little bit too.","Curtis Y. Arledge","Yes, absolutely, I mean, there's been a lot discussed in the media about the flows that have been into equity funds in the first part of this year, and we have seen that and then some. I think at the end of 2012, clients broadly were waiting to see kind of how the fiscal cliff played out. And obviously, with debt ceiling and sequester and budget and other things still in front of us, there still are some uncertainties. But I think as each uncertainty gets removed, we definitely see a reason to not act all the way. And the flows that we've seen and the conversation that we're having would lead us to believe that investors, and when I say investors, I mean everything from retail, mutual fund investors to some of the world's largest sovereign wealth funds, are absolutely looking at this as an environment to begin to put money back to work. Again, I think uncertainty has dampened people's activity in terms of making a decision to invest. And as we get past each of these events, we've seen people absolutely take action, and I know other parts of our company see flows as well. Brian, I don't know if you...","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes, Brian, maybe you want to talk about what you see on the Pershing platform on the retail side particularly.","Brian T. Shea","Yes, we've only had a couple of weeks of data to monitor, but so far this year, there's a significant shift, both an increase in the inflows into mutual funds on the platform and a big shift from what was in 2012 primarily fixed income-oriented funds to more of a balance. And so you're seeing a big growth in equity mutual fund inflows, at least for the first couple of weeks. So hard to tell if that's a long term trend yet, but definitely a positive sign.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. That's really helpful. And then Todd, you provided some near-term outlook for spread revenues. Just putting aside that outsized deposited movement that we just spoke about for a minute, can you just discuss the reinvestment environment for the securities book as you see it? I mean, we've clearly seen some movement on the longer end of the curve, but not a lot on the shorter end, where I think, in my opinion, historically has mattered more for you guys.","Brian T. Shea","Yes, I think that's a good observation, Howard. The short end of the curve is more important at this point because the duration of our liabilities is more better matched there. When you look through the course of the year, even in a quarter, the decline that we've seen in the net interest margin is a reflection of 2 things, one is spreads and the other is balances, and it's about 50-50, and so we don't see the spread environment in the short end improving. In fact, we've pretty much gone through the repricing that you would have expected with the resets in the lower LIBOR rates. So it's a headwind, and we expect more of the same. As we had indicated, we're not expecting a better environment in 2013. We're expecting more of the same. We've got a couple of pretty tough punches in 2012 when the ECB eliminated the credit on excess reserves, as well as QE3, which dragged down mortgages, as well as some of the short end of the curve. So hopefully, we won't see those kind of events again in 2013, but we don't expect a lot of improvement.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Fantastic. And then final one for me, just on capital return. Todd, you mentioned the capital ratios continuing to grow and just continuing to plug along in the buyback. But on the near-term, the fourth quarter, did the buyback slow down due to timing of year or potentially the Meriten acquisition or something else? And then do you have any more overall [ph] thoughts on CCAR and 2013 as you enter the year with really strong Basel I and Basel III ratios?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes. At the end of 2012, as Gerald had mentioned, we saw a pretty sharp spike in our balances and most of that spike has since whittled away. But when we saw that, we actually saw a little bit of -- what could have been a little bit of pressure on our leverage ratio, and we thought it was on our interest to hold back on about $100 million or so of buybacks that we probably could have done to make sure that we had a strong leverage ratio and a strong CCAR that we could present for 2013. So we didn't want it to interfere at all with our 2013 efforts.","Operator","Our next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Two questions, one on the expense ratio. Todd, you mentioned that the expenses reflect the revenue profile that you have right now. Should I take that to mean that we're -- we should anticipate a higher expense ratio going forward until we see some rate hikes? Or that there's going to be another round of efforts on trying to lower the expense ratio? Or is this about as low as it can go?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes -- no, I think mix will be key to it, Betsy, and the fourth quarter was particularly soft for DRs. So if you just imagine, $100 million with very little variable expense from quarter-to-quarter. So it's going to be the revenue mix and DRs was the noisiest component of that revenue mix. So we had expected to improve a little bit as the revenue mix gets more normal and just some of the seasonal impact. So I think in your model, you will have to average that out a little bit better. We probably should have given you a little clearer guidance on that...","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And you are running ahead of your expense programs in terms of targeted improvement in the expenses?","Thomas P. Gibbons","We are -- yes, we're slightly ahead of where we would have expected to be. The cost are slightly less to get there, and the reason for that largely is because we allocated a lot of those costs in a restructuring charge against a gain that we took on the sale of a property.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Right, okay. And then from here, how should we think about the benefit of the program on earnings?","Thomas P. Gibbons","I think it's going to be consistent with what we have indicated in the past. Effectively, what the operational expense initiatives are doing for us is they're offsetting some of the growth related to pension, related to other benefits expenses, related to merit increases and some slight inflation in our other operating expenses. So those are matching themselves off. So in order to generate operating leverage, it's pretty hard if we don't show a little bit of growth outside of that to generate a whole lot of operating leverage. If we can generate 2% or 3% or 4% of revenue growth, then we'll -- then we can see some operating leverage. But again, we want you to be mindful of the revenue mix in that. So if NIR is flat and FX is flat and we're seeing in the lower margin business the revenue growth, and you're going -- then the operating leverage is going to be more challenging.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And then second question is on the capital ratio and you mentioned that part of the reason for the improvement this quarter was the lower RWA. Could you describe what's backing that? And I guess I just -- the follow-up on that is are you as able to pay out against lower RWAs as you are against earnings accreted improvements in the capital ratio?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, I mean, a couple of questions there. The reason for the little improvement in the Basel III Tier 1 common ratio, the numerator accounted for about 10 basis points, as we did see about $150 million or 10 basis point increase in the capital, and that's pretty consistent with what we would expect to retain in a quarter -- in a normal quarter. The denominator, we'd expect to get some benefit as we see some runoff typically in some of the higher weighted -- risk-weighted assets. This quarter, for the same reason that we got some improvement on the reserve, we got some improvement using the similar models. We got some improvement on the risk weighted assets as our historical data against a lot of retail analysis and commercial loans has improved dramatically. So as we've improved the quality of our portfolio, which reflected in our risk weights, and we've readdressed those risk weights in the quarter so we picked up some of the benefit of that so that was a little bit more of it. The 40 basis points in the denominator is probably heavy by about 20 to 25.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just thinking on the payout ratio, we hear that sustainable earnings, obviously very critical for payout ratios, and I'm just try to understand. Do you think that the improvement in the capital ratio that you got this quarter feeds into that much higher of ability to do the payouts in 2013? Or should we really be looking at what the earnings generation is driving in terms of improvement in the capital ratio?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Okay, let me make a couple of comments, and then Gerald probably want to make a comment or 2. Where -- the CCAR looks at things under normal and also under stress. And as we've indicated in the past, we intend to do pretty well because we've got some -- really, 2 things going for us. One is we don't rely on a lot of risky assets in order to generate our revenues, and the other thing is the mix of our businesses is a little less equity intensive so that a steep drop in the equity markets has a little less impact to us. So as a result, we can kind of continue to generate even through a pretty ugly environment like the ones that we've gone through for us. So it's really based on -- the payouts will be based on where we see our performance and what we see as being prudent, given where our capital ratios are. But certainly, it puts us in a position with stronger capital ratios than we would have expected at this point of the year to do a little better. I don't know, Gerald...","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes, so maybe I can add onto that a little bit. I think we're quite pleased with that 9.8% Basel III Tier 1 common ratio. I think it gives us an increased flexibility to consider capital actions. I would generally say that the dividend payout ratio and the 25% to 30% is probably something for all of us to think about. And the total payout ratio last year, we guided you to about the 65% range. I think we have the flexibility to see that north of that 65%.","Operator","Our next question is from Glenn Schorr with Nomura.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Quickie, as you -- I think this has been asked in the past, but just always want a little more color. If you look at assets under management, they're up nicely 10% year-on-year, and the fees associated up 15% x acquisitions. That's great and normal. Assets under custody, up 9% year-on-year. The servicing fees are flattish. You gave some pieces to that. But I guess the question is, is there a reason why that, over longer periods of time, wouldn't have the same rational relationship? Is something changing in the mix that we shouldn't expect fees and assets to grow in line with each other?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes. I think some of that, Glenn, has to do with the fact that Corporate Trust and DRs are included in the Investment Service revenues. And so I think our Asset Servicing fees have, in fact, been growing, but the Corporate Trust and DRs have been declining, particularly in this quarter. DR is more seasonal than structural, and at Corporate Trust, we've just seen a runoff in the structured products, which are impacting overall revenues. Asset Servicing fees have been growing, maybe not totally in line with the assets under custody. But maybe I'll ask Tim to comment specifically on that.","Timothy F. Keaney","Yes, sure. Glenn, it's Tim. Year-over-year, just a reminder, the Asset Servicing fees grew at 7% versus AUC of 9%, and I think you see a couple things. I think you see a little bit of a mixed shift. I think some of it is timing. I would certainly say that more of our new business converted towards the back end of the year. And then, frankly, a little bit of it is loss business by maintaining our strong pricing discipline. So hopefully, that answers your question.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Definitely. I appreciate all of that. Maybe a quickie on -- not the biggest number, just more curious. If you x FX, if you look at fixed income trading, it's had big swing up last quarter and down 46% this quarter. The explanation was lower interest rate trading revs. I'm just curious, we see -- if we look at the big broker-dealers, we're looking at like 15% swings, not a 46% swing. So just maybe a little explanation on what you're trading for whom on a quarterly basis as you grow out the global markets business.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Okay. There's -- there are really 2 activities there outside of -- or 2 key activities outside of FX and the other trading category. One of them is general fixed income trading, where we do make markets for our clients. So we saw that a little softer. And the thing that's more episodic is really around some interest rate trading. So we saw interest rate derivative trading. So we saw a fair number of interest rate derivative trading activity in the third quarter that we didn't see replicate itself in the fourth quarter. And the nature of that business, it is -- for us, sits on such a small number, Glenn, that a little change is a pretty significant impact percentage-wise.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Yes. No, I hear you, I hear you. Just more curious than anything else. The last one on -- a lot of talk about the collateral management opportunity. I know you're investing in it. We've seen some of the market participants not ready for central clearing. But -- so maybe a question on timing but also if you can even size the opportunity of -- and where you're at in the investment cycle for that opportunity.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes. Glenn, we continue to build out the capabilities. We've seen very good interest from the buy side. Traditionally, our collateral management has been supporting the dealer community, and we've seen some nice growth in our tri-party collateral balances. I think we produced a number for you. We are experiencing some fee growth in the area already where we're also seeing some net interest income growth in that area as we help optimize and transform some of the collateral for the dealer community in particular. So we're starting to see some good further attraction in this space. Part of the CSD announcement that we made is to support collateral services in Europe into the future. So we're excited about that. I know you all are anxious to see more transparency and information around this, and later in the year, I think we'll be able to put together some better numbers and direction for you. But we feel good about our progress, and we continue to see very good interest in it.","Operator","Our next question is from Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Yes. I was intrigued by your announcement last week that you're going to start the Central Security Depository in Europe. You just mentioned it. I'm wondering if you might comment on the cost of that and, really, the longer-term strategic possibilities. And then, also, do you think that's an opportunity that's unique to BNY Mellon because you have the corporate issuer client base, or can it be replicated by your global custodian peers?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Great question. I love that question. So, Tim, I'll -- yes, it's in your area. I'll ask you to address it.","Timothy F. Keaney","Sure. Look, it's a bright spot for us. You know the regulations are changing, both Dodd-Frank and EMIR coming up on us very quickly. So that's driving people to make decisions, partly around the collateral question that was just asked to Gerald. But more importantly, there's a number of CSDs in Europe. We're the only one that provides the full value chain of services, particularly the notary functions, so the things that happened before secondary trading, and we think that's a unique differentiator for us. We started to do this initially to defend our Issuer Services business in Europe. But as the bond business and Issuer Services business grows, we think this could become a needle mover for us. So I would say watch this space. But you correctly connect the CSD strategy to collateral. Because in a post Target2-Securities environment, T2S should go into effect in June 2015, you have to be a CSD to play in Central Bank money collateral. So that's the other reason why we did this, which has a much more strategic aspect to it, and connects our collateral ambitions here in the U.S. to our collateral ambitions in Europe.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Great. And then just could you quickly come back to whether you think that's a unique opportunity to you, and could State Street do it, for example?","Timothy F. Keaney","I would say relative to our traditional trust bank competitors, I don't think -- see anybody that can offer the level of services that we have, that the landscape's changing in terms of the current players like Euroclear and Clearstream. But again, I would say they're missing one important part of the value chain. But again, just think of this in terms of impact in 2013 as being somewhat modest and building over the next, I would say, 2 years.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And then on the collateral management, clearly, people are talking a lot about the revenue opportunity, but I think a lot less so about what this means to risk and the interconnectedness of the financial system. And I think in one sense this is just repo, but I'm wondering whether the types of collateral transformation I hear you say that you're going to engage in, say, like lending out treasuries for corporate bonds, whether we should be concerned about the contingent liquidity risk you and others are going to be taking on to facilitate those types of activities for your clients.","Gerald L. Hassell","Sure. No, it's a very good question and something we're very, very mindful of. We obviously need to continue to enhance our risk management capabilities in this space and ability to liquidate collateral if we had to, but don't think of all of the transformation occurring on our balance sheet. Some of our role is to be an intermediary between parties where we act as the agents. So in some cases, we'll use our clients' treasury through our treasuries in that transformation process. In other cases, we'll simply be the agent between the parties. So we don't always have to be the lender. Obviously, there's a lot of value in that, but they're -- you're correct in saying there's risk associated with it, and we have to be mindful of that risk and manage it very, very well. And so we are enhancing and building out our capabilities in that space to be able to handle it.","Thomas P. Gibbons","And, Luke, if I can add something to that. I mean, we're sitting on $90 billion or up to $90 billion in central bank deposits. If we can put a little bit of that to work to relatively short-term secured floating rate loans that effectively can convert a corporate bond to cash that can then be posted at a central clearer, that's a great trade and it comes with very little -- we certainly have the liquidity to handle it, and it comes with very, very little incremental risk and some incremental income.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And just a follow-up on that one and final question. Do you envision the bulk of your activities to be as the agent administrator or as principal? Like which of the 2 of those is the bigger revenue opportunity for you?","Gerald L. Hassell","Well, the immediate quick hit this is -- net interest income shows up with virtually no expense, and therefore, bottom line income. So you're going to see the more quick revenue hit in that space. But longer term, we want to have it be more at an agent position, where we get continuous repeatable fees, and that's what we expect out of this. And so it's creating that neural network, as we refer to, and have all the parties use us, principally as agent rather than acting as principal and using our balance sheet.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just to follow up on the NII and securities gains topic. Todd, I heard your comments about hoping to keep that combination of the 2 flat. But can you talk a little bit more about how risk is changing within it? And you obviously have a lot of unrealized gains left. But at some point, you're going to sacrifice net interest income for gains and that could run out. So I just want to understand how long you can see the visibility out on keeping those 2 kind of working together, because at some point you may not be able to keep the gains going in lieu of protecting your NII.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes. Actually, I look forward to that date because it probably implies a little higher interest rates, Ken. But the -- I think the simple way to think about this is we try to maintain a portfolio about 2 years in duration, relatively very low credit risk, as you can see from looking at it. So each quarter a quarter burns through and as we take -- as some of those securities come down and they get very rich because there's strong interest on the short -- on the relatively short end of the curve for those assets, we'll sell some of the richer securities and then we'll reinvest back out on the curve. That gives up -- it can give up a little bit of NII on a go-forward basis, but it's not too much. And that's why -- and it maintains the portfolio balance to where we want it. And that's why as we started to look more and more of this, it's exactly what's been going on, and we wanted to make sure investors see that and that we would intend to do that as long as the interest rate environment stays where it is. If the rate environment changes, so if we see a rise in rates, we'd probably do a little of extension duration. There would be no need for that type of activity, but we would be making up for it in our NIR.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And just cleaning up one, can you tell us what the accretion portion was this quarter?","Thomas P. Gibbons","I don't recall. Off the top of my head, it was probably around $60 million. It tends to come in about $5 million or so a quarter, as we had indicated in the past.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Right, okay. And then on a separate topic, good trajectory on custody. But what's getting harder to understand within that Asset Servicing line is how the custody fees are going. Following on Glenn's question, this quarter also looked like you had about the slowest win rate of new custody wins. So I was wondering if you can just kind of talk us through what's happening just on core custody revenues, because you have to x out collateral management, x out broker dealer services, x our security lending, and we don't see any of that. And then also if you could just touch on, like is anything changing with regards to the speed of new wins on the core custody side?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Tim, why don't you take that one?","Timothy F. Keaney","Yes, sure, I'll take that. But first, let me take them in kind of reverse order. Don't get overly concerned about that new business win rate because less of the business is geared to AUC, and that's something we need to think about. I've gone back and looked at over the last 6 quarters in terms of win and pipeline, it's been pretty consistent. And the mix and the ratio between AUC going up 9% year-on-year and fees going up 7% I talked a little bit about earlier, I wouldn't be overly concerned about that, although the mix is changing a bit. And so we are doing more of middle office outsourcing and transfer agency and things. But there's also some good news in there. You're also seeing the repricing that we've been implementing now for some time has some traction, and so I wouldn't say -- I'd also just say that the business continues to be very competitive, especially in the large end of the market. So no, I can't tell you there's been any significant shift there, Ken.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes. The assets under custody wins from quarter-to-quarter are pretty lumpy. If you get some big ones in 1 quarter, you won't necessarily see them in the next quarter. So that's not a steady state. But we are seeing a steady state in terms of the increased interest in mid-office and derivatives, servicing and a variety of other things. So -- some of which require -- that are slow to ramp up on the revenue side, even with the announcement that we make, and over time, that we expect those revenues to come in.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then my third question -- last question is just on Issuer Services. And you guys had very much given us an understanding of the seasonal decline that we would expect to see in DRs and then also the ongoing challenges on the structured finance runoff, which you've given that kind of that 50 or 75 basis point headwind. So how close are we to -- it's tough now to talk about it sequentially because of the seasonality. But as far as just the business is concerned, as we think about the year ahead, knowing what we know about the environment, at what point are we getting to a kind of a bottoming of those 2 line items? And do you expect growth in Issuer Services as we look ahead on a year-over-year basis?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes. I'll make a couple of comments there. First of all, let's split Issuer Services into 2 businesses, there's Corporate Trust and there's DRs. So DRs is a cyclical business. It's a -- it's really largely driven by the developing markets and the BRICs. So we're seeing softness in new capital development there and M&A and any type of corporate action. So that -- and that tends to be somewhat cyclical. So with the global downturn, it's reflected even more dramatically there. Back in September, when we did an analysis, unfortunately, we don't -- we haven't computed those numbers yet, when we looked at the total number of corporate actions in the DR space, it was down about 30% year-over-year and that's what really drives the revenue base there. So that's going to come with the cycle. So we -- if you expect an uptick and a little combinations and corporate actions in the developing world, we'll see that. And -- but if not, it'll -- it could get -- it'll stay here. And that -- then that will have some impact, as I mentioned, on leverage because it doesn't come both ways. There's not a lot of expenses associated with it. With -- in terms of Corporate Trust, that's more a reflection. We're seeing okay business in most components of it. But the non-agency book and the CLO-CEO book continues to run off. There are some CLOs being created, and we're getting our market share of those, at least. But it's not fast enough to stop that decline that we've seen, which we would probably expect over the next couple of years.","Karen B. Peetz","Yes. And, Ken, the only thing I would like to add, it's Karen Peetz, is that we did see some great spots. It's not enough to kind of set a trend for Depositary Receipts. But December of the quarter, we had some optimism where the pipeline's up pretty significantly as we head into the new year. And then the only thing I'd amplify on Todd's comment about CLOs is we are the market leader as those new CLOs are coming to market. There are 127 all of last year, of which we won 33%. So hopefully, it will begin to offset the decline that's happening on the existing book.","Operator","Our next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I want to go back to NII for just one sec. Todd, you talked about in the past is you kind of trying to keep net interest income flattish. Balance sheet is up about 12% year-over-year, and I get that interest rates are lower. But you guys talked in the past about trying to reinvest little bit more. So I guess should we think about the decline in NII, just from a dollar perspective, as a sign you guys not being able to reinvest quickly enough or I guess the rate compression is a little bit worse? And again, what gives you confidence that you guys can, again, kind of keep the number flattish from here if rates stay where they are?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, I'd say there are 2 things. Number one, the contraction rates was a little heavier than we had expected and QE3 drove some of that. And the one thing that hasn't moved as quickly as we had hoped is some of that secured lending that we just described. So our view is we're going to see some burn off of assets. We can fight that headwind if we have the growth in our collateral services business and the principal lending side of that business. That will basically moderate it, along with the repayment of some of our trust preferreds. And -- but spreads are tough. I mean, there's no question about it. And the -- with the Fed in there buying mortgages, they've become so rich. It doesn't really make sense to put some of the shorter-duration mortgages on our -- in our book. So that's -- the way we sustain the NII that we have is going to be -- and the securities gains is going to be a combination of managing the portfolio the way we had described and putting more of that money to work at a little faster pace. We weren't as successful as we would've like to have been this quarter.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And a follow-up on the collateral transformation opportunity for you guys. I understand there's still lots of questions around the size of the market and how much collateral is actually going to be needed over time. But I guess when you think about the incremental NIM pickup for you guys, what is it today? You mentioned $90 billion sitting deposits with the Fed or just in treasuries, earning 25-ish basis points. What do you guys get currently on secured lending, which I guess we could try to use as a proxy for what you would do on the -- what you would get on the collateral transformation opportunity?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, it can be all over the place based on the counterparty and the collateral underneath it. But it would certainly be 35 to 75 basis points higher than which you would see holding the money at the Fed, Alex. And the way to think about it is we would like to see the book grow by $20 billion, and so that's some of the -- that would be our ability to offset some of that spread contraction headwind.","Gerald L. Hassell","And, Alex, just a little bit of other color. The fourth quarter between the physical (sic) [fiscal] cliff in Europe and a variety of other things that were going on, I think people, particularly towards the end of the quarter, were really in a risk-off mode in terms of leaving a lot of cash all around the world. We're already starting to see some of that cash go back to work. Hopefully, we'll see some more capital markets activities and, therefore, demand for borrowed securities in the sec lending side, demand for further collateral transformation as people pick up their trading activities. So we're a little bit more hopeful than -- concerning the fourth quarter activity, that market activity will pick up in that space, and therefore, we'll be able to put some more money to work.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then just the last one for me. I was hoping you could dissect the Issuer Services a little bit. I think we kind of -- the picture on the DR side of the business is clear, some of that is cyclical, and that's certainly shown up in the numbers. But when you think about the Corporate Trust business, 2012 was still a pretty good year for total DCM activity, so to speak. Corporate high yield was probably one of the better issue of the year as we've seen. So is there a way to kind of tease out, I guess, the sensitivity to your business if we see a decline in kind of corporate issuance and I guess couple that with the fact that the structured credit stuff, which I guess is about $100 million of annual revenues or so, keeps running off?","Karen B. Peetz","Right. So it's Karen again. The high yield and the corporate debt types tend to be our lower fees. And there's also -- even though high yield, as an example, we always dominate, it's still a small number of deals in the realm of kind of global issuance. So that can't kind of carry the day. The other thing is the structured book has historically been the highest fee and margin. And so as that's runs off and also as new deals are coming in priced less than the old deals were, you get this kind of real churn that's happening in the business. So to a large extent, how we're reacting is to just transform the business model. We've gone to a more functional alignment so that we can manage the expenses. And we're in this kind of wait-and-see mode. We have a great footprint. We have a great kind of strategic capability, but we're very much going to have a lot more flexibility in how we can manage expenses as we go forward.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Bedell with ISI Group.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Could you just flesh out the expenses a little bit more in the fourth quarter? I mean, just looking to try to understand the trajectory as we go into 2013 in a few lines, such as professional services and software and equipment and business development. They looked a little high. Just wondering if you can frame out the seasonality of that versus what we might see in 2013 and also talk about the pace of the cost-saving initiatives. I think you're targeting a little over $400 million for 2013. Is that still the number we should be thinking of? And so I guess what I'm getting at is are we still looking at around a $2.8 billion quarterly run rate, or do you think you can improve upon that?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Sure, Brian. Answering the question around our initiatives, I think you should look at what we had -- the guidance that we had previously given, and we expect that we will be in line with that guidance for 2013. That's what we certainly budgeted for. In terms of some of the quarter-end driving expenses, I mean, we saw some seasonal things, like our donations were up, our marketing expenses were up. We tend to have a conference. In fact, we had 1 conference that we only have every 4 years was -- it came in this fourth quarter. As well, it tends to be -- we take a hard look at some of our assets in terms of software, and there were a couple of write-offs there. And typically, that will happen in the fourth quarter, and it can also be related to our operational excellence initiatives as we start to sunset some of the systems. We're also making some investment in our brands as well, and we'll roll that out in the first quarter.","Gerald L. Hassell","That being said, Brian, given the environment that we're operating in, we just have to be very, very disciplined around our expenses. And it's one of the things I said in my opening comments, we're going to continue to try to drive efficiencies across our operating platforms and our expense base. So it's something we have a lot of focus on and a lot of attention on.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So it sounds like that $2.8 billion is a little elevated, and as you go into 2013, the cost-saving initiatives should help offset some of the natural inflation from a base that's a little bit lower than $2.8 billion on a quarterly basis. Is that fair to say?","Gerald L. Hassell","I think you're spot on, on that.","Thomas P. Gibbons","I think that's fair. And be careful to -- as you design your model, think about the revenue mix.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Right. Right, of course, okay. And then on -- and asset servicing, Tim, maybe can you talk about how the pricing initiative is going? I know you repriced a lot of the lower base -- or do you expect some more attrition to come from some of those repriced agreements in 2013? And if you can talk about that in conjunction with the business that you're winning on the mid-office, maybe just sort of a net outlook for growth in Assets Service and revenue in 2013 in that area.","Timothy F. Keaney","Sure. Why don't I start with something I haven't mentioned yet, Brian, which is we have an excellent pipeline of business that will convert over the next 3 quarters so -- of the wins that we have not converted yet, which is significant, it's a little over $800 billion, so that's 1.5 kind of quarters of activity in value that hasn't quite converged yet into the run rate. But on pricing, just to remind you, this is a long-term strategy for us, structurally realigning the business. We started with the low end of the client base, as you'll recall. The way I would think about is if you look at Asset Servicing fees, not Investment Services fees, but Asset Servicing fees, we think we've got pricing power over, let's say, 10% to 12%. We've been raising prices steadily where we're allowed contractually to do so. We're retaining 75% of the clients with about a 20% uplift. I don't think that's going to change at all. We're staying very disciplined on that. And the great news there is that'll drop straight to the bottom line. So we've only got about 10% of that showing up in the run rate yet, so I think there's upside there. But because of the nature of when clients are repricing, we're largely timing the repricing out to when client contracts come up for review. That will largely be done by the first quarter of 2015. And personally, I think the more impactful thing over time will be the other end of the spectrum, which is those very large clients where we see opportunity to do a lot more in places like collateral in our global markets capabilities, and that's something we focused on as well.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And large part of that $800 million is mid-office that's coming in?","Timothy F. Keaney","It's really mixed, Brian. You would see a core bundle of Asset Servicing with securities lending and foreign exchange and accounting. And then you'd see about half of it, which are things like middle office outsourcing, transfer agency, fund administration and that is something. That mix has shifted slightly over time. So it's about 50-50.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then just real quick on the net interest revenue outlook of staying flat. Does that include the assumption of deploying some of the $90 billion of central bank deposits into higher-yielding secured loans, Todd?","Thomas P. Gibbons","It does, Brian.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then money market fee waivers for the fourth quarter. Could you mention the EPS hit from that, and then whether you'd see fee waivers moving up in the first quarter, given that little bit of a decline in short-term rates?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes. The money market fee waivers were consistent with what we had seen in the third quarter, so there really hasn't been much of a change. There's actually slightly improved from where we were on a year-over-year basis. So right now, I don't -- of course, if you're seeing any -- I don't think we're seeing any real change into the first quarter as well.","Timothy F. Keaney","No, in Investment Management, fee waivers were the lowest negative impact to us that they have been in 6 quarters, and it's been pretty steady so far. We're still sorting through sort of the year-end flows and impact on repo markets and whatnot. So -- but I would say it's definitely improved from a year ago.","Operator","Our final question today is from Josh Levin with Citigroup.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So someday, interest rates will go up. And when interest rates go up, that's certainly very positive for your business overall. But given that most of your assets are fixed income, is there a partial drag on your revenues, because higher rates means lower fixed income volumes just because of the way duration works and that means -- translates to lower servicing fees? I mean, how should we think about that relationship?","Thomas P. Gibbons","And maybe a few of my colleagues can jump in here on this question but if you had a very sharp sell-off in fixed income, that would probably be a price change across the portfolio, pretty modest. If it was 5%, that would be a lot. And for most of our Asset Servicing businesses, our fees are not necessarily a function. They're not -- it's not like AUM where it's a basis points. There's a little bit of that. But most of the fees are related to transactions, as well as to accounts. So there's 3 different sources of fees. So you might see a modest decline in the AUC, assets under administration, and a very modest decline in the amount of fee -- related fee revenue to it.","Timothy F. Keaney","And, Todd, if I could just add one other thing. Josh, it's Tim. Back to this whole collateral theme, I would hasten to guess we're the largest custodian of U.S. treasuries in the world. And as these regulations take effect, where we've talked a little bit about what the increase in volume will demand in terms of posting a collateral, a lot of those U.S. treasuries are going to be needed. And that's why we link that back directly to an inherent medium-term strength, whether it's transforming the collateral or through our traditional securities lending and financing capabilities. I think that's going to be a big plus for us.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And my final question is on the tri-party repo market. There have been some changes there in terms of structurally and working with the fed. Are you seeing -- are there any changes to pricing or margin in that market?","Gerald L. Hassell","Essentially, no. We're putting through the \"tri-party reform,\" working with the industry, both the buy side and the sell side. Pricing for our services is held up as it has been in the past. There's been more activity. I think the main issue around tri-party reform is taking risk out of the system, and I think we're making very good progress on doing that. So it's not a pricing issue. It's really a reform issue on taking risk, intraday risk out of the system.","Karen B. Peetz","And the only thing I would add is that we have been pricing for daylight that hadn't been priced before, and so there has been some revenue benefit from that, but it's modest.","Gerald L. Hassell","Thank you. Well, thank you very much everyone for your interest and dialing in today. Sorry we couldn't get to everyone's questions. If you have further questions, please give Andy Clark and the team a direct call, and we'll be happy to follow up with you. Thanks again, everyone.","Operator","If there are any additional questions or comments, you may contact Mr. Andy Clark at (212) 635-1803. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Please go ahead.","Magda Palczynska","Good morning. Today, BNY Mellon released its results for the second quarter of 2019. The earnings press release and the financial highlights presentation to accompany this call are both available on our website at bnymellon.com. Charlie Scharf, BNY Mellon's Chairman and CEO, will lead the call; then Mike Santomassimo, our CFO, will take you through our earnings presentation.

Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, July 17, 2019, and will not be updated.","With that, I will hand over to Charlie.","Charles Scharf","Thank you, Magda. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'll share some overall thoughts about our second quarter performance, then I'll hand it off to Mike who will then take you through the financials in more detail. We reported earnings per share of $1.01, down 2% versus a year ago. Total revenue was down 5% year-on-year. As we anticipated, the level and shape of the yield curve negatively impacted our results due to lower NII. In addition, continued low levels of volatility and overall muted market activity negatively impacted our foreign exchange and securities lending activities in Asset Servicing. And our Asset Management business suffered from the impact of lower assets under management and the impact of divestitures.","Against that backdrop, we continue to maintain strong expense discipline without sacrificing investments for the future of our franchise. Total expenses were down 4%. This includes a significant increase in our technology investment, which was more than offset by savings in other areas. So we're being very judicious and ruthlessly prioritizing investments while also benefiting from our continued progress in increasing our underlying efficiency.","On the capital front, return on tangible common equity was 21%. Our capital ratios remain strong, and we continue to return the substantial amount of capital back to our shareholders. We're increasing our quarterly common stock dividend by 11% to $0.31 per share starting in Q3. We also plan to repurchase up to $3.94 billion of common stock through the second quarter of 2020, an increase of around 20%.","The significant impact of lower NII on our business certainly impacts our thinking of how we manage the company in the short term, but it does not change our longer-term focus and our work to build out our franchisees. Our business mix is unique, our market positions are strong, and we see opportunities across the company to build out a stronger longer-term growth profile.","Pershing is a great example. We occupy a great position serving the wealth community and continue to invest in our market-leading platform to serve independent broker-dealers, but we also continued to invest significantly to capture more of the fast-growing RIA segment. We held our annual client event this quarter with attendance by a couple of thousands of our clients and partners. At that meeting, we announced a series of initiatives aimed at improving our clients' experiences.","We're streamlining and digitizing customer onboarding for our clients to enable them to spend to more time, what they do best. We're also rolling out a new capability that will allow firms and advisers to use net asset flows and KPIs to measure their overall business performance and identify trends in their business more quickly. We've also just released a new technology assessment tool to help advisory firms pinpoint their technology needs, identify the right technology stacks and drive better returns on technology investments at a time when clients are increasingly struggling with those topics.","And as we said over the last few quarters, we're moving beyond the impact of the client losses that impacted our results over the last year and expect to see continued improvement in our revenue growth as we onboard a series of new mandates later this year. In addition, our sales pipeline continues to be strong.","In Clearance and Collateral Management, you see another example where we have distinct competitive advantages and are seeing continued strong performance. Given our role in servicing both in the buy and sell side and our status as the sole provider of U.S. government clearing, we can help clients optimize their funding needs in a way that others just can't. We continue to generate additional revenue through collateral optimization services as well as attracting incremental balances. ","In addition, client activity and market demand is driving increased securities settlement volumes and growth in collateral management balances. We continue to see strong U.S. government securities settlement volumes driven by elevated levels of U.S. Treasury issuance and secondary market trading. This business should continue to be a source of strong organic growth. Both banks as well as nonbanks are seeking access to our government securities settlement platforms and access to U.S. dollar funding market through tri-party and other repo clearing capabilities.","As we increase the coordination of our government securities clearance platform and our global collateral management capabilities, we expect to provide enhanced capabilities across regions especially as we develop interoperability across those regions and assets. We're currently working to build the next-generation global collateral platform to support these capabilities as well as enhance resiliency and data and analytic capabilities not currently available in the market. We think it will significantly boost our ability to attract new market participants as well as additional business from our existing clients. In addition, the business remains focused on technology-enabled solutions for our clients, facilitating optimization of collateral across our platform as well as for collateral held away from us and the ability to monitor intraday liquidity credit usage on-demand with our proprietary APIs.","We're also seeing progress in Issuer Services. Our reduced CLO platform has been received well by clients and should provide the foundation for us to compete more effectively. We continue to see good business momentum in Corporate Trust as we gain market share in a number of our key debt products. ","In Treasury Services, while we're challenged by the impact of the yield curve, we do see some success in our focus on expanding our client relationships, which was -- has resulted in higher deposit balances. While these are interest-bearing deposits predominantly, they are from strong relationships across multiple geographies and we think strengthens our business over the long term. We remain focused on building our liquidity, trade finance and payments businesses as well. ","In Asset Servicing, although equity markets particularly in the U.S. have been strong, reduced client activity and the impact of the yield curve has negatively impacted our financial results, but we continue to experience important new wins across client segments and geographies. Just to highlight 2 of them: We were recently awarded mandates by ATP, Denmark's largest pension fund; and in the U.S., we were named Microsoft's new Global Custodian for their treasury operations, the first time in nearly a decade that Microsoft has switched custodians. And we continue to expand our service and capabilities for higher-growth asset classes, such as alternatives and ETFs. In fact, assets under custody related to ETF servicing are up roughly 50% against a year ago, a sign of our traction in the marketplace. ","The client response to our commitment to work with third parties to more closely integrate the front-to-back operating model has been positive. Our alliance with BlackRock has also been well received, and we're in the process of enabling our integrated functionality to several joint clients and continue to have extensive discussions across existing and potentially new clients. ","And as I mentioned, and Mike will cover in more detail, low levels of volatility and market activity have significantly impacted our foreign exchange and securities lending activities. While we haven't seen a change in these trends just yet, they can and will change very quickly at some point, we will be the beneficiary of that.","In our Asset Management business, though our performance in Asset Management was negatively impacted from cumulative outflows over the past year, the level of outflows in our higher-margin products has slowed and we're seeing continued improvement, investment performance, particularly in some of our larger equity strategies. ","In our Wealth business, we were negatively impacted by the interest rate environment, but our assets under management flows, where we get paid for investment advice, continued to be positive.","On the expense side, you see the impact of our continued focus on using our resources wisely. We have not announced a special program to reduce expenses, but as I think you can see in our results and will continue to see, we're embedding quality improvement and a clear focus on increasing efficiency into the BNY Mellon culture and how we manage the company. This includes eliminating unnecessary management layers across every area of the firm, from staff to sales to operations; automating processes which are today manual; and rethinking the flow of activity between us and our clients.","Just a reminder, while these activities will result in lower expenses, it's actually more important that they will increase the quality of the work we do for our clients. While it sounds more strategic to discuss new capabilities we're building, which we are, there's a meaningful opportunity to improve our growth trajectory by differentiating our firm through the quality of the work we delivered day in and day out. We're far from done here. This is a multi-year journey and the ability to continue to drive benefits for both our clients and ourselves continues to be extremely meaningful. ","And as I mentioned earlier, though our expenses declined this quarter, they continue to include a significant increase in technology and product development investments. While some of these expenses are discretionary to some extent, we remain committed to these investment to build the business for the future. We will continue to keep an eye on the impact to the environment and our business and know that we have this lever and others to pull if we choose to reduce the expense base even more significantly. But we believe we should protect these investments as much as we can as they will drive much of the future success of the company. Having said that, we remain confident that our ability to continue to drive improved quality and drive efficiency will offset these investments for the next couple of quarters. ","We also continue to bring in and elevate exceptional talent to help us accelerate our progress. There have been a couple of talent changes worth highlighting. Bill Daley has joined s Vice Chairman and will be responsible for overseeing our government affairs, philanthropy and corporate and social responsibility efforts. I've known Bill for many years and couldn't be more excited to attract someone with his reputation, abilities, experience and judgment. Jim Crowley has become CEO of Pershing. Jim has spent his career at Pershing and has overseen a broad range of responsibilities, from sales operations, most recently serving at the Chief Operating Officer. He knows our clients, systems and organization, so it's been a quick and seamless transition. Most importantly, Jim understands the importance of not missing a beat with our business while thinking through where we can go to play an even bigger role in the support of the growing Wealth business.","And we just announced that Jolen Anderson will be joining in September as Head of Human Resources. I've known and worked with Jolen and know how important she will be in our journey at creating a high-performance culture that can support the growth of our business. ","So in closing, we in the industry will have to continue navigating market challenges as the yield curve creates headwinds in the short term, but believe that we will be beneficiaries of Central Bank actions as we are confident they will ultimately result in stronger global economic growth and stronger market activity.","We have not changed our belief that opportunities across the franchise to drive higher growth exist, and we continue to remain focused on balancing our short-term performance with building our company for the longer term. With that, let me turn the call over to Mike.","Michael Santomassimo","Thanks, Charlie. But let me run through the details of our results in the quarter. All comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless I specify otherwise. Beginning on Page 4 of the financial highlights document. In the second quarter, total revenue was down 5% to $3.9 billion. This mainly reflected lower net interest income, the impact of prior year outflows and divestitures in Asset Management and reductions in foreign exchange and securities lending, which were driven in part by market factors. Total fee revenue was down 3% year-on-year. Within Investment Services, we saw fees grow across a number of our businesses. Net interest revenue was down 12% and expenses were down 4%. This resulted in an 8% decline in pretax income to $1.3 billion, $969 million in net income applicable to common shareholders and a 2% decrease in earnings per share to $1.01, which was helped by our common stock repurchases. And our pretax operating margin was 33%. ","Moving now to capital and liquidity on Page 5. Our capital and liquidity ratios remained strong. As of June 30, our key ratios were stable and up since the end of the first quarter. Common equity Tier 1 capital totaled $18.5 billion and our CET1 ratio was 11.2% under the Advanced Approach. Our average LCR in the second quarter was 117%. The SLR was 6.3%. And as Charlie indicated, we are pleased with the significant capital return that we announced a few weeks ago. ","Now looking at net interest revenue on Page 6. As I mentioned, net interest revenue was down 12% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Total average deposits were up both year-over-year and sequentially. This was driven by higher interest-bearing deposits partially offset by the expected decline in non-interest-bearing deposits. The rates paid on interest-bearing deposits increased from 99 basis points in the first quarter of 2019 to 104 basis points in the second quarter. Despite the expectations for lower rates, pricing has continued to be competitive throughout the second quarter but appears to have stabilized. Loan balances declined in Pershing and Clearance and Collateral Management primarily driven by lower client demand for leverage. The net interest margin decreased 8 basis points sequentially, driven by the impact of higher deposit rates and lower market rates impacting our reinvestment yield.","On Page 7, we'll go into more detail about how our net interest revenue changed versus the first quarter. As I said, net interest revenue was down 5% sequentially, which was at the low end of the range we provided with our first quarter results. At that time, I'd said that we expected that average non-interest-bearing deposits would continue to come down and that the rate paid on interest-bearing deposits would continue to increase due to competition. Both of these happened as expected.","At that point, we also expected the yield in our securities portfolio to be relatively flat to the first quarter. Given the downturn in rates since then, the yield on securities portfolio was actually down approximately 5 basis points. U.S. short-term rates moved 5 to 20 basis points lower during the quarter, impacting our loans and floating rate securities. The longer end of the curve is lower by between 30 and 40 basis points, impacting our fixed rate securities portfolio reinvestment yields. European government securities yields are also lower. As reminder, about 1\/3 of our portfolio reprices every quarter. Including the lower yield on the secured portfolio is the negative impact from higher premium amortization. These reductions were partially offset by the higher interest-bearing deposit balances and we took advantage of short-term investment opportunities. ","We're taking action to increase NII while maintaining our current risk profile. For example, we sold low-yielding munis in the quarter and reinvested in high-grade CLOs and other asset-backed securities. We also took advantage of attractive pricing in the reverse repo market and are selectively investing in short-term loan assets as well as optimizing funding in long-term debt issuance.","Now Page 8 details our expenses. On a consolidated basis, expenses of $2.65 billion were down 4%. Approximately 1% of the decrease was driven by the favorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. The remaining decrease reflects lower staff expense and our continued expense discipline which resulted in decreases in most other expense categories while absorbing a significant increase in technology investment, which is reflected in staff, professional, legal and other purchase services as well as software and equipment warrants.","As discussed over the last couple quarters, we have executed a number efficiency initiatives, including organization streamlining, which helped drive the expense improvement in the quarter. We remain confident that we can become significantly more efficient in the future.","Turning to Page 9. Total investment service revenue was down 3%. Assets under custody and administration increased 6% year-over-year to $35.5 trillion, primarily reflecting higher market values and net new business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. Within Asset Servicing, revenue was down 8% to $1.4 billion, primarily reflecting lower net interest revenue, foreign exchange and securities lending, lower client activity and the unfavorable impact of the stronger dollar. As you can see, foreign exchange and other trading revenues down 11%. In foreign exchange, client activity was modestly lower and volatility has been historically low for some time. ","Securities lending has also been negatively impacted by lower demand and tighter spreads. Although revenue was down, the securities available to lend increased 15%, which should position us well as the markets change. Consistent with the last number of quarters, we don't see an acceleration in pricing headwinds in the business, just a continuation of what we have seen in recent years.","In Pershing, revenue was up 1% to $564 million and up 2% sequentially, reflecting the impact of higher client assets and growth in accounts and clearing volumes, partially offset by lower net interest revenue. The sequential increase includes a small piece of the new business pipeline that we've been talking about, which we expect to impact the results later in the year and have a more meaningful impact next year.","Issuer Services had a good quarter. Revenue was up 3% to $446 million, benefiting from higher Depository Receipt fees and higher volumes in Corporate Trust, partially offset by lower net interest revenue in Corporate Trust. The 13% sequential increase primarily reflects higher fees in both businesses. The sequential increase in Depository Receipts was primarily driven by timing of corporate actions and a little increased transaction volume. We continue to see good business momentum in Corporate Trust.","In Treasury Services, revenue was down 4% to $317 million, reflecting lower net interest revenue. Although total Treasury Services deposits are up, we are seeing the impact of the shift from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing deposits and higher cost of it -- of the interest-bearing deposits.","Clearance and Collateral Management revenue was up 6% to $284 million due to growth in current volumes in collateral management due to the new government clearing clients that we converted last year in other new clients as well as higher clearance volumes related to heightened levels of U.S. Treasury issuances. Average tri-party collateral management balances were up 21%. Approximately 2\/3 is from the client conversions and the remainder is from new business and more activity from existing clients.","Page 10 summarizes the key drivers that affected the year-over-year revenue comparisons for each of the Investment Services business. ","Now turning to Investment Management on Page 11. Total Investment Management revenue was down 10%. Asset Management revenue was down 12% year-over-year to $618 million, primarily reflecting the change in AUM which was impacted by the cumulative outflows since the second quarter of 2018, partially offset by higher market values. It also reflects the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar principally versus the British pound and the impact of divestitures and hedging activities. Just a reminder, performance fees can vary based on client anniversary dates and were lower compared to significant outperformance last year, particularly in LDI. ","We had outflows of $24 billion in the quarter, primarily driven by $22 billion in outflows from low-fee index strategies with 2\/3 of that from a single client that took assets in-house. We had equity outflows of $2 billion for the quarter. Despite the outflows, we had strong investment performance in our largest equity strategies. We had $4 billion of outflows from fixed income products, and multi-asset and alternatives inflows turned positive at $1 billion. We had $1 billion in LDI inflows and $2 billion in cash inflows and overall assets under management of $1.8 trillion, which were up 2% year-over-year due to higher markets, partially offset by the impact of the stronger dollar and net outflows. ","Wealth Management revenue was down 5% year-over-year and 1% sequentially to $299 million, with both decreases primarily reflecting lower net interest revenue partially offset by higher market values. Within Wealth Management, client assets increased 1% and were up sequentially 2% to $257 billion.","Turning to our Other segment on Page 12. Noninterest expense decreased year-over-year, reflecting lower staff and occupancy expense related to consolidating our real estate that was recorded in the second quarter of 2018. ","Now looking ahead to the third quarter, there are a few things you should consider. With respect to net interest revenue, let me walk you through some assumptions, but as always, you should make your own assumptions as well. Based on what we see today, our interest-bearing deposits will be similar to the second quarter. We expect that average non-interest-bearing deposits will continue to come down. The rate environment has been changing quickly and the forward curve is currently pricing in at least two cuts this year, and as a result, we expect the securities portfolio yield will decline in the third quarter.","The competition for deposits remains high and deposit repricing is difficult to predict with a high degree of certainty but we expect the betas on the back of the Fed rate cuts will be close to 100% for some parts of the deposit book but the overall beta will be less than 100%. Given these assumptions, we would expect the sequential percentage decline in net interest revenue to be similar to what we saw in the second quarter, depending on the yield curve, deposit pricing and non-interest-bearing deposit volumes. Keep in mind that depending on the on balance sheet and market dynamics, there may be shifts of revenue between net interest income and FX and the other trading volume. And I would continue to caution you that's very early in the quarter and the environment has been dynamic.","Although equity markets have been rising, a little less than 1\/3 of our AUM is correlated to the equity markets. So you should factor that into your expectations for Q3 Investment Management fees. ","And a reminder that we had some notable items in the third quarter of 2018 which you should factor into your modeling. And lastly, while we remain committed to continue to invest more in technology and product development, we will continue to monitor the impact of the environment in our businesses and know that we have levers to pull if necessary to further reduce our expense base.","With that, operator, can you please open up the lines for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth Usdin","I just have to ask on that rates part of the outlook, Mike. So you said 1\/3 of the book reprices every quarter. And I'm just wondering if you can elaborate further on just the pace of change, what that means for investment yields, just presuming this curve environment. I'm assuming that then means then, if even we'll stay here, we'll have continued pressure past the third quarter. Can you elaborate on that? And also just where -- how your -- that magnitude of change and duration, where the duration stands today.","Michael Santomassimo","Ken, thanks for the question. So as you would expect, I'll make sure I cover all pieces of it there and take it apart, right. But on the duration, as you would expect, given the down-tick in rates, the durations come down just naturally as pre-pays have gone up in the mortgage back book. We've -- as we continue to take action on the maturities that come through the portfolio, we add a little bit of duration back. But overall, it's ticked down slightly sort of in the -- sequentially in the quarter. As you sort of think about the impact of lower rates, there is a lag as that sort of kind of bakes into the book if 1\/3 of it's repricing every quarter. So I think that you should be able to model that pretty easily, I think.","Kenneth Usdin","Okay. And my quick follow-up is then, just you mentioned I guess trading rate risk for credit risk. Can you just talk about the philosophy at this point in the economic cycle of making that move, and your confidence from a risk management perspective?","Michael Santomassimo","Yes. I think in the -- you're talking about some of the changes we've made in the securities portfolio with be the munis and CLOs and et cetera, that I mentioned. Is that where you're -- what this was about?","Kenneth Usdin","Yes, that's it, that's it. Yes.","Michael Santomassimo","Yes, yes, look. I mean, I think when you look at what we did, it's -- one, it's not a major sort of driver in the book. But the munis we sold were yielding below IOER. And so all we did was sort of redeploy those in some very high quality asset-backeds and CLOs. And so I wouldn't take those as a bet or a direct -- a big change in direction of the book.","Charles Scharf","Now I would -- this is Charlie. The only thing I would add is I would just take it as we're going through everything that impacts NII to figure out what we can and should do on the margin that can be additive without changing the risk profile in a real material way.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","A couple of questions. So on the expense side this quarter, really good results. Wanted to understand. I know you gave some basic explanation on where that came from, but maybe you could drill down a little bit on how much more expense cuts you could continue to do that are not touching the investment spend. Because we get the message on NIIs coming down, but I think part of the story this quarter was you were able to offset that with the expense cuts.","Charles Scharf","Yes. Betsy, it's Charlie. Listen, I've been very, very consistent I think since the day I got here about what we say on this, and nothing is different, which we continue to believe that there are meaningful opportunities to reduce expenses and that will continue for a relatively long period of time, meaning beyond what we actually even think about at this point. It cuts across a whole series of initiatives. Everything, as I've talked about, from reducing layers, location of employees, automation of things like reconciliations, instructions with clients, corporate actions, NAV automate, I mean, we'll do the long list of things that we're constantly looking at. ","And what I'd say is in an environment like this, you get even more focused on figuring out what you can do more quickly to have actually impact our results. Again, we do it because it drives quality. The byproduct of that, quite frankly, is that we become more efficient at this. And so as time goes on, I think we get more and more confident that there continues to be more opportunity for us, which is why I made the comments relative to the efficiencies relative to the size of the investments we have to make.","We think, as I said for the remaining couple of quarters, the efficiencies will more than offset the increases. But if we think the environment warrants a change in the level of investment, we can do that. But we feel very, very positive about where we're going with the expense trajectory of the company in a way which is positive for our clients.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.","Steven Chubak","So I wanted to dig in a little bit to the securities book and some of the NII disclosure. And you spoke of some changes to the securities mix and maybe reinvesting in CLOs. You also talked about potential to optimize some of the higher-cost funding sources. I'm just wondering whether some of those changes or some of those actions are contemplated as part of the NII guide.","Michael Santomassimo","Yes. I mean, look, all if it is contemplated, Steve, as we sort of look at it. And as Charlie mentioned, sort of we're going through every last piece of it, that sort of builds up to drive NII. And we're going to continue to work to optimize it as best as we can without substantially changing sort of the risk profile that we've got.","Steven Chubak","Got it. And just one -- for my follow-up, I wanted to ask about capital ratios and maybe more specifically try to get a sense as to, as you look out over the next couple of years, just given the strength of your CCAR track record, how you're thinking about managing or determining what's the appropriate capital target, especially in anticipation of the fact that the SCB could potentially be deployed or implemented as early as 2020.","Michael Santomassimo","Yes. Look, Steve, I think we've got to just kind of let the capital rules get finalized, right? And hopefully that will happen sooner rather than later, but we've been waiting for a while for that. So I think that will -- that's going to happen sort of first. And as you know, we've been sort of constrained with -- based on sort of the leverage ratio in CCAR for the last number of years. And so that -- we don't see that sort of changing. That's been the constraint for us going forward at this point. And we're -- as you can see over the last couple of years, we've been very active to both optimize sort of how we think about our modeling that goes into stress testing and CCAR. And I think you've seen that as we've sort of increased our capital return over the last couple of years. And I think it -- we'll continue to sort of do that as things evolve.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier","First question, just on Pershing. So that showed some growth in the quarter. You guys mentioned some of the onboarding of clients. Can you provide an update on the timing and the impact ahead of some of that new business as well as what drove the lower margin balance in the quarter? It seemed a little I would say counterintuitive from what we're seeing with the peers.","Michael Santomassimo","Mike, it's Mike. I'll take that. So as we've said over the last few quarters, I think on the new business side, we would -- we're in the middle of onboarding a number of those clients now, and we would expect to start seeing that more meaningfully towards the end of the year and into the first part of next year. On the margin balances, there's really no story other than we've seen a lack of demand from clients right now. And that could turn pretty meaningfully pretty quickly, but it's really just been muted activity from the existing clients.","Charles Scharf","Yes, but it has nothing -- I mean, it has nothing to do just the clients -- net changes in clients in our business. It's actual activity of the existing clients that we have. And it's just the impact of the way to think about the risk they want to take in the market today.","Michael Carrier","Got it. Okay. And then just as a follow up. Charlie, just based on the investments, you guys mentioned the Pershing wins, you pointed to some of the asset servicing wins, you have traction on the collateral and the clearing management. So it seems like some of the organic growth initiatives that you guys have been putting in place are starting to gain some traction. Just wanted to get an update on your view on more of the strategic repositioning and outlook. Because obviously, there's a lot of focus on NII and the rate headwinds, but it seems like you're making some good traction on some of the business areas.","Charles Scharf","Yes. Listen, I think it's very early and so there, too -- just because we have some businesses which have seen some growth, doesn't mean we -- that internally, we feel better about it than we should. But we do have some businesses that have continually shown some organic growth and others where it's still slow, predominantly because of the time it takes for us to build up our capabilities and the long sales cycles.","We highlighted those we're seeing growth in the business and those are -- they're real, they're consistent. They relate to both our execution and the market positions that we have. And on the longer-tail businesses, such as Asset Servicing, that continues to be a work in progress, but we feel as good as we have felt that the opportunities are there. It just will continue to play out over time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken","Mike, you referenced, I think, a high beta expectation when in a rate cut environment. And I just was curious to get some color on what drives -- you the confidence that it will be high. This quarter, we saw market rates begin to fall and yet interest-bearing deposit yields went up. It looks like the policy -- if we get a policy cut, it'll be viewed as an insurance cut. And in the past, those haven't had as high beta. So just kind of curious about what it is that you're seeing in the market and what you're hearing from the folks closer to those deposit markets and what would give you the confidence that those betas would be high.","Michael Santomassimo","Yes. I mean, Brennan, look, I mean, obviously, we'll see how things play out over the next coming weeks, but we've got a very disciplined process where we go business by business, segment by segment within those businesses and try to be realistic about what the beta is going to look like for each of those segments. And that's sort of how we go about the process of trying to understand what's possible. And some of those segments are more competitive than others and will have lower beta than others, and there's dynamics that we sort of take into account. And so we're going to continue to do that and work through that as sort of rates sort of come down.","Charles Scharf","The only thing I'd add, Brennan, and I know you know this. But we don't sit here and pretend to be able to forecast how many rate cuts there will be. What he said is we're just taking what's in the implieds and saying, \"If that holds true, here's what we would expect.\" To the extent that it's something less than that and it's something more insurance-like, you might be right, but then that also changes the outlook for NII in a more positive way than it otherwise would have been for some of the out quarters. But if it is a series of cuts, then the rate at which we and others will be willing to move is impacted by that. So a lot will have to do with what the actions are and what the words are around it and what the expectations are beyond that first cut.","Brennan Hawken","Yes. That's all really, really fair and helpful. My next question is on expenses. You guys have talked about how you have been, that this quarter is a reflection of the discipline and how you have the ability to step up when you need to and show the impact of the efficiency efforts you've been baking. Is this -- as we think about tuning up our models here, should we think about this as the right jumping-off point for the rest of the year? Or are there some factors that we might be missing that we should consider when we consider the back half here?","Michael Santomassimo","Yes. I think -- Brennan, I think you really got to sort of look at it year-on-year because there's dynamics that sort of change as you sort of look at individual quarters. And so I think you got it -- so I think you could sort of take the view that both Charlie and I gave in terms of the efficiencies offsetting all the investments and sort of think about that on year-over-year basis for each of the quarters going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.","Glenn Schorr","A quick follow-up on that -- your comments on ETF servicing up like 50% versus last year. Curious if you can help us with thoughts on what kind of base are we talking about? And maybe just talk a little bit more towards overall positioning, winning new clients. Is the revenues coming from current clients and their organic growth? Just curious of...","Charles Scharf","Yes. This is Charlie. I'll take that. Listen, we don't disclose the individual pieces, but it's -- when you look at who services the biggest ETFs out there, we have not historically been one of the large ETF providers. So just a way of saying relative to what you see in the world, it's from a small base, but it's also just very clear for us relative to the focus that we have on it. We have won -- so I would describe it as a significant piece of business from a strong name in the market that wants to grow in the ETF space. And we're very, very focused on growing it in a more material way than what you've even seen in the past. So that's the reason why we wanted to highlight it. Not a huge revenue impact in the short term, but important strategically for us.","Glenn Schorr","Understood. And maybe I could go over to Asset Management side. Last quarter, I think you pointed out some of the investments you're making in passives, all -- smart beta, LDI. Maybe you could provide a little bit more color on -- I know these are longer-tail investments, but curious on what you're working on right now.","Charles Scharf","Yes, listen. It's exactly the same sort of list. As you pointed out, it doesn't change quarter-on-quarter. When you looked at the results in the quarter, obviously, you saw the flow of information. Mike talked about it. Big piece driven by one very specific client that took something in the index base in-house. We are focused on the things that we spoke about. And it is a relative -- it's not the easiest environment, but we're -- what we're focused on our existing platform is ensuring we have the right products and focused on performance. And we walk you through some of the things on the performance side which should, over a period of time, drive flows and drive our own financial performance.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","In view of the pressure that everyone is seeing on the margin because of the rate environment, have you guys considered -- obviously, your loan book is not as big as your securities book, but is there any consideration of trying to focus on maybe growing the loan book to offset some of these pressures that you're seeing on the margin?","Charles Scharf","Listen. I think we are -- as Mike said, we are focused on looking at every component of NII, but not rethinking the risk profile of who we are and what we are. When you looked at what we do in the lending space, for the most part, what we do in the lending space supports the rest of the businesses that we're in. It's slightly more than an accommodation, that's the way I would think about it. It's an important component of what we do and what we provide for clients. But we don't have the infrastructure. We don't have the diversification. We don't have the size lending platform that some of the others have. And our view is if you just entered that just for the sake of creating NII to solve a short-term problem, that probably won't end well for us if we went down that road. So we're trying to be far more selective about where we can pick up some yield without putting ourselves in a position, especially at this point in the credit cycle, that will -- that we will regret later on.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And then following up on your assets under management comments, recognizing that equity is not a material part of your assets under management. But can you share with us -- the trend obviously that many of the active managers both in fixed income and equity are seeing is the pressure from the passives, of course. Can you share with us, are you guys seeing that same kind of pressure in your active part of the assets under management, and what are you trying to do to offset it?","Michael Santomassimo","Yes. I mean -- Gerard, it's Mike. Certainly, some of the -- in some strategies, we're seeing more pressure than others, but -- and I think what we're trying to do is make sure that our -- where we have differentiation, that we're focused on performance. And as you sort of look at our large or -- larger strategies, they do -- they are differentiated. They're not sort of like index-hugging kind of strategies. And I think we've seen good performance. We've seen a slowdown in outflows, and in some cases, a return to inflows in a few of them. And so we're focused on those differentiated strategies which I think will help us over the long term.","Charles Scharf","And I guess I think what I would add is I always break it into two parts, there's flows and just the fee environment. I would say the pressure that we've seen on fees, while it hasn't gone away, it hasn't increased. And it's probably -- we've had probably had more filter through than less at this point. So that's on a relative basis. A negative going away for us, which is certainly a good thing. And as I said, we're focused in our equity business, whether it's on the Walter Scott business or any of the others focused on performance. And the performance has been quite good. And when you see better performance, you see better impact on flows. It's early, but it certainly feels better when you got the stronger performance than when you don't.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein","Just hoping to follow up on a couple of specifics here. So I think, Mike, you mentioned the beta on rate cuts will be closer to 100% on the portion of your deposit base. What percentage of your interest-bearing deposits will have that kind of 100% beta on the rate cut? Which I'm assuming is more contractual, which is why you kind have that level of confidence.","Michael Santomassimo","Yes. I mean -- and Alex, and that's not something that we sort of disclose in that level of detail. But as I said, you should assume it's not just where we've got contractual sort of rights to do that. We're being very disciplined about how we sort of go through the segment by segment review of the book.","Alexander Blostein","Okay. And then lots of color around expenses, more on the qualitative side, but I was hoping what to think through the rest of the year and maybe into 2020. If I hear you guys correctly, it sounds like the efficiencies are more than offsetting technology spend. So should the expense run rate be down versus kind of the first half of the year or for the back half of the year?","Michael Santomassimo","Yes. As I said, Alex, you should sort of think about it through year-over-year, right. For the third and fourth quarter, just given some of the dynamics that you sort of look at, the way the P&L sort of works out, and you should assume that the efficiencies offset the -- any of the investments we're making in the third and fourth quarter year-on-year. So sort of flattish year-on-year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.","Michael Mayo","So I heard you're controlling what you can control with the expenses, but I'm just wondering about the pricing environment. So assets under custody are up 5% year-over-year, but servicing fees are only flat. You said the pricing pressure is the same as it has been. So should we think about that relationship as the pricing pressure? Or if not, how should we think about it?","Michael Santomassimo","Yes, Mike. I would -- it's Mike. I would just remind you that as sort of the markets go up, so in particular, the U.S. markets have sort of gone up year-on-year, right? So that does have an impact of AUC\/A. And as -- if it's just market sort of driving AUC\/A up, you don't get paid the same for that increase that you do for bringing in sort of new clients, right? Because clients have sort of graduated fee schedules. So there's a little bit of that you see in there. And then we'll go back to what we said on the pricing. Like, we really see no discernible difference at this point relative to what we've seen over the last number of years.","Charles Scharf","I will say the following thing, Mike, which won't satisfy you, but it's just the reality. We don't spend a lot of time looking at that ratio. There is -- assets under custody are not directly related to that line. We get paid for different things, not just the level of AUC\/A that exists. Sometimes, it's based on transaction, sometimes it's based upon the activities that we have. So we would expect that number to grow over time at a faster rate, but that doesn't mean that we won't see benefits in the net interest -- I'm sorry, in the operating margin of the company over a period of time. That's the way we think about it and what we look at.","Michael Mayo","Well, that's helpful. So maybe just a more specific question. When you talk about pricing pressure, what is pricing pressure? Like, if you say it's kind of similar the way it's been the last few years, is it 1%, 2%, 3%, 0.5%? How would you quantify that?","Charles Scharf","We don't talk about the specifics. It's obviously embedded in the overall number. On a percentage basis relative to just when you look at our revenue growth number, the negative impact is not a hugely significant number.","Michael Mayo","Okay. And then last follow up. Some of your peers have reported so far that the money center banks have shown servicing fees up 5%, whereas yours was down 5% -- I'm sorry. It was much different on a core basis. So yours -- anyway, no matter how you slice it, the money center banks did a lot better this quarter. Is there anything unique to them or unique to you? Or like you said, new business flows on later this year and maybe that changes them?","Charles Scharf","Listen, we're not going to spend a lot of time talking about our competitors, and there's a lot of that's hard to understand when you just look over our press releases relative to these businesses. What we've looked at for our competitors, for comparable businesses, doesn't agree exactly with what you said. But we can certainly follow-up with you later on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","First question, Mike. Just you talked about Issuer Services and some of the differences on the DR timing where we've had some shift between the second and third quarters and the timing of that. So now maybe you can just talk about the impact of that in 2Q on a sequential basis. And then sort of given the timing, what the outlook on the ADR side might be for 3Q in terms of seasonality.","Michael Santomassimo","Yes. Brian, so as I said I think a couple of quarters ago, you really sort of need to look at Issuer Services over the full year and not focus too much quarter-to-quarter. And I think when you do that, you sort of see actually more stability over the last few years than you sort of look at that, as you might guess, than looking at it quarter-to-quarter. So I would just encourage you to sort of look at it that way and go back to sort of what we sort of printed in 2018 and use that as a base to sort of think about the whole year.","Brian Bedell","Okay. Fair enough. And maybe just a question on the organic growth. Obviously, both you guys talked about some of the progress you're making, especially in Clearance and Collateral and within Pershing. I mean, I guess at this sense -- at this stage, do you have sense of how you would characterize that organic revenue growth, parsing that out from the market impact in at least those areas where you are growing? And then in conjunction with that, you made some new hires obviously while you're still reducing the expense base on the comp side. So maybe if you can talk about whether you still plan on making some other senior new hires to accelerate that organic growth in other businesses.","Charles Scharf","So let me just start with the second piece first. First of all, I want to point out, we didn't just highlight hires from the outside, we highlighted promotions from within. And so because there are a series of very big jobs here which we promote from within and are thrilled with the talent that exists here. Listen, I think we're -- we highlighted in this earnings release because we do think the jobs that we've talked about are important to continuing to further our progress inside the company. Over a period of time, we should talk less and less about that as we create more stability in the senior management ranks. But the positions that we've added that we talked about we think are meaningfully additive to our ability to think differently about these businesses and grow them. And the first question was?","Michael Santomassimo","The significance of the organic growth...","Charles Scharf","Yes, listen, I think it's a hard question. I think we would -- if you just ask, like, what's the tone that we want to set relative to the way we're thinking about it, is we are very early on in our journey to build a company which has a higher rate of growth than it had in the past. The fact that we have some businesses that are showing underlying organic growth is certainly a good thing. It's real. We think it's -- while there might be some volatility, it's sustainable both because of the work we're doing and the quality of the franchise that we have. It's not everywhere. We have a lot more work to do. So the trends are mildly positive with still a lot more to do.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Wildhack with Autonomous Research.","Robert Wildhack","On the balance sheet. I think in the past, you said that the Fed's normalization was going to lead to deposit runoff of I think $70 billion. But that was from a while ago. Anyway, you can help us quantify the impact that process has been having and how that will change once the Fed stops?","Michael Santomassimo","Yes. Look, Robert, it's Mike. As I've said in my remarks, we sort of expect interest-bearing deposits to -- at this point in the quarter, to be about where they were last quarter and then noninterest-bearing to keep coming down a little bit. And I think post QE stopping and the Fed reducing its balance sheet, that should be a net positive going forward. But we'll see how it plays out.","Robert Wildhack","Okay. And then can you just give a quick update on the BlackRock-Aladdin or -- yes, BlackRock-Aladdin partnership and how that has progressed? And what the client uptake has been like on the additional capabilities you've built out?","Charles Scharf","Yes. I think what we've seen is a very, very high degree of interest from both existing clients that we have and potential clients. We're in the process of onboarding, of the existing common clients we have, a meaningful portion of those to give them access to the new capabilities. And most of the remaining ones are extremely interested and we're just in the process of going through that discussion. So all in all, I think we just feel very good about what we've done there and continuing to talk to other third parties about being able to do the same.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Just a quick question. You're still seeing good growth in the tri-party collateral balances. How much of that is still coming from the on boarding from JPM? Or is that fully done at this point in time?","Michael Santomassimo","The onboarding finished in the late third quarter last year. So you're still seeing the annualization of that, Brian. So roughly sort of 2\/3 of it from the conversion and the other -- the remaining from either new clients or growth from the rest of the client base.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. And then you mentioned on the expenses that the tech spend was going to be offset by efficiency saves. But when should we see the tech spend slow? Assuming there was some accelerated expense to get the platform as you want it to be. But should we see it slow in 2020? Or is this just an ongoing rate of spend that we should expect for the near term?","Charles Scharf","Yes. I don't know answer to that is the short way of think -- is the succinct answer. I think we've certainly thought about it in detail through the end of the year. We're at the beginning part of our process for thinking through next year in detail. There's no doubt that the tech spend should become more efficient as time goes on. There's still a lot to do. So relative to the way we think about overall expenses, obviously, that will be governed by the way we're thinking about what our requirements are and what the environment is. So we're very conscious of the world that we live in, but I think we'll defer the answer to the question until we think about it some more through our process.","Operator","And gentlemen, it appears we have no further questions at this time.","Charles Scharf","All right. Thanks, everyone, for the time. Take care.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call webcast.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon\u2019s consent. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Valerie Haertel. Ms. Haertel, you may begin.","Valerie Haertel","Good morning and welcome to the BNY Mellon second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With us today are Charlie Scharf, our Chairman and CEO; and Mike Santomassimo, our CFO. The earnings materials include a financial highlights presentation that will be referred to in our discussion of second quarter results and can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, bnymellon.com.","Please note that our remarks today maybe forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release, the financial highlights presentation and in our documents filed with the SEC available on our website, bnymellon.com. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, July 19, 2018 and we will not update forward-looking statements.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Charlie.","Charlie Scharf","Thanks, Valerie. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. I will begin with a few comments on our business performance before turning it over to Mike who will then run through our second quarter financials and outlook before we open the call for questions.","We reported earnings per share of $1.03, up 17% from last year\u2019s second quarter. Year-over-year revenue grew 5%, expenses grew 3% and as we did last year, we benefited from a reduction in our tax rate. I will talk more specifically about revenue growth in a second, but just a reminder, we are focused on increasing the rate of revenue growth given the nature of our business it takes time and therefore it\u2019s very hard to draw any conclusions in an individual quarter good or bad. Having said that, we again saw some underlying franchise growth in some parts of the company this quarter and we continued to benefit from the positive impact of higher interest rates and stronger equity markets, albeit at a more modest pace than last quarter. Regarding expenses, we remain disciplined and focused on deploying our resources. Currency translation and real estate costs impacted expense growth by 2% and despite an increase in our investment in technology all other expenses were only up modestly.","Let me say a few words about our asset servicing business first. We saw steady performance in our core custody, middle office and fund accounting revenues and we did see good growth in several areas, including securities lending, where we saw increased demand for U.S. government securities in equities and we had good growth in foreign exchange revenue driven by higher volumes for market activity, but also new business wins predominantly from asset servicing clients. We continue to enhance our capabilities and recently launched new foreign exchange products to better service our clients, including FX prime brokerage and FX options. We also enhanced our existing capabilities in emerging markets.","As we look forward, our pipeline and demand for services is solid in our asset servicing business overall. Our strength in our end-to-end fund administration solutions business, which includes our institutional transfer agency services, is a differentiator and we continue to experience growth in our real estate and private equity servicing, a trend that we have seen for well over a year. Regarding new business, we had a healthy number of new wins in mandates, especially in the U.S. and Canada. In purging, our business continues to be strong, but this quarter was impacted by two lost clients. These have been known to us for quite some time and while these losses will impact us on a year-over-year basis for the next few quarters, we are also in the process of on-boarding several large clients, which will positively impact our results starting predominantly in the second half of next year.","In Issuer Services, we continued to see improved results in our core corporate trust business resulting from repositioning of our front office sales and relationship management teams and investments to improve our technology capabilities. While the market remains competitive, we continue to see a strong pipeline particularly for collateralized loan obligations in corporate debt and through the first half of 2018 our market share improved a bit. In Treasury Services, we continued to see growth in our payment volumes from existing and new clients and our pipeline remained strong both in the U.S. and Europe. In clearance and collateral management, our business here continues to be strong. We saw double digit revenue growth in clearing and collateral management services from growth in collateral management activity, the on-boarding of new broker-dealer clients from JPMorgan\u2019s exit of the government clearing business and higher clearance volumes related to monetary policy easing from the increase in U.S. government debt and treasury issuances as I noted last quarter.","In investment management we are continuing to focus on investment performance, drive scale on our business portfolio, invest in product development and distribution capabilities and strengthen our wealth management franchise. We did see outflows in our long-term strategies and cash this quarter, Mike will provide more color here in a few minutes. Importantly investment performance remained in line with the first quarter with 89% of our AUMs ahead of benchmark over 3 years and 5 years. And importantly we are continuing to focus on retaining and attracting great talent.","This quarter we added two senior people to the executive team. In Wealth Management, Catherine Keating joined us as CEO on July 9 reporting to Mitchell. The business has done well, but we can do even better. Catherine is a seasoned CEO with a strong track record in wealth and asset management. She knows the business, the markets, appreciates the advantage of the business being part of BNY Mellon and I am confident she will do a great job for us. We also announced a new CEO of Treasury Services, Paul Camp who will be reporting to Todd and will be joining us in August. Paul has a great reputation and has extensive global experience in this space and I am thrilled that we were able to attract someone of his caliber. Here too we are doing well, but we have the opportunity to do it in better.","Before I turn the call over to Mike, I need to say a few more things all of which should sound familiar to you. We are focused on delivering strong financial results including driving stronger organic revenue growth and as I have said this will take some time. Our technology investments will continue to grow and we will be vigilant about controlling other discretionary expenses. We believe that we have a financially attractive business model with unique collection of assets which work together to give us competitive advantage. We see some evidence of early progress, we still have much more to do and we have confidence that we will be successful and that we will drive more value for you and our clients.","Now let me turn the call over to Mike.","Mike Santomassimo","Thank you, Charlie and good morning everyone. I will first run through the details of the second quarter results and then provide some thoughts for the third quarter. Charlie and I will then open up the call for questions. All comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless I note otherwise. Beginning on Page 3, I have the financial highlights presentation. Total revenue increased 5% to $4.1 billion in the second quarter. Fee revenue increased 3% to $3.2 billion due to higher equity market values with favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar, the change in FX translation rates which positively impacted fee growth by approximately 1% and growth in volumes across our foreign exchange and our collateral management business. The year-over-year growth rate was negatively impacted by lease related gains recorded in the second quarter of 2017 which impacted fee growth by approximately 1.5%.","Net interest revenue increased 11% to $916 million from higher interest rates. Our expenses grew 3% to $2.7 billion. The impact of the weaker U.S. dollar and costs related to our real estate consolidation activities negatively impacted expenses by approximately 2%. Including in the real estate cost is $12 million related to moving our headquarters in New York City from lease space to our own building. We have begun the physical move of now and expect the cost associated with the relocation to be approximately $75 million, down from approximately $100 million that we communicated at Investor Day in March, with the remainder expected to be recorded in the fourth quarter of this year. This will enable us to reduce our real estate footprint by approximately 300,000 square feet in 2019.","In addition to that, there were also some expenses in the second quarter related to rationalizing other locations. Our continued investments we are making in technology were partially offset by declines in other expenses. The majority of the incremental technology investment this year is going towards improvements relating to our operating platforms and technology infrastructure. Having said that, we are also still investing approximately $1.5 billion in developing new capabilities for clients. This year, as we have said in the past, technology is one of our key investment priorities as well as continuing to be focused in driving more efficiency into everything we do.","In the second quarter, we repurchased 12 million common shares for $651 million and paid $244 million in dividends to common shareholders. Additionally, the board has authorized the repurchase of up to 2.4 billion of common shares beginning in the third quarter through the second quarter of 2019 and an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.28 per share payable beginning in the third quarter of this year. All of this resulted in an increase in pre-tax income of 7% to $1.4 billion and an increase in net income applicable to common shareholders of 14% to $1.1 billion, which benefited from a lower U.S. tax rate of 20.5%. We generated positive operating leverage and a pre-tax operating margin of 34% up from the prior year period. This coupled with a reduction in our share count increased earnings per share by 17% to $1.3. Our risk-adjusted returns continue to be strong. Our CET1 ratio increased 11% and our return on tangible common equity was approximately 23%.","Page 5 highlights our investment services business. Investment services revenue increased 8% to $3.1 billion. Net interest revenue increased in most businesses, primarily due to higher interest rates. Within the business, asset servicing revenue increased 10% to $1.5 billion primarily reflecting higher net interest revenue mostly driven by higher rates, foreign exchange and securities lending volumes, equity market values and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar.","Pershing revenue increased 2% to $558 million as a result of higher net interest revenue and fees from growth in long-term mutual fund balances partially offset by the impact of lost business. We are continuing to see our clients consolidate assets on to the Pershing platform, which enhances visibility into their client\u2019s portfolios. The lost business is primarily driven by a couple of clients one was the result of industry consolidation and one move to another provider. As Charlie mentioned, the pipeline is good, but it takes time to onboard. Sequentially, Pershing\u2019s revenue decreased 4% primarily reflecting lower clearance revenue, of which approximately half was from normal changes in volumes and half from the lost clients.","Issuer Services revenue, which includes corporate trust and depository receipts increased 8% year-over-year and 3% sequentially to $431 million. Both comparisons primarily reflect higher net interest revenue and corporate trust and higher depository receipts revenue. Treasury Services revenue increased 6% year-over-year and 2% sequentially to $329 million, primarily reflecting higher net interest revenue due to the higher interest rates and higher payment volumes, which were up approximately 4%. Clearance and Collateral Management revenue, which includes our U.S. government clearing U.S. tri-party activity and global collateral management increased 11% year-over-year and 5% sequentially to $269 million. Both increases primarily reflect growth in Collateral Management, increased clearance volumes and net interest revenue. We are continuing to onboard the U.S. government clearing clients that are transferring from JPMorgan and those migrations are going well. We saw some modest impacts from the activity in the second quarter and expect to have most of the migrations completed by the end of the third quarter.","Additionally, average collateral management balances were up 12%. Non-interest expense within investment services increased 2% to $2 billion driven primarily by higher technology investments and the unfavorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. Also, our foreign exchange revenue increased 19% from higher volumes across many of our products. Securities lending revenue increased 31% primarily driven by higher demand for U.S. government securities and higher demand for equities. Our assets under custody and\/or administration grew 8% to $33.6 trillion reflecting higher market values and business growth.","Turning to Page 6 for the investment management business, investment management revenue increased 3% to $1 billion. On a sequential basis, total revenue decreased 6% driven by the performance fees being higher in the first quarter and the gain on sale from the CenterSquare divestiture also in the first quarter. Asset management revenue increased 3% to $702 million. The results were helped by the increase in equity markets, the favorable impact of a weakness U.S. dollar principally versus the pound, which was partially offset by the impact of lost revenue associated with the sale of CenterSquare and the impact of outflows in some of our actively managed strategies, particularly equities.","Wealth Management revenue increased 4% to $316 million primarily a result of increase in the equity markets partially offset by lower net interest revenue due to a 4% decline in deposits. Assets under management increased 2% year-over-year, but declined 3% sequentially to $1.8 trillion. The sequential decline was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar principally versus the pound, which drove an approximately 3% decline in net outflows partially offset by market appreciation.","Turning to the flows, our actively managed strategies experienced $8 billion in net outflows, with $4 billion in outflows from fixed income and $3 billion each from equity in multi-asset and alternatives partially offset by LDI inflows of $2 billion. Index strategies had $7 billion of outflows. Cash outflows of $11 billion were primarily driven by some recent outflows due to client M&A activity.","Now, turning to the other segment on Page 7. Fee revenue declined year-over-year primarily reflecting the impact of lease related gains recorded in the second quarter of 2017 and lower corporate bank-owned life insurance. Fee revenue also declined sequentially primarily reflecting lower asset related gains. Net interest expense increased year-over-year and sequentially primarily resulting from corporate treasury activity. Additionally, non-interest expense increased year-over-year primarily reflecting higher technology spend and expenses related with our real estate consolidation.","Now, turning to capital and liquidity on Page 8. Our capital and liquidity ratios at the end of the quarter increased since the first quarter. Common equity Tier 1 capital totaled $18.4 billion as of June 30, 2018 and our CET1 ratio was 11% under the advanced approach. The supplementary ratio was 6.2%. Our average LCR was 118% in the second quarter.","Turning to Page 9, net interest revenue increased 11% to $916 million primarily driven by the impact of higher interest rates. On a sequential basis, net interest revenue decreased slightly as expected due to lower deposits partially offset by higher interest rates. The net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased 10 basis points to 1.26%. Sequentially, the NIM was up 3 basis points. Year-over-year, our average interest-bearing deposits increased 7%, while our average non interest-bearing deposits declined 12%.","Now, Page 10 has details of our expenses. On a consolidated basis, expenses of $2.7 billion increased 3% primarily reflecting higher investments in technology, which impacted the staff professional legal and other purchase services and the software and equipment expense lines. Additionally, the year-over-year comparison reflects the unfavorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar and the expenses related to our real estate consolidation. Sequentially, non-interest expense increased primarily reflecting higher investments in technology and expenses associated with the consolidation of our real estate. These expenses were partially offset by lower staff expense due to the impact of vesting of long-term stock awards for retirement eligible employees that was recorded in the first quarter and the favorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.","Now, looking ahead to the third quarter, there are few things to factor into your modeling. As it relates to net interest revenue, we expect reinvestment rates to be up significantly versus the third quarter of 2017, but up only modestly versus the second quarter. Deposit betas are behaving as we expected and currently deposit balances are down slightly versus the second quarter average, but it\u2019s still early. We expect this to result in net interest revenue growth in the mid to high single-digit percent range versus the third quarter of 2017 and we still expect our full year 2018 effective tax rate to be approximately 21%.","Before we open the call up for questions, we would like to make some comments on the outcomes of the CCAR process that were released in late June. I wanted to provide a brief reminder on how the process works. There is first a quantitative test and all firms have to satisfy both their internal model driven results and the Fed\u2019s models. And just as a reminder, we don\u2019t have transparency into the how the Fed models work. And as you look at the results, we have been constrained by our own model for the last couple of years. When there is a qualitative assessment, historically this is focused on governance over the process, your capital management policies and how you apply governance to your model output.","Now when you look at the results, we believe that our models are conservative. You can see the results of the test over the last couple of years and see the conservatism relative to the Federal Reserve\u2019s estimates and model outputs. So we weren\u2019t surprised by the results. Additionally, our constraining ratio is Tier 1 leverage which is sized based and not risk based. Our models project an increase in client deposits that we assume are pleased at central banks which does not create any incremental risk, but still causes our Tier 1 leverage ratio to decline and constrain our activities. We continue to believe that the Tier 1 leverage ratio should not be constrained on capital actions. This all coupled with the scenario that was more severe and very unlikely to actually occur resulted in capital actions that were lower than some of you expected.","I do want to point out that the lower distributions will not have a significant impact on earnings in 2018 or in the CCAR approval period. With a more reasonable scenario, we would expect to be in a position, return to 100% over time whether or not we will change our models. So what does this mean as we look forward, you can assume that we are reviewing our models with urgency. The fed proposals to provide more transparency to the CCAR scenario is in models as well as introduction of the stress capital buffer should all be constructive too.","And now, this concludes our remarks and Charlie and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.","Glenn Schorr","Hi. Thanks very much. So I appreciate the forward-looking guidance, I am just curious on the deposit migration that you are seeing, the interest bearing down 12 inches, interest bearing up 7, non-interest bearing down 12, is that, do we look for more of the same in the next several quarters that a function of the rate environment and in other words if we go on the path, that is in the forward curve, is it going to just be chipping away or do you see an end to that client behavior, it just has obviously a big impact on the modeling? Thanks.","Mike Santomassimo","Hey, Glenn, it\u2019s Mike. I will take that. So I think when you look at the non-interest bearing as a percentage of the total, it\u2019s about where we expected it to be and what we have been saying now for a very long, very long time actually and so just it\u2019s just about 30% of the total. And so as we have said a number of times over the last couple of years, we would expect that that percentage to trend down a little bit below 30 over a period of time. And so it\u2019s behaving sort of where we thought it would \u2013 it is right about where we thought it would be.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. And then\u2026","Charlie Scharf","And Glenn this is Charlie. It\u2019s just and that\u2019s the way we thought about where it looks like going forward that that continues.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. And as I will finish off this and I combo then, does the same apply for the modest decline on the loan side and the incremental deposit betas of what were 60% this quarter?","Charlie Scharf","Look, I think on the loans side that will bounce around from any given quarter. So I wouldn\u2019t read into a decline in loans as a go forward trend that\u2019s going to continue to decline. On the deposit betas, you recall that there was a rise in March that\u2019s fully baked into the second quarter and there was a little stub of another rise in June. And so it\u2019s probably a decent indication of where betas are trending right now.","Glenn Schorr","Okay, awesome. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","Thanks guys. Good morning. Just first question around expenses, can you provide us an update on the kind of $300 million investment initiative you outlined at the Investor Day, I guess a), is it still $300 million, how much of the $300 million already in the run-rate and how we should think about just maybe absolute dollars of expenses as we progressed through the year?","Mike Santomassimo","Yes, hey, Alex, this is Mike. Thanks for the question. So as we mentioned last quarter that $300 million investment sort of ramps up throughout the year and so it\u2019s not exactly a linear sort of progression throughout the year, but we are sort of midway through the year and we are sort of approximately sort of where we expected to be in that sort of ramp up and $300 million sort of plus or minus is still sort of the range that we have been looking at.","Charlie Scharf","The only thing I would add to it is that what we have talked about relative to where we had hoped the total expense outcome to be for the company. I wouldn\u2019t say there is no meaningful difference there. So to the extent that we decide to spend more money on technology, we will actively seek to manage the overall expense base and that\u2019s still what we are trying to accomplish.","Alex Blostein","Yes, got it. That makes sense. And my second just quick cleanup question around Issuer Services, it seems like there is kind of a different dynamic there you guys clearly making progress in the Corporate Trust and DR business has been a lot more muted. As we think about seasonality, I think historically Q3 was a strong quarter for Issuer Services, any kind of drops off in Q4, how should we think about I guess given the changes in business the way you guys have been reporting in here?","Charlie Scharf","Yes, I think as you saw last year in the third quarter, Alex, there was that historical sort of pop that you get from the DR business sort of got muted last year. And so while we would expect the number to be a little higher than you saw in the second quarter, you can\u2019t go back a couple of years, you got to sort of look at the new trend there in terms of what you think that the pop might be.","Alex Blostein","Got it. Great, thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Charlie Scharf","Hey, Mike, if you are talking, we can\u2019t hear you.","Operator","Mr. Carrier we are unable to hear you. Please check your mute function.","Charlie Scharf","Operator, why don\u2019t we go to the next one?","Operator","Okay. Mr. Carrier, did you want to ask your question? Okay, hearing no response, we will move on to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Great, thanks very much. Just maybe focusing back on the balance sheet, on the asset side, I appreciate your comments Mike about being not moving up as much, but if you can talk about some of the drivers in the second quarter on the Fed Funds and securities repo one, it looks like it was especially large increase and then it looked like there was also a corresponding increase in the liability side there, what was the driver in that and how should we think about that trend going forward?","Mike Santomassimo","Yes. I think you sort of need to and you\u2019ll probably notice there is, I assume, you are looking at the supplement, Brian, so there is a footnote on the page as well that I would sort of just pointed to, but what happens, we have got a cleared repo product that gets some positive balance sheet treatment that where we will do repos, reverse repos with clients that gets novated over to FICC. And so there is very little that ends up on the balance sheet, so that sort of makes the both the revenue and the rate sort of pop year-on-year and you can get a sense based on the footnote on the bottom of the impact to that. So that\u2019s what you are seeing sort of drive that number or a good chunk of the driver of that number is that program really kicking in and we have seen some good growth there.","Brian Bedell","And would you expect that to stay pretty lively I guess with Fed hikes or does it look more sort of abnormal for just this quarter?","Mike Santomassimo","No, I think we have seen that. We have seen the demand for that product ramp up over last year. And so while in any given day or week, it sort of moved \u2013 the volume moves around. We have seen that demand stay pretty consistent now over the last number of months.","Brian Bedell","Okay. And then just on the follow-up maybe just as we look into 3Q and 4Q, if you can talk a little bit more about the impact to the clearing services run-rate from the JPM transitions, I think you mentioned at the end of the third quarter, just trying to look for sort of a clean number there as we look into the fourth quarter and then also similarly from the two clients lost, appreciate that you are going to be on-boarding folks in the second half of next year, but is there more revenue run-off in the third quarter versus the second quarter given those two clients running off?","Mike Santomassimo","So I will start with the second one first. So I think the impact of the lost clients is in the run-rate now for the second quarter, so there is not another drop-off in the Pershing business. So, I think that\u2019s a pretty easy one. I think on the clearance and collateral, we haven\u2019t given you a specific number. But as we sort of think about those migrations, we started with the smaller ones first and then you move to the bigger ones over time. And so \u2013 and by the end of the third quarter, we will have pretty much everything in there. So I think once you get to a third quarter number, you will have \u2013 it will be pretty much fully in our run-rate. So you are seeing a small piece this quarter and you will see a little bit more next quarter and then it will be in our run-rate.","Brian Bedell","Okay, thank you.","Charlie Scharf","Yes, sorry, the only thing I will add to your question though is when you sort of think about the clearing collateral business, we are also seeing very good growth outside the U.S. So although we focused a lot on sort of the JPMorgan migrations here in the U.S., we have also got a very strong business outside the U.S. and up very strong double-digit growth outside the U.S. in terms of the demand for that product that we have got.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Moving on to our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I just had a follow-up on the deposit beta point, looking at the 15 or so basis points increase in interest-bearing this quarter, but also then thinking about the fact that I think you have said that U.S. dollar deposits are about 70%, was there an increase in non-U.S. dollar deposit costs or should we apply that 15 basis points just to the U.S. dollar which would suggest a beta higher. I am just trying to square that component of the math like if you could help out on that? That will be great. Thanks.","Mike Santomassimo","Yes. As you know, U.S. rates, our non-U.S. rates have not really moved around that much in the quarter. Now, there is some expectation that, that\u2019s going to start to happen in the third quarter, particularly in the UK at least, but that hasn\u2019t been a big driver so far. So \u2013 and remember as we have said, the betas that are going to continue to sort of increase as rates increase and so on, it sort of implies about a 60% beta for the quarter, we would expect that to keep increasing as rates go up.","Brennan Hawken","Yes, it was probably 60% beta, but if we think about the U.S. dollar deposits, wouldn\u2019t it imply a higher beta in the U.S. on the U.S. side since that\u2019s the only thing we saw?","Mike Santomassimo","Yes, it would be a little higher.","Brennan Hawken","Okay, good. Thanks. Just wanted to clarify that. And then it sounds like non-interest bearing shift you guys think is probably sustainable and in line with what you had expected, do you think that we are going to be continuing to trend lower here in the foreseeable future or is there any sort of visibility that you have into that line as well and the sort of remixing that we would think is natural as rates go higher? That would be great. Thanks.","Mike Santomassimo","Yes, Brennan, I mean, what we said a little earlier, right is that the percentage of \u2013 the non-interest bearing as a percentage of the total is a little less than 30 rounds, I think the 30% this quarter. That percentage we would expect to sort of grind down as rates rise. And so that may bounce around in any given quarter a little bit, but we would expect that to continue to grind down.","Brennan Hawken","Thanks for the color.","Operator","We will take our next question from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott","Hello. Thank you for taking the question. In terms of capital, you mentioned reviewing your models with some urgency, once you have completed that, would you be thinking about putting in a kind of mid-cycle resubmission that some of the other banks have done in the past to get the payout ratio backup without having to wait for next year\u2019s process?","Charlie Scharf","Yes. This is Charlie. I would say, I don\u2019t think we \u2013 I think it\u2019s unclear I think our first \u2013 the first thing we have got to do is do the work on the modeling and that is it\u2019s got to be done properly, it\u2019s detailed, it\u2019s got to be reviewed, it\u2019s got to be signed off. And so we don\u2019t have a date at which that will be done, but the point is we are actively doing it and then depending on when it\u2019s done in our conversations with the Fed that will figure out where we go from there. So, the short answer is we don\u2019t know.","Geoffrey Elliott","Thanks. And then the real estate consolidation costs coming down from $100 million to $75 million, is that because you are able to do the same things at a lower cost than you originally expected or is it because you are doing a bit less, you are doing it over a longer timeframe?","Charlie Scharf","No, it really relates to one building and we actually sublet it, we know the actual numbers now.","Geoffrey Elliott","Terrific. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell","Hey, good morning. I noticed that on the period end balance sheet deposits were down $10 billion, but the balance sheet was down $20 billion, is there a deliberate effort to de-lever a little bit or is there something else going on in terms of the mismatch between the deposit shrinking in the balance sheet?","Mike Santomassimo","Yes, there is no effort to de-leverage per se, Jim, as you would suggest. But as you start to look at treasury activity, some of the trades you had put on just make less sense now and so we know we are just looking at how to best optimize sort of some of that. So I wouldn\u2019t read into that.","Jim Mitchell","Okay. And then maybe just with the rollback bill that passed that gave you guys a carve out for the SLR, does that help at all or is it just the DFAST remains the constraint and it doesn\u2019t really matter in how you run your business?","Mike Santomassimo","Yes, I think \u2013 well, I think that the bills that are out, the bill that got passed plus the some of the Fed proposals still have to get implemented and so that will take some time to sort of play into it. So in a BAU environment, the SLR is still something we are focused on to make sure that we stay where we need to be. But as we sort of think about the future as constructed the Tier 1 leverage ratio in CCAR is the place we are most focused on where our constraint is.","Charlie Scharf","Yes, I guess the only editorializing I would do around it is I would describe it certainly helpful, because whenever you have something which you think makes less sense and you wind up with something which you think directionally makes more sense, that\u2019s a positive change in terms of recognition of the way the business should be run. But as Mike mentioned, our current constraint is the Tier 1 leverage ratio in CCAR which quite frankly we struggle with in terms of a concept of constraint is the reason Mike spoke about, but we will see where that one goes as well.","Jim Mitchell","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And our final question comes as a follow-up question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Alright, great. Thanks for taking my follow-up. Just wanted to actually circle back more strategically on the balance sheet growth strategy as rates go up you guys have always got deposits would sort of runoff to some extent, but is there, I mean, I guess going forward how do you view this from the client side of the business in terms of what you view as, let\u2019s say, the level of excess deposits that are subject to that potential runoff versus how you want to use deposits as an important product within your toolkit? And then if deposits do runoff, would you be willing to using borrower funds to keep the balance sheet from shrinking significantly?","Mike Santomassimo","Yes. So, there is a bunch in there, Brian. So, I will try to get at it, but the \u2013 so, on the last piece we are always looking for opportunities to deploy the balance sheet where it makes sense and where the return make sense. So, that\u2019s something we are looking at now and have always looked at. And so that will sort of continue as we sort of think about that. And where we are focused on deposits is really growing the underlying franchise. So, as Charlie sort of talked about a number of times now like where our focus is, is driving organic growth. And as you sort of do that across most of our products, particularly in investment services, that will bring deposits with it. And so as we sort of think about, there maybe some decline in some of the excess deposits a lot of that sort of run-off already and you have got \u2013 and as you sort of grow the franchise you will bring in new deposits as we do that and can we frame what the level of excess deposits is right now roughly so we can get a sense there?","Charlie Scharf","We have not disclosed that. We think that answers\u2026","Brian Bedell","Okay, fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","And it looks like we do actually have another question from Ken Usdin from Jefferies.","Charlie Scharf","Hi Ken.","Ken Usdin","Thanks guys. Good morning. Thank you. If I can ask a question on core asset servicing, so at securities lending that line was down 1%, AUC\/A were flattish, can you just talk us through some of the dynamics of pluses and minuses in the asset servicing on a sequential basis?","Mike Santomassimo","A lot of that Ken is just some seasonal like activity that happens in the first quarter. We get some fess for things like tax reporting and then there are some particularly some other items that sort of hit \u2013 only hit in the first quarter, so I wouldn\u2019t read into that as a run rate decline.","Ken Usdin","Okay. And then can you give us just some idea of your \u2013 I know you have stopped giving us the new wins, but can you just give us an idea of the pipeline and how you are expecting that to kind of just project that over time as far as your new wins in servicing?","Charlie Scharf","Yes. I would say \u2013 this is Charlie, I think we feel very good about what the wins were both on a gross basis and a net basis in the quarter. And I guess the only other thing I would say is because with lots of people you are right about the way the quarter pans up and whatnot, but you all know this and we talked a little bit about this over the prior quarters. Wins take a period of time, these are generally conversations that happen over multiple quarters leading up to a process generally if you are not going to renew with the incumbent. And so I think where we are today relative to where we hope we would be we are on target and success for us in asset servicing will continue to be a slow steady build which quite frankly it\u2019s hard to look at quarter-by-quarter, you need to look at that over a longer period of time. And I think at this point we still feel on track relative to that commentary.","Ken Usdin","Great point, Charlie and if I might just two more cleanups, just related to the numbers, Mike did you say what the benefit on the revenue side was from FX translation on a year-over-year basis put into context with the 2% hurt on the cost side?","Mike Santomassimo","We did, it was in my commentary, roughly \u2013 it was roughly about 1%, yes, it\u2019s like roughly 1 point, but there too, remember we mentioned, we also had some leasing gains in [indiscernible] in the prior year. So my own take at this net-net is the overall number is a pretty good, I mean the reported number is a pretty good proxy for what real growth was in the quarter. Well, on the expense side, we did have the effective currency and the real estate.","Ken Usdin","And as we roll forward that was my other question on the currency, the way to growth on expenses, if we continue to have this burden on the cost side, is this kind the 3% zone, the right way to think about go forward as well?","Mike Santomassimo","Yes. I would go back to sort of the guidance we gave at Investor Day on expenses Ken and I think we are sort of tracking there.","Ken Usdin","Right, okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","And we have a question from Mike Carrier with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Mike Carrier","Hi. Thanks guys. Sorry about that earlier. Just one question on the investment management side, just in terms of the long-term flows in the quarter, I don\u2019t know if you mentioned anything that was more unusual or maybe lumpy, just given the level of outflow this quarter versus what we have been seeing?","Mike Santomassimo","So I will take that and Charlie can add color to on, so just to remind you Mike we are very much an institutional money manager, very little retail in there. So you guys think about as you sort of look at some of these line items. I just reiterate the performance has been consistent, Charlie mentioned sort of the 89% over the 3-year and 5-year benchmark, so we feel okay there. And as you sort of look at the some of the equity \u2013 actively managed equity portfolios that\u2019s sort of inline with what you are seeing across the industry. In depth, I would sort of think of some of those outflows is very idiosyncratic clients, changes in allocation for our clients. And then on the cash side, as I mentioned in my commentary, there was some concentration related to some big client M&A activity that brought some balances in on a temporary basis. So, you sort of see that dynamic going through there.","Mike Carrier","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then I know you guys hit on Pershing just the year-over-year some of the lost business, but I guess just when I think about that business and some of the industry trends that we are seeing, generally it\u2019s fairly favorable, but I just wanted to figure out like how much of that was just very specifically that versus maybe the core of the underlying trends of the business?","Charlie Scharf","Yes, let me take a shot at this. I think these are so \u2013 just as I talked about on the asset servicing side where there are long gestation periods when people decide to leave us, it\u2019s the same thing. So, these are things that we have known about for a long time. It\u2019s factored into our thinking about what we think overall trends in revenue can look like. And again these are relatively idiosyncratic relative to when they show up. There continues to be a significant interest in clients of all sizes to talk about their desire to figure out how what we can do at scale relative to not just cost, but building additional capabilities, how they can benefit from that. There is a \u2013 I would describe it, it\u2019s just an extremely open mind in the asset servicing world, where we deal with big asset managers and small asset managers across the world, but also the broker dealer community both bigger and smaller. So I think relative to the way we think about the opportunity in the business, those trends continue to make us feel very good about the business that we have and that\u2019s not even talking about the opportunities within Pershing that we think we continue to have in the RIA space, which we highlighted at Investor Day.","Mike Carrier","Alright, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And there are no further questions in the queue.","Valerie Haertel","Thanks everyone for joining us. Feel free to call Investor Relations if you have any follow-up and have a great day.","Charlie Scharf","Thank you everyone.","Operator","And if there are any additional questions or comments, you may contact Ms. Valerie Haertel at 212-635-8529.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Andy Clark. Mr. Clark, you may begin.","Andy Clark","Thanks, Wendy, and welcome, everyone. With us today are Gerald Hassell, our Chairman and CEO; Todd Gibbons, our CFO, as well as our executive management team.","Before we begin, let me remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement in the press release and those identified in our documents filed with the SEC that are available on our website. Forward-looking statements in this call will speak only as of today, January 17, 2014, and we will not update forward-looking statements. Our press release and earnings review are available on our website, and we'll be using the earnings review to discuss our results. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Gerald. Gerald?","Gerald L. Hassell","Thanks, Andy. Welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As you saw from the release, for the fourth quarter, we've reported earnings of $0.44 per share. Now this includes an after-tax loss of $115 million or $0.10 per share related to the write-down of an equity investment. After netting out this loss, we had adjusted earnings of $0.54 per share. We had a strong year-over-year growth in core Investment Management and Investment Services fees. The growth reflects improved market conditions and importantly, our success in providing solution sets across our businesses that our clients are seeking. As we have said in the past, we are making strategic investments in several areas to expand our capabilities and we're seeing early evidence of returns on those investments.","For the quarter, we had total revenues of $3.8 billion, which is up 4% over the fourth quarter of 2012. The Investment Management business performance remains terrific. Our success in attracting new assets help drive a 14% increase in assets under management year-over-year to a record $1.58 trillion. In 2013, net long-term flows were $95 billion as we continue to have particular strength in the liability driven investments category. Now this organic growth, along with higher equity values and performance fees, helped mitigate the pressure from higher money market fee waivers year-over-year. Similar to Investment Management, we had strong year-over-year growth in Investment Services. We saw growth in Asset Servicing, Issuer Services and Clearing fees driven by higher volumes, improved equity values and net new business.","Clearing Services in particular continues to show strong growth as our technology platform serving investment advisers is more broadly adopted. But some of our investments also contributed to this growth. Our Global Collateral Services business continue to collect -- gather collateral management assets. We enjoyed better foreign exchange results year-over-year as our investments in the electronic channel had made us more competitive and we are attracting greater volumes.","Now in terms of our expenses, seasonality played a large part of the sequential growth. Our expenses have been impacted by our strategic investments for future growth, as well as increasing regulatory and compliance requirements. Notably, our operational excellence initiatives' savings help mitigate some of this expense pressure. And you will see that we achieved our operational excellence targets of over $650 million, a full 1 year ahead of schedule. And, importantly, we're not done. We're now transitioning to a broader continuous improvement process designed to improve efficiencies. This process is not a program or an initiative or a one-time project. It will be an ongoing area of emphasis that is becoming part of the fabric of our culture. Now we already have line of sight into several hundred millions of dollars of financial benefit over the next few years.","Turning to the capital front. Our business model generates a significant level of capital and allows us to perform well in stress scenarios, giving us increased financial flexibility. In 2013, we have returned approximately $1.7 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends or share repurchases. Now in terms of share repurchases, during the first quarter, we are in a position to potentially increase the total share buyback relative to the fourth quarter. And Todd will cover that in more detail in a minute. So for the quarter, continued growth in core Investment Services and Investment Management fees, successful completion of our operational excellence initiatives, and continued strong capital position.","Now looking ahead to 2014. We expect to see more of the benefits in some of the investments we've been making. In Global Markets, we're continuing to roll out new electronics foreign exchange and capital markets trading capabilities that position us to capture additional activity. The growth of our Global Collateral Services business should benefit as the markets deal with new collateral regulations. In Investment Management, we're in the midst of greatly expanding our wealth management sales force. Additionally, we are making significant progress reaching individual investors by expanding our retail distribution capabilities and product offerings. We've also made progress in expanding our Investment Management and Investment Services capabilities in the Asia-Pacific region with our separately-managed accounts platform scheduled to go live shortly. We've successfully piloted an intermediate -- Intermediary Private Banking program between wealth management and Pershing and will look to build on that momentum. And we continue to reposition to benefit even more as fund managers look to leverage our technology and advisors and brokers move away from self-clearing. We like how we're positioned and we're upbeat about our prospects for 2014. With that, let me turn it over to Todd.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Thanks, Gerald, and good morning, everyone. As in the past, my comments will follow the quarterly review, and let's begin on Page 2. As Gerald noted, EPS was $0.44. That includes the after-tax loss of $115 million or $0.10 per share. That was related to the equity investment we have, a minority interest in ConvergEx. So we see it as a $0.50 -- $0.54 quarter but that does include the benefit of approximately $0.01 on tax.","Looking at the numbers on a year-over-year basis, total revenue was $3.8 billion. That's on a non-GAAP, that's up 4%. In our Investment Services business, we had growth in Asset Servicing, Issuer and Clearing Services. Investment Management and performance fees continued their strong trend. FX revenue was up, and NIR also grew. Expenses were up 2% on a GAAP basis. Adjusted, they were up about 4%, largely reflecting higher staff, legal, consulting and business development expenses.","Turning to Page 4 where we call out some business metrics that will help you understand our underlying performance. You can see that AUM of $1.58 trillion was up 14% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Now this was driven by net new business wins and higher equity market values.","During the quarter, we had net long-term inflows of $2 billion, and short-term inflows of $6 billion. Assets under custody and administration at quarter end were $27.6 trillion, that's up $1.3 trillion or 5% year-over-year. It primarily reflects the impact of higher market values and net new business. Linked-quarter, AUC\/A was up about 1% and that's due to improved market values. Most of our key metrics showed solid growth on a year-over-year basis. Average loans and deposits in wealth management, Investment Services were up very strongly, most clearing metrics were up quite nicely as well. DARTS volumes and average long-term mutual fund assets continued that recent strong growth trend.","DR programs were down in the quarter and that's really reflecting market events including M&A and corporate restructurings. So when you do see an M&A transaction, it can result in the termination of a given program. And we have been disciplined, I might say, around the pricing in that business. Average tri-party repo balances were down year-over-year but up sequentially as we continue to see opportunities for growth for Global Collateral Services. Asset Servicing fees were up -- this is on Page 6, were up 4% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Both those increases largely reflect higher market values, organic growth and higher collateral management and segregation fees in Global Collateral Services. The year-over-year increase was partially offset by lower securities lending revenue, and that was primarily driven to -- by lower spreads. We had an estimated $123 billion in new AUC\/A wins in Asset Servicings. And for the year in total, we had new AUC\/A wins totaling $639 billion. Clearing fees were up 10% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher mutual fund fees, asset-based fees and volumes, and that was partially offset by higher money market fee waivers. The sequential increase was primarily driven by higher clearing revenue and mutual fund fees.","Issuer service fees were up 10% year-over-year and they were down 26% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primary reflects DR revenue that was really driven by corporate actions, and that was partially offset by the runoff that we've seen in securitizations in Corporate Trust. The sequential decrease, as we've mentioned before, was primarily resulted from seasonally lower DR revenue in the fourth quarter versus the third. Investment Management and performance fees were up 6% year-over-year and 10% sequentially. And if you adjust them for the sale of our Newton private client business last quarter, they were up 7% and 11%. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher equity market values, net new business wins and higher performance fees and that was partially offset by higher money market fee waivers and the average impact that we saw in the strengths of the dollar. The sequential increase primarily reflects seasonally higher performance fees and higher equity market values.","Now in terms of money market fees, the aggregate impact or EPS this quarter was approximately $0.06 to $0.07, that's pretty much in the range that we saw in the third quarter. From a revenue perspective, on a year-over-year basis, that drag was $47 million, and it's split fairly evenly between our Investment Management and our Investment Services business.","Moving on to FX and other trading, revenue was up 5% year-over-year and it was down 9% sequentially. The underlying components, FX revenue was $126 million. That's up 19% from last year, that's down 18% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher volumes and we did see a little bit higher volatility. The sequential decrease was driven by a significant decline in volatility sequentially, but that was partially offset by volume increases. So as Gerald noted earlier, the enhancements we've made to our electronic trading platforms have contributed to the results and we have definitely seen a significant increase in volume.","Other trading revenue was down $13 million from the year ago quarter and up $14 million from the third quarter. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects lower derivatives trading revenue. The sequential increase was driven by higher fixed income trading and that was partially offset by a lower equity derivatives stream. Investment and other income was a loss of $60 million compared with income of $116 million in the year ago quarter, and income of $135 million on the prior quarter. Both decreases primarily reflect the write down of the goodwill in our equity investment in ConvergEx.","Turning to Page 8 of the earnings review, you'll see that net interest revenue on a fully tax equivalent basis was up $41 million versus the year ago quarter. It was down $6 million sequentially. The year-over-year increase in interest revenue is primarily driven by higher average interest earning assets. The sequential decrease primarily reflects the change in the mix as we saw a full quarter impact of the move to a defensive rate position that we took pretty much in the third quarter. And that was partially offset by an increase in revenue generated by the higher deposits. The net interest margin for the quarter was 1.09%. It was flat with where we were last year at this time. And down a bit from 1.16% in the third quarter.","Turning to Page 9, total noninterest expenses, and this excludes the amortization intangibles, M&I, as well as litigation restructuring charges, were up 4% year-over-year, and about the same sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily resulted from increased staff expense and that was driven by higher incentives due to the higher pretax income that we had, as well as increased employee benefit cost and that's really came down to higher pension expense for the year 2013.","Higher legal expense was related to litigation defense. We did see some increased consulting expenses, as Gerald had mentioned, largely driven by regulatory and compliance requirements, but also to support some of our key business initiatives. And we did have higher business development expense, and that's a lot to do with our corporate branding campaign and the marketing initiatives that we've had as we continue to invest in building our brand.","The sequential increase primarily resulted from higher legal consulting and business development expenses reflecting the factors that I noted above, as well as seasonality and the timing of client conferences and corporate sponsorships.","Page 10 details our success in achieving our operational excellence initiative goal of more than $650 million expenses. We've done that a year ahead of schedule. In fact, we've now achieved savings at a rate of about $716 million.","One noteworthy accomplishment in the recent move of our New York Treasury and Trading operations from a leased building in downtown Manhattan to one of our own properties. It's a state-of-art facility and it's another example of how we're taking action to reduce the cost of our real estate footprint around the globe.","Now that we have met our operational excellence goals, this will be the last quarter that we report them to you.","As Gerald mentioned, we're now shifting to a broader transformation process, one that we've internally branded, Transforming for Success. And that moves us from a project or a program orientation to one of a culture of continuous improvement.","This work should provide significant beneficial impact as we've identified a number of things that we'll be doing over the next few years. But it's not simply about cost, of course that's very important to me, and an important component. It's also about raising the bar on service quality, driving productivity gains and importantly, reducing risks.","Turning to our capital story, as you can see on Page 11. Our key ratios strengthened substantially over the quarter. At December 31, our estimated Basel III Tier 1 common ratio under the standardized approach was 10.6, and that compared to 10.1 at the end of September. Now this ratio is calculated on a fully phased-in basis. The 50 basis point sequential increase primarily reflects lower risk-weighted assets that are related both to securitizations, as well as to margin-wise.[ph] Our estimated supplementary leverage ratio actually declined by about 10 basis points during the quarter. That was largely due to a spike that we saw in year-end balance sheet. Our year-end balance sheet was actually $18 billion larger than the average for the quarter.","On Page 12, you can see that at quarter end, we had a net unrealized gain investment securities portfolio of $309 million. That was down from $723 million at the end of the prior quarter. And that was driven by the rise in interest rates that we saw in the fourth quarter.","Looking at our loan book on Page 13. You can see that the provision for credit losses was $6 million. This was driven by an increase in the allowance related to a municipal-related entity. And that compares on a year-over-year basis to a credit of $61 million and a provision of $2 million in the prior quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.8%, and that was positively impacted both by the tax benefit associated with the loss to an equity investment, in fact that was the major driver, as well as some benefit from lower state taxes.","Now a few points to factor in to your thinking about the current quarter. Incentive expenses is impacted by divesting of long-term stock awards. As we've mentioned in the past, for retirement-eligible employees. So typically, we do see a seasonal increase in the first quarter. We would expect a decrease in our pension expense given the very strong performance that we've seen on the assets in 2013, as well as an increase in the discount rate. We would expect net interest income to be down in the quarter due to a lower day count. So there's 2 fewer days, as well as a smaller balance sheet as we have seen a lot of the spike in deposits run off.","The quarterly provision should be in the range of $0 million to $15 million as we've seen in the previous number of quarters. We expect the tax rate to be around 26%. Also in the fourth quarter, our gross share repurchases, including open market employee benefit plan related repurchases, totaled about $321 million. In the first quarter, our gross share repurchases could increase by as much as $60 million. But that is, of course, subject to market conditions and other factors.","During the quarter and all of 2014, we'll be focused, as I think you've heard from both Gerald and I, on 3 main activities. One is investing in our organic growth opportunities. Number two is transforming our businesses to this continuous improvement that drives productivity gains, saves us some money and generates premium service quality. And number three is we will continue to deploy our capital and manage our risks wisely. With that, let me turn it back to Gerald.","Gerald L. Hassell","Thanks, Todd, and I think we can now open it up for questions, Wendy?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","One question just on the outlook for the SLR. There was, over the past weekend, some discussion coming out of Basel that a lot of investors kind of focused on, that did not have a carve out for deposits at the Fed or central banks. And just wanted to get your updated sense on how you're thinking about that. I realize that the U.S. [indiscernible] hasn't opined yet but there's a little bit of a concern since Basel did this, that we'll follow.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Sure, Betsy. It's Todd. I think the good news on the final Basel rule is that they are going to treat unfunded commitments a little more reasonably. So the impact of that is probably a reduction of about 50% on the balance sheet. There still is an open issue, not so much with Basel on the treatment of central bank cash, but ultimately how the U.S. is going to treat that. And I think it's too early to call so there's plenty of room within the U.S. interpretation to do something. And we hear things both positively and negatively along that but I just say, at this point, we really don't know.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Can you give us a sense on the unfunded commitments, what the benefit is to you from that?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes. We have anywhere from around $45 billion, $40 billion to $45 billion on unfunded commitments. And it moves it from about 100% to about 50% is our rough estimate, we really haven't -- this news just came out so we really haven't gotten completely underneath that yet.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Sure, great. And then separately, on the investments that you've been making in retail, Gerald, you highlighted, I think, at the beginning of the call some of the opportunities out there and expectation. Can you just give a sense as to -- kind of the timeframe for what you're thinking the retail investment spend will drive some increases in top line and over what timeframe magnitude?","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes. I'll start and then perhaps turn it over to Curtis. As you know, we are relatively underexposed to the retail investor. And this has been something of great focus by the firm. We're starting with improving some of our distribution capabilities, investing at wholesalers to get our products on various retail platforms around the world, not just in the U.S. We're investing in some of the product capabilities. We're investing in some of the areas around the Dreyfus brand and capabilities to enhance some of those product offerings. And so this is not a short-term fix because this takes a fair amount of investment in both people and strategies to broaden our exposure to the retail investor. So this is a long-term investment and this is something we plan to continue to push. Curtis?","Curtis Y. Arledge","I think that's well said. We've obviously got a great start. The Dreyfus platform, here in the U.S., has obviously got all the infrastructure and very importantly, the relationships with the adviser community through Pershing, we're able to connect with some of their clients as well. So I think that we have a lot of foundation to build upon. To your specific question, I mean we've gotten -- started adding staff, adding product development capabilities, investing in our brand. And I actually think we're going to see some -- we're going to see the beginning edges of our improvement toward the end of this year. There are some product specifically that we have a very strong investment performance in that I think the market has great demand for. So we're very optimistic about our future here.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So what percentage into the investment spend would you say you are?","Curtis Y. Arledge","I'd say we're about 20% of the way into the investments spend. And at the end of 2014, I expect to be closer to 50%.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then the revenue piece is starting at the end of '14?","Curtis Y. Arledge","Yes, we're, obviously, we're already in the business. So we have revenues in the retail space. But seeing real momentum, I think that, I hope we'll be able to see it in the third and fourth quarter this year.","Operator","The next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Gerald, you guys have made some comments at a recent conference just about operating leverage going forward and what kind of environment you'd need to deliver positive operating leverage. And it seemed like even with these hundreds of millions of expenses and per the last answers about where you are on the build, that the operating environment needs to still get meaningfully better to really generate bigger operating leverage. So can you kind of give us your thoughts as far as next year to on your belief in what revenues you think could look like on the top line? And then if you can, in fact, deliver operating leverage as you look go ahead?","Gerald L. Hassell","Well, first, Kenneth, I don't want to get in the forward guidance business. But I think in this environment, we are challenged. But we're challenging the team to produce positive operating leverage. I think we said in a 4% to 5% zone or north of that and we should be able to produce it. We are obviously bearing the cost of regulatory compliance and investments in our businesses, so we're partially reinvesting some of those gains from operational excellence right back into the business and covering those other costs. But I sure would like to produce positive operating leverage. It's our goal. I know it's top of the mind on our investors and by you all. And that is part of our goal.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Ken, I'd add to that. I think that what we had indicated a couple of years ago at our investors conference is we felt our revenue growth rate should be in the 3% to 5% range. It's been approximately there at about 4% this year. At the lower end of that it's pretty difficult to generate a lot of positive operating leverage as we get to the higher end of it, we do start to generate it. This year we made, and this year being 2013, we made a conscious decision, and I think Curtis just pointed out a couple of the types of investments that we're making. We made a conscious decision to put 1% or 2%, if you will, of our expenses growth into reinvesting in opportunities for the future. So I think that otherwise you would have seen a meaningful operating, the core business did generate a meaningful operating leverage.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Yes, and related to that, just on -- you pointed out that this quarter, there seem to be a good amount of partially seasonal expense pickup. But can you help us try to identify how much of that increase might have been one-time or above trend relative to the expense result this quarter?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Sure. I mean, some of it is episodic. So we have seen a sharp rise in our defense -- litigation defenses. That's likely to run for some time but for -- certainly not permanently, we have seen a pickup around certain compliance and regulatory issues, some of that is episodic. But the run rate is certainly higher. I'd say the growth rate of that has probably curtailed a bit. And then we saw marketing costs which tend to be somewhat seasonal as we picked up our advertising campaign and we have a number of conferences and corporate events that typically take place in the fourth quarter. So that is seasonal. And I think we did make a push with our brand campaign in 2013 that would abate a little bit.","Gerald L. Hassell","Ken, the other point I would like to make is one of the reasons why we view this continuous improvement process is something that's got to be part of the core fabric of the company. And we do see, as I said in my opening comments, a line of sight for continuing to get expenses and efficiencies and higher levels of productivity out of our core operations. There's no question in my mind that there's hundreds of millions of dollars there, and we have an ability and certainly an attitude to get at it.","Operator","The next question is from Glenn Schorr with ISI.","Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","A quick one on RWA inflation or lack thereof, which is a good thing. So I see RWAs whether it be centralized or advanced came down some in the quarter. So my quick question is, a couple of banks have been reporting inflation on higher operational risk. I think that's been accounted for in your models a while ago. I just want to know if we should be looking for any other RWA inflation as all these final rules have come out?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Sure, Glenn. It's getting complicated because there's a lot going on right now. But if you look at, we give a fairly detailed disclosure around the changes to our risk-weighted assets, both in the standardized and in the advanced approach. And when we reflect that, that's on a fully phased-in basis. Actually now there are phased-ins that start to take place this year, so our actual reported the numbers this year, as we move into Basel III, are going to be quite higher than the fully phased-in numbers. All of that being said, if you look through the numbers, there's a couple of drivers there, OCI had a modest impact to us because we did see a little bit of downturn in the securities portfolio. We got a little bit of a pickup in the pension portfolios, it's gone up in value. And then the meaningful driver is the RWA calculation in the standardized approach. Now just to add complexity, the standardized approach does not take into consideration operational risk. It just has -- uses Basel I, and adds severity to it, if you will. And so the large driver there is around securities, our securities lending mix, as well as margin lending and the quality of the collateral that you have in those margin loans. So we did see some improvement there. And we saw less of that reflected in the advanced approach. So it's not to say that there couldn't be changes. But from our best estimates right now, we're not really -- we don't really require a whole lot of RWAs to build our business. And I think the kind of the other thing to point out is we do have these non-agency securities and the securitizations and they do tend to draw a little bit higher capital charges. And they're slowly paying themselves down. So that should continue to be a positive for us.","Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, I get that. And then LDI flows for the year were awesome. I don't know if I saw what they were for the quarter. And I'm just curious if higher long-end rates are, in a weird way, bad in the short term but really good in the long term for that business. I'm just curious if it had an impact in the quarter and what your outlook for the LDI outflows are.","Curtis Y. Arledge","Glenn, it's Curtis. I definitely think that looking at this funded status ratio of pension plans is an important indicator here of kind of what's going on. If you look at where we are today, that's where the average plan is funded at about a 95%, 96% ratio which dipped actually below 75%, back in 2011. We're at the highest levels we've been at since before the financial crisis, 2008. And so pension plans have been on a pretty wild ride around their funded status ratio. In the quarter, we definitely saw more interest in talking about whether they should move towards locking in some of this recent improvement, there was definitely some de-risking. We even saw it index, in the index businesses where there were actually outflows in equity index products and movement towards fixed income and towards more balanced risk. So I definitely think that the LDI business is still a very promising business as pension plans are, in many ways, better positioned to be able to move to that strategy.","Operator","The next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So I wanted to touch base on the collateral management opportunity and kind of what the learning is this year. So migration to clearing happened this year, fairly seamlessly, which I guess is a good thing. But looking out, I guess, when you think about the opportunity for yourself and it sounded like there's already a little bit of revenues coming through the model today. So I was hoping maybe you can help us quantify that, and maybe give an update on how big do you guys think collateral management could be for you? And I guess what are the catalysts we need to look forward to, to see more a material impact?","Gerald L. Hassell","Sure, Alex. I think, as we said in the past, we're still, I think frankly in the early stages of the impact on the marketplace. The dealer side has been impacted early on. Now the -- the long investors of risk accounts, other market participants, the buy-side is now having to deal with this particular issue. We've cited insurance companies as a good example in the past where, historically, they have not had to post collateral and now they have to start doing so. So I think we're still in the early innings of the impact in the market broadly. Though most of the revenues that we've seen as we've been -- seeing some success here in collateral services has been around the segregation or the optimization of the collateral as opposed to moving into the next phase of transforming it and making it more available and more easily movable around the world. And so, I still think we have many innings to go in terms of the opportunity here. And so, we're -- as I said in my opening comments, we're seeing increased revenues. It's showing up in our asset servicing fee line, that's where it shows up. And we're quite positive about the prospects here.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then, Todd, just a question on expenses, follow-up to Ken's question, I guess, as well. But, as you pointed out a couple of years ago, you said I think around 3% expense growth rate is reasonable. There's new investments you guys are making relative to what you outlined a few years ago. But also, it sounds like there's new savings that you will try to achieve. So kind of blending it all together, is a 3% kind of normal expense growth rate for the next couple of years still a reasonable way to think about it?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes. But Alex, it's going to, obviously, be tied to the revenues and it's going to be tied to types of revenues that we see. So the mix can have a meaningful impact. Certain of our revenues are very -- have fixed cost, so massive amounts of operating leverage to them, whereas others come with meaningful cost. So the revenue mix has a big impact. I mean the good news is we've had a headwind of increasing pension expenses year-after-year. And that should ease a bit this year. But I think generally, it's going to come with -- depending on the mix of revenues and the amount of investments as opportunities that we see for organic growth.","Operator","The next question is from Ashley Serrao with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ashley N. Serrao - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So on expenses. I hear you loud and clear on your $100 million program. But maybe you can give us some examples of what you're working on today and how we should be thinking about the incremental investment spend there versus the savings?","Gerald L. Hassell","Sure, I'll take a stab at it and then, Todd, maybe you want to weigh in. In many ways, it's fairly basic and it's -- and we said in the past, we've had -- we have multiple operating platforms. We're going to the conversions of that now and being able to shut down different things. It makes it a much more efficient operating environment when you have fewer platforms and fewer engines to work across, so improvement going from a more manual process or to a more automated process, really applying some metrics and engineering around our capabilities. We have multiple centers around the world, that do things like reconciliations and tax claims and corporate actions and stuff like that, there's ways to consolidate those. Just a whole variety of different things. Brian Shea is really leading the charge with Suresh Kumar, our Chief Technology Information Officer. Brian, maybe you want to weigh in here.","Brian T. Shea","Yes. Thanks, Gerald. I think what we're doing in terms of this Transforming for Success program is expanding the focus beyond just pure expense reductions, although that's an important part of it for sure. A couple of things that are new and different. One is we're working across the Investment Services businesses which have been run more like individual businesses in the past and effectively. But we're trying to drive best practices across those businesses and create more leverage. So an example would be cross line of business solutions for clients which actually generate new revenue streams. One example which -- and that's happening within Investment Services and across Investment Services and Investment Management. And a good recent example would be that we just piloted an Intermediary Private Banking service for Pershing registered investment adviser customers. And in a pilot program of only less than 6 months, we've had over $300 million in loan demand generated from the independents RIAs who are actually leveraging BNY Mellon's wealth management capabilities in a different way. Similarly, by working across the businesses, we're looking at -- we're evaluating the portfolio of services and solutions we deliver, trying to figure out if there are subscale solutions or services that we don't actually need to provide that can reduce expenses. And we're instituting essentially consistent expense management disciplines and process and reporting, and doing other things like that, that actually can drive higher return on what we already do. And it's not rocket science, but it's just working differently across the businesses. So that's one of the big things. And we believe that there's tremendous opportunity in these cross business solutions that we can generate revenue. So that's why this is different. It going to include revenue generation as well as expense reduction.","Ashley N. Serrao - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And maybe on capital. You got a welcome downgrade in the GSIV rankings. I believe the substitutability criteria helped you there. But how does this impact how you think about running a capital cushion on top of your leverage requirements? And how does this impact how you think about CCAR in general?","Thomas P. Gibbons","In terms of running the cushion, we're already, as you can see, actually running a pretty substantial cushion. So that we obviously think that puts us in a better position. But what we do is we sensitize what those capital ratios can be. We do our own internal stress test of many different types to estimate what we ultimately think the cushion ought to be. We don't really know what our additional GSIV requirement is going to be. That was under the Basel framework, the global requirement. But we have not been designated within the U.S. what that might be. But we certainly feel quite comfortable about the level that we're operating today. We think it's prudent and we think it's got plenty of cushion for potential downside. I think the good news in our business model is, we have, as you know, very low risk-weighted assets, so there doesn't tend to be a lot of volatility around those assets. They're very high quality, most of them are secured and short-term. And then our securities portfolio is also extremely high quality, mostly agencies and treasuries. So it survives any stress test typically quite well. I think the other thing in our business model is we do have a lot of annuity-like businesses. And we've got a less risky mix of assets. Now that doesn't always help us when the equity market shoots up like it did in the fourth quarter. But when it goes the other direction, we don't feel the pain quite as much as most. And that makes us a little more resilient in terms of stress testing as well. So hopefully that helps you to get a little better understanding of our perspective.","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes. I think in general that we have a low risk-weighted asset model. We have good capital cushions. We're getting a better line of sight on some of these new rules and regulations as they're unfolding. And as we've said earlier, we think we have some pretty good financial flexibility as we go into 2014. And we'll see the results of the CCAR exam at the end of March and stay tuned.","Operator","The next question is from Josh Levin with Citigroup.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You talked about meeting operational excellence goals a year ahead of schedule. For those of us on the outside who don't work for the company, we only have access to publicly available information. Where can we look to sort of see the fruits of operational excellence? Where is it flowing through?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes. Josh, I think what we had indicated in the -- 3 years ago, almost 3 years ago now, was if we initiate this program, those numbers amount to about 2% reduction in our annual run rate. And we had indicated there was probably about a 2% inflation in our annual run rate. So by making these improvements, we won't feel the impact of the inflation. That's merit increases, the increase in cost of pensions, and the increased software amortization was largely where I reflect it in the inflation component. So that would let our businesses and our business mix reflect upon itself. So we indicated that a 5% type of revenue growth rate we thought, we could see something like 100 to 150 basis points positive operating leverage, 4%, a little bit less than that. So that's exactly where we are running right now. Obviously, the revenue mix makes a little bit of a difference. But what you saw this year on a GAAP basis was 4% over 2% and, adjusting it for some of those one timers, you saw basically 4% over 4%. And the reason you didn't see more operating leverage is because we made a decision to invest organically. If we were investing -- if we were doing M&A rather than organic growth, you would have seen it. We think the organic growth comes with a much higher IRR. It's much more interesting rather than paying somebody else for their labor, developing ourselves is much more interesting, our long-term run rate. And that's why you see what you see.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. There's been a lot of talk that the M&A environment might pick up. If we do see a lot more M&A activity, how does that impact your various businesses?","Gerald L. Hassell","Well, usually when there's more M&A activity, it increases volumes and volatility in the marketplace. And volumes and volatility help our business model. And anytime there's more action going on in the markets, people are willing to take a little more risk, take a little more positioning. We see that flow through our business model through transactions. And it also improves some values. Areas like Depositary Receipts, anytime there's corporate actions, boy, it shows up there real fast.","Operator","The next question is from Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So coming back to the asset management business for a second. The margins there are in the low 30% range, and that's below, I think, what you see at some of your peers. So I wondered if you might touch on what you think the issue is there. Is there a good structural reason for it or do you see some opportunity to get it higher? I think you talked earlier on the call about the retail opportunity. Is that part of a margin improvement story? And what level of margin do you think the asset management business could support beyond the investments you're making in retail?","Curtis Y. Arledge","No, I think you're actually right on it which is some of the higher-margin activities within the investment management industry are in the areas that we've talked about investing in, which is retail. Growing our overall absolute return and alternatives efforts which we've seen actually some nice progress. And we actually do a whole lot of work around our margins and benchmarking to the industry. And margins, obviously, vary across different asset classes that investment managers are exposed to. So we're a pretty diversified asset manager that is more weighted towards institutional at the moment. Equity managers might have higher margins, but they're also substantially more volatile. Our margin actually is pretty stable through time. So those are some of the factors that we look to. We -- again, clearly, the last several years have been very challenging in fee waivers. So the business has a large mix of assets that are exposed to the money market business. And that has been a major dampening. You're talking about reasonably higher-margin business that has been under a downward pressure now for a number of years. So that has definitely put a damper on it. We're obviously waiting to see where the SEC goes with the rules around money markets. But hopeful that someday that actually will bear fruit, either in money market form or those assets will have to move somewhere. And potentially to -- some of them will get a short duration, fixed-income product. So that's sort of the thought around margin.","Gerald L. Hassell","And I also would add, that's why strategically and longer term, we feel like we need to make the investments to have greater exposure to the retail investor and retail products, and also in the alternative space, those are 2 key areas of focus that are going to require a level of investment. But I think those are the areas for growth and are also the areas for margin improvement.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, helpful. And then the issue of spinning off asset management. I'm actually not sure the rationale for that is very good, but it's something you've been asked about more lately on. Some people question whether there are real synergies with the servicing business, so I thought perhaps an opportunity to comment on that.","Gerald L. Hassell","Sure. We obviously like the Investment Management business. We think there are some benefits and synergies across our Investment Services areas. We see clear evidence of it in terms of the clients we serve. When they trust us to manage the money, we have opportunities to servicing and vice versa. Having the intellectual capital internally around our Investment Management boutiques to help us be a better service provider absolutely helps. You heard Brian Shea talk about some of the initiatives that we're doing across Pershing and Investment Management, utilizing that platform more robustly. We just see a number of different opportunities connecting to our wealth business, Investment Management, the whole strategy in Asia-Pacific, it's building the technology platform to put our products on top of it and have attracted advisers and wealth managers globally. We use that platform and put our products front and center on it. We just see lots and lots of different opportunities to continue to grow both businesses together.","Operator","The next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","I have some real specific questions and then just a broader question. But my specific questions, can you just remind us what are your main financial targets? You mentioned 3% to 5% revenue growth, but what are the other main targets?","Thomas P. Gibbons","What we had indicated, Mike, back on investors day that we've anticipated 3% to 5% revenue growth. We expected anywhere from 0 to 200 basis points of operating leverage based upon where we would be within that. Obviously, that would be largely driven by revenue mix. And one of the issues that Curtis just pointed out in fee waivers is meaningful, it's $0.06 to $0.07 a quarter with very limited expenses associated with it. The other indication is we thought we would, over time, generate a 10% plus return on shareholders' equity, that leads to quite a bit higher return on tangible common equity. So those were the basic underlying themes.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","And the investment spending that you're talking about, you said you're 27% done. What is the total dollar amount of the investment spending?","Thomas P. Gibbons","We haven't disclosed that, Mike, and what Curtis was speaking to specifically was investment spending within Investment Management where we've got a number of projects that he alluded to. So we're about 20% of the way through that, we'll be, as he indicated, about halfway through by the end of the year. At which point, we'll see some of the benefits of the earlier investments.","Gerald L. Hassell","That was specifically in the retail space.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Right, and that was specific to the retail space. And we also have mentioned on a number of occasion the types of investment that we are making in our Investment Services businesses as well.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","So last year, that investment spending equaled 2% of expenses or maybe how much did it equal last year?","Thomas P. Gibbons","I think we had indicated for 2013, it was roughly in line with a 2% increase in our expenses.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Okay. And then as far as the continuous improvement project, you said that should save a few hundred million. Can you specify that a little bit more concretely?","Thomas P. Gibbons","At this point, we're debating that internally whether we want to go public with that, Mike. So I think it's too early to say. We are looking at the various expense savings that we're going to be able to generate. As Brian pointed out, some of this is -- as we become much more process-oriented, there are some also revenue benefits that we think we will get out of this as well. But we haven't determined whether we're going to go public with that or not yet.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","The reason I ask those specific questions, someone else asked about the operational excellence and where do we see it. And so how do we, on the outside, know if you're achieving your targets with the continuous improvement or the investment spending? Or do you want us just to look at those general financial metrics that you're shooting for?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes. That's what we're debating internally, Mike. We really haven't reached a -- ultimately, and I think it was Josh at Citi that pointed this out, ultimately, you got to see it. And we believe you will see it. And I think we've been pretty consistent with the guidance that we gave a number of years ago, there's obviously a lot of factors in markets that go on that can create noise there. But that's why we're debating. And so, let's just -- let's drive it through and perhaps let it reflect itself.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","And then my general question. You mentioned that you're underexposed to the retail investors and you want to get more involved in the retail investors. I'm just trying to reconcile my thought of Bank of New York from several years back, when Bank of New York was referred to as the banker to banks, more wholesale, institutional. And now we're talking about Bank of New York getting involved with the retail investor. Going back, you had branches. And so, I'm just trying to reconcile that prior perception with the direction where you're going now. And you also mentioned Investment Management, private banking, how far to the retail investor would you like to go and when did you make this mental change?","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes. So Mike, retail banking and exposure to the retail investor are 2 different things in my mind. When I say exposure to the retail investor, when you think about pension funds, things like that are not growing, that's not where the assets are being accumulated. They're being accumulated at the individual investor as they plan for retirement on a global scale. And so, we manage a lot of money in the institutional space. We manage some money in the retail space. And we'd like to be able to have a better balance there. Dreyfus is our principal retail mutual fund brand. But it's not just Dreyfus, it's having our boutiques and their investment strategies on various platforms around the world. So I don't think you're going to see us get into the retail banking space, but to utilize things like the Pershing platform to make our products available on different platforms around the world where our investment boutiques and investment strategies are quite strong.","Curtis Y. Arledge","Yes. And Mike, maybe I would add, if you think about it, we're the 8th largest investment management firm in the world, and Dreyfus ranks about 23, 24 in terms of mutual fund volume. So we have all of the investment capability around the globe and, certainly, within the United States specifically to create investment offerings we think will be very attractive that -- really the adviser community, so we will reach retail investors and mutual funds primarily through the adviser community. And again, Pershing helps with that. But certainly Dreyfus is a very long, as long as any one relationship with much of this community. We just need to invest more in it to make more of it. And then we directly reach individual clients through our wealth management business. We're the eighth largest wealth management firm in the United States, but have been heavily concentrated in a few key markets. And so, our investment there actually has been expanding our geographic footprint in the wealth management business where, again, we are delivering investment capabilities to clients -- wealth management clients, but not in a large enough part of the market.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","And when would you say you made this change overall? I mean, just -- you seemed like you're -- it's a continuum from you don't want to do consumer banking, I guess, that more wealth managers are talking about a little bit more about consumer banking. Take a look at Morgan Stanley, all the way up to your Dreyfus. Where do you draw the line and say we want to be here, we don't want to be on the other side of that line?","Gerald L. Hassell","As the investments company in the world, we go to where the investment assets are. And the investment assets are with wealthy individuals. They're being managed through advisers, they're being managed through different retail strategies, and that's what we want to continue to build upon, Mike.","Operator","The next question is from Cynthia Mayer with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just very briefly to follow up on the investing in organic opportunities. So you guys gave a sense of the timeframe for the Investment Management business. But outside of that, what kind of timeframe are you thinking of? Is this investing over this year, next year or is it sort of a permanent shift?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Well, why don't I -- why don't we hit on a couple of those things in the Investment Services business in some ways, those are even further along. For example, we've talked about Global Collateral Services quite a bit. We've made investments in our capabilities there, and we're delivering on those. Some of that's around financing, that's been a bit disappointing. As Gerald had mentioned, it hasn't moved as quickly as we had hoped. And it's also being impact -- it's being impacted a little bit just by market rates. So very low rate environment has made less need for transforming securities. That's been offset with the segregation business on some of the legacy stuff, which has been terrific, as well as some of the optimization capabilities that we ported to our clients, so we're seeing good growth there. The other area that we've talked a fair amount is the electronification of our FX business. So we have -- we are probably about, I would say, 50% or 60% of the way through that investment. It is starting to pay some dividends -- or it's still early, but I think it's starting to pay some modest dividends. I don't know, Tim, if you have anything to add to that.","Timothy F. Keaney","Yes. I might just add 2 points, Todd. And some of this gets back to the question Mike Mayo was asking. We continue to make investments around Pershing's platform and making it global, as a lot of these private banks see lots of opportunities to serve their clients well, we feel really good about both the technology play there and our domain knowledge. And these private banks have a huge opportunity, but they also have to deal with an increasing regulatory environment that makes it actually much easier for them to outsource. And then, Eagle and outsourcing, it's been a theme now for probably the last couple of years where asset managers and the insurance subsidiaries -- the asset management companies of insurance companies are outsourcing it at an unprecedented rate. And the investments we continue to make in Eagle around data warehouse and accounting are driving well over 1\/3 of our new business pipeline now. So those would be the things, Todd, I would say we're investing in and I think we see across the board. The real sign is that they're starting to pay off and should have real traction in 2014.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And maybe just to follow up on FX. Can you give a little color on how you're thinking about the market -- your market share at this point and the mix of electronic and higher touch? Is the sort of rotation over to more electronic trading done or do you feel like there's more to go? And how is your market share?","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes. As I said in my opening comments, we are seeing the benefits of our electronic platforms being adopted. We are -- we definitely feel we're capturing more volume than we were in the past. We're clearly moving more to more negotiated type trades or commercial type trades on the platform itself. It's very fast, it's very efficient, it's very transparent. And so we feel pretty good about the positioning of it. We're streaming prices to our traders and we're getting in the position to stream prices to our clients on desktops so they can automatically tap into us if they like the price and we'll be able to execute it. So we feel good that the investments we're making are gaining traction.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And maybe just a last small one. You mentioned pension costs will fall. Can you size that?","Thomas P. Gibbons","We're analyzing it right now. We will disclose that in the annual report, but it could be in the range of $10 million to $20 million a quarter.","Operator","The final question today is from Andrew Marquardt with Evercore.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just to pile on a little bit on the Transformation of Success -- or Transforming, sorry. The initiative or non-initiative in terms of cultural shift. Can you help us maybe frame it a different way in terms of how should we think about in terms of operating margins, right? Maybe piling into the former initiative laid out that you've now met and exceeded. How should we think about getting operating margins up from kind of the mid-20s to maybe upper 20s or 30s. Is that going to be kind of the next leg to do that or do you still need to have kind of a better macro rate environment?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes. I think there are couple of drivers there, Andrew. So one of the disclosures that we make around our Investment Services business is our revenue, fee revenue, our core fee revenue to expenses. And that will be the first place that you visibly see then, ultimately, that will come into the operating margin as well. Now 2 things can happen there. We're either getting more efficient or less efficient, which you would see, and we're getting better pricing or pricing is more challenging. So right now, we are starting to see some modest improvements. We didn't see a big improvement over last year, this year, and a lot of that can be driven by revenue -- by mix. So as you see more and more loss of fee waivers for example, there's -- that's all pretty much a fixed cost business, there is no additional expenses. That can make noise in those numbers from period-to-period. But I think we've given adequate -- actually we give very good disclosures, so you'll get a sense of where that's driving. And our goal is to get that on average -- there is some seasonality to it, on average, to pick that up 4 or 5 points.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then -- so does that translate into kind of an all-in pretax operating margin in the upper 20s or can we kind of get back to -- or maybe [indiscernible]...","Thomas P. Gibbons","Most of that would come down -- fall through the operating margin. But if you think about it, if we're saying $0.06 or $0.07 a quarter on fee waivers and you just -- that's a substantial growth rate right there. If it doesn't come with much expenses. That would overwhelm what we do on a period-to-period as we grind down our -- and make ourselves more efficient.","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes. And I think the way to think about it is, certainly, in a traditional custody business, it's highly commoditized. And we want to be very aggressive around making sure we have a highly efficient operations around commoditized products. And so that's one issue. We can't wait for rising interest rates to improve our operating margins, and that's what this program is about, this process. And we were just taking control of what we can do and making it much more efficient using technology, using productivity to drive the cost down in commoditized areas and, on the investment side, introducing applications on those platforms that our clients want and are willing to pay for. So that's a good way to think about it.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it, that's helpful. And then related to this transformation process. One of the things you noted, obviously cost service and productivity, but then also you had mentioned reducing of risk. Is that more of an outcome of this initiative or this process, or is that kind of a dedicated focus? And how should we think about that, what is that related to?","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes, in some way, it's a dedicated focus, but it's also an outcome. The more human labor content you take out of the process, the more straight through, the more electronic it is, the more you use technology, the less chance for error. And the less chance for error means less risk. And so, we're really trying to constantly drive down the operational risks associated with many things that we do. And using technology and using the capabilities that we have, we think we can improve efficiencies and reduce the operational risk. The infamous [ph] straight-through processing, the higher levels of straight-through processing, the less risk associated with the business.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then just a couple of ticky tack...","Gerald L. Hassell","No, go ahead.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just couple of ticky tacks. On the balance sheet side, you previously talk about excess deposits, maybe in the range of $50 billion, so that's the hold. And what kind of rate environment do you have to see that -- do you think to maybe have that reversed?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes. We've -- as we do a lot of analysis around our deposit base, right now it is most correlated to a couple of things. It's correlated to our -- obviously, to our underlying core business. So it's very much tied into fee business. So it tends to be frictional types of cash, so the more we grow our fee business, the more we grow our deposit business. So there's probably an underlying 4% or 5% growth rate in it for our core fee business. But right now, what's overwhelming is the unusual monetary policy that we're facing. So the feds got a $4 trillion balance sheet. It's sitting on $3 trillion of excess reserves. As those excess reserves come down and there is draining, we are going to see a substantial decline in our balance sheet, anywhere from $50 billion to $80 billion would be our expectation as we get to more normalized rate environment. So all that cash that we're leaving at the Fed, and not earning that much, we would expect to, in a normal rate environment, to normalize. And the good news there is we more than offset that with the spread on the remaining cash and the fee waivers. We do have a large balance sheet that, at this point in time, that's really reflecting this current environment. And I think it's important to understand.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. And then just lastly on other and fees, investments and other income. Obviously, you reflected the write-down or the loss, but it also had some maybe higher-than-usual C capital gains and asset gains. Should we -- I think you previously talked about that, that line should be in kind of $80 million kind of quarterly range. Does that still hold? I mean it's kind of...","Thomas P. Gibbons","No. We'd indicated that it will be more in the $80 million to $100 million range, and we've been on the high end of it. But then you'd like to -- it's based on circumstances but, yes, we'd still look to keep it in that range.","Gerald L. Hassell","Well, thank you very much, everyone, for dialing in and your interest. And Wendy and everyone else who's still on the line, if you have further questions, please follow up with Andy Clark and our IR team. So again, thanks very much, everyone.","Operator","Thank you. If there are any additional questions or comments, you may contact Mr. Andy Clark at (212) 635-1803. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating."],"3609":["The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) Q1 2018 Earnings Conference Call April 19, 2018  8:00 AM ET","Executives","Valerie Haertel - Global Head of IR","Charles Scharf - Chairman and CEO","Michael Santomassimo - CFO","Analysts","Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Michael Carrier - Bank of America","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","Brian Kleinhanzl - KBW","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital","Operator","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call hosted by BNY Mellon.

Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent.","I will now turn the call over to Ms. Valerie Haertel. Ms. Haertel, you may begin.","Valerie Haertel","Good morning, and welcome to the BNY Mellon first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With us today are Charlie Scharf, BNY Mellon's Chairman and CEO; and Mike Santomassimo, BNY Mellon's CFO. The earnings materials include a financial highlights presentation that will be referred to in the discussion of our first quarter results and can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.","Please not our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement in our earnings release, the financial highlights presentation and our documents filed with the SEC which are available on our website bnymellon.com. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, April 19, 2018. And we will not update forward-looking statements.","Before I turn the call over to Charlie and Mike, I would like to highlight a few changes to our earnings materials. Beginning this quarter, we are presenting total revenue for each of our primary lines of business within our two business segments. The change in presentation table on page 13 of the earnings release summarizes the primary product and services and types of revenue generated in each line of business.","Within in investment services the lines of business include Asset Servicing, Pershing, Issuer Services, Treasury Services and Clearance and Collateral Management. Within investment management the lines of business includes Asset Management and Wealth Management. In addition the reporting of the following expenses has been changed. First, the M&I litigation and restructuring charges are no longer separately disclosed on the income statement. Expenses previously reported in this line have been reclassified to existing expense categories, primarily other expense.","Second, clearing expense previously included in other expense has been reclassified to sub-custodian expense and renamed sub-custodian and clearing expense. Additionally the adjusted pre-tax operating margin non-GAAP measure for the Investment Management business no longer excludes amortization of intangible assets and provision to the credit losses.","Please note that the prior periods to the expense reporting changes and the Investment Management pre-tax operating margin calculations have been reclassified to be on a comparable basis. These changes, our previous reporting views and financial trends can be found in our financial supplement. We believe that the updated presentation provides a more complete picture of our financial performance and will enable you to view revenue on the basis consistent with management.","All of our earnings documents are complementary and we recommend be viewed together.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Charles.","Charles Scharf","Thank you, Valerie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I've got a few comments I'll make, I'll try and keep in brief since we covered a great deal of ground at our Investor Day recently. I'll then turn it over to Mike, who we'll take about the changes we've made to our reporting to provide more inside into our business performance, run through our first quarter financials and then we'll open it for questions.","First of all, we reported earnings per share of $1.10, up 33% from last year's first quarter. Revenue grew 9%, helped 2 points by a weaker dollar and expenses grew 4%, 3 points of which were due to the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar. Pre-tax income increased 20% and after tax income increased 29%.","Strong equity markets, higher interest rates and lower tax rate all helped drive our strong results for this quarter. The major global equity market indices were up significantly versus the first quarter of 2017, helping drive higher AUCA and AUMs. The return of volumes and volatility was also positive for us this quarter and we saw benefits in Pershing and FX, in fact Pershing matched their highest U.S. daily trade volume ever on February 6.","As our results show this quarter, benefiting from the market is an important part of our business model, but we also discussed at our Investor day that we look beyond the markets and focused on driving our underlying franchise growth. And while it's early, we do see it progress. Specifically, we saw growth in parts of the franchise including deposit balances, FX trading, tri-party repo activity, collateral management activity, increased securities lending activity and stronger demand for liquidity services.","In asset servicing, we onboarded new business from a key global investment manager and expanded our relationships with several sovereign wealth clients, which have added significantly to our assets under custody in the Asia-Pacific region during the quarter.","And as we discussed at Investor Day, we continue to invest in our markets capabilities in the form of people, technology and ultimately additional capabilities. While early days, we see signs that our investments are just beginning to pay-off. I mentioned that we saw increased activity in FX, and we believe that the investments we have been making are allowing us to see increased volume from existing clients and are beginning to attract new clients.","Within the collateral management space, we continue to expand capabilities. In the first quarter, we were the first to market to support offshore Chinese assets as collateral. This offering enables us to allow clients to mobilize new asset classes and asset types to collateralize trade exposures in our tri-party program.","We were also the first to launch a new API that helps dealers improve funding efficiency, what this means is that the assets can be costed [ph] anywhere, so optimization can occur irrespective of the location of assets. Given the scarcity of high quality liquid assets clients wanted a way to optimally allocate collateral, which in high volume trade environment can be done by hand, a sophisticated algorithm was needed and we delivered it.","In Pershing, we continue to see large complex financial services firms choosing Pershing to either outsource functions to achieve greater scalability, to support growth, or determined that clearing and custody, while critical are not core to their unique value preposition. One example is a mandate we received this quarter from a large regional bank to outsource the support for their private wealth and capital markets businesses, which we will be onboarding over the next 12 to 18 months.","As we discussed at Investor Day, Pershing has been accelerating its investments in global advisory solutions to further differentiate its capabilities, such as bank custody where we have a unique advantage in the marketplace. As a result, Pershing signed four relationships seeking bank and brokerage custody in the first quarter and expects to sign a total of seven over the course of 2018. This is a good example of how we are working across the firm to bring our diverse capabilities to the advantage of our clients.","Turn to Corporate Trust for a second, as we have discussed, we continue to invest in improving the client experience and our capabilities in targeted areas. And while it's early we're just beginning to see improved results. This quarter we saw organic fee growth for the first time in a while, following a change to the leadership strategy and investments we're making in technology. While early, we see improved execution and we will look to build upon the success in the coming quarters.","In treasury services, we continue to see growth in our payment volumes from existing clients driving higher banking transaction services fees. Our private label outsourcing business continues to be in demand and this quarter we had some new business wins.","As previously announced, we have been expanding our payment transformation efforts in partnership with real-time payments in Zelle providing links to other banks and financial institutions, who don't want to invest in direct connections. This is an important part of our strategy to provide value added services to our clients and the growth area for us. The pipeline remains strong reflecting significant opportunities.","Now, let me talk for a second about clearance and collateral management. We're benefiting from monitory policy easing and the increase in U.S. government debt issuances. U.S. treasury issuances for the first quarter were strong resulting in higher domestic clearance volumes. Based on current trends and expectations for further quantitative easing, we expect to see continued strength in our clearing volumes.","Additionally, the migration of the JPMorgan clients to our platforms continues to progress well. We've completed many client conversions, but the largest conversions are expected to begin in the second quarter and be completed by the end of the year.","In investment management, we've been focused on our performance and we've been consolidating funds as well as launching new ones to meet the marketplace demands for the non-traditional investments, which as we talked about at Investor Day are core to our strategy. This quarter, our investment performance continued to be positive for us, with 89% and 88% of AUMs above benchmark over three and five years respectively.","This contributed to a strong performance fee quarter relative to recent first quarters with broad based fees from LDI, fixed income, equity and alternative strategies. Additionally, we saw improved active equity flows, which benefited from new targeted products, particularly in the mobility innovation fund, which raised about $3 billion during the quarter. Our fixed income flows were strong especially in European and Global Credit as well as secured finance.","Finally, the consolidation of our North America businesses we announced last November is going well and both client and consultant reaction has been positive. We're also investing in new talent to help grow the business including key hires during the quarter to oversee investment strategy, consultant relations and trading.","And now before I turn it over to Mike, I don't want to be repetitive with comments I made at Investor Day, but I do want to mention a few things again. We are focused on building our franchise for the long-term, because we are confident in our future. We will continue to focus on delivering strong results in the short-term, and we believe we have a very financially attractive business model with unique collection of assets, which work together to give us competitive advantage.","We're focused on increasing our rate of revenue growth and while this will happen overtime, we continue to believe we can do this without sacrificing operating margin. And we will do this while investing in technology, operations and in our people both in infrastructure new solutions particularly focused on those that are data driven and digital. In fact, we said we believe that we will still generate positive operating leverage, and you saw this quarter our continued discipline in controlling the total expense base for the quarter.","We're lucky enough to have great and unique franchises, great assets and we're operating from position of strength.","Over to Mike.","Michael Santomassimo","Thanks, Charlie, good morning, everyone. Before I walk you through the results for the first quarter, I'd like to touch upon the reporting changes Valerie noted earlier, which are intended to give you a better picture of our business performance.","We're now reporting our revenue in a way that is consistent with how we think about evaluating our business performance. It should complement the previous format, which can be still found in our financial supplement, this should be additive to our disclosures. You can find the details of the changes on page 13 of both the first quarter earnings press release and the financial highlights presentation.","Turning to the first quarter results, as Charlie mentioned, growth in earnings for the quarter was largely due to the increase in interest rates in equity markets versus the first quarter of 2017. Although, the U.S. dollar has significantly weakened over the past year against key currencies in which we conduct business. The impact was essentially neutral on net income on a total company basis consistent with previous quarters.","With that, let me run through the details of the first quarter results. All comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless I note otherwise. Beginning on page three of the financial highlights presentation, total revenue increased 9%, primarily driven by a 10% increase in fee revenue due to stronger markets and a 16% increase in net interest revenue due to higher interest rates and to a lesser degree higher deposit balances.","Also contributing to the growth in fee revenue was higher foreign exchange revenue and growth in collateral management. A weaker U.S. dollar favorably impacted the revenue growth rate by approximately 2 percentage points.","Our expenses grew 4% primarily due to a weaker U.S. dollar, which unfavorably impacted the expense growth rate by approximately 3%; higher staff expense partially offset by lower consulting expenses.","When factoring in the significance of the unfavorable impact of the weaker dollar on our expense growth, you can see that while we are making important investments for the future, we continue to remain discipline in controlling our expenses. We generated significant positive operating leverage and increased our pre-tax operating margin to 35%, up from 31% in the prior period.","In the first quarter, the company repurchased 11 million common shares for $644 million and paid $246 million in dividends to common shareholders. All of this resulted in an increase in pre-tax income of 20% and an increase in net income applicable to common shareholders of 29%, which benefited from a lower U.S. tax rate. This coupled with a reduction in share count increased earnings per share by 33% to $1.10. Our risk adjusted returns continue to be strong, our CET1 ratio increased to 10.7% and the return on tangible common equity improved to 26%.","Page five highlights our Investment Service business results. Total investment services revenue increased 11% on a year-over-year basis and 5% on a sequential basis. Within the business asset servicing revenue increased 13% on a year-over-year basis and 4% sequentially. Both increases primarily reflect higher interest rates and deposit balances, which drove the growth in net interest revenue. These also increased due to higher volumes, market values and foreign exchange volumes.","We also benefited from the favorable impact of the weaker U.S. dollar. Pershing continued to perform well, up 11% with performance driven mainly by an increase in net interest revenue as a result of higher interest rates as well as fees growth in long-term mutual fund balances and higher clearance volumes.","Issuer services revenue, which includes our Corporate Trust and Depositary Receipt businesses increased 6%, primarily reflecting higher net interest revenue in Corporate Trust as well as the favorable impact of the weaker U.S. dollar. On a sequential basis the increase primarily reflects seasonally higher depositary receipts revenue. Treasury Services revenue increased 6% primarily reflecting higher net interest revenue, driven by higher interest rates and payment volumes.","Clearance and Collateral Management, which includes U.S. government clearing, U.S. tri-party activity and global collateral management was up 13%, primarily reflecting growth in collateral management, higher clearance volumes and net interest revenue. Additionally average tri-party balances were up 14%. Non-interest expense within investment services increased 5% year-over-year and decreased 7% sequentially.","Both periods also reflects higher technology cost consistent with what we discussed during our Investor Day with unfavorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar and higher volume related to sub-custodian and clearing expenses. The year-over-year increase was partially offset by lower consulting expense. The sequential decrease was primarily due to severance litigation and an asset impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017.","Now a few additional comments on the Investment Services business. Foreign exchange revenue increased 10% due to higher volumes across most of our FX products. Securities lending revenue increased 20%, primarily driven by increased demand for U.S. government securities and equities.","Average loans were 8% year-over-year however on a sequential basis they were up slightly. Assets under custody and administration grew to $33.5 trillion, reflecting higher market values, the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar and net new business. Pershing's average long-term mutual fund assets are up due to higher equity markets and from clients consolidating assets on our platform.","Turning to page six for the Investment Management business highlights, total investment management revenue increased 13% year-over-year, on a sequential basis revenue increased 4%. Asset management revenue increased 16%, reflecting higher equity market values, the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar principally versus the British pound and higher performance fees. The quarter also benefited from a gain on the sale of CenterSquare.","Performance fees increased from $12 million to $48 million primarily due to strong investment performance in our LDI and alternative strategies. And as Charlie mentioned our long-term active investment strategies performed well with 89% and 88% of our assets above their three and five year benchmarks respectively.","Wealth Management revenue increased 5% reflecting higher equity market values and net new business, partially offset by lower net interest revenue from lower deposit balances. Sequentially deposits were up 15% in Wealth Management. Assets under management increased 8% year-over-year, but declined 1% sequentially to $1.9 trillion.","Turning to the flows, we experienced another quarter of net inflows into our long-term actively managed strategies with $17 billion of inflows during the quarter. The LDI strategy had strong inflows of $13 billion and fixed income net flows of $7 billion, which were partially offset by outflows in our multi-asset and alternatives strategies of $3 billion. Additionally active equity flows were flat following a multi-quarter trend of outflows.","As we continue to look for ways to differentiate our equity strategies and as a result benefited from the new fund launches that Charlie mentioned in the quarter. The inflows into long-term active strategies were partially offset with $13 billion of index outflows resulting in $4 billion of total long-term inflows. Index outflows primarily resulted from clients rebalancing at a funds tracking, underperforming international equity indices in both Europe and Japan.","We experienced short-term cash outflows of $14 billion mainly drawn from government money market funds, which were in net outflows across the industry during the first quarter. Further increases in interest rates as well as competitive yields from select peers also contributed to our net outflows in these funds over the quarter.","Together total long and short net flows were $10 billion in the quarter. Lastly, the impact of the sale of CenterSquare and other changes are included in the divestiture and other line in the flows table.","So turning to the other segment on page seven briefly. Fee revenue increased sequentially primarily reflecting the impact in the fourth quarter of 2017 of the enactment of the U.S. Tax Legislation. Additionally, we recorded a $49 million of net securities losses related to the sale of approximately $1 billion of debt securities, which represents less than 1% of our portfolio. Additionally, non-interest expense declined year-over-year, reflecting lower professional yield and other purchase services partially offset by higher incentives.","Now turning to page eight on capital and liquidity, the capital and liquidity ratios as of March 31, 2018 remained above the regulatory minimums with the appropriate buffers. And most of them increased since December 31, 2017 on a fully phased in basis. Common equity tier 1 capital totaled $18.3 billion, an increase of $496 million compared with the fully phased in basis at December 31st. The increase primarily reflects capital generated through earnings and additional training capital resulting from stock awards, partially offset by capital deployed through common stock repurchases and dividends paid.","The fully phased in supplementary leverage ratio remains stable at 5.9%, which exceeds the 2018 regulatory requirement of 5% with the reasonable buffer. We also remain in full compliance with the U.S. liquidity coverage ratio requirements. Our average LCR was 116% in the first quarter.","Now on page nine, net interest revenue increased 16% year-over-year and 8% sequentially, primarily reflecting both higher interest rates and deposit balances, partially offset by higher average long-term debt. Year-over-year, our average interest bearing deposits increased 11%, while our average non-interest bearing deposits declined 3%. Year-over-year, our net interest margin increased 9 basis points to 1.22%.","On page 10 on expenses. I'd like to note, we also made a few expense reporting changes this quarter to simplify our reporting and give you better insight into our expense categories. Merger and integration, litigation and restructuring charges are no longer separately disclosed in the income statement, we've had very little M&I and restructuring expense in recent years. And these expenses previously reported in this line have been reclassified primarily to other expenses in prior periods have been restated.","Clearing expense, which is previously included in other expenses been reclassified to sub-custodian expense and renamed sub-custodian and clearing. This should help you better understand our market and volume based expenses.","On a consolidated basis, expenses increased 4%, primarily reflecting the weaker U.S. dollar which unfavorably impacted expense growth rate by approximately 3% and higher staff expense partially offset by lower consulting expenses. The sequential decline reflects lower expenses in nearly all categories.","Looking ahead to the second quarter, there are a few things to factor in your modeling. While it's still too early to predict how the quarter will play out, we expect on an average, rates will be higher in the second quarter than in the first. And as of today, our deposit balances lower than the average deposits in the first quarter. Additionally, the yield curve has flattened in recent weeks, which negatively impacts our reinvestment opportunities.","The quarterly investment and other income line is expected to be in the range of $40 million to $60 million per quarter for the remainder of 2018. Additionally performance fee should be in line with the second quarter average over the last couple of years. We expect total expense growth in the quarter to be similar to what we saw in the first quarter versus a year ago. And we still expect our full year 2018 effective tax rate to be approximately 21%.","Now before turning to Q&A, I'd like to make just a few comments on the recent regulatory developments regarding capital requirements. So earlier this month, we completed the CCAR process for 2018, while we can't discuss the details, the supervisory severely adverse scenario was noticeably more stringent than in prior years. This variability in these scenarios year-to-year may cause fluctuations in the payout ratios.","With regard to the SLR, we welcome any attempts to revise the leverage based standards and based on the draft it would appear that the requirement to decline and that would be positive for us.","With respect to CCAR, it's way too early to know the impact of the stress capital buffer framework, given that it may change year-to-year based on the thorough reserves, severely adverse scenarios and supervisory models. The proposal indicates that a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio plus a prescribed stress capital buffer must be maintained at all times. This is consistent with the way we manage our capital already.","Given the high quality of our balance sheet, it's possible that the impact of this rule change would be positive, but it will depend on the outcome of the final rule, and it's too early to draw any conclusions by either way.","Additionally the new frameworks increased emphasis on stress capital buffers, which are based on the Fed severely adverse scenario and supervisory models raises the potential for more volatility and unpredictability year-to-year.","We are hopeful that the potential volatility and unpredictability year-to-year will be mitigated by the Fed providing more visibility into the stress scenarios and supervisory models and refinement of this methodology during the common period. We look forward to engaging with the Fed in this common period as they finalize the rules.","Now with that Charlie and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.","Glenn Schorr","Hi, thanks very much. So, I noticed in the prepared remarks and disclosure you noted net interest revenue growth in every single business obviously rates were up, but it's also balance growth. So, we noted high deposit betas, I am assuming that's kind of stay given your mix of clients and business. So the question I have is, how much balance sheet growth is possible as you continue to have like really good capital return. Because that's what - that's going to help continue to drive net interest revenue, right?","Michael Santomassimo","Yes, hey Glenn its Mike, let me just give you a couple thoughts there and then hopefully I'll answer the question. But, as you sort of think about the first quarter and we said this at Investor Day as well, sort of that we saw deposit balances a little higher than we expected in the beginning part of our first quarter and those have come back down to kind of where we expected them to be.","And as we sort of think about the second quarter, all things considered, we still expect NIM to increase and we would expect that even with the lower deposit balances, the rate of growth of NIR will be a little lower than the first quarter. But we still expect it to be pretty healthy versus the second quarter of 2017. So we still expect to see both of that happening.","And I think as we build - as we continue to build the franchise and bring on new clients, we would hope that our - any of the decline we see in our balances as a result of rates rising would be more than offset to or offset partially at least by new business coming in. And we have the room on the balance sheet to continue to do that.","Glenn Schorr","Okay, I appreciate that. You mentioned the business wins, obvious in tri-party and collateral management are climbing as the balances grow. Business wins and losses in asset servicing are we not going to get that anymore?","Michael Santomassimo","Well\u2026","Glenn Schorr","I just didn't...","Michael Santomassimo","Yes, we took that stat out because and this came up a little bit at the Investor Day, and we agreed with the view that it just really wasn't a particularly worthwhile statistic it's a gross number not a net number. Our belief the way different people talk about it across the industry is very different relative to timing, relative to is it custody, is it fund accounting, middle office how you count it. And so our view so just wasn't a whole lot of value in it which we agreed with.","Glenn Schorr","Okay, I appreciate, thanks.","Michael Santomassimo","Thanks, Glenn. Next question, operator?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein","Thanks. Good morning, guys. I wanted to follow-up on the discussion really to the capital and the NPRs put up by the Fed. So, in terms of I guess the excess capital dynamic obviously too early to really tell, but I was wondering if you guys think though the impact that you could have on the business particularly the repo markets, which I guess partially been somewhat constraint by the leverage requirement of the banks. A, I guess do you think some of that could come back, to what extent do you think that could help your tri-party repo business. And if possible to I guess breakout, how much of revenues you guys generated in tri-party repo to help us kind of calibrate what the upside could be?","Michael Santomassimo","Hey, Alex, this is Mike. I think the impact on - you'll get a better sense from the other banks in terms of exactly what the impact they think it will have, but you would think that given the constraints they are all under now that you would see that have a positive impact on the repo market, which would then come back to us from a servicing perspective. To what extent, it's hard to know right now.","Alexander Blostein","Any sense how much you guys generated in tri-party repo revenues currently?","Michael Santomassimo","That's not something we disclose, but it's included in the clearance and collateral management line that you see in the disclosure.","Alexander Blostein","Got you. And then just my follow-up secondly, just kind of going back to the Investor Day, you guys outlined longer-term NIM guidance of 1.25% to 1.40%, you're at 1.23% now so seems like you're kind of there. Any additional clarity you guys can provide on the assumptions I guess underpinning the 1.25% to 1.40% in terms of the rates back drop, the size of the balance sheet, the timeframe of how you guys think you'll get to those levels?","Michael Santomassimo","As you noted, we're pretty much on the bottom of that range as we speak and so if rates continue the way - to increase the way the market expects, we would be getting into that range as we go out through the rest of the year. And as you know, there is a lot of dynamics that sort of play into exactly what the NIM will be in terms of deposit mix the level and rates as you mentioned, but we would expect to begin to get into that range as we go up through the rest of the year.","Alexander Blostein","Got it. I mean I guess like is there a scenario where it will be above 1.40%, I guess, just given there still seems to some runway on the rate side?","Michael Santomassimo","Yes, I mean it's possible there is always a scenario, who knows.","Alexander Blostein","Got it, all right. Thanks guys.","Michael Santomassimo","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Great, thanks. Good morning folks. Maybe if we can just go back into asset serving, looking at it sort of the old way on the fee line of asset servicing, still very strong 10% growth year-over-year, maybe if you can just bifurcate that a little bit specific to your point of clearing and collateral out of that separately on the clearing of the treasury business. And if you can talk about maybe sort of qualitatively about the pipeline in asset servicing, I think you mentioned you onboarding a new business from a large customer, that's - can you give a little more clarity on that and the timing of that?","Charles Scharf","Yes, so as you sort of look at the asset servicing line back in the supplement, it's up 10% year-over-year as you sort of noted Brian. So, again as you sort of think about the drivers of that, very consistent with what we talk about in general about what's happening. So the market levels and currency sort of helped aid that as well as growth in our collateral businesses and then organic sort of flows into our existing client portfolios.","So - and then there is a little bit of seasonality that you see in the first quarter, as you look at the sequential results from a few items, but for the most part you're seeing the same drivers that we talk about in general across the firm.","Michael Santomassimo","And just keep in mind with the business there are different things that go into the revenue flow, the core custody, core fee based business, obviously is impacted by the level of the markets. Wins and losses, it's a slow steady set of changes that happen based on what the trends on wins and losses. So you are not going to see dramatic shifts there. And so one client coming on doesn't materially change the number in a quarter, but it just gives you a point of view of what we're seeing in terms of wins and losses.","Charles Scharf","And I think as you think about the new business wins. We feel if we were to report a number, it would be pretty consistent with what we've seen over the last number of quarters. I mean it was a little outsized at the end of last year, but otherwise if you looked at the average across the previous quarters, it's pretty similar. And the pipeline still feels good.","Brian Bedell","And we have more conversion from the zero [ph] priced deals. So yet to come and I think you mentioned the JPMorgan Treasury business is still the majority of that yet is still to be transitioned, is that correct?","Michael Santomassimo","Yes, good number of the clients from JPMorgan have been converted already. But it's a few of the bigger ones are coming in between now and the end of the year.","Brian Bedell","And just on the expense control very solid obviously in the quarter, so better than expectations. As we think about Charlie, your comments on investing in the business in the rest of the quarters this year. Do you think this type of expense level is sustainable for the rest of the year given that you still have some improvements in the costs base to make as well?","Charles Scharf","Yes, I'm not going to give you a forecast on expenses beyond what we said at Investor Day, but what you saw this quarter was very consistent with our points of view on what we think we can produce. And so this quarter includes a fair amount of the additional technology investments not all of it we will be growing throughout the year. But we're very, very focused on continuing to build and increasing the operating margin, which means we should continue to see a tight control on expense.","What that means for the actual number, again away from the effect of currency, we're focused on it. And so I think everything I said there will continue to play out throughout the year.","Brian Bedell","Great, thanks very much.","Charles Scharf","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning.","Charles Scharf","Good morning.","Betsy Graseck","Hey, Charlie, at Investor Day we talked a lot about organic fee growth rates. And I think you mentioned or was it organic revenue growth rates. I think you mentioned it is old days of 1% going to 1.5%. Maybe you could talk a little bit about how much of the revenue growth this quarter was organic?","Charles Scharf","Yes, I'm not going to talk about that that's not something we're going to talk about at every single quarter. We did that, investors to just give you a sense of the way we look at it internally. And what we are focused on driving. I think, but when you look at some of the results that we see whether it's security lending loans, what we saw on FX, what you see the levels of AUCA. And just our comments on growing the underlying client base and franchise.","I think directionally what you see across the businesses is headed in the right direction. And I guess, the last thing that I would say is when we went through Investor Day was just was very interesting experience quite frankly to watch people's reactions to us being very open and honest in disclosing things that I don't think that anyone else has disclosed in the business. So that again you have the lens into how we're thinking about it, which from our perspective is a positive because we're focused on the things that we wanted to do better at and think we can do better.","So overall, you'll see it in the actual operating metrics over a period of times. So directionally in the businesses which have more quicker paybacks, a series of the markets related businesses, liquidity and security lending, you saw franchise growth. And we're focused on delivering it in the other businesses, which have longer lead times as well.","Betsy Graseck","Got it, okay. Just obviously revenue growth was very strong this quarter. It seems like you outperformed the 1.5% long-term average that you were talking to at Investor Day I don't know if that's a fair conclusion from your perspective?","Charles Scharf","Yes, I think directionally it's fair to say that there was higher organic revenue growth than we've seen in the past. We're not pounding our chests that we've declared victory here. I mean this is the very beginning. And as I said, most - the important parts of our business Corporate Trust, asset servicing, continuing to build stronger flows in our asset management business, client assets in the wealth management those take time to build. And you are not going to see big movements several months into a process here, but directionally we do feel very good about it.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And then just separately, during the quarter obviously a lot of solidity in the markets that you could speak to outlook if volatility pulls back a little bit. And then separately on LIBOR there is a lot of discussion on how you are positioned for the LIBOR move that happened in the quarter and maybe you could speak to the impacts that had this quarter. So going forward is either the one and three months be revert to the basis risk that it had before or continue to widen out from here we can get a sense of the impact on you guys? Thanks.","Michael Santomassimo","Hey, Betsy, its Mike. So on the first part on the volatility question. So, in the first quarter some of the volatility did impact and helped some of the volumes that we saw particularly in Pershing as Charlie sort of noted in terms of having one of our peak days in that business. So, in some ways volatility will be helpful right, but there could be negative effects of that as well depending on how that impacts the overall market. So we'll see.","I think on the second part of your question, in terms of how we're positioned vis-\u00e0-vis LIBOR, we are weighted more towards - we have more LIBOR based assets - short-term LIBOR based assets than we do liabilities. So as LIBOR starts to move up, whether it's one or three month it is sort of helpful for us relative to how we are positioned.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And then just lastly, you mentioned Zelle and some of the things that you're doing to help connect people to that without having to directly invest in the Zelle backbone, I think that's what I heard, but maybe you could give us some color as to not only what you're doing, but what you think the market is for that?","Charles Scharf","Yes, I think obviously - I presume everyone understands what Zelle is, which is the group that is owned by a series of the banks that are building out the capabilities to leverage real-time payments network.","In order to participate in those capabilities, the institutions have to do a fair amount of work to integrate their technologies with those platforms. Not every bank wants to do that, and not every bank actually controls their own capabilities because some of its outsourced. Many of those banks are clients of ours in our Treasury Services business. So we have the ability to step in and provide a series of those services to help them get access to those networks.","The real question over a period of time relative to what those capabilities mean is, will banks and others build out solutions that access the capabilities of these real-time networks, so that product offerings become more attractive versus using ACH and other methods of payment today, that's something we and other financial institutions are very focused on that will take - that's not weeks or months that will evolve over the next couple of years. But those capabilities are better than what exist in the marketplace and we're - let's think of us as a facilitator for the financial institutions that don't have the infrastructure or can't spend on it to do their own direct integrations.","Betsy Graseck","Super, thanks. That's helpful.","Charles Scharf","Thanks, Betsy.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth Usdin","Hey, thanks. First question I'd like to ask you about it seems like the issuer services business seems to be flattening out, can you just talk about the two different pieces of that? And whether or not you are seeing either better activity or just better new business start to come through, is that a turn in that?","Michael Santomassimo","Hey, Ken, its Mike, thanks for the question. In the Corporate Trust business Charlie sort of highlighted a little bit in his remarks, but we have seen some green shoots of organic growth there in the quarter. And so as Charlie mentioned that's a good positive trend that we're sort of hoping to build upon.","I think on the DR space, we'll see sort of how it goes, I think there's a lots of seasonality in those numbers and a lots of timing around when certain corporate actions and other activities are happening in that business. We're hopeful that we'll continue to have - manage it as best we can and we still have a very strong market share in that business and continue to sort of win our fair share things that come to the market. But it can move around quite a bit quarter-to-quarter.","Charles Scharf","And there's no doubt, I mean, we talked last year about not winning several large deals, which I described and I think what we described that we're very conscious on our part. So you wind up with the lapping effects of those. And I think I'll just go back and stay on Corporate Trust for a second again we talked about this at Investor Day, when we say we're starting to see some these green shoots of growth just to be clear this is - we've - there is a very focused effort in Corporate Trust for us to - which we went through with new management place to understand why we weren't being as successful in the business as we think we could have been.","And so we've made a series of changes there, I'd say we're extremely focused on the business and we see a very heightened focused on our coverage, on our sales efforts with our - some of our most important partners across the globe that actually help generate that business and we're working on and continuing to build our technology. So again it will hopefully, if we're as successful as we think we can be it will build overtime.","But it's a very conscious effort, it's not just us watching what's going on in the marketplace and feeling good in good times and bad in bad times.","Kenneth Usdin","Understood. And if I can ask a second one just mix of deposits that are denominated in non-U.S. dollars can you update us on like the size of that and I know we're in a U.S. rate cycle, but would the balance sheet still also be positively rate sensitive should we start to see non-U.S. central bank start to raise rates? Thanks guys.","Charles Scharf","Yes, on the later part of the question first, euro is becoming non-negative I think would be helpful so that would be a positive impact. I think there is a high probability that the Bank of England raises rates shortly and so that will be sort of marginally positive. But the overall mix of the balance sheet hasn't changed much with still around 70% of it still in U.S. dollars with the remainder being outside of the U.S.","Kenneth Usdin","Got it thanks a lot.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question with Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just a follow-up on that the 70% deposits in U.S. dollar and the increase that we saw here this quarter at least that came through on the average balance sheet. What sort of deposit beta would you say we saw here with the last Fed hike and do you have any expectations for where that's going to continue to go from here?","Michael Santomassimo","Hey, Brennan, its Mike, as we said a number of times over the last year or so we would expect that betas continue to increase as rates increase right and sort of that's what you see happening. It's largely happening as we expected across the different businesses. And again you saw - you got the full impact of a rate rise in December in those numbers and you got a little piece of one in March as well. And so I think you can kind of read into the numbers and see what you think sort of the average beta is there and you're probably not that far off.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. The second part of the question, I guess, implied with your lead in that could continue to see some lift from that imputed beta as well?","Michael Santomassimo","Sorry say it again somewhat, sorry?","Brennan Hawken","I am saying that it seems like what you said from the lead in from your preface that you think that betas probably could continue to see some upward pressure that's I was just clarifying that.","Michael Santomassimo","Yes, as rates rise we would expect betas to continue to increase.","Brennan Hawken","Excellent, okay thanks. And then from my follow-up here, it looks like some really nice trends in consulting expenses it's my recollection, but I'm not 100% sure here that maybe some CCAR and regulatory expenses were flowing through that line. Are we finally reaching the point where we're getting some relief on regulatory expense front? Does that mean that - that would mean and imply to me at least that that's sustainable or should be given where everything that you guys have built up from a capabilities perspective plus be in the environment that we're in, is that really do you think that that's a fair conclusion to come to? Thanks.","Charles Scharf","Let me take a stab Mike, and you tell me whether you agree, how is that? I think the answer is predominantly yes, but I'd just make a couple of comments on that. I think the very significant amounts that we spent on consulting for those specific things you talked about, for the most part we'll not continue at the levels that you've seen and you see the benefits of that running through our results.","I will say and I've got just think like the newcomer, relative newcomer and I'm sure you all appreciate this, there is a hugely significant amount of regulatory expense embedded in the other lines that's just the reality of what the regulatory environment is today versus what it was years ago.","So, we spend a tremendous amount on regulatory, it's just not specifically in the consulting line and that's not going to go down for what we see at this point and time. And we continue to spend a significant amount of money outside the U.S., specifically for GDPR and MiFID II inside Europe.","So just think about it as it's a little bit of a reallocation from consulting to us doing a bunch of the work whether it's the headcount expense, technology expense and things like that.","Michael Santomassimo","Okay. And I'll just add one thing, so as we said a number of times too that the decline you see in consulting, we had at this time last year where we are still working on sort of the resolution plan. And so a big chunk of that decline was related to that activity that we're working on last year. But Charlie is right, there is a - there maybe a little bit of a pause in the short run, but in the U.S. where there is plenty of efforts that's going into a number of initiatives across the globe\u2026","Charles Scharf","That we are currently spending on.","Michael Santomassimo","That's currently in the numbers.","Brennan Hawken","Yes, no for sure just we got to take our victories where we can on the regulatory spend front. Thanks a lot guys.","Charles Scharf","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America.","Michael Carrier","Thanks, guys. One question on Investment Management. I don't know if you had the gain on the sale of that entity. And then also on the performance fees stronger than expect you guys mentioned some of the drivers, just wanted to get a sense, is there anything changed in terms of the recognition by quarter that we should expect things to be different than what we've seen historically?","Charles Scharf","No, I mean, there is nothing that would change sort of the normal seasonality that you see in lines like performance fees. The gain, we haven't disclosed the number, but the gain on CenterSquare is embedded in the numbers, it's not a material game changer or remover for the overall results. But it is in the number.","Michael Carrier","Okay. And then follow-up on the Investment Services business, if I just look at I guess quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year just the revenue growth versus the asset growth that came in stronger and typically we're not seeing that, but it seems like under the new disclosure that can be either activity with volatility or rates with net interest income, so just wanted to get a sense. And then in terms of predicting that line, you guys give a lot of metrics, I know you're not giving that the win metrics, but is there anything else that we should be thinking about to try to think about either forecasting into that line item going forward?","Charles Scharf","I think in the Asset Servicing business when you look at it in the earnings release, just keep in mind what's also in there is net interest revenue. And so, net interest revenue was as we mentioned a significant driver sort of the overall business results and I think that's true in asset servicing as well. You also have the impact of the market in FX and so forth. So just keep that in mind as you sort of look at that overall number. In terms of metrics to look at in terms of forecasting, I don't think there is anything necessarily new to sort of add to that conversation.","Michael Santomassimo","The only thing I would add is again it was a very good quarter relatively to asset values or the impacts in volatility on us and rates. And so we were clearly beneficiaries of that. It was an important driver as we've said in our comments of the results. We also had significant balance growth that we saw. So as we look forward to the next quarter, sitting here today it's not as strong as it was, but on a year-over-year basis still should look - I would say we still good about what we're going to say.","Michael Carrier","Got it, thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott","Hello, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. It looks like the first quarter expenses came in a bit lower than you've been pointing to. Even given if anything the currency was moving in the wrong direction. So could you talk about what changed there as you went through the quarter, where you're able to take out those expense saves, maybe didn't have budgeted in initially.","Charles Scharf","I don't know why do you say that?","Michael Santomassimo","I mean, Geoffrey, I think, let me clarify. So at Investor Day, we said the expenses would be up 4% to 5% in the quarter and they're up 4%. So they're about right where we expected them to be.","Geoffrey Elliott","So I go to more like up 3.6% and you said 2% of growth driven by foreign currency translation and then the actual foreign currency translation was 3%. So it kind of feels like you did a little bit better than you were pointing to back then. Just trying to understand where the extra saves or extra benefits on the expense side came from?","Michael Santomassimo","Yes, there is no single like big things that's driving in. As Charlie mentioned a couple of times this morning, we are very focused on looking at like the whole place and making sure that we're being as efficient and effective in sort of spending as we can. And so little singles and doubles sort of add up overtime. And so we're focused on all of it, but there is no single thing to point to.","Charles Scharf","And we don't obsess about a half a point or a point in any given quarter.","Geoffrey Elliott","Sure. Understood. And I guess thinking about the full year, us there anything that kind of gives you more confident that you can do better on the expense side given what you've seen in the first quarter?","Michael Santomassimo","Yes, we're not going to give you a number for the full year, but as we said, a bunch of different ways. We're coming in every day focused on making sure that we're doing the best we can to keep the expense base where it needs to be, while making the investments we need to make.","Geoffrey Elliott","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Yes, thanks. Good morning. Just had a quick question one on your comments around the deposits, but it was little early in the quarter to be calling out the run off that we're seeing. Can you just I don't if whether that was going to interest bearing, non-interest bearing or I mean was that a significant magnitude of deposit outflow that you saw?","Michael Santomassimo","Well, I think what we're kind of calling out is what we mentioned in March as well, at Investor Day is that we saw higher balanced in Jan and Feb, January and February than we thought we would see. So now balances are sort of back down about where we thought they would be. And there is no single driver of that it sort of normalized to where we expect it.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay.","Michael Santomassimo","Yes, you saw both non-interest bearing and interesting bearing come down.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. And then you did have some security sales in the quarter. Was that just slightly repositioned the book or is this something that you're seeing with rising rates you are looking to get more shorter duration overall?","Michael Santomassimo","It was a very minor repositioning that we're able to do due to the adoption of a new accounting standard that allowed us to reclassify some of our HTM bonds. So very minor in the scheme of the portfolio.","Brian Kleinhanzl","And just onetime in.","Michael Santomassimo","Yes.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay, thanks.","Michael Santomassimo","Thank you.","Operator","So our final question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you and good morning. You guys have talked about it at Investor Day and today about the emphasis on technology investing and spending. When you look at it from a line of business standpoint, is there one or two lines that have a greater focus of the spending?","Michael Santomassimo","So you mean, which businesses.","Charles Scharf","Asset services and investment management.","Gerard Cassidy","Correct, exactly is there an area that you guys think that you need to put more effort and money versus another area within the organization?","Charles Scharf","It's probably skewed somewhat towards investment services versus investment management. But that's not to say that there are significantly amount of opportunities for us that we're focused on to use technology in the Investment Management business, whether it's wealth management or in the asset management side.","When it comes to the core we talked about the investments that we're making in infrastructure, I would say the majority of those comments relate to the Investment Services business and the work that we're doing there.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And then as a follow-up, I know there is a lot of moving parts with the capital notice of proposed rulemaking that have come out recently from the Fed, hopefully it will settle down. But when you guys look longer term it was - it looks like a lift in the dividend payout ratio that used to be a soft line at 30%. When you guys look out longer term, do you have a sense of where you think the dividend payout ratio will go relative to stock buybacks and stuff that you use for return of capital?","Charles Scharf","No, I think sitting here today I don't think anything is different than - I don't think we're thinking about it any differently than what we said at Investor Day relative to dividend.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good, thank you.","Charles Scharf","All right, well thank you all very much for the time, take care.","Operator","If there are any additional questions or comments, you may contact Ms. Valerie Haertel at 212-635-8529.

Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent.","I would now turn the call over to Mr. Izzy Dawood. Mr. Dawood, you may begin.","Izzy Dawood","Thanks, Wendy, and welcome, everyone. With us today are Gerald Hassell, our Chairman and CEO; Todd Gibbons, our CFO, as well as our executive management team.","Before we begin, let me remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement in the press release and those identified in our documents filed with the SEC that are available on our Web site bnymellon.com. Forward-looking statements in this call speak only as of today, July 18, 2014, and we will not update forward-looking statements. Our press release and earnings review are available on our Web site, and we'll be using the earnings review to discuss our results.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Gerald.","Gerald Hassell","Great, thanks, Izzy and welcome everyone and thanks for joining us this morning. So a few key takeaways for the quarter, we\u2019re attacking our expense base, as we continue to align our operating model with the reality of the macro environment. We are absolutely committed to aggressive expense management and to reducing structural costs and it\u2019s paying off, helping us generate positive operating leverage during the quarter.","Investment management fees and most of our investment services fees continue to grow, demonstrating our ability to meet the increasingly complex investing needs of our clients. Our capital position remains strong, adds to our ability to generate capital, providing us with the financial flexibility to continue to return capital to shareholders.","So looking at our performance during the quarter. As you saw from the release, we reported earnings of $0.48 per share which included a $0.14 per share charge covering two items we previously disclosed. One was the charge related to certain investment management funds, and two, a severance charge related to progress in streamlining our organization which I might add, is expected to benefit our expense run rate in excess of $120 million charge. And we should begin to see the benefits this year with a full effect in 2015. Now when you add these items back, one might say that we earned $0.62 per share, but we think we really owned about $0.58 per share on an operating basis.","So, turning to revenues. Total revenues were 3.7 billion. Investment management had a good quarter and continues to demonstrate why we value this business. Investment management and performance fees were up 4% year-over-year and they were also up 5% sequentially. Assets under management increased 15% year-over-year to a record $1.64 trillion. And we are continuing to execute on our initiatives to drive future earnings growth including our strategy to increase our focus on individuals as investors by broadening our reach to intermediaries and the retirement market and by expanding wealth management.","Now another key strategy involves building out our local capabilities for clients looking to invest in Asia. In fact, in APAC we\u2019re currently on-boarding our first client onto the separately managed account platform that we built in conjunction with our purging operations. So we\u2019re not only attracting clients that will use our technology, but we\u2019re also getting asset management mandates on it as well. During the quarter, Insight Investment was named the winner of Global Investor Magazine to annual award for investment excellence as asset manager of the year in its category. Insight was also named the LDI manager of the year by the UK Pension Awards. So a great performance in our investment sector, in that regard.","All-in-all a good quarter for investment management, which remains a significant earnings contributor and capital generator for our firm. We like the fact that this business is balance sheet light and that it continues to serve as a valuable role in allowing us to leverage and deepen our client relationships across the Company.","In investment services, asset servicing, clearing and treasury services fees grew nicely, while issuer services was down. Investment services business was again helped by the growing contribution from global collateral services, which showed good growth during the quarter as usage of our optimization and segregation solutions continued to increase. In global markets, the industry-wide low volatility negatively impacted our revenues, but we\u2019ve been able to offset that partially as enhancements to our FX platform drove a significant increase in volumes. So again, our investments are paying off.","Now during the quarter, our asset servicing and global collateral services capabilities received a number of awards for innovation, service quality and the strength of our capabilities and we again came out on top of our peer group in a key industry survey, this time in Global Custodian Mutual Fund Administration Survey.","Now on the expense front, earlier this year we outlined some of the actions we\u2019re taking to manage expense growth, including streamlining our organization, reducing our real estate footprint, consolidating platforms, reengineering processes and getting more out of each technology dollar we have spent. I said you would see evidence of all these news this year, and our progress is now being reflected in our numbers. We\u2019ve succeeded in reducing operating expenses both year-over-year and sequentially, notwithstanding the impact of regulatory risk and control-related expenses.","So let me highlight two important areas. The first item involves reducing employee costs. We made good progress in streamlining our organization, which includes reducing positions in layer in getting to fewer, more effective managers. The employee cost reductions are real and very sustainable. But while the cost savings are important, these actions are not just about costs, they\u2019re about creating an organization that is better aligned and connected with our clients and markets and cultivating a high performance culture.","Now as part of these moves, we promoted Brian Shea to head investment services, bringing the front and back-end together to drive better client solutions and improve our productivity and efficiency. Curtis Arledge added to his responsibilities, the oversight of the newly formed BNY Mellon Markets Group, which brings together global markets, global collateral services and prime services. Now Curtis has extensive experience in capital markets and asset management and it gives to me unique insight into the markets and needs of our clients, both buyer side and sales side clients. That together with a new structure will help to further accelerate the delivery to clients of solutions and trading, securities financing and securities lending. And I might add importantly, our clients have told us this is how we should be organized to better serve them.","The second expense item is our real estate footprint. You saw that we reached an agreement to sell our One Wall Street building for 585 million, which will reduce our New York City footprint by 750,000 square feet. Now in terms of the future financial impact, there will be some incremental expense in 2015 as we work through some overlapping occupancy expense. And in 2016, we will see the benefit of this action and Todd will cover this more in just a moment. Now our focus is on driving productivity improvement across our businesses, across geographies, across functions and doing it aggressively every single day.","Turning on to the capital front, we continue to generate significant levels of capital, resulting in strong capital ratios which provide us with a financial flexibility to return more to shareholders and drive shareholder value. During the quarter we increased our dividend by 13%. We repurchased 12.6 million shares. Now another compelling statistic, since the financial crisis, our strong capital generation has enabled us to more than double our tangible capital while also reducing our shares outstanding below pre-crisis levels.","Now before I hand it over to Todd, let me wrap up with an update on our corporate trust business. Back in May we told you we were exploring whether the corporate trust business is worth significantly more to someone else rather than to us. We have now completed that process. When we weigh the benefits of the sale of the current environment against both the near-term pressures on this business, in a more positive long-term outlook, we concluded that we can create more shareholder value by retaining it.","We will continue to focus on driving profitable growth. This business is positioned to benefit from the significant upside for earnings and operating margins that will result from an eventual move to more normalized monitory policy, the expected vacant and structured debt maturity and a potential recovery of a non-agency mortgage backed market. I have always liked this business and our leading market share position and I am confident of its future growth potential.","Now the bottom line is we\u2019re executing to drive shareholder value through our focus on three activities, one, streamlining our organization and continuously finding ways to improve our productivity and efficiency, primarily through enhancement to our technology and operations and by sustaining the momentum that we have established on the cost front. Two, executing our initiatives to drive revenues and profits, focusing on growth opportunities, such as individuals as investors, our APAC investment management strategy, leveraging our investment services scaled to develop highly affective mid and back office solutions and enhancing our collateral systems and FX trading platforms to provide clients with better liquidity management tools. And finally, complying with a host of new capital, liquidity and other regulatory requirements and doing it as efficiently and effectively as possible.","Now as I said before, we expect to see the benefits of all these actions, to continue to show off in our numbers this year.","With that let me turn it over to Todd.","Todd Gibbons","Thanks, Gerald and good morning everyone. My comments will follow the quarterly earnings review beginning on Page 2. As Gerald knows EPS was $0.48, the $0.48 include the $0.14 for the previously disclosed items. It also includes the benefit of approximately $0.04 between the credit provision which was negative for the period, as well as a little bit higher than normal investment and other income, so all in we view it as about $0.58 quarter.","Looking at the numbers on a year-over-year basis total revenue was 3.7 billion, investment services fees were down 1% we saw some strength in asset service and clearing services but that was more than offset by the weakness in issuer services and we\u2019ll talk about that in a minute.","Investment management and performance fees were up 4% and if you exclude money market fee waivers they were up 5%. FX was down on the lower volatility numbers and NIR was down 5%. Expenses on an adjusted basis were down 4% so for the quarter, our operating revenues were a little soft down about 2% year-over-year, but we more than offset that by the decline in expenses enabling us to generate 200 basis points of positive operating leverage. We do expect the revenue growth rate to recover in the third quarter.","Turning to Page 4, what we call our some business metrics that help explain our underlying performance, you can see that we had record AUM of 1.64 trillion that\u2019s up 15% from a year ago, driven by higher market values as well as new business. During the quarter we had net long-term outflows of $13 billion and short-term outflows of $18 billion. The long-term outflows were primarily driven by our liability driven investments AUM where we had one client that opted to bring that service back in-house.","Assets under custody and administration at quarter end were 28.5 trillion that\u2019s up 9% year-over-year it primarily reflects the impact of higher market values as well as some currency impact. Linked quarter AUC\/A was up 2% due also to improve market values. For the quarter we had an estimated $130 billion in new AUC\/A wins.","Looking at to our key metrics you can see share growth over a year-over-year on most of them average loans and deposits in wealth management and investment services continued their growth trends. The market value on securities on loan at period end grew, and most of our clearing metrics were up while DARTS volumes were actually down. On the flip side, DR programs and average tri-party balances were down slightly.","In terms of the key external metrics, both equity and fixed income in our markets were up, but I would point out that fixed income appreciation trialed the equity market improvement and as we have discussed before AUM and AUC\/A are more oriented towards fixed income assets. The FX volatility index average was off 37% the lowest average in a quarter since pre-crisis, impacting FX revenue. And the average Fed Funds effective rate was down 3 basis points or 25% from last year, which had a negative impact on our money market fee waivers.","Looking at fees on Page 6, asset servicing fees were up 3% year-over-year, 1% sequentially. The year-over-year increase reflects higher market values it also reflects the impact of a weaker U.S. dollars, net new business and organic growth, partially offset by lower securities lending revenue. The sequential increase primarily reflects seasonally higher sec lending revenue and higher market values. Clearing fees were up 2% year-over-year and up slightly sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by a higher mutual fund fees, partially offset by a decrease in DARTS and higher money market fee waivers.","Issuer services fees were down 21% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower dividend fees partially due to timing and corporate actions and DRs. In addition the comparison was impacted by lower customer reversements in corporate trust, as well as higher money market fee waivers and that impact of the continuing net maturities in corporate trust.","The good news as Gerald indicated is that we can see the net maturities of structured securities abating in the next 18 or 24 months, as the pace of the maturities slows and the impact of the new business should begin to more than offset. When you look at investment services, you will see that our investment services fees as a percentage of non-interest expense declined from 94% to 93%. However, if you adjust for the money market few waivers and also the impact of the issuer services business for the quarter, the ratio actually improved by 1%, demonstrating some operating leverage there.","Investment management performance fees were up 4% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Both increases reflect higher equity market values and the average impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. The year-over-year increase also reflects net new business, which was partially offset by money market fee waivers and lower performance fees. The sequential increase also reflects lower money market few waivers and higher performance fees. Excluding money market fee waivers investment management performance fees were up 5% year-over-year and 3% sequentially.","In FX and other trading revenue was down 37% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. And looking at the components, FX revenue of 129 million was down 28% year-over-year and 1% sequentially and that\u2019s primarily reflecting lower volatility offset by higher volumes. In fact, if you look at the composite on Page 5, you can see that market volatility was down 37% year-over-year and 20% sequentially. So clearly we are capturing higher volumes. Other trading revenue was down 27 million from the year ago quarter and 5 million from the first quarter. The decrease from the year ago period reflects lower derivatives trading and the sequential decrease primarily reflects lower fixed income trading.","In the second quarter, we exited one of the derivative business lines and Curt are considering further actions to improve the performance of this unit going forward. Investment and other income was $142 million in the quarter, compared with 285 million in the year ago quarter and 102 million in the prior quarter. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects a gain related to an equity investment recorded in the second quarter of 2013 and that was offset by higher other income and seed capital gains. The sequential increase primarily reflects higher other income, equity investment revenue and asset-related gains, which was partially offset by -- we actually had lower lease residual gains in the quarter.","Turning to Page 8 of the earnings review, you will see that NIR on an FTE basis was down 35 million versus the year ago quarter and down $8 million sequentially. The year-over-year decrease resulted from lower yields on investment securities and that was partially offset by the higher average earning assets which is largely driven by higher deposits. The sequential decrease was primarily driven by the higher premium amortization on agency mortgage backed securities. As you recall from previous quarters, when rates do go down, the premium amortization rate, excuse me -- when rates go down, the premium amortization rate actually increases. The net interest margin for the quarter was 98 basis points down from 115 a year ago and 105 in the first quarter.","Turning to Page 9, our non-interest expense included two non-recurring items. The first was 109 million charge related to the previously disclosed administration of certain investment management funds with the charge we are adequately reserved for this issue, I would point out that the charge has been broken out in the investment management disclosure which will enable you to evaluate the segment\u2019s results on an actual operating basis. The severance charge of $120 million related to the streamlining actions which Gerald mentioned in his earlier comments, this charge was included in the M&I litigation and restructuring line. These actions will benefit our expense run rate in the second half of this year and I will give you a little more detail on that in a moment.","Looking at our results adjusted for these items, total non-interest expenses were down 4% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, both decreases were primarily driven by a 5% reduction in staff expense and we were able to do that despite the impact of increased regulatory risk and control expenses. The year-over-year decrease also benefitted from a 24% reduction in the business development expenses. On Page 2, you can see that at quarter end we had a net unrealized gain on the investment securities portfolio of 1.2 billion. This increase from 676 million at the end of the prior quarter was driven by the lower rates that we saw in the quarter.","Looking at our loan book on Page 11, you can see that the provision for credit losses was a credit during the quarter of 12 million which was driven by the continued improvement in the credit quality of the book. This compares to a credit of 19 million a year ago and a credit of 18 million in the first quarter. ","Turning to capital on Page 12, at June 30, 2014, our estimated Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased in under the standardized approach was 10.4%, compared to 11.1% at the end of March and under the advanced approach it was 10% compared to 10.7 at the end of March. The 70 basis point sequential decrease primarily reflects an increase in risk weighted assets related to the assets of certain consolidated investment management funds. As a reminder, the fully phased in common equity Tier 1 ratio will be effective in 2019.","Also in the second quarter, we exited the new parallel runned under the Basel advanced approaches and are now required to perform both standard and advanced transitional calculations. The binding of these ratios is the lower of the advanced standard common equity Tier 1 which is currently the advanced at 11.7%. Note that the quarter-over-quarter decline in our transitional risk-based capital ratios has two main components. First of all the switch this quarter using the advanced approach methodology is the most significant one. And the impact of the assets of the consolidated investment management funds I just mentioned also impacted that.","Our estimated supplemental leverage ratio was flat during the quarter at about 4.7% and that's despite a 4% sequential increase in the average balance sheet. During the quarter we repurchased 12.6 million common shares for a total of $431 million and the effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.7%.","Before moving to some outlook comments, let me spend a few minutes on the two transactions we expect to close in the third quarter, first of all the tale of our equity investment Wing Hang actually has already closed in the third quarter. This quarter\u2019s results or next quarter or the third quarter will include an after-tax gain of approximately $320 million. Note that our equity investment revenue related to Wing Hang totaled $20 million in the first half of 2014 and $95 million in 2013. The 2013 numbers includes a gain that we had with sale of property at about $37 million.","Also the One Wall Street building is expected to be, the closing of it is expected to be done in the third quarter. It will result in after-tax gain of approximately $200 million, 345 million pre-tax. We have entered into a new lease now for our new corporate headquarters which we expect to occupy by the end of 2015.","A few points to factor into your thinking about the current quarter and beyond, third quarter earnings are generally impacted by seasonal downturn in transition volumes and market-related revenues, particularly foreign exchange and securities lending, while DRs will it tends to be much stronger in the third quarter. Two transactions will impact investment in other income going forward. As I noted earlier, the Wing Hang investment contributed approximately 10 million per quarter for a line item in the first half of the year. In addition, we recently adopted the accounting standard related to low income housing. That will result in additional investment in other income of approximately 15 million per quarter. And that will be offset in the income tax expense. So these two transactions will increase the lower end of the previous guidance range for this line item by approximately $10. So we see investment and other income to be in the range of $90 million to $100 million on a go forward basis.","In terms of net interest revenue in the second half of this year, we\u2019re also planning to reduce our exposure to introduce two inter-bank placements, asset so actually reducing the amount of cash that we have there and increase our securities portfolio, inventory of high quality liquid assets. The anticipated revenue as a result of these tactical actions should mitigate the impact of our net interest revenue as a result of the ECV interest rate actions, as well as this prolonged low investment rates in the U.S.","Severance charge this quarter will benefit in our expense run rate beginning in the second half of the year. We expect the savings of our streamlining actions to more than offset the impact of the July 1st merit increase. As mentioned earlier, we expect our headquarter sales to close this quarter. In terms of the financial impact we\u2019ll see incremental occupancy expense of $30 million in 2015 as we absorb the rent expense on the new headquarters, as well as the expenses of transitioning of the One Wall Street. Once we do make that transition and get through the overlap, we expect to see a benefit of our expense base of approximately $10 million in 2016 and beyond, and that's versus staying here at One Wall Street. In addition the proceeds will enable us to pay down nearly $500 million of long-term debt, and we\u2019ll also receive some benefits from tax incentives provided by the State of New York.","We intend to continue to buy back stock in the third quarter based on market conditions. We expect the tax rate to be around 27% for the quarter. Our focus has been and will continue to be on executing to drive shareholder value. As Gerald said, we\u2019re not relying on market activities to improve. We\u2019re continuing ways, to identify ways to increase our efficiency and we\u2019re ensuring -- working to ensure that the actions that we\u2019ve taken continue to show up in our numbers.","With that, let me hand it back to Gerald.","Gerald Hassell","Great. Thanks Todd. And Wendy I think we can now open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We are now ready to begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse.","Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse","Good morning. Gerald, you just come off of a sizable expense program, you recently announced for the expense initiative that is supposed to begin in the second half of this year, yet you found some levers to pull this quarter as well. So my question is what else are you evaluating today? How quickly can you deliver? And should we expect this 4% year-over-year decrease to actually build going into the back half of the year or is there some investment spend taken into consideration as well?","Gerald Hassell","Well, thanks Ashley for the question. We continuously look at all of our expenses as a way to try to control them better in recognition of the macro environment that we\u2019re in and rightsizing the size of company to the reality of the revenues that are being generated. So it\u2019s a continuous process, that's why we haven\u2019t announced any program, we haven\u2019t announced any separate initiative. It is day in and day out reduced any expenses and improving our operations and efficiency. I feel good about what we have achieved so far in the first half of this year. We\u2019re looking to do more in the second half. The severance cost that we are taking this quarter, the run rate will improve and offset the normal merit increase in the second half of this year. So I feel good about going into the second half in terms of continuing to control expense as well.","Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse","Got it. And then can you remind us of what your ROE and ROT targets are? And give us a sense of where you think you can go without any help from rates and how quickly you think you can get there?","Gerald Hassel","Yes, we had indicated a few years back that our target on ROE was about 10%, and return on tangible common equity would be substantially higher than that, so far the first quarter, I mean excuse me for the second quarter return on tangible common equity was about 18%. We think we can continue -- in the first quarter we\u2019re going to be around 8% and 18%. We think they can continue to grind that up into that 10% range without a significant move with rates or volatility. Obviously I think we saw move in a better market conditions here than we would see a much more significant jump.","Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse","Alright, thank you for taking my questions.","Gerald Hassell","","Thanks, Ashley.","","Todd Gibbons","Thanks, Ashley.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Thanks guys good morning. A quick follow-up on the numbers I guess, on expenses and then a big picture question after. So, lots of moving pieces, you guys announced additional measures and you just have had obviously the -- some of the benefits will come in next six months or so in comp, but I guess if you look at the expense base overall, 2.7ish billion dollar run rate in the quarter today, like ex one of the, ex some of the one timers. Is that a fair run rate do you guys expect to grow that as the business continues to grow? Or is this kind of the run rate in expenses that we should think about over the next six months to 12 months as you realize some of these savings albeit offset by some of the goal initiatives?","Todd Johnson","","Yes Alex, it\u2019s Todd, we are working real hard to try to maintain this expense level or keep it from growing so that the actions that we have taken around the headcount, the actions that we have taken around occupancy, the very careful analysis of all of our discretionary spend, we want to try to keep overall expenses flat and some of the benefit of that we are using to invest in some of the new revenue streams that Gerald has talked about, but all-in-all, there will obviously be some noise in those numbers we\u2019re trying to keep it as flat as we can.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And the second question, just on the current environment, over the last three to four months or so we\u2019ve seen increased pressure on the bigger banks to shrink the balance sheets to get faster compliance with SLR. You see that resonate in the retail markets declining 10ish percentage year-over-year. Just curious to think about how that impacts your business holistically. You guys are obviously a big tri-party repo manager. So curious to see how that kind of flows through to your operations, and just overall given the fact that you are big counter-party to a lot of the banks on Wall Street. Is that having any sort of impact on the business overall?","Gerald Hassel","Yes Alex, great question. Certainly some of our largest clients are shrinking their balance sheets and reducing their repo positions. So what\u2019s interesting is our tri-party repo program has essentially been flat so as the dealers in the U.S. have shrunk the marketplace the global tri-party program has increased. So we are able to maintain the revenues and their profitability in the business and get a good return on the investments we have made in the tri-party repo reform program. There is no question that as the big dealers in the U.S. shrink their activities, there is some impact in our revenue streams there. But we are making up for it through enhanced services and capabilities in other places like collateral services. Collateral services, as you may recall was originally designed for the sales side, the buyer side is the one that\u2019s going to serve using it much more heavily. And so we feel very good about our position to be able to offset the declines in the large broker-dealers with more activity from other clients.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Got it, great. Thanks so much guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Hi, two questions, first on the corporate trust, you indicated that, you went through the review and decided to retain it, could you just give us a little bit more color on the ends announced into that decision?","Gerald Hassel","Sure Betsy thanks for the question. When we said -- in May, when we made more public that we are exploring this, we said at the time, let someone was willing to pay us a premium value for this business, we wouldn\u2019t sell it, because we like the business, we like the attributes of it. It\u2019s a fee-based business. It has future upside potential with a more normalized monetary policy and is structured notes and mortgage backed securities come back on. We see light at the end of the tunnel. We would only sell it if in fact someone would pay us the premium what we thought the value of these businesses were it\u2019s a challenging environment for someone to acquire something of this size and complexity. And so we decided that we couldn\u2019t get the kind of premium that we thought that this business was worth, and we think that it\u2019s much more valuable in our hands and we can continue to build upon it and leverage it, and it\u2019s a great business. And that\u2019s why I said we have always liked it. It was only a question whether it was more valuable to someone else than versus us.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. So, I mean obviously the Street know that there is a increased activism in the Company. And I guess the underlying question is, was this undertaken impart to answer questions to those folks or were you able to get to higher ROE, RTCE expectations the work you\u2019re doing now on the expense side?","Gerald Hassel","Well, the consideration to begin we have started a long time ago, so let\u2019s start with that. Our Board has always been very active and we as a management team have been very active. And looking at our -- all of our portfolio of businesses and making sure that they\u2019re best held in our hands versus someone else. And on corporate trust in some ways it was a simple math in a low interest rate environment with a level of deposits that were generated, if someone could make better use of those deposits and get a better margin on it and pay us a premium for the business that\u2019s when we would consider. To the extent that someone couldn\u2019t take advantage of it, we\u2019re happy to have the business and continue to own it and grow it and that\u2019s our leading market share of business. So that was the core reason for that. We think we can achieve our capital ratios, our leverage ratios, our liquidity coverage ratios, all within our own needs, irrespective of retaining the corporate trust business.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Got it. And then just separately, kind of ties into the collateral management question earlier, but as the fed starts to well ends tapering and then starts to increase reversed repo program, obviously you\u2019re in the middle of that. And with money market funds management product you have got as well as with the tri-party exposure that you\u2019ve got, maybe you could get, you\u2019re in a unique position to give us some color on how you think that higher increased RRP program is going to impact the financial markets?","Gerald Hassel","Well, I\u2019ll start with part of the answer and then I\u2019ll turn it over Todd, Todd has become a student of this as well as Curtis. We are the vehicle through which the reserve repo program of the Fed is -- we\u2019re the mechanism for allowing it to happen in the marketplace or for them to put the program in place. So and the Fed is a client of ours in that regard and so we do see the activity running through us and we\u2019re not going to violate any confidences there. But I think it is certainly one of the tools in the Fed\u2019s tool box in terms of managing monetary policy and interest rates. And so maybe with that I\u2019ll turn it over to Todd or Curtis.","Todd Gibbon","Yes. I would just add Betsy that given the new liquidity and capital rules it\u2019s going to be difficult for the Fed to open market transactions the way they\u2019ve done in the past, hence the reserve repo program where they go directly to money market funds came into place. I think there is some question about just how much the Fed wants to expand that program. And obviously if they do expand it they would do through the tri-party repo so we do see that activity. The other alternative that they have to increasing interest rates or drain it\u2019s to either sell some of the assets that they have or increase the interest that they pay on access reserves or in this term deposit facility that they have in the banking system. So if they do reserve repo the cash will come out of the banking system and it will go into money market funds based on price, and then the banking system would have to bid against that some of the cash that went into those funds would come back into the banking system. But I think it composites it\u2019s kind of that simple, and as reserve repo grows the access reserves should decline.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Glenn Schorr with ISI.","Glenn Schorr - ISI Group","Hi, thanks very much. So the actions that you\u2019d described taken to offset some of the lower rates and the actions in Europe, I am curious if you feel that has any material change on your asset sensitivity once all the changes are in motion I heard you on the revenue neutrality, but just curious on what that means in rising rate environment in the U.S.?","Gerald Hassel","Yes. As you can tell from our NIR position we\u2019ve taken a bit of a defensive stance we\u2019ve actually reduced our asset sensitivity substantially from where we were last year. We do pay for that a little bit on our NIM there is no question about it. There will be a little bit of an increase as we do make that transition Glenn. I don\u2019t think it will be significant it will be in the vicinity of about 10% so our sensitivity would increase about 5% to 10%. And we will be users of the health and maturity account as well so there\u2019s less sensitivity to the capital ratios.","Glenn Schorr - ISI Group","Got it, okay cool. And speaking the capital ratios, just looking for a drop more color on what specifically got consolidated from asset management to produce the drop in the ratios? And I am just curious on timing on why it happened this quarter I am just not familiar with it?","Gerald Hassel","Sure, we actually consolidated some of the CLOs that one of our asset managers managed, actually quite a few of the CLOs. So as we transition from Basel I to Basel III we actually reviewed the treatment of those consolidated assets. And we determined that even though we have no economic risk to them, we have no credit exposure at all that they should be included in our risk weighted assets. We actually expect this might be a temporary item FASB has just recently discussed the possibility of adapting a new standard that could be adopted as early next year and it would lead to us probably in consolidating some or even most of these assets as early as next year.","Glenn Schorr - ISI Group","Okay, last one for me is just the 24% decline in business development cost. Is that -- is there a business to component to that impact or is that more of a sustainable decline because it actually -- it really moved the needle?","Gerald Hassel","Yes, there are two major components and there couple, but I\u2019d say the two major components in there Glenn is our marketing expenses and our travel and entertainment expenses. We\u2019ve been much more aggressive in managing our -- those discretionary expenses. For example, we have discouraged internal travel, we\u2019ve encouraged, increased use of video and audio conferencing. And so rather than pull some of our operating committee together from time-to-time, we are doing it virtually much more frequently. And we are doing that across the board, we are not decreasing important revenue producing travel, this is internal related travel. Also last year, we had a substantial campaign on our marketing and branding efforts and we\u2019ve reduced the spend associated with that. We are going to try to keep this discipline and sustain these levels. Now there is some seasonality to this with conference and so forth, so we would expect the third quarter is typically pretty good and the fourth quarter tends to be a little bit higher.","Glenn Schorr - ISI Group","Okay, thank you for that.","Gerald Hassel","Thanks, Glenn.","Operator","","Thank you. The next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Thanks. Good morning. Just one follow-up on the NII, outside of the puts and takes, can you also tell us whether or not you think you can actually maintain this current level of NII, your comments were more focused on the offset between extending versus drags from ECB. But what\u2019s going on underneath that surface?","Gerald Hassel","Yes, I think we will be able to as we model this out and obviously it\u2019s going to be a bit sensitive to interest rates. But as we go through our modeling here, I think in the next few quarters, we will be able to maintain the level at this rate or in the ballpark of this rate, maybe slightly higher.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Okay. Two questions on investment servicing, just core asset servicing ex-security lending was up only slightly sequentially but it was up 4% year-over-year. I am just wondering if you can walk us through trends underlying the asset servicing. You did have a seed growth and I get that you had not as much of an equity sensitive custodian. But just only a $5 million kind of core increase in servicing can you give us some flavor for the growth or the traction of growth that\u2019s underneath that?","Gerald Hassell","","Yes Ken, it is Gerald. Just a couple of comments there, one you\u2019d recall we did lose a couple of clients over the course of the last 12 months. Those losses are now in the full run rate and that\u2019s why you\u2019ve seen a softness in some of the asset servicing revenues that\u2019s now fully in a run rate and we think we feel good about the pipeline in a go forward. We\u2019re attracting good clients and so it\u2019s a little bit soft this quarter, but we expect it to pick up in the future.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Okay. And my last one just about issuer services and you point out the drags of both sides of the business but second quarter is typically a seasonally stronger one that leads to the bigger jump in the third. So can you also just walk us through corporate trust and ADRs and the drivers there?","Gerald Hassell","Sure so the issuer services on a year-over-year basis I think it was down more than $60 million. Part of what we saw in the second quarter was last year we saw a little more dividend action in the second quarter, and due to timing, we\u2019re going to see some of that in the third quarter. So we would expect the third quarter to show the typical bounce that we get in seasonality around DRs and probably even a little bit higher than typical. So that was one of the reasons for softness there. And the reason is we also had fewer of these, kind of pass through, where some of our technology investments in corporate trust paid for clients and we see that in our revenue as well as in expense line. We had a little bit few -- a little bit less than that.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Okay, great thank you.","Gerald Hassell","Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. The next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Hi. Two as you say, reduced structural costs maybe you need to further reduce the structure and at the annual meeting I asked about the merits of having both assets serving along with asset management and Gerald you said that you have done the work and my thought is perhaps you need to show your work. Because the way we look at, the reported ROE has not been over the target of 10% since at least 2009. And so if this is a superior structure should there at least be an ROE in the double-digits?","Gerald Hassell","","Well, Mike we -- just as I said at the shareholder meeting, it\u2019s a business we like a lot. We think there is a lot of good benefits with the two businesses together. Investment management is a great contributor to our earnings, it\u2019s capital light it\u2019s fee-based. We\u2019re getting collaboration across the businesses we learn from each other, we are collaborating our new products, new services, new capabilities. When we have done math as I said at the annual meeting, we don\u2019t take the math works, there is a lot of tax challenges, a lot of regulatory challenges associated with it. We are in fact improving the margins both in investment services and in investment management and that was evidence this quarter, in investment management you saw a 2% improvement year-over-year in the margins in the business, why we\u2019re still investing in it? So we think we can improve the returns and the margins and drive a great business together. We like the diversity of the earnings, we like the fact that they mutually service the same client, I think it\u2019s a great combination.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","I have three follow-up questions, should I ask one and then re-queue or ask all three now?","Gerald Hassell","Ideally one now and then re-queue Mike.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Okay. Well, so what is the dollar amount of synergies and to repeat what I said before, again this is such a good combination, why is the ROE been below the cost of capital for the last five years?","Gerald Hassell","So Curtis maybe you want to touch base a little bit on some of the synergies.","Curtis Arledge","Yes. So Mike I think that when you think about investment management we\u2019re serving the same clients. In so many cases that our clients run investment services business, you\u2019ve asked for a very specific number. Truthful what is happening is these clients become clients with both parts of our organization, but with this continuous ability to connect to the investment services clients that's such powerful part of investment management.","Let me give you a -- just in this quarter, a couple of examples. We had a foundation, a line of the investment servicing business that is expressing interest and expanding their portfolio in a direction of direct lending investment vehicles. The team that covers them for investment services are well aware of our capabilities in this space introduced us to that client and it became a win for us in terms of getting an investment management mandate.","The other part of the investment services business that\u2019s been a real winner for us from past several months has been offering our private banking services for the clients approaching. So the financial advisors that approach and serves, many of them don\u2019t have access to their own private banking activity, so we\u2019ve linked those two actually invested in having a team in our private bank, make lending available to them and have seen nearly $0.5 billion of loan volume over a pretty short time and actually on really what we call the pilot effort that we\u2019re now actually planning to make it a much bigger part of the business.","If you look at our cash business today, because we\u2019re at a low interest environment, the overall economics of the cash business are not really what we think the contingent opportunity is in a more normalized rate environment, but just think of all the changes that occurred in the money market fund world with the question was asked earlier about the basic change in market structure. We think we\u2019re well positioned to provide services around cash products into the higher rate environment that will be very valuable to the shareholders of BNY Mellon. So those are some examples of the places where there is real synergy.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Okay. I\u2019ll re-queue. Thanks.","Gerald Hassell","Thanks Mike.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Good morning. So I guess I\u2019m just, I\u2019m a little bit confused about why you would want to be give up your asset sensitivity or lose some of the asset sensitivity here. I mean the NIM currently at like roughly 100 basis points is just far from heroic you have got Yellen in making comments that rates might be moving higher. So can you help us understand what drove that decision a little bit with a little bit greater clarity?","Gerald Hassell","So you\u2019re talking about moving a little bit of the cash that we have in the form of placements into high quality liquid assets. Part of that is compliance with LCR, so we are sitting on a massive amount of cash, placements are not LCR compliant. So this is a fairly easy way for us to comply and we will generate a little bit of additional NIR. We don\u2019t want to give up much of our interest rate sensitivity, so you\u2019re not going to see a significant move there. We do think that there is growth in opportunity cost and the capital cost to join that Brennan. But you will see a modest adjustment.","Curtis Arledge","Yes. And Brennan some of the other activities we\u2019re working on, you\u2019ve seen the loan book and our wealth management business grow, we like that sort of that asset. You\u2019ve seen some of our secured financing for some of our collateral management clients\u2019 increase. We are looking at other area within our asset capabilities to generate better returns on those assets and still keep the interest rate sensitivity available to us for our win rates to improve.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Okay. Thanks for that color. And then if we think about your asset management business and the sort of adjusted pre-tax margin there, if we look at what happened last year in that business, it contracted about 100 basis points versus 12 and I understand the majority of that was investment in distribution. But if we look at other asset management firms, they saw a rather significant expansion in margins last year. So I guess what's holding back the asset management business given how constructive the market is? Is there a structural impediment there, does it have something to do with how the agreements with the affiliates are structured. If you can maybe help us understand that a little bit that be great?","Curtis Arledge","Yes Brennan, it is Curtis. So first of all I would say that last year in addition to the investments that we made to grow our wealth management to expand our reach to financially expand our budgets through primarily in the U.S. to drive us and also to grow geographically. Those investments they sort of dampen margin, but I would also would call out the fact that we had a pretty some meaningful fee waiver environment, so we have a big part of our business is absolutely impacted by low or short rates.","When you compare our overall enterprise to other peers that are sort of over the $1 trillion mark, we have a substantially smaller percentage of assets that are any equity asset class, and so the -- and I would also point out that our equity AUM is also pretty diversified, lot less as a percent is U.S. equities which have -- and especially did here last year. So we don\u2019t -- well it was certainly a tailwind for us. It was not nearly the tailwind that it would have been for investment firms that are less diversified and more similarly exposed to equity AUM.","I don\u2019t think that the boutique structure certainly is one of our investment firms is very focused on their client base, their asset classes. They have a wider array of their own activities, both institutional and through retail distribution channels. But I actually think that they would benefit from the scale. We have firms that are 30, 40, 50 people highly focused on a very specific asset class, and we give them geographic reach in terms of clients and have a firm on the East Coast of United States that\u2019s raising money all over Asia and throughout the Sovereign Wealth Fund World without having to actually build their own infrastructure to do that.","So I think it is a -- we\u2019re pretty excited about what we do. We are investing in it and you\u2019re absolutely focused on improving margins. That\u2019s why we are investing with where we are. If you look at the peers who have higher margins than us, they generally have substantially larger percentage of their assets in the retail space, and they have a larger share currently, they are benefiting from the equity tailwind. Of course that creates more profit volatility and margin volatility, if you look at it through time. But we are investing to improve our margins and are pretty excited about our opportunities there.","Gerald Hassell","Yes just one final bit of color, I think you are seeing evidence of it in the 200 basis points improvement in margin year-over-year. This year and early next year are sort of the high watermarks in terms of the level of investment and we showed you in April. We expect an improvement in margin as those investments start to pay off. And also I might add, the investments we are making are not high risk investments. It is investing in wholesalers and distribution. It\u2019s investing in wealth managers. We are bringing in clients. That\u2019s starting to show up in numbers now. These are investments we have very-very conference on the returns.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Okay, thanks for the color.","Gerald Hassell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank","Hi. Great, thanks. Good morning.","Gerald Hassell","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank","Yes good morning. On the, just back to the corporate trust, on the expense side of this can you just talk a little bit about to what degree some of the consolidation of this platforms were involved in the prior cost reduction program, and whether the dynamic changed upon your decision. And then, so should we be thinking about any other further backdrop of consolidations as the potential expenses on the corporate trust now that you are keeping in?","","Gerald Hassell","","Yes, the primary operating platform for corporate trust is the trust accounting system. It\u2019s really dedicated to corporate trust. They are the last user above it, and actually we were in a migration mode to our end-stage platform called GSP, for those of you who are interested in acronyms. We\u2019re in the process of doing the conversion and we are going to continue the process and it should be completed next year. And so there is no change in that going forward. And we will realize better operating metrics as a result of it.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank","Okay. So that\u2019s yes, it\u2019s interchanged through sort of expense -- based on you keeping that. ","Gerald Hassell","Brian, you\u2019re breaking up, if you could\u2026","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank","I\u2019m sorry, so there is no change in the expense fee based on you are keeping that, it\u2019s the takeaway there?","","Gerald Hassell","No, not at all.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank","And then on the revenue side, maybe question for Curtis and Brian -- and congrats on your extended role by the way. On the clearing business, you know the revenue, hope that well given charges definitely declined in the quarter. So I was just wondering if that was due to the component that\u2019s related to licensing and asset management or are you gaining new clients and is the run rate better there? And then similarly for Curtis, you know the organic growth has been very strong in asset management recently, this quarter little bit weaker, maybe if you could just address the LDI outflow and your view of the organic growth coming in the next one to two quarter overall?","Brian Shea","Brian, it is Brian Shea. I will start with the clearing question and then I will turn it over to Curtis. The clearing business has been pretty strong with core fee growth driven by significant growth in mutual fund assets and asset-based fees offset by higher cash earnings receivers and lower DARTS as you recognized. I think the underlying metrics behind the clearing business are all really pretty strong. In this quarter we have a record level of client assets in custody. We have a record number of total individual investments on our platforms globally. We have a record levels of mutual fund assets on our platform overall. And growing margin balances as you can see in the metrics year-over-year, and you know the slight -- lots of low rates and discussions about money market industry, pretty solid cash management balances.","And I would not actually to reinforce Curtis\u2019 point that the market share urging clients choosing, because they decide which cash management alternatives they use. But the clients have chosen Dreyfus more than ever before, and so we have a record level of market share of Dreyfus cash management on the purging platform. Again, when an interest rate environment changes that will be a much more valuable linkage in synergies between the investment management and investment services business. So that\u2019s my perspective on clearing I am going to turn it over to Curtis.","Curtis Arledge","Yes and on the organic side, first of all we will tell you that we had a long-term out flows this quarter of 13 billion. It\u2019s a pretty unique situation actually and that one of our large LDI clients actually decided to take their LDI activities in-house. So it was not any way related to our investment performance or service, we always hate losing any business, but completing our standard decisions that they may -- to do that. I will tell you that our pipelines around LDI specifically continue to be robust, pension de-risking is still very much alive and well and I would actually say it\u2019s expanding geographically. So our largest business is Insight, which has a large book of UK, LDI business and I can tell you that the global interest in LDI is definitely not shrinking.","One of the nice things about just -- since we are talking about the Insight, I will tell you the Insight, the tools that you\u2019ve to be able to perfectly model the liabilities, especially UK liabilities are having inflation sensitivity component. You have to be very good at understanding market dynamics and what drives risk and return and in the quarter, Insight specifically actually had a very significant amount of inflow into alternative strategies absolute return strategies where they are taking a lot of their capabilities and creating absolute return products, if their clients, who have been very satisfied with them in the LDI space are allocating to them and also getting broader interest.","We like the short term side like the rest of the industry did experience outflows our outflows we think are roughly in inline with that the industry saw in the second quarter both some of it being tax payment, some of this being that clients were certainly in the beginning of the quarter reallocating short-term cash into some of the higher yielding on assets and actually that\u2019s the story in fixed income as well. Our product outflow there is related to mostly short duration fixed income where clients are reallocating.","In equities the dynamic there has really been three things. The equity rebalancing so the increase in equity markets has caused clients to move money. But we\u2019ve also seen clients move assets around into past strategies. So in this quarter, you actually will see our increase of 7 billion was almost entirely equity index. So it\u2019s nice thing you have a diverse range of products to be able to -- it\u2019s leaving one place, it\u2019s going another money in motion is big part of our advantage here.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank","Great, great thanks very much for the thorough answer.","Gerald Hassell","Wendy, I think we have one more question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Cynthia Mayer with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Hi, thanks a lot. So just getting back to the expense management, you and others have been mentioning for a while that the pressure of compliance cost and I am just wondering looking ahead, do you see those leveling off? Is that a pressure that you feel is abating, so that to the extent you do streamlining, more of it will fall to the bottom line and same question and I guess the combining of your platforms, is there upfront IT for that?","Gerald Hassell","Great question, Cynthia, so first on the regulatory side, the rate of increase is slowing down, it is creating greater clarity around the rules and the regulations and what we need to do to be in compliance with them. But importantly, we cannot sacrifice having a well-controlled, well risk-managed firm we are absolutely committed to that and we\u2019re not going to sacrifice having a great firm in those categories. But we do in fact see the rate of growth moderating and our expense management is taking into consideration, continuing to fund those activities and so that\u2019s why we are very diligent around all the other things that we can control so that we can fund new investments, we can fund having a well controlled environment and continue to grow our businesses and serve our clients well. So it\u2019s all factored into the expense control programs that we put in place. And the platform consolidations again the technology investments that we\u2019re making are factored in the expense base and we\u2019re realizing the synergies out of the platform consolidations and it\u2019s in the run rate.","Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Todd Gibbons","Thanks.","Gerald Hassell","Thank you. Everyone thank you very much for dialing in today. I know you had a lot of interest in our results and so follow up questions to Izzy Dawood or Andy Clark they are available to answer your questions and thank you for your interest in us.

Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Andy Clark. Mr. Clark, you may begin.","Andy Clark","Thanks, Wendy, and welcome, everyone. With us today are Gerald Hassell, our Chairman and CEO; Todd Gibbons, our CFO, as well as our executive management team.","Before we begin, let me remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement and in the press release and those identified in our documents filed with the SEC that are available on our Web site bnymellon.com.","Forward-looking statements in this call speak only as of today, April 22, 2014, and we will not update forward-looking statements. Our press release and earnings review are available on our Web site, and we'll be using the earnings review to discuss our results.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Gerald. Gerald?","Gerald L. Hassell","","Thanks, Wendy, Andy and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. As you\u2019ve see from our release we achieved good results this quarter with pretax earnings up 12% year-over-year. We\u2019re reporting earnings of $0.57 per share, with total revenues of $3.6 billion.","We also achieved a 3% fee growth in Investment Management and Investment Services, which within a context of what is a persistently slow economic recovery is deep and see growth. Investment Management benefitted from our continued success in attracting new assets. We recorded our 18th consecutive quarter of positive long-term flows, with net long-term in flows of $21 billion.","Assets under management was up 14% year-over-year to a record $1.62 trillion. Driven by the continued strong flows into our liability-driven investment strategies. Investment Services fees were also up, benefitting not only from strong growth in clearing, but also a nice growth in asset servicing.","Now Investment Services business was also held by the growing contributions from Global Collateral Services. As usage of our optimization and segregation solutions continue to improve. And in Global Markets, the enhancements we\u2019ve made to our electronic foreign exchange platform have helped us attract greater volumes.","Now during the quarter the strength and quality of our asset servicing capabilities were recognized in a key market service. Among our peer group, we earned a number one overall score in the R&M Global Custody survey of clients and fund managers. We were also the number one in the expert\u2019s category, which included investment managers who rated 5 or more global custodians.","In total, we received 10 number one ranking in our peer group. It\u2019s the latest vote of confidence in our ability to provide the expertise clients need to navigate the challenging times as they struggle to manage regulatory change risk and cost. And we were able to achieve the growth in Investment Management and Investment Services fees in spite of some ongoing sizable challenges.","One, the substantial impact of money market fee waivers; and two, the decline in the pretax income of Corporate Trust. As a revenue from structured debt securitizations has run-off faster than a revenue coming from new business. Year-over-year, our rough estimate is that money market fee waivers and a run-off in Corporate Trust fees, accounted for a drive for a total fee revenue growth of approximately 200 basis points. On the expense front, total expenses were down both year-over-year and sequentially.","And Todd will cover more on expenses in a moment, but what I do want to emphasis, is that we are taking aggressive action in virtually every expense category from moderate to growth rate here.","So, for example, we are controlling a rate of expense growth in technology by in-sourcing application development, reducing storage cost in consolidating platforms. We are reducing our real estate foot print. We are reengineering how we work including rationalizing our client-coverage teams, making it more efficient and allowing us to reduce costs while enhancing the client experience. And importantly, using evidence of all of these moves and our commitment to aggressive expense management this year.","I should add that like all large financial institutions, our regulatory control and compliance costs have risen substantially and continued to be high, and I have to say it is a critical that we maintain a great control environment. But now that we are beginning to gain more clarity on the new rules, the rate of related expense growth should begin to slow and that\u2019s encouraging. On the capital front, our capital story is among the very best in the industry.","Our key capital ratios continued to strengthen. We achieved an excellent return on tangible common equity at 18%. Now given that significant levels of capital that we generate and our strong capital positions, we have the financial flexibility to invest in our businesses and maintain a high payout ratio, which was more than 80% in the first quarter of 2014. Earlier this month, we announced another dividend increase of 13% which followed a 50% increase last year.","So, the bottom-line is we are executing to drive our shareholder value and we are actively aligning our business model and we are focused on managing expenses well and generating strong returns on tangible common equity.","With that let me turn it over to Todd.","Thomas P. Gibbons ","","Thanks Gerald and good morning everyone. My comments will follow the quarterly earnings review and we\u2019ll start on Page 2. As Gerald noted the EPS was $0.57, we should note that the $0.57 includes about $0.03 to $0.04 for the combined benefits of a lower tax rate. And also we had a loan loss provision credits.","Looking at the numbers on a year-over-year basis, total revenue was $3.6 billion. Investment Services fees were up, 3% that is driven by strength in asset servicing in our clearing businesses.","Investment management and performance fees were also up 3% and that number would be 5%, if you excluded the impact of money market fee waivers. FX revenue was down driven by the volatility we experienced in the quarter. NIR on a fully taxable equivalent basis was up 2% and securities gains were down $26 million. Finally, expenses were down 1%.","Turning to Page 4, where we recall some business metrics that will help explain our underlying performance. You can see that AUM of $1.62 trillion was up 14% year-over-year. And that\u2019s 2% sequentially, that\u2019s driven by both market as well as net new business. During the quarter we had net long-term inflows of $21 billion and revolver short-term outflows we can seen, it was $7 billion.","You will note that, we\u2019ve enhanced our full disclosure providing flows by all of our major asset classes including the Index and LDI strategies.","Assets under custody\/administration at quarter end were $27.9 trillion. That\u2019s up $1.6 trillion or 6% year-over-year. That\u2019s primarily reflecting the impact of market as well as currency impact. Linked quarter AUC\/A was up 1% due to improved market values. We had an estimated $161 billion in new AUC\/A wins during the quarter.","As you look down the list, most of our key metrics continue to fuel growth on a year-over-year basis. Average loans and deposits in Wealth Management, Investment Services were again up strongly. The market value of securities and loans at period end increased. All of our clearing metrics were up, with DARTS volumes particularly strong yet again. On the flip side, DR programs and average tri-party repo balances were down slightly.","In terms of the key external indicator, markets were up, but most importantly for us the FX Volatility Index was down 14% and that really is what\u2019s driving FX revenue. The average Fed Funds effective rate was down 7 basis point or nearly 50% from last year, which had a negative impact on our money market fee waivers and our net interest income.","Looking at fees on Page 6, asset servicing fees were up 4% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. The year-over-year increase reflects higher market values, net new business and organic growth. The sequential increase primarily reflects organic growth, but it did benefit from higher securities lending revenue and net new business.","Clearing fees were up 7% year-over-year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher mutual fund fees, higher asset-based fees and an increase in DARTS, all of that was partially offset by higher money market fee waivers. Sequentially, higher clearance revenue was primarily offset by fewer trading days during the quarter.","Issuer services fees were down 3% both year-over-year and sequentially. Both decreases reflect the impact of the continued net run-off in Corporate Trust. The year-over-year decrease was partially offset by higher DR revenue driven by corporate actions. The good news is we can see the net fee run-off abating in the next 18 months to 24 months, as the pace of the structure debt maturities slows and new business should more than offset that run-off.","When you look in investment services, you will see that investment services fees as a percentage of noninterest expense were up versus the year ago quarter. This improvement was primarily driven by an increase in investment services fees with little additional expenses.","Investment management and performance fees were up 3% year-over-year and down 7% sequentially. Excluding money market fee waivers, investment management and performance fees were up 5% year-over-year and down 6% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher equity market values and the net impact of new business. The sequential decrease primarily reflects seasonally lower performance fees and there were also fewer days in the first quarter.","When you look at our Investment Management business, you\u2019ll see a new disclosure that we think provides a better basis for comparison to other investment managers, that is, it\u2019s an adjusted pre-tax operating margin, which excludes intangible amortization, net of distribution and servicing expense and also adjusts for fee waivers. On this basis, our pre-tax operating margin for the quarter is 35%.","In FX and other trading, revenue was down 16% year-over-year and down 7% sequentially. If you look at the underlying components, FX revenue of $130 million was down 13% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. Comparisons for both prior periods were impacted by lower volatility. The good news here is we\u2019re capturing higher volumes driven by enhancements to our electronic FX platform.","Other trading revenue was down $6 million from the year ago quarter and $14 million from the fourth quarter, decreases from both periods reflect lower fixed income trading revenue and the impact of market-to-market losses on certain hedges.","Turning to page 8 of the earnings review, you\u2019ll see that net interest revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was up $11 million versus the year ago quarter and it was down $37 million sequentially. The year-over-year increase resulted from higher deposits partially offset by lower yields and investment securities. The sequential decrease primarily reflects lower yields on investment securities and fewer days in the first quarter and that was partially offset by the change in the mix of assets and we reduced the cash and interbank investments and increased our securities portfolio. Net interest margin for the quarter was 1.05%, down from 1.11% in the year ago quarter and 1.09% in the fourth quarter.","Turning to page 9, total noninterest expenses were down 1% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, comparisons to both prior periods were impacted by lower pension expense and higher incentive expense due to the acceleration of the vesting of long-term stock awards for retirement eligible employees. The sequential decline also reflects the decrease in business development expense as well as lower professional, legal and other purchased services and risk-related expenses.","The year-over-year decrease also results in a provision for administrative errors in the cost of generating certain tax credits both of which were recorded in the year ago quarter. On page 10, you can see at the quarter-end, we had a net unrealized gain on the investment securities portfolio of $676 million, the increase from $309 million at the end of the quarter was primarily driven by the reduction in market interest rates.","Looking at our loan book on page 11, you can see that the provision for credit losses was a credit of $18 million. This was driven by the continued improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio. That compares to a credit of $24 million in the year ago quarter and a provision of $6 million in the prior quarter.","Turning to our capital story, as I mentioned which is a good one. As you can see on page 12, our key ratios strengthened over the quarter. At March 31, our estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio under the standardized approach on a fully phased-in basis was 11% that compares to 10.6% at the end of December. The 40 basis point sequential increase primarily reflects capital generation during the period. And that was partially offset by some increase in few of the risk-related asset categories.","Our estimated supplementary leverage ratio also improved substantially during the quarter to approximately 4.7%, primarily reflecting two things. One are some changes to the treatment of unfunded commitments and the methodology is actually calculated average assets as well as the strong capital generation that we\u2019ve mentioned earlier. During the quarter, we repurchased 11.6 million shares for $375 million completing our repurchases under the capital plan for 2013.","The effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.1%, it was positively impacted by the change in New York state tax rates that was enacted on March 31. A few points to factor into the thinking of our current quarter and beyond. We would expect NII to stay in the range we saw this quarter adjusting of course to day count. The quarterly provision should be in the range of zero to $15 million. We expected the tax rates to be around 27% for the second quarter.","We anticipate gross share repurchase is up to approximately $430 million, of course that\u2019s subject to market conditions. And we also expect to record a pretax gain of nearly $500 million on our interest in Wing Hang, when the sale closes, which is expected to be in the second or third quarter.","Bear in mind, however that Wing Hang equity income is averaged somewhere between $15 million and $20 million per quarter and was included in the other income line. We\u2019ve already mentioned that we are consolidating our space which will lead to a net reduction in New York City of approximately $700,000 square feet. There are maybe some costs associated with this consolidation, as we reposition our staff, but we expect gains to more than offset these costs when one Wall Steet building and move to a more efficient space.","That sale is beginning to take place in the second or third quarter. So as Gerald indicated you will see evidence of these actions this year. So wrapping up, we are taking actions to control expenses relative to our revenues, and we want you to see in our results. We are going to provide you with more details on this at our Investor Day that we are planning to be hosting in the fall. With that let me hand it back to Gerald.","Gerald L. Hassell","Thanks Todd. And I think we can open it up to questions Wendy.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","Thank you. At this time, we are ready to begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","Hi, thanks good morning.","Gerald L. Hassel","Good morning.","Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","A Couple of questions, one on expenses, one on capital. On the expense side, Todd you went through the outlook for the improvement in expenses associated with the space that you are getting rid off. Could you give us a sense of Joe whether that is going to be on a run rate basis? Is that exactly what the gain is going to be, but maybe you can help us on the run rate expense ratio side?","Thomas P. Gibbons","","It\u2019s actually hard for us to put in exactly a number on that because we haven\u2019t decided we\u2019re actually going to be located. We haven\u2019t signed a lease on the new property or with some of the cost associated with that. We do know there will be improvement, but Betsy it\u2019s a little early to actually specify a number.","Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Maybe a little bigger picture on the expenses than Gerald mentioned during your prepared remarks that your expectations are that expense gross could slow down here with regulatory expenses falling down. Did you suggest there that regulatory expenses could exactly start to fall following the overall growth rate or just the regulatory expense gross will be slower?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Just slower, they are not going to fall that\u2019s for sure because we are still building out risk compliance right to date aggregation models, risk analytics models et cetera, that the regulators in are asking for. So we don\u2019t see the expenses declining. But we see the rate of growth slowing as some of these things have already been embedded in our run rates. A good example that is in our local dealer services tri\u2013party heading up at the shareholders meetings we gave a number that over the last two years, we\u2019ve incurred about $73 million of additional expense in that business, associated with regulatory compliance and satisfying tri-party reform. That\u2019s in our run rate today. So that is a good example where the rate of growth will slow. But it won\u2019t decline.","Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Gerald L. Hassel","","Hey Betsy let me add something there. The rate of growth in the risk and kind what we\u2019ll call the center or in the shared services, has been a two to three times the rate of growth in the businesses. And we are trying to bring that more in line.","Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. So if we are thinking about just operating leverage generally and the kind of operating leverage you are looking to manage towards. Maybe you could give us a sense of what kind of range you are anticipating all the actions that you\u2019re doing is going to end up driving in terms of operating leverage.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, Betsy as we try to make it clear operating leverage is going to be driven both by the expense control that we implement as well as the revenue mix. So, when we see fee weighted risk for example increase, we are seeing a loss revenue with no additional expenses and we get replaced by increases either in Investment Management or Investment Services. Traditional fees, they are typically expenses that come with that, so I want to make it clear that revenue mix is absolutely essential to what actually happens to operating leverage.","Now that being said, we are controlling nominal expenses. So, we are getting our hands around a number of things both in the center, just slowing the growth rate even flattening it for example, our capital budget is flat, we are getting more out of the tax spend that we currently have. And we can expand on that conversation a bit. But if all things fully constant, yes you will see in other words, if the revenue mix stays into this and the market stays into this, then you will see positive operating leverage even at relatively low growth rates.","Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay and that's great. Just one quickie separate question, you went through the capital ratios that all look good going up obviously, what was the reason that EBITDA came down?","Thomas P. Gibbons","The tangible common equity is total\u2026","Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right, right, it just look like a 20 bps decline Q1 scale.","Gerald L. Hassell","It\u2019s not much of a change if there is any change. The balance sheet might have averaged a little bit large of that. I don\u2019t think it must have changed balancing out.","Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, now it was 20 bps just wondering. Okay and then on SLR up nicely in the quarter, I mean that your SLR assumes that your deposits are fair or not, taking out or they are not in the denominators, they are in?","Thomas P. Gibbons","No, they are in the denominator.","Gerald L. Hassell","Cash has not removed from the denominator.","Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right, okay, so you are assuming that and I know it\u2019s not final rule, you have to, we\u2019re assuming that it can be in the final rule. So from here, is it just normal course to get up to the 5%? Is there anything special that you feel like you need to do right now, at one point we were talking about you potentially having to charge for deposits but doesn\u2019t seem like that in the run rate given how you\u2019ve gotten this up to now?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, I think that we can actually get over the hurdle pretty quickly. I think the one thing we made clear is, it doesn\u2019t make sense to get there just by holding additional capital. So we can look at the deposit base and the deposits that have less value to our net value under the SLR or even the liquidity coverage ratio, we could certainly put those types of balances off the balance sheet.","But we are still looking at some point we\u2019ll be able to be consolidate some of the assets from our asset manager. So there are a number of ways that we can get there and we always have more room to issue preferred stock if we thought it was appropriate to bolster our Tier 1 leverage which should be a lot less expensive than holding common.","Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay great. Thank you.","Gerald L. Hassell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Glenn Schorr with ISI Group.","Glenn P. Schorr \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Hi thanks. One quick one on the Investment Management side, I heard your comments and disclosure on the 25% versus 35% margin in Investment Management. Are you able to break down which is due to the distribution adjustments versus the money market fee waivers I think it\u2019s fair and interesting just curious on the breakdown?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, my recollection, Glenn is about 200 basis points over this related to fee waivers. And you can calculate, we disclose intangible amortization, so you can calculate that and the remainder would be the impact of the distribution fees. Some show there is a gross up and some show is a net to the revenue.","Glenn P. Schorr \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Got it, okay that's cool, I could do that. And then, I don\u2019t know if you could talk a little bit about the lending growth inside Investment Services. I think it was up 18% year-on-year. Just curious what\u2019s driving that.","Gerald L. Hassell","Sure. That\u2019s associated in some ways with our collateral services area where we provide some level of secured financing to the broker\/dealer community as far the optimization segregation, but it\u2019s also around collateral services, around that area. So it\u2019s a program where there are good safe loans, highly collateralized to some of our largest clients around the world.","Thomas P. Gibbons","","Hey, Glenn, this has come a little bit slower than we had hoped. We\u2019re actually starting to see a pickup and we\u2019re seeing that trend even in the second quarter.","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes, and a little bit of it is called term funding. So it\u2019s having the dealers who rely on this short-term wholesale funding. So we\u2019re seeing six, nine months, in some cases one year maturity on these loans. So that helps their clients who have less reliance on wholesale short-term funding and it\u2019s a good earning asset for us.","Glenn P. Schorr \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Okay. Last one, non-interest bearing deposit growth was up 16% year-on-year. If you look at your foreign deposits, you have like $100 billion. Curious what\u2019s driving the growth and more importantly what\u2019s in the Euro zone, has they contemplate the negative deposit rates? Just curious on how we should expect the balance sheet to react.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, good question. So they are fair amount of European as well as U.S. deposits and the actual average deposits is about flat, slightly down. Free deposits are actually up, but interest-bearing deposits are slightly down on a quarter-over-quarter basis. If the Euro zone were to go to negative rates that would actually present the opportunity for us to charge for deposits and we are giving that very serious consideration. In the two non-Euro zone, European countries that did go to negative rates, we did pass-through that through to deposits.","Glenn P. Schorr \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","And now client pushback? And I guess where I\u2019m going with it is, one route is charging for deposits sometimes with large customers that\u2019s a bit of an issue. Is it possible to rather mismatch and move your assets outside the zone or is that not something anybody wants to take on in terms of a mismatch?","Gerald L. Hassell","Well, typically you\u2019ll have the interest rate parity that comes towards the hedging of that type of a transaction as long as assuming you\u2019re not taking any FX risk. There is some opportunity to do some of that with the hedging, but again managing your liquidity and also the liquidity coverage ratio targets that the regulators we\u2019re establishing will have to be taken into consideration when you do that, Glenn.","Glenn P. Schorr \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Okay. That makes sense. I appreciate that. Thank you.","Gerald L. Hassell","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) The next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","","Great, thanks. Good morning, everybody. Just a question on the Investment Management business. I guess if you look at the growth in assets and the fee rate quarter-over-quarter, it seems like it saw a pretty decent decline and understandably some of that is money market fee waivers, although it didn\u2019t seem like the dollar amount was that different sequentially. So I guess the day count counts for the rest of it, but can you guys just kind of walk us through the expectations for the fee rate and the Investment Management business ex-performance fees in the coming quarters and to tie into that, maybe just to address what kind of fees are you guys getting on the LDI mandates because that obviously seems to be a big driver?","Curtis Y. Arledge","","Alex, Curtis Arledge here. So on a year-over-year basis then I\u2019ll talk about sequentially as well. The biggest drag as Todd, mentioned was the fee waiver impact. A very significant decline year-over-year in short rates and that has absolutely dampened revenue growth. So revenue growth of 3 would have been north of 5 actually is Investment Management a little more than 200 basis points, just a fee waiver impact.","We also are comparing our third quarter of 2014 to a \u2013 with a very strong first quarter 2013 on the fee side. We actually have fees when we have a less than 20% an investment boutique, their performance fees and carried interest actually, our share up to the performance fees and carried interest actually runs through that fee line and it can be somewhat volatile. We had a very strong first quarter 2013, so if you just look at the normalized rate that probably is another 100 or 200 basis points of fee growth. So we are actually pretty happy that fee growth generally given the mix of assets that we have in the market performance overall, very nice performance on the new business front.","The sequential story is really not that different, so fee waivers have a smaller impact as you said the days actually was a pretty meaningful impact, and then again the volatility in our management fee line from performance fees they are on at the boutiques where we have less than 20% stake also attributed to that also. It\u2019s small, but nonetheless it\u2019s still directionally the same hence the year-over-year results.","LDI, obviously a business that we are doing extraordinarily well and not just the LDI business that insight in the U.K. that their ability to leverage that into other growth in active fixed income in absolute return products, so it\u2019s a springboard for many other businesses. LDI by itself is a business that does have lower fees, but on giant volume of assets and they are also want to make sure that everybody understands that the what the management fees might be, there also is a meaningful opportunity in a number of those mandates during performance fees.","And so when you see our fourth quarter performance fees a meaningful portion of that is actually coming from LDI related mandates where we have given opportunity on our performance fees if we outperformed a client\u2019s benchmark. So it\u2019s a great business for us overall and again it\u2019s helping to drive not just revenues in LDI, but other revenues as well.","Alexander Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks Gerald, it\u2019s a lot of color. And just a follow-up on expenses, I guess Todd bigger picture seasonally first quarter I guess tends to be a little bit lighter some of the myriad increases, things that have already kick in for you guys in the second half of the year. So maybe just taking a step back, how should we think about the expense growth of the current base because it does seem like that's the lowest or one of the lower kind of core expense numbers have seen from you guys in a while, so kind of $27 billion, $28 billion run rate quarterly is that a sustainable number or what kind of growth we should think about from off of this base?","","Gerald L. Hassell","In the second half you are right, typically July 1, since where a myriad increase pull through, but we are looking to, I think we are looking to keep most of the expense lines as flat as you can. I think you will see a little bit higher software amortization and it\u2019s going to be a little bit more in the noise than anything. The first quarter you got to remember does also, is also impacted by the acceleration of retirement to eligible employees on their deferred comp. So that should reverse itself in the second quarter.","Alexander Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","","Got it. Thanks guys.","Gerald L. Hassell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein.","Luke Montgomery \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning guys.","Gerald L. Hassell","Good morning.","Luke Montgomery \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So my sense is you have been working on a benchmarking analysis so that your asset management segments margins versus your peers. Now I guess adjusting for few ever you said there in the mid 30% range, which I think seems a bit low for from your scale and $1.6 trillion asset management so. I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re able at this point to communicate whether you think there is a good structural reason for that or if you see there is maybe a meaningful opportunities improve margins in the business. I think with that the revenue yields in LDI indexing cash are pretty low and those are probably 65% of the total, implied may be overall contribution margins in those businesses and could that be enough to offset revenue yields?","Curtis Y. Arledge","","Hey Luke, it\u2019s Curtis. We obviously spend a lot of time on understanding the industry framework and working clients across a large different channels thinking by what means to margins. I do think as Todd walked through earlier the intangible amortization, the distribution netting \u2013 distribution costs and fee waivers get us into that mid 30 range. I also would highlight that as we\u2019ve talked about in previous earnings calls over the past year or so really last nine months or so, most impactful, and we\u2019ve also been investing in our business.","And so I\u2019ll add that probably 1% to 2% range of margins just in terms how we think about it. When we look at the structural, the biggest structural thing that we\u2019ve talked about a lot has been fee waiver impact and the contribution margins there are north of well north of what are overall margin is.","So it would be nice to not our fee waivers obviously that would help a great deal. And then the nearest structural thing we\u2019ve also talked about is that if you look at our business and you commented on somewhat in your question, we are if predominantly focused on institutional clients in management firm. And it\u2019s why we have been over the past nine months or so, really making pretty meaningful investments in two ways to expand to reach more individuals as investors.","We do that in two ways one directly through direct comp contact with individuals through our wealth management business here in the U.S., great business seven partners in the U.S., there is great room also great opportunity for us to expand and we\u2019ve been growing in markets where we\u2019ve had little presence and even in some cases no presence. That is actually on quite well.","We\u2019ve talked about expanding our sales force by about 50% about a year-ago and we\u2019re about 60% already through that expansion. Starting to see revenues from having done that and we\u2019re really quite excited about it. It\u2019s just bringing the great offerings and investment offerings we have around our firm plus the power of being private bank and I\u2019ll highlight you that what we know in our earnings release, well we are named top ranked bank, our wealth management team is doing an exceptional job and expanding that reach is going to be fantastic.","The other way we are expanding the individual investors, the second method is through intermediaries where we work with advisors and there has been some coverage of this and what\u2019s going on with us. I\u2019ll highlight this is not a startup effort on our part. In fact, Dreyfus was one of the original creators of mutual fund industry and BNY MELLON that has both U.S. presence to drive this but also has the global presence. We\u2019ve about $156 billion in long-term mutual fund assets. Which would make us $200 million just on retail basis, on what is 100 asset managers on a whole just on a retail asset base.","So we already have a pretty significant presence here, but it isn\u2019t anywhere close to what we think it should be. So we\u2019ve also been investing there. And I think if when you look at firms you have margins higher than ours. They\u2019re able to take your investment offerings and get them through client channels. They are not just institutional but also reach individuals as well and interrupt while in doing that. We do a lot work like, look I talk about the study that \u2013 we used Mackenzie. We think Mackenzie\u2019s benchmarking study is one of the best in the marketplace and we got actually right out or slightly above peers who look like us. So that\u2019s sort of long-winded answer to your marketing question.","Luke Montgomery \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","","Okay. Just a follow-up on that. I guess, I\u2019m not \u2013 in terms of the investments you\u2019re making in retail business, I\u2019m not clear why do you think that\u2019s a higher margin business or that\u2019s more about having an underutilized retail platform that you\u2019re going to scale up. And then, I guess along with that, how do you rate the strength of the Dreyfus brand, especially in the warehouse distribution channel and are you considering a rebranding campaign or do you think that\u2019s the brand that you really want to build on?","Thomas P. Gibbons","","So the first question is, I think there is a underutilized potential. I think the contribution margins of taking investment capabilities that we already have today that we are offering in some ways to the retail channels and directly to wealth management also, but expanding that will be pretty a meaning contribution margin. We don\u2019t have to expand our investment capabilities all that much and can reach a much broader universal clients, and again, this is a market where we are already very present and we just want to get a figure out of it, because we think there\u2019s big opportunity with what we have.","On the Dreyfus branding side, I definitely think that part isn\u2019t just about covering clients. You also have to have the right products. We\u2019ve launched a number of products and are actually seeing very early success. I will tell you we\u2019re already seeing success. If you look at our line and the earning release today, we\u2019ve had a $2 billion of inflows and alternatives, as an example, and that has actually come through what we traditionally called retail channels.","The new products we\u2019ve launched have been everything from long, short funds for the Newton and The Boston Company to multimanager and liquid our strategies that are managed by EACM, which is our fund of hedge fund investment firm and also launched a, we\u2019ll use the term smart data product as well. So it\u2019s getting us the ability to reach more clients with more products and again it\u2019s benefiting from the great position we already have in those channels. The Dreyfus brand, I think, will grow with our expansion here and any changes around branding \u2013 those are certain things we talked about. Gerald, if you want to comment.","Gerald L. Hassell","","Yes, I guess I have one more comment, Luke, and that is we\u2019re not totally relying on the Dreyfus brand and so the other boutique brands, which have strong names in their own right, are being put on the various channels and various platforms around the world. And so, pick a name; a Newton, a Walter Scott, The Boston company, Standish, all have branding name recognition in their category space and placing those more aggressively on third-party platform is part of the goal here and I think they have good names in order group of assets.","Luke Montgomery \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And maybe the last one on this question is, we actually have a BNY Mellon fund family outside the U.S. It\u2019s quite large and actually inside the U.S., it\u2019s about $80 billion north of assets. It\u2019s been primarily used as the way that our wealth management business has managed mutual funds. So trying to assess that, long-term assets is about $66 billion. The Wealth Management in the U.S. being Mellon family is slight around $80 billion and there\u2019s north of $70 billion outside the U.S.","So being Mellon brand globally actually is in pretty good condition. And then I would also tell you one of the places that we are very excited about is the ability to connect with our brethren in the Pershing organization who are reaching the RIA and the independent broker\/dealer network. That\u2019s substantially more clients and it\u2019s actually a very difficult \u2013 quite challenge to reach unless you have the ability to partner with our firm with Pershing and call list they have with those clients.","So a lot of opportunity here, we\u2019re excited about it, it will obviously take sometime. We\u2019ve been making investment center. We went a little over a year ago actually we had our board and management team here and approve this investment and we\u2019re excited about progress we\u2019re making already, the teams working very hard in coming together. you may have seen we made senior hire recently, and those people are very important to helping build the brand that we\u2019ll market.","Luke Montgomery \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Very helpful, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken M. Usdin \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Hi, thanks. Good morning.","Gerald L. Hassell","Good morning ken.","Ken M. Usdin \u2013 Jefferies LLC","I was wondering or I\u2019m sorry, just for anyone is most relevant. The new business wins on the custody study side, it\u2019s kind of been running at sub 200 for a couple of quarters. Now, just wondering because it\u2019s flavor for the business pipeline on the asset servicing side, whether it\u2019s a market effect or whether it is changes to the marketplace and how you are pipelines working?","Gerald L. Hassell","Tim, why don\u2019t you take that.","Timothy F. Keaney","Sure. Hi, Ken, Tim Keaney. We look at it Ken, both on an asset basis and revenue. I\u2019d say it\u2019s actually been pretty consistent particularly on the revenue side for the last six quarters we saw. And I think it\u2019s reflecting something we\u2019ve talked about on the last few quarterly calls and we\u2019ll shift in non-AUC\/A types of business things like our transfer agency business or sub transfer agency or subaccoutning business and middle office outsourcing, which now is about a third of our pipeline and has been consistently slow now for the last several quarters as insurance companies and asset managers looked outsource.","So, I wouldn\u2019t be overly concerned about that sub 200 number, I feel pretty good about the consistency of the revenue and it\u2019s sign of the mix. And the overall point on the sales pipeline it\u2019s about $2 trillion state tax been not quite a high water mark, but a very, very strong pipeline both in asset servicing and I would also Brian Shea say in Pershing.","Ken M. Usdin \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Okay. Secondly, just Todd, to your points on the NII front, I\u2019m just wondering you saw a decent decline in your earning asset yields, and I hear your points about keeping duration short. But, can you just talk to us how you\u2019re balancing the rate environment with the longer-term asset sensitivity and where you\u2019re kind of new investments are versus your rolling-off rate?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes. We\u2019re probably going to achieve a little more in the loan book. So that\u2019s one of things that you see pick up. As we\u2019ve seen a little bit of the decline in cash at central banks as well as Interbank placements. So that\u2019s rolling into the secured loan book that we talked about and it offset some of the slight spread tightening that we\u2019ve seen just from, generally from narrower spread.","We are taking a hard look at the investment securities book now and given the new regulations that are meant to go into effect next year; we will probably need to reposition that book a bit. And there are certain types of asset that will become more attractive to us such as commercial mortgage-backed securities, we\u2019ll probably hold a little less of certain high quality asset-backed securities. We have to think about what we might want to do with communities for example because of how they get treated?","Today, we\u2019ve actually build up a bit of a short-term treasury portfolio as well. Just to be defensive in case interest rates ever actually went south or the interest on accessories go south in the short-term. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen, but it\u2019s the defensive position with very little risk. So we actually came in the middle of analyzing exactly what we were ultimately going to look like.","Ken M. Usdin \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Okay and did some tough driver answer today, but is that something that we\u2019ll hear about you think in a quarter or two or is that something that will evolve over the next year or so and how do we get the sense of what the net effect of that all might be from an income statement perspective.","Gerald L. Hassell","Right now, we are thinking it\u2019s probably neutral. So I will give you that much guidance but we\u2019ll give, this is one of the reasons that we targeted the late fall holding Investors Conference to give clarity around this, also around the capital implications, the balance sheet and so forth and some of our other strategies. So it fits pretty neatly into that timing.","Ken M. Usdin \u2013 Jefferies LLC","","Okay. And then just last two quick clean-ups together. Do you have the accretion number this quarter and also was there anything notable in the nice reduction you saw in other expense?","Gerald L. Hassell","The accretion and there are really two things that are helping us, they are actually negatively impacting the net interest margin; one is the accretion and both on year-over-year and sequential basis it\u2019s about $5 million, and the other is the amortization of the premium. And on year-over-year basis there was about $11 million so that's about $16 million impact, a little less than sequentially. And so that's what\u2019s driving some of that number, I don\u2019t expect that to change too much, so accretion should be kind of in that ballpark as we see these securities just continue the kind of burn off over time.","Nothing particular notable in the other side, we did have a litigation recovery or release from our provision of about $12 million and so that\u2019s one of the beneficiaries there, other than that everything is pretty well controlled in the other category.","Ken M. Usdin \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Okay great. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Cynthia Mayer with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Cynthia Nevins Mayer \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, thanks a lot. So a question on the Corporate Trust you mentioned the run-off the higher margin securitization over the next 12 to 18 months, and I was wondering if you can give us a sense of the magnitude of the revenues associated with that, and I saw for instance that your services were down about $8 million sequentially. Is that typical of the kind of step down, we could expect, or do you expect it to occur evenly, any color will be great.","Gerald L. Hassell","Todd?","Thomas P. Gibbons"," ","Cynthia what we\u2019ve in terms of fee revenue, what we\u2019ve explained or we\u2019ve disclosed is that we expect about a half of 1% of our total revenue to step down as a kind of the net run-off impact. So somewhere in the vicinity of $50 million to $75 million a year and within issuer services there are really two businesses now, there is depository receipts and there is Corporate Trust, and it\u2019s depository receipts actually did a little bit better and Corporate Trust is the difference so pretty consistent with the guidance that we\u2019ve previously given.","Cynthia Nevins Mayer \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, so you expect that to basically to bottom out after 18 months and then be steady?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, there is a lot of these securitizations were in the ballpark of 10 years or so and so a lot of them were constructed back in 2006 and 2007, so we\u2019ll get to that end point, and I think the other thing to note is there is not a lot of reduction in expenses that comes, but you still have to do the same service and even though it\u2019s just on a small base.","Gerald L. Hassell","And I will point out, we are getting more than our fair share of the new issuance market and we are seeing some CLO pickup activity in the CLO space, where bid encouraged that the housing market will see some recovering securities coming ahead of that. So I think we are bit more optimistic about seeing some new business come on to hopefully shorten that timeframe but it really depends on the markets recovering and new securities being issued.","So the proposals that are currently coming out of the senate are looking for a private solution at least in terms of the securitization market which will present opportunities for us in our corporate trust functions, again that \u2013 those and that\u2019s going to actually be passed, but it\u2019s at least going to see some indication of what the future might look like.","Cynthia Nevins Mayer \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay and then just a small one on set landing, I know you are planning a big business, but look like the market value of securities on loan was up quite a bit, sequentially what\u2019s behind that and how do you see that business. Is it ever going to recuperate the past levels do you think?","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes, Cynthia. There was a very nice pick up, in securities that on loan picked up during the quarter and we are taking some action on our own parts to put some securities out in the marketplace and satisfy client demand. So, and we are optimistic we\u2019ll see that the rate of growth will continue to improve. Spreads are very low, but the volumes are up. So we\u2019ll take it.","Cynthia Nevins Mayer \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. The next question is from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott \u2013 Autonomous Research","Hello there. A quick question on the asset from the cost of the growth which seems to be lacking some of the peers groups. So I guess the question If I to have is, if your customers are very satisfied you mentioned the Global Custody survey where you came out well, why isn\u2019t that translating into stronger growth in asset under custody and do you want to change that?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Well two things, I think we are pretty much inline with most of our peers, quarter-to-quarter it\u2019s also a bit episodic, you can have some lumpy, you know new business come in and then converts. So that\u2019s another issue. We are also trying to be somewhat price disciplined in certain client categories. And so we are trying not to chase the lowest price and we repeat the business and so we are trying to do impose some discipline on ourselves in the marketplace. We feel recently good about the growth in the asset under custody in the mix of business that we have.","Geoffrey Elliott \u2013 Autonomous Research","And you mentioned the need for price discipline and not chasing every piece of business. What are the areas where you think competition is particularly in terms of the movement?","Gerald L. Hassell","Tim, why don\u2019t you take that one?","Timothy F. Keaney","Sure. Hey, Ken, Tim Keaney. As we\u2019ve set as a consistent team now. We do have pricing power in smaller and I would say middle market clients w here we have been very consistently reprising in the asset servicing business and continued to do so with pretty high retention rates. It\u2019s the exact opposite with the minority of your largest clients where there is things happening there. They are being really tough on I would core custody, but I would say on the flip side they are very open to doing more business with fewer providers and it\u2019s much more about share wallet and gaining share wallet which is why I think Gerald, referenced a referenced a cup of key points that I hope weren't overlooked, the progress that we are making on the investments we\u2019ve made on building out our collateral capabilities and continuing to invest in our electronic platforms in foreign exchange.","Those are paying off. So it\u2019s about doing more with the largest clients but it is still very tough price competition at the high end of the market.","Geoffrey Elliott \u2013 Autonomous Research","","Thanks.","","Operator","","Thank you. The next question is from Robert Lee with KBW.","","Robert Lee \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","Gerald L. Hassell","Good morning.","Robert Lee \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","","Question really focusing on asset servicing and understanding that your underlying mix is, I believe, skewed towards fixed income and cash. So you don\u2019t necessarily get the full benefit of the market lift. But now we\u2019ve had a, I guess, pretty strong past year kind of at least equity market tailwinds. It does seem like business activity has been reasonably active and I think the 4% year-over-year growth excluding sec lending. So what does it take really to get that business kind of to a faster growth rate or high single-digits? Is it just structurally just even with some good tailwinds that structurally it\u2019s really just kind of in this low single-digit growth business or is there something else that we\u2019re not seeing that you think is really weighing on that particular revenue line?","Timothy F. Keaney","","Robert, Tim Keaney again. I think if you pull out securities lending, which is probably the more helpful way to look at it, you\u2019d see fees in asset servicing up 5% year-on-year and 2% sequentially, very closely aligned with sort of AUC growth. But I think what\u2019s changing in the market is a shift towards financial institutions. We don\u2019t see a lot of defined benefit pension plan or central bank business moving and that\u2019s a good thing, because we have a big market share there, but they are very slow growers.","What\u2019s really been growing the asset servicing business is financial institution. So mutual funds, banks, brokers and hedge funds and I think that really plays to our strengths, because we\u2019ve been investing in our outsourcing capabilities.","Bridgewater is I think a great example of where we\u2019ve been making some big investments. I mentioned Collateral and FX and I think that\u2019s where the opportunity for us is going to turn as we focus on bundled players that are winners in the consolidating industries that they compete in.","When our clients grow, we grow, but it also means we need to continue to invest in the products and services that our clients need. And those areas are ones that we really believe are going to continue to drive our growth. And I would also say there is a space that we have a unique position and that we don\u2019t see a lot of our traditional trust bank competitors and that\u2019s where private banks and other financial advisors are getting out of self-clearing and they are looking at Pershing and the platforms that we\u2019ve been investing in there.","That, we believe, over the next year or two is going to be another really bright spot for us. So I guess those two or three things that will be real catalyst for us. And maintaining strong price discipline.","Robert Lee \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. And maybe just, I know it\u2019s both a question and a suggestion maybe. You talked about new business wins and you did mention that you\u2019re seeing a lot of business not coming \u2013 revenue streams that are tied to AUC or administrative assets, but possibly get a sense for what the revenue impact is on your new business wins if you have $160 billion of active wins. Should we be thinking enough? Though it\u2019s hard to translate that into what it really means. Is that $5 million of revenue, $25 million of revenue? So I guess it\u2019s a question or suggestion, it would be great to get some of those kind of metrics in the quarter and kind of the revenue impact of net new business?","Gerald L. Hassell","","I think Robert, it\u2019s just a point. I\u2019m nodding at Todd here. It\u2019s really hard to answer that question with any specificity because of the business mix and I just will go back and say that question that was asked earlier. Am I worried at all about the sub-$200 million of AUC\/A wins, I\u2019m not we\u2019ve been looking at and quantify what we see the value of the business be in each quarter. And it\u2019s been pretty darn consistent with the last six quarters or so, I don\u2019t know.","Thomas P. Gibbons","","Yes, I think I just add the fact that our revenues in asset servicing is closely related to the growth rate than AUC, whether it\u2019s market driven or new business win, I think it\u2019s keeping that correlation pretty tight.","","Robert Lee \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","All right, well, thank you for taking my question.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Welcome.","Operator","","Thank you. The next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","Good morning.","Gerald L. Hassell","Good morning.","","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","Just on the SLR here, a lot of encouraging moments here this quarter. I was just hoping just mechanically may be you could break down the improvement in the SLR to the different components in how much was retained earnings versus daily average balance on the asset side and such. And also give a reminder or some sort of sense Basel kind of what you intend to run rate above the 5% requirement, I hope.","Gerald L. Hassell","Okay, sure Brennan. In terms of the break down between capital generation and what I\u2019ll call is the change in the denominator, it\u2019s about half in capital generation and half the change in the denominator. And so the change in the denominator where really two things as the U.S. is moving towards these Basel adoption of the denominator definitions. What is unfunded commitments get treated using the credit conversion factor that was established under Basel I that was worth about a $20 billion reduction in assets that we have to otherwise have put into our denominator.","And then the rest of it was the change from going from an average calculation of the balance sheet to a month end calculation, so the average of three month ends. So, typically we would see balance sheets grow especially a quarter end so a little bit. And you can see our spot balance sheet versus our average balance sheet is almost always higher. That was probably worth about $12 billion or $15 billion in assets, so the combination of the two which is just about\u2026","Thomas P. Gibbons","","On the Basel part of your question given how much cash we have at central bank, we don\u2019t expect to run much in the way of Basel.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Okay that makes sense. And then on the money market fund business, can you may be give us the sense of the size of the institutional money market business if you have in the U.S. and how much of that is institutional account that institutional book breaks down in between prime versus treasury and other.","Gerald L. Hassell","Well, virtually all of the money market business is U.S., we really don\u2019t have much in the way of outside the U.S. money market funds. Most of it is sourced through almost 50% of our money market funds come from our cash with servicing encouraging platforms less than one of the positive synergy, is not worth this much right now. But it is one of positive synergies kind of being associated with large asset servicing book of business. So a lot of the deposits in the money market funds are sourced from internal clients or encouraging platform. That\u2019s the way to think about it so it\u2019s really a U.S. based business.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Back to the split between treasury and client I don\u2019t have a stuff in my head, Gerald.","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes it moves rapid, and we have a \u2013 so let me give you some general answer. So it\u2019s we have a much larger institutional in retail money market business, and a much larger treasury then client compared to many others. Again the numbers you\u2019re rounding, it\u2019s a pretty meaningful treasury business.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Okay. So, if we think about where the market is in those various break down. You guys probably \u2013 with its skew more to the treasury side than the product market business.","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes. Exactly right. And so that\u2019s why you see everything is obviously, with treasury rates at zero\u2026","Thomas P. Gibbons","","More yields.","Gerald L. Hassell","","Yes, exactly.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Sure, sure. Thanks, thanks for the color.","Gerald L. Hassell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse","Ashley N. Serrao \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","","Good morning. On collateral management, you touched a little bit about the investment you\u2019re making build out the business, but how should we think about the longer-term opportunity for you there? So any color on how much money you\u2019re making from the business today and how the competitive landscape is evolving would be appreciated?","Gerald L. Hassell","Okay. We\u2019ve been making investments over the last year, year and a half in that stage. It\u2019s starting to show up in the investment services achieve, it\u2019s one of the contributors to the growth there. We don\u2019t break it out individually. Right now, we\u2019re seeing more in the segregation category, I being the custodian for the segregated assets around collateral services. At some point, we little start to move into the higher value transformational aspects of collateral services. Doing some secured financing is also been a contributor to the collateral services.","We do see that\u2019s evolving, it\u2019s evolved more slowly than we would have expected as the new laws in regulations are kicking in. We expect this to pick up over the course of time and it\u2019s a global phenomena I might add. So we see opportunities to do this in all parts of the world.","Ashley N. Serrao \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","","Great. Thanks for the color there. And on the SLR, it could progress this quarter, but as the rule hopefully enters the final inning. What impact do you think the rule as it stands today has on business decisions for you and more probably the industry? And then, just broader update on the global regulatory landscape laws, we appreciate it.","Thomas P. Gibbons","I\u2019ll deal with the SLR question maybe Gerald, you can handle the broader question on the regulatory landscape.","In terms of \u2013 for I think everybody in the industry and certainly the big institutions. They can be more balance sheet sensitive. So use of the balance sheet is going to come to play with a higher cost. So that, as we look at any of our businesses, the balance sheet intensive businesses, they are going to come under tighter scrutiny, and can we make the returns, and how do we squeeze the returns out of them. Part of the reason that we frankly we like the investment management business because there is no balance sheet things that comes with that. So I think that is a question that we \u2013 that all large financial institutions are dealing with right now. Gerald, I don\u2019t know, if you want to comment on the regulatory.","Gerald L. Hassell","Well. The regulatory fronts and I guess the thing that\u2019s challenging for all of us is, the lack of harmonization across the regulatory environment with Basel adopts the U.S. has a different standard, U.K. has different standard, the ECB has a different standard. It\u2019s particularly challenging to all of us to determine what's the right mix of businesses and use of balance sheet or not, with these changing environment.","We\u2019re starting to get a little more clarity around it. And it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re certainly very focused as the company around making sure our business model performs well in the new environment, other firms are going to the same decision making process. I think as Todd pointed out anything that\u2019s balance sheet intensive is either to shrink or get priced up. And I think that\u2019s one of the things the regulators are looking for, is to make sure risk is peripherally placed in the marketplace or stop doing the activity and so I think that\u2019s going to be some of the changes you see more broadly across the industry.","","Ashley N. Serrao \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Great, thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Rob Rutschow with CLSA.","Rob C. Rutschow \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC","Hi, good morning, thanks for taking my question. The first question is on expenses, you had close to a 10% decline in the employee benefit expenses sequentially. And if I\u2019m reading the numbers right, you also eliminated and some liability for capital purposes so, with the sequential change just through to a change in assumptions or is there something else you\u2019re doing there that allows you to produce those things and expenses.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Rob, the reduction in the pension expense is the combination of the \u2013 there is nothing unusual there. The plan has been to define benefit plan, it\u2019s largely driven by I should say by the define benefit plan. The defined benefit plan was frozen two dimensions quite a few years ago. And the year-over-year changes first time that we actually saw interest rates go up quite a few years as the discount factor on the liability. That in combination with the very strong underlying performance with the assets the seasonal fund. Even though we reduce what we estimate our go forward returns in R&D. That reduced our pension expense we estimated by about, it should be by about $100 million this year. So $25 million or quarters so that\u2019s marginally the driver of what\u2019s you are seeing on the benefit side.","Rob C. Rutschow \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. The follow-up question would be on the, I don\u2019t know if you guys have provided this or we can \u2013 what would be your total regulatory expense, and is there any way to segment that between servicing investment management. Thank you.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, we have not disclosed a specific number except for the cost of actually compliant with Tri-Party Reforms, where we have seen our expenses in that particular unit run rate go up, it\u2019s not exclusively related to Tri-Party Reform but most of it is by over $70 million. There is very limited impact in the investment management space around regulatory, it\u2019s almost all investment services related.","","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from\u2026","Gerald L. Hassell","","Wendy, we have time for one more question.","Operator","","The final question is from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim F. Mitchell \u2013 The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hi, good morning. Maybe I could just ask about the TR business, and it looks like M&A is picking up cross border IPO activity seems to be picking up. Can you discuss that the pipeline, I guess and relative to the similar week results this quarter is just a little too early to tell. How do you think of that going forward?","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes, let me start just by referring to this quarter, Jim it actually wasn\u2019t a bad quarter. We saw some decent corporate actions and revenues weren\u2019t too bad. So when you look at the issue with services downward, that\u2019s masked by the weaker performance in Corporate Trust that we discussed.","Jim F. Mitchell \u2013 The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","It\u2019s sponsored programs I guess for now, this quarter.","Thomas P. Gibbons","","Some of the sponsored programs are down mainly because of our own choice. We're just being again more disciplined - the category being more disciplined around the pricing of working with different programs where our market share is still holding in roughly 60% category. So you're just seeing a slight decline in number of programs. It's not a big deal and it's really that we've been proactively managing it.","Jim F. Mitchell \u2013 The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","","And in terms of the outlook.","Gerald L. Hassell","The outlook, as M&A activity picks up and as IPOs pick up around the world, this is an area of the benefit and it\u2019s mostly an emerging markets business. And so, as you\u2019re seeing activity in that space DRs will clearly benefit from it. Corporate actions and M&A are the big revenue drivers for this business. That necessarily with day-to-day trading, although that\u2019s the foundation of it, all those things that you mentioned really turbo-charged the revenues in that business. So we\u2019re optimistic as you are.","Jim F. Mitchell \u2013 The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay, great. And then on the \u2013 quick follow-up on the capital ratio. I noticed that your Tier 1 common on the standardized approach rose, I assume with retained earnings, but the advanced approach declined by 30 basis points. Is that simply higher operational risk assumptions or is anything else in there?","Thomas P. Gibbons","","No, that\u2019s largely driven by some of the parameter changes as we got ready to come out of the parallel run. There were some parameter changes around some of our risk-related assets that drove that change.","Jim F. Mitchell \u2013 The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. All right, thanks.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Great. Thank you.","Gerald L. Hassell","Well, thank you very much everyone.

Ms. Haertel, you may begin.","Valerie Haertel","Thank you, Anna and good morning everyone. Welcome to the BNY Mellon third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With us today are Gerald Hassell, our Chairman and CEO, Todd Gibbons, our CFO, as well as members of our executive management team.","Our third quarter earnings materials include a financial highlights presentation that will be referred to in the discussion of our results and can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. Before Gerald and Todd begin, let me take a moment to remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release, the financial highlights presentation and those identified in our documents filed with the SEC that are available on our website at bnymellon.com. Forward-looking statements in this call speak only as of today, October 20, 2015 and we will not update the forward-looking statements.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Gerald Hassell. Gerald?","Gerald Hassell","Thanks, Valerie. Welcome, everyone and thank you for joining us this morning. Our results demonstrate our focus on delivering significant value for our clients and shareholders in all market environments. Given the global market instability and continued low interest rates, it has been an exceedingly challenging revenue environment. So, we remain laser focused on the key priorities we discussed with you at our Investor Day a year ago. We are executing our strategic plan, which is enabling us to deliver solid results in line with our 3-year financial goals. For the quarter, we again controlled our expenses, while continuing to make strategic investments to enhance client service delivery as well as improving our technology platforms and capabilities to drive future revenue growth. In addition, we are making ongoing investments in risk management and regulatory compliance practices.","So, turning to earnings, earnings per share were $0.74, up 16% on an adjusted basis, which excludes the third quarter 2014 sale of our equity investment in Wing Hang Bank and our 1 Wall Street headquarters. It\u2019s also net of litigation and restructuring charges. Now, focusing on the year-over-year comparisons on an adjusted basis, we generated more than 370 basis points of positive operating leverage and improved our pre-tax operating margin to 31%. Total revenue was up 1% as growth in Investment Services, including contributions from our volume and volatility sensitive businesses, was largely offset by softness in investment management, which was negatively impacted by the strong dollar as well as declines in equity market values globally. Net interest revenue was up 5% and total expenses were down 3% and our return on tangible common equity in the quarter was 21%.","So, looking at our progress against our strategic priorities, our first priority is driving profitable revenue growth. We are working to deepen our client relationships and grow revenues, but we are also maintaining our pricing discipline when competing in the marketplace. Now, during the quarter, revenue in Investment Services again benefited from growth in Global Collateral Services and Asset Servicing. We also on-boarded nearly 230 new staff during the quarter in association with the mid office services of T. Rowe Price that we are taking on. This strategic relationship further endorses the market demand for our expertise and platform capabilities.","Foreign exchange revenue was also up strongly year-over-year as we continue to benefit from both higher volumes captured through the expansion of our services and higher volatility. Investment management revenue reflected the reset in the equity markets and the impact of the strong dollar. That said the diversity of our investment management business, combined with our growth initiatives in business improvement efforts, helped mitigate the market impact on our financial results. On a constant currency basis, investment management fees were flat year-over-year. Our LDI strategies continue to see strong inflows reflecting continued client demand.","And we also saw some good momentum in fixed income and our alternative strategy. Our initiatives to align our investment management portfolio to the largest growth pools are delivering results. Our U.S. retail initiative, which is focused on third-party intermediary advisors and expanding the Dreyfus distribution platform is contributing to our results. As is our wealth management sales force expansion which has built a strong pipeline and is benefiting from the growing synergies with our Pershing business. Our second priority is executing on our business improvement process that leverage our scale and expertise to deliver efficiency benefits to clients, while reducing our structural costs. Our success on this approach is reflected not only in lower expenses in nearly all categories, but in our industry leading market positions across all of our businesses.","Now, some highlights of our business improvement program include the sale of Meriten, our German-based boutique, where we had a marginally profitable business and identified the opportunity to better redeploy our capital. That closed in the third quarter. We have realigned our UK transfer agency operating model to improve its profitability. We have created a new client pricing strategy group to develop, analyze and measure service delivery costs to better align our cost with our client pricing. We have implemented an automated process to measure market data usage to identify opportunities to reduce the number of pricing feeds and terminals. And we have created what we call MyDashboard, which improves employee productivity as part of our digitization strategy. And MyDashboard provides our managers with a convenient snapshot of key data on their employees such as expenses, performance measurement status, training and other key metrics. The capability was recently named best new digital project for financial services as part of the Gartner Financial Services Cool Business Awards.","And we have also been analyzing our current real estate portfolio to reduce cost. And we are selecting locations and workplace standards that enable collaboration and innovation. During the quarter, we completed our exit from 1 Wall Street ahead of schedule and we now occupy our new, more cost efficient headquarters at 225 Liberty Street and we are taking a very similar approach across many of our locations globally, which will help reduce our real estate footprint.","Given the more difficult-than-expected equity markets, it will be critical for us to keep driving efficiencies to meet our Investor Day goals. To that end, we continue to identify additional opportunities to reduce corporate overheads and to leverage scale and operations, technology and distribution in both Investment Services and investment management while continuing to deliver a high level of service to our clients. Many of our efforts are singles and doubles, but they have been adding up, helping us fund some of our revenue growth initiatives and increasing regulatory compliance costs.","Our third priority centers on being a strong, safe, trusted counterparty. We continue to have among the highest credit ratings in the industry. This quarter, our credit ratings were affirmed by the rating agencies, including our A1 rating from Moody\u2019s. Now, during the quarter, we implemented a new system to meet the bulk of reporting requirements and completed a program to measure and monitor intraday credit risk exposure. We also established a more granular and rigorous CCAR approach that strengthens our capital adequacy process. Our business improvement process has helped us fund some of these investments.","Our fourth priority involves generating excess capital and deploying it effectively. We remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and capital and liquidity position. With respect to our capital ratio, we are pleased to report progress towards achieving compliance with the supplementary leverage ratio which increased to 4.8% this quarter.","Now, as a reminder, SLR is expected to be effective, it\u2019s the beginning of 2018 and we are on a good path to meet the requirement by then. Now, in accordance with our 2015 capital plan, which authorized us to return up to $3.1 billion to our shareholders, we repurchased 690 million in shares and distributed $190 million in dividends during the quarter. Year-to-date, we have repurchased more than 1.9 billion in shares and distributed nearly $575 million in dividends. Our fifth priority is to attract, develop and retain top talent. Across our organization, we have been enhancing our talent strategies and culture to ensure we have the right people in the right jobs. Great talent enhances our ability to win. This quarter, we named a new President of our markets group, Michelle Neal, who starts next month. She exemplifies the kind of talent we have been attracting and developing in our organization. Michelle has a special combination of experience in electronic trading and settlement and she is well equipped to continue to drive the markets group\u2019s strong performance. And we are very pleased to welcome her to our team.","Now as we look ahead, we remain confident in our ability to achieve the 3-year financial targets we shared with you on Investor Day a year ago. With that, let me turn it over to Todd.","Todd Gibbons","Thanks Gerald and good morning everyone. My commentary will follow the financial highlights document starting with Page 7, which details our non-GAAP or what we call our operating results for the quarter. As Gerald noted, EPS was $0.74, that\u2019s up 16% year-over-year on an adjusted basis. Now adjusted, it excludes the sale of our equity investment in Wing Hang and the sale of 1 Wall Street and is also net of litigation and restructuring charges. Revenue in the third quarter was up 1% year-over-year reflecting strength in asset servicing, especially global collateral services as well as in clearing, foreign exchange and financing related activities. It was offset by the impact of the stronger dollar and lower equity markets, especially on our investment management business. Expenses were down 3% year-over-year. Our success in lowering legal and consulting expenses and in bringing savings from our Business Improvement Process as well as the stronger dollar are driving lower expenses in almost every category. Combination of our revenue mix and ability to control expenses through the business improvement process resulted in more than 370 basis points of positive operating leverage year-over-year.","On Page 6 of our earnings release, you can see the key currencies that impacts our business, the strength of the U.S. dollar against the pound and the euro, which were down 7% and 17% respectively, continue to impact investment management more than our other businesses, since 42% of the revenue is from outside the U.S. As we have noted in prior quarters, the overall company impact from currency translation is nominal. Adjusted for the stronger U.S. dollar, revenue would have been up approximately 4% and expenses up approximately 1%. Income before taxes was 8% year-over-year on an adjusted basis and is up 10.5% if you exclude the provision for credit losses. On a year-over-year basis, our pretax margin increased approximately 200 basis points to 31% in the third quarter of 2015. And finally, return on tangible common equity was 21%.","Page 8 shows our consolidated fee and other revenue. Asset servicing fees were up 3% year-over-year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects organic growth in global collateral services, our broker dealer activities and asset servicing and net new business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. Sequentially, organic growth and net new business was offset by the typical seasonal step down in securities lending revenue as well as lower market values. Clearing services fees were up 2% year-over-year, down 1% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher mutual fund and asset based fees. Issuer services fees were down 1% year-over-year and up 34% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower fees in depositary receipts and the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar in Corporate Trust, now is partially offset by net new business in Corporate Trust. The sequential increase primarily reflects seasonal higher fees and depositary receipts versus the second quarter. Treasury service fees were down 4% year-over-year and 5% sequentially, both decreases reflect lower payment volumes as we continue to be highly selective exiting client relationships that don\u2019t meet our risk criteria.","Third quarter investment management and performance fees were down 6% year-over-year and sequentially. On a constant currency basis, investment management and performance fees were down 2% primarily driven by lower performance fees, lower equity market values and net outflows, partially offset by the impact of the first quarter Cutwater acquisition and strategic initiatives. The sequential decline primarily reflects lower equity market values, net outflows and seasonally lower performance fees. Both decreases also reflect the sale of Meriten Investment Management in July. Performance fees were $7 million compared to $22 million a year ago. FX and other trading revenue on a consolidated basis was up 17% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. FX revenue of $180 million was up 17% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher volatility and volumes.","Financing related fees were $71 million compared to $44 million in the year ago quarter and $58 million in Q2. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher fees related to secured intraday credit provided to dealers in connection with their tri-party repo activity. As we noted last quarter, some of our clients may moderate their usage or possibly find alternatives of sources with this financing. Importantly, both increases also reflect higher underwriting fees. Investment and other income of $59 million compared with $890 million in the year ago quarter and $104 million in the second quarter. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the gains on the sales of our equity investment in Wing Hang and the 1 Wall Street building. Those are both recorded in the third quarter of \u201814. There is also a $17 million loss on seed capital investments that\u2019s recorded in consolidated investment management funds versus the $16 million gain last year that is not reflected in these numbers given the required separate gross presentation for consolidated funds. The sequential decrease in investment and other income primarily reflects lower leasing gains and the loss associated with the sale of Meriten Investment Management.","Page 9 shows the drivers of our investment management business that help explain our underlying performance. You can see AUM was $1.63 trillion, unchanged from last year. Note that assets under management for the current and prior periods have been restated to exclude Meriten. We had $5 billion of long-term net outflows during the quarter. Those were primarily in index strategies, active equities and fixed income offset by continued strength in LDI where we retain a leadership position. Our wealth management business expansion initiative is helping to drive an increase in loans and deposits. Year-over-year, we saw a 19% increase in loans and 11% increase in deposits.","Turning to the investment services metrics on Page 10, you can see that assets under custody and administration at quarter end were $28.5 trillion. That\u2019s up $200 billion year-over-year reflecting net new business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the stronger dollar and the lower equity market values. Adjusted for currency, year-over-year growth would have been roughly 3%. Linked quarter, AUC\/A was essentially flat. We had estimated new \u2013 total new assets under custody and\/or administration business wins of $84 billion in the third quarter. Now, while this is relatively low, it\u2019s mainly due to the timing of new business wins this year. In the second quarter, we announced the significant new strategic relationship, which resulted in an upside win for that quarter. We continue to see strong demand for our services and we have a solid pipeline of opportunities. It is important to note that this quarter we changed our methodology for reporting our estimated new business wins. Moving from reporting based on the day the mandate was granted to the date that it was actually contracted. Although it\u2019s not a significant, we have restated our historical new business wins beginning in 2014 through this quarter for better comparative purposes. Additionally, year-to-date new business wins totaled $1.42 trillion, so we are still trending above our historical average.","Now to \u2013 turning to a review of other metrics, the market value of securities on loan at year end again was up year-over-year increasing by 2%. Average loans and deposits continue the strong year-over-year growth trend. Our broker-dealer metric of average tri-party repo balances grew 4%. All of our clearing metrics were up with global DARTS volumes up 18%. The net decline in sponsored DR programs primarily reflects our continued focus on exiting low activity programs.","Turning to net interest revenue on Page 11, you will see that NIR on a fully taxable equivalent basis was up 5% versus the year ago quarter and down 3% from Q2. The overall balance sheet was stable this quarter. We benefited year-over-year from higher average deposits and a better asset mix. The yield on interest earning assets increased 3 basis points year-over-year and the yield on interest bearing deposits decreased 4 basis points. The decline in deposit yield was driven by our efforts to charge for deposits in non-U.S. locations to cover our cost, where negative interest rates exist. Sequentially, NIR was lower reflecting lower average securities and the impact of interest rate hedging activities. The net interest margin for the quarter was 98 basis points, 4 basis points higher than the year ago quarter and 2 basis points lower than the prior year and in line with our expectations and remained in the range of 95 to 100 basis points as we noted on our Investor Day last year. The year-over-year increase reflects the shift out of cash and into investments in securities and loans. The benefit of which was mainly realized in the second quarter.","Turning to Page 12, you will see that non-interest expense on an adjusted basis declined 3% year-over-year and was flat sequentially. The year-over-year decrease in non-interest expense reflects lower expenses on all categories, except other expense. Other expense includes concessions we gave to clients impacted by the system \u2013 the SunGard systems outage to cover out-of-pocket and other incidental expenses they incurred. Lower expenses compared to a year ago reflect the favorable impact of a stronger dollar, lower legal and consulting expenses and the benefit of our business improvement process. The third quarter decrease was partially offset by higher consulting expenses associated with regulatory requirements.","Total staff expense declined 3% year-over-year reflecting the favorable impact of a stronger dollar, the impact of curtailing our U.S. defined benefit plan and lower incentive expense partially offset by our annual employee merit increase effective on July 1 and higher severance expense. The sequential increase in headcount of 600 employees primarily reflects the on-boarding of staff related to two strategic relationships as well as our continued in-sourcing of technology talent to both reduce cost and retain institutional knowledge in-house. Sequentially, the annual employee merit increase and higher severance and other expenses were almost completely offset by lower incentive, business development and sub-custodian expenses.","Turning to capital on Page 13, our fully phased-in advanced approach common equity Tier 1 ratio decreased by 60 basis points to 9.3, that was driven by increases in risk-weighted assets primarily related to credit risk and operational risk. In addition, we are also no longer assuming use of a methodology that is subject to regulatory approval, which reduced the ratio by approximately 25 basis points. As Gerald noted, we made good progress on our supplemental leverage ratio and we are at 4.8% this quarter due to higher capital and a lower average balance sheet. While our ratio is now 20 basis points below the required 5% minimum, we do plan to maintain a cushion above that. As we have noted previously, this ratio was expected to be our binding constraint and we are confident that we will be in compliance when the regulation becomes effective. To the extent that excess deposits did not run off as we anticipate with an increase in rates, we have many levers to pull, including the issuance of additional preferred, if necessary, to achieve compliance.","Few final notes about the quarter. As you will see in our release, our effective tax rate was 25.4%. Also on Page 11 of the earnings release, you will see some investment security portfolio highlights. At quarter end, our net unrealized pre-tax gain in our portfolio was $1.05 billion. That compares to $752 million at the end of June, with the difference owing principally to a decline in interest rates.","Now, I would like to discuss a few points to factor into your thinking about the fourth quarter. We expect to see the typical seasonal decline in depositary receipt fees with the limited offset in expenses. We estimate the decline of the fourth quarter from the third quarter to be approximately $120 million in revenues. We expect to generate seasonally higher performance fees in our investment management business in the fourth quarter, approximately in line with last year. Net interest revenue is expected to be flat. We expect to see seasonally higher business development expenses. Additionally, we expect an increase in consulting expenses related to our investments in regulatory compliance initiatives.","I would also like to note that the fourth quarter of last year was when we began to see the U.S. dollar strengthened. So, you should keep that dynamic in mind as you model us. We expect total expenses to be relatively flat in the fourth quarter versus the year ago period, adjusted for litigation and lower for the full year 2015 as compared to the full year 2014. We continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 25%. I will also remind you that we are going to pay a dividend on the preferred that we issued in the second quarter. And finally, we continue to expect to execute on share buybacks in accordance with our planned authorization.","So in summary, we are executing on our strategic priorities and we are pleased with the progress we are making even with the relatively challenging market headwinds. We are continuing to generate significant positive operating leverage even while we invest in initiatives to drive further growth and absorb higher regulatory compliance cost. We are focusing on managing our balance sheet, generating capital and deploying it effectively to deliver value to our shareholders and we remain on track to achieve the 3-year targets we shared at Investor Day this time last year.","With that, let me hand it back to Gerald.","Gerald Hassell","Thanks, Todd. And operator, I think we are ready to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ashley Serrao from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Ashley Serrao","Good morning.","Gerald Hassell","Good morning.","Ashley Serrao","I was just curious, what portion of the $500 million in savings that you outlined at Investor Day have been achieved so far? And also what portion of that has been reinvested in the business? Ultimately, I am just trying to get a sense of the net savings that have dropped to your bottom line. And I may have misheard this, but it sounds like you have also identified incremental opportunities that you think would be additive. Any color there would be appreciated?","Todd Gibbons","Yes, Ashley, let me say that \u2013 this is Todd, let me just say, first of all, that the $500 million was a number that we put out last year and we have been working hard to add to that total figure and this is a continuous process improvement. These are structural changes and not one-time events. And we do continue to see increasing opportunities and the number continues to get bigger. In terms of how much is adding to the bottom line versus what\u2019s being reinvested into regulatory or other strategic platforms. I think the best way to look at that is to look at the increase in the operating margin. Some of that is that \u2013 the 377 basis points this quarter, some of that, on a year-over-year basis, some of that is related to the dollar, probably about 77 or so, so even on a constant currency basis were 300 basis points better. So that\u2019s what you are seeing dropped to the bottom line.","Ashley Serrao","Okay, thanks for the color there. And then I guess the other question was I noticed cash into bank placements ticked up sequentially for what looks like the first time in the year. I know you have proactively been trying to shift away from cash. So, I was curious how we should be interpreting the increase?","Todd Gibbons","Yes, I think if you look at the average period, it\u2019s probably a better way to look at it. You will see it\u2019s relatively flat and actually cash at the Central Banks is down a little bit. So, we do get spikes from time to time on quarter ends. In fact, the period ends have been spiking by about $15 billion or $20 billion, but you could guess get noise there, but general, cash at other banks should be flat and Central Bank deposits is going to be down on a year-over-year basis as we put more in loans as well as in securities.","Ashley Serrao","Okay, thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Alright, thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Ms. Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. And your line is open.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, thank you. Todd, I wondered if you could give us an update on how you are dealing with negative rates over in Europe, the degree to which deposit pricing strategy is done and why with an expectation to reduce deposits there?","Todd Gibbons","Yes, there is a slight decline, Betsy in deposits since we initiated that strategy, but not much. We did up the charge for some of those deposits in the third quarter, late in the third quarter. And I would say just seeing a modest decline, if any.","Betsy Graseck","And so as you think about the size of the balance sheet and this lower for longer rate environment, could you talk through thoughts on the SLR and whether or not that includes issuing incremental preferreds?","Todd Gibbons","Sure. So, we did get to 4.80 on the quarter. We do accumulate even at 100% payout ratio, we accumulate somewhere between $600 million and $800 million a year in incremental capital from the amortization of intangibles as well as equity that\u2019s issued for compensation plans. So if you take that into consideration that moves us up a bit over the next couple of years. We have also gone through \u2013 if we kind of look at our balance sheet through two lenses, one is in a zero rate environment and one is on normalizing rate environment that\u2019s reflected in the forward curve. In the normalizing rate environment, as you know we would expect quite a bit of deposits to run off and we could probably comply in the normal course with the SLR with a pretty decent cushion. If it stays in a zero rate environment, we have got a team working together with investment services in the treasury group. And we have prioritized all of our balance sheet consumption and where we might either look at interest rates going even negative on interest rates to discourage deposits or in other words pushing off other SLR related activities. And we would hold as a kind of a last resort if it makes sense economically to issue preferreds.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And I am sorry if I missed it, but have you given your bank SLR, I know you talked about the hold co level?","Todd Gibbons","Yes. The bank SLR is about 20 basis points below the hold co level right now.","Betsy Graseck","Alright. Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Luke Montgomery of Bernstein Research. Sir, your line is open.","Luke Montgomery","Thanks. Good morning, I would like to know what your thoughts are on the application of block chain technology to securities settlement in tri-party repo, I think you know that there is a number of start-ups out there that are looking at this. Do you think that technology would be more likely to disintermediate the settlement infrastructure, which would be maybe the central securities depositories or could it also be some of the services that global custodians like you provide. And then do you see any limitations in the technology or maybe vested interest that would prevent it from being adopted by this the securities markets and just how closely have you been examining it?","Gerald Hassell","That\u2019s a mouthful of questions. We are studying block chain technology quite intensely. It has some very, very positive attributes. Clearly, the whole idea of two sides showing up on a public ledger and being able to swap values instantaneously is very appealing. So we are looking at it and whether it can be deployed in some pilot programs we have internally. And therefore see how the technology can be used to improve our core operations, both on the clearance and settlement side. We have been trying to engineer our company for same day or real time settlement regardless. And so whether it\u2019s through block chain or through other means, it\u2019s something that we think about a whole lot. We do have some pilot programs going on in the payment space, I mean our treasury services area, where that\u2019s the area most impacted at the moment by third-party technology companies are going after the payments. Typically, it\u2019s the small payments, consumer payments, but anything that happens at the consumer level, we assume is going to happen at the institutional level. As it relates to clearance and tri-party directly, that is an extraordinarily complex operating platform with incredibly complex algorithms built into it. So, we are not na\u00efve to think that technology can\u2019t disrupt even that, but I think we feel pretty comfortable at the moment there. The last but not least, for a block chain to work, you need to have everybody on both sides, the buy side and the sell side, to show up simultaneously in volume to have it make sense. And so we are looking at some technologies on how it can be applied. So a lot of \u2013 there is a lot of room ahead of us before it\u2019s fully implemented but we are studying it very carefully.","Luke Montgomery","Okay. Thanks. That\u2019s really helpful. And then I was just hoping you could sketch out in a little more detail what you are attempting to achieve with Dreyfus and retail distributional, I think I recall one of the possible explanations for the low to mid-30% range operating margins in the asset management business, is that the retail platform is expensive but maybe not up to scale. So as you execute against that plan, do you expect to see operating margins in the asset management business improve?","Curtis Arledge","Yes, this is Curtis. Absolutely, what I would point you to is that while we are the sixth largest asset management in the world, in terms of U.S. mutual fund families, we are currently 37th. So we have all of the investment capabilities or a large majority of the investment capabilities in-house that is used by investors that use mutual funds, financial advisors and individuals, ultimately as the end users. But our platform to reach advisors is below where we think it should be or where it could be to really improve our distribution of our investment capabilities through that channel. It\u2019s very important to appreciate the large scale shift of assets from defined benefit plans, ultimately into what we will refer 1K after they go through retirement plans. And so a major industry shift to these assets that have been managed by CIOs, pension plans are now even managed again by individual advisors. So, we want to obviously be in sync with that shift. The investment that we\u2019ve began over a year ago we are actually pretty excited about U.S. retail, despite a pretty challenging environment for the industry. We have done quite well. And so recent statistics around flows actually have come out and we were 18th in terms of the third quarter in terms of net flows. So, the 37th largest family is 18th and net flows over an extended period of time, we should see our market share grow and it\u2019s a very important part of our initiative that we outlined at Investor Day. I would also highlight that we do reach clients directly through our wealth management business. Our wealth management business tends to focus on individuals and family offices with higher net worth. And we have seen through our expansion fantastic growth there. Todd mentioned the 19% increase we have seen in loans and deposits. I would share with you that our partnership with Pershing has been a really important contributor to that, nearly a quarter of our growth in loans and deposits came from connecting to the financial advisory clients of Pershing. So both U.S. retail coverage of advisors and wealth management are important parts of our future investment management.","Operator","Alright, thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is open.","Glenn Schorr","Thanks very much. So, everybody likes the positive operating leverage even without the currency impact, a quick question on the delta in the legal and consulting expense year-on-year. I don\u2019t know if you can give us the dollar amount for each quarter or just the delta, just curious how much that was a contributor?","Todd Gibbons","Yes. The consulting and legal expense did decline on a year-over-year basis a little. We are seeing some of the dividends from the lower litigation defense charges as well as lower consulting expenses related to a number of our strategic platforms. That was offset somewhat by higher consulting expenses related to some of the regulatory compliance efforts, especially around improving the qualitative process in our CCAR as well as the resolution recovery planning. So on a year-over-year basis I think it was down about $20 million.","Glenn Schorr","That means the bulk of the 300 basis points on your operating leverage is the structural improvements stuff?","Todd Gibbons","That is correct. Yes, it\u2019s beyond that. A lot of it\u2019s coming \u2013 obviously the biggest expense is in the staff expense and so that\u2019s where most of it\u2019s coming.","Operator","Alright. Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Sir your line is open.","Alex Blostein","Great. Good morning everybody. Todd, it might be a little premature, but as we think about 2016 you guys obviously had a great job this year controlling expenses and some of that\u2019s FX related, but as you noted and a lot of it is just kind of core improvement. Given the fact that it sounds like you made a lot of progress on the regulatory front and getting those systems in place, where are we I guess in the pace of growth of regulatory-related expenses and as we think out into next year, is there still enough you guys can do in the core business to keep expenses kind of flattish to down?","Todd Gibbons","Yes, I think, Alex it\u2019s a little early in our planning process. We continue to identify through the business improvement process additional actions that we can take. We do anticipate as I had indicated in the fourth quarter, a bit of a pop on some of the regulatory cost as we further build out some of the compliance and risk functions. I would say it\u2019s a little early to call it for next year, but we do see a number of continued opportunities and our goal is, as you will even see in this quarter, as the guidance that we gave for the fourth quarter is to keep things flat on a year-over-year basis. Depending on the revenue growth and where the revenue comes from, that could be more challenging.","Alex Blostein","Got it. And then just around balance sheet management, so you guys have been charging forward deposits in Europe for the last couple of quarters, I guess. Any thoughts in doing the same in the U.S. given the fact that the balance sheet came down a little bit quarter-over-quarter, but overall still pretty elevated? So, any thoughts around charging for deposits here?","Gerald Hassell","Yes. Alex, I will take that. We do have a team working with our Treasury group and our Investment Services group at the U.S. client base. And making sure whatever deposits we do have from them are ideal operational deposits versus non-valuable deposits and experimenting with certain types of clients and client segments whether they can be priced differently than what they are today and either they pay for it or pay for the use of the balance sheet or they move the deposits somewhere else. And so we are doing it on a selected basis. We haven\u2019t put through any charges yet, but we are having conversations with certain clients in certain client segments.","Todd Gibbons","I think we also benefit from having the ability in the portal to be able to help our clients sweep cash into money market mutual funds, both our own and other providers. So, we can at least retain some of the distribution fees associated with it.","Operator","Alright, thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Sir, your line is open.","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Good morning. On the asset servicing side, you are able to keep fees flat quarter-to-quarter even with sec lending and equity market declines. I am just wondering, did you always start to recognize revenue from the T. Rowe contract? And how do we start to understand how that builds forth over time? It seems like the underlying core servicing and new business was quite good relative to the market conditions. So, I was just wondering if you could flush that out for us?","Brian Shea","Yes, the asset servicing \u2013 it\u2019s Brian Shea speaking. The asset servicing fees were up 3% year-over-year. It\u2019s driven by a combination of global collateral services, broker dealer services and the core asset servicing fees, so pretty good performance overall. I think, from a T. Rowe Price perspective, we on-boarded the T. Rowe Price middle office team in August and we began to receive some revenue from middle office operational services from T. Rowe Price in August. We will be then \u2013 we will be moving towards a fund accounting conversion from their existing fund accounting platform to ours and then a new middle office platform in stages. And as we implement each stage, we expect to have additional revenue growth from each stage through the execution process. And importantly, we see this as a secular trend among investment managers who are looking for much more variable cost by share economies of scale services both from middle office services and technology platforms as well.","Gerald Hassell","Very little revenues in the third quarter from T. Rowe.","Ken Usdin","Okay. So, then what was the \u2013 what drove the sequential growth ex-T. Rowe then across the businesses aside from sec lending decline?","Todd Gibbons","Organic growth, global collateral services growth, broker dealer services growth, all contributed to asset servicing year-over-year improvement.","Brian Shea","Sequential improvement, yes.","Todd Gibbons","And sequential improvement, yes, sure.","Operator","Alright, thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mr. Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open.","Brian Bedell","Great, thanks for taking my questions. Just to maybe zero in on the short-term rate environment, a couple of things, I guess. What\u2019s your outlook for money market fee waivers into fourth quarter given just the recent pullback in some of the treasury and repo yields? And then also on the balance sheet for the quarter, we saw an uptick in securities portfolio yields, maybe you just talk about the driver of that. It looks like the rate on the MMDAs went to zero on the liabilities side. So, maybe if you can talk about those dynamics?","Todd Gibbons","Okay, I will \u2013 good morning, Brian, it\u2019s Todd. In terms of fee waivers, there is not a heck of a lot of noise there. We have given a $0.06 to $0.08 impact overall per quarter. And I would expect it\u2019s going to be well within that range. It was kind of in the middle of that range in the third quarter. And so we are seeing some noise on yields with the potential government shutdown. And your second \u2013 what was your second question, Brian?","Brian Bedell","On the results in the third quarter on the drivers of \u2013 there was an uptick in the government and other securities lines in the securities portfolio and then also on the, in fact, the MMDA went from 13 basis points to 0, I just wonder if that\u2019s sustainable?","Todd Gibbons","Yes. In terms of the \u2013 and you are talking about the securities portfolio, our proprietary portfolio, it is up from last year at this time fairly substantially and we did get some yields out of it. Basically, we repositioned cash once we had a full understanding of the LCR and it was acknowledged that we could use to help the maturity account and still have an asset considered as a high-quality liquid asset. So, at that point in time, we took down inter-bank placements and we increased our securities, increased our duration for a little bit in the portfolio and also increased the yield. That\u2019s been a little bit of change over the past couple of quarters, but we think that\u2019s relatively stable and that\u2019s why we are forecasting into the fourth quarter flat NIR relative to the third quarter. In terms of the MMDAs going down, I don\u2019t know of course \u2013 I don\u2019t see any impact to that degree at this point in time.","Brian Bedell","Okay. And the interest deposits are still in that 50 to 70 billion camp?","Todd Gibbons","That\u2019s where we would estimate them. Yes, Brian.","Brian Bedell","Okay. And then just a follow-up on asset management, it is really benefiting in the LDI side from the flows coming out of defined benefit pension plans. As you think about the revenue capture that you get in the LDI versus the stuff that you will be losing in the index and in the active, is that an accretive swap? It sounds like that could obviously a longer term trend, if you just want to comment on that?","Todd Gibbons","Yes. So, index fees, as you know, are very low and the large majority of our index assets are institutional, so they are truly on the low end of the fee range. LDI has single-digit management fees, many of those mandates also have performance fees, so a lot of the performance fees that we are in actually come from LDI mandates. So, it\u2019s \u2013 so, we have to think about it from a blended management and performance fee perspective. The only thing I would tell you is that when we take on an LDI mandate, we are frequently taking on a large majority of a client\u2019s total portfolio. So, they maybe reducing their equity and other exposures that are managed by others and moving their portfolio, sometimes their whole portfolio to us in LDI. So, a lot of the LDI growth we have seen have been \u2013 where pension plans have either taken a portion, or again, in some cases, the large majority of their plan and moved it to us. Index assets are a pretty interesting flow dynamic to watch. They have a lot to do with just the overall exposure, some very large clients will have the used index products to get data exposure to equity markets and fixed income markets. And given the volatility you have seen the outflows we have had in equity index strategies that we have mentioned in the last quarter and I will say again this quarter, some of the flows in index are very large flows from single clients and so not really as connected to what we are seeing in LDI.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mr. Brennan Hawken of UBS. Sir, your line is open.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I understand that what you can say on this might be limited at this point, but is there anyway you can help us think about any potential liabilities and other headwinds from the SunGard outage at this point? And how you feel about your ability to pass those liabilities on to SunGard?","Todd Gibbons","Okay. Brian, this is Todd. I will take some of that, maybe I can turn it over to my colleagues as well. In terms of the financial impact, we did incur some incidentals as you might expect in the quarter and those ran through the numbers. And we did cover the related charges that are \u2013 some of our clients would have experienced and we did take that as a charge in the third quarter as well. In terms of any differences in making investors whole, we don\u2019t see as we have gone through the reconciling process, we don\u2019t see much in the way and there certainly could be some of that. And we have of course have reserved our right to include SunGard any recoveries that we will be looking to make. That\u2019s about where we are financially.","Gerald Hassell","And just broadly Brennan, we have been very proactive with our clients, making sure that they were \u2013 they have been covered in terms of their out of pockets or when they have went through a challenging week, so we wanted to make sure we were proactive in covering their costs and taking care of them. Investors, at the end of they day between the \u201cmachine generated NAVs\u201d and the process, the protocol we followed at the time, was miniscule. So we felt good about the process that was employed. And so we are actively working with the clients, working with their fund boards, making sure that they fully understand what happened and how we recovered and why the system is stable and safe. So we are moving forward.","Brennan Hawken","Okay, great. And then certainly, we have talked actually to some of your clients and they have described as good partners for this, so heard that on the other side as well. So thanks for that. And then just a quick one on capital, can you quantify or give us a sense about how much of your advanced RWAs are in up risk at this point?","Todd Gibbons","Yes. So Brennan, this is Todd again. It\u2019s a very big number. And that may change as the regulators reconsider the standardized approach. But as there have been \u2013 the methodology is informed by external losses or losses at third parties and as there have been bigger and bigger losses, that gets filtered into our model and as a result, keeps driving up the risk weighted assets. So the number is about a \u2013 really probably a little over a third or right around a third of our total risk weighted assets in the advanced approach.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mr. Mike Mayo of CLSA. Sir, your line is open.","Gerald Hassell","Hi, Mike.","Mike Mayo","Can you hear me?","Gerald Hassell","Now, we can hear you better. Thank you.","Mike Mayo","Sorry about that. Can I just get a clarification, your assets under custody are flat in a down market, second quarter to third quarter, is that explained by the global collateral services and broker dealer services or is there something else going on?","Gerald Hassell","It\u2019s organic growth.","Brian Shea","Yes. So Mike assets \u2013 it\u2019s Brian Shea, assets under custody most recently are up 1% year-over-year, flat sequentially as you mentioned. Currency and market values had a negative effect. If you had a constant currency and constant market, you would seem more like a 3% growth rate in our AUC\/A which is pretty solid. And as you know, our focus is not exclusively on AUC\/A growth or pure revenue growth or pure market share growth, but we have shifted our focus towards better profitability and creating more value for clients and shareholders. I guess, the best example of that which Gerald mentioned earlier is that we are repositioning our UK TA business and we are actively repositioning as a global institutional bundled service and reducing the focus on local UK retail TA. So, we are actually pushing AUC\/A out in that environment, but we are going to improve our profitability in the process and that\u2019s the goal.","Todd Gibbons","And it was in the quarter that we on-boarded T. Rowe, Mike. So that was a substantial reason for the sequential \u2013 not having any material sequential impact.","Mike Mayo","Okay, that makes sense. We have heard a lot about pricing for better profitability for 3 years, 4 years, not just from you but for the whole sub-segment. I mean are you raising your hurdle rates, are you instructing your relationship managers to do something differently. I know you have mentioned that you have had these sorts of pricing conversations with the kind of lower tier accounts, but can you provide anything else more tangible, more than just the UK example?","Brian Shea","Sure, Mike. It\u2019s Brian again. So I think you have heard us talking in the past about up pricing small accounts, raising minimums, enforcing minimums and etcetera. And we have done quite a bit of that over the past few years and made some progress for sure. But now, what\u2019s happening is a slightly different thing, which is we formed a client pricing strategy group and the focus of it is to align the drivers of our costs and our client pricing to drive more rational behavior and to end with the clients. We believe there is a real opportunity to lower costs end to end with our clients in partnership and we are using pricing strategies and data to inform the clients in a way and to incent the clients to actually implement low cost behavior. So for example, we have online systems that clients can use, which are more efficient and to provide better service and yet clients are still faxing us things. So we are putting incentives in place to move towards the online systems and use the more rational service delivery, that actually lowers the client\u2019s costs and make them more efficient as well. And so there is a series of things like that that we are working on and we will be consulting with our clients and trying to drive lower end to end cost with them in a rational way.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mr. Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research. Sir, your line is open.","Jim Mitchell","Okay, thanks. Good morning. Maybe just a quick follow-up on capital, with the bank SLR at 4.6, needing to get to 6, is there anything you could in terms of shifting around assets from the holding company to the bank to kind of shore that up, because that\u2019s obviously more of a constraint than the firm wide SLR, how do we think about that if we are in a lower for longer and higher deposit type environment?","Gerald Hassell","Yes. Jim, that\u2019s exactly what we intend to do. So I think you hit the point. We think we can probably downstream capital in a way that pumps up the capital at the bank over the capital at the holding company. There will be a little bit of cost of that, but it won\u2019t be huge. So we don\u2019t need to execute that right now.","Jim Mitchell","Okay. And do we have to think about \u2013 do you have to incorporate I mean maybe we don\u2019t know yet, but just thinking about next year\u2019s CCAR, it will capture 2018, do you need to build a glide path into next year\u2019s CCAR for SLR in any way or do you have time to get there?","Gerald Hassell","Yes. The CCAR, next year\u2019s CCAR specifically excludes the SLR, so that will go into effect in 2017. But I think any prudent analysis, so this kind of get into the qualitative side of it. I think that we are going to have to demonstrate that we have a reasonable glide path and we have a way to get there. So I think that will be from a qualitative side, but it\u2019s excluded from the actual quantitative side of next year\u2019s CCAR.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mr. Adam Beatty of Bank of America. Sir, your line is open.","Adam Beatty","Thank you and good morning. Just a couple of follow-ups on asset servicing, firstly on SunGard, I want to close the loop on that. Have you seen any kind of extended duration of the contracting process, any impact on your discussions with perspective clients due to that? And then on the cost side, is there any run rate cost that you would expect from maybe additional safeguards or what have you? Thanks.","Brian Shea","Yes, it\u2019s Brian Shea. So, we have been in constant communication with our clients throughout \u2013 especially the affected clients during the period of time that there was an impact. But actually, we have extended our outreach to clients to put this in context and to help them understand the details of \u2013 and had meetings and dialogues of well over a thousand clients to make sure that they understand what\u2019s going on. I would say our clients have been working with us very closely and been very supportive and understanding during the incident and are getting tremendous amount of transparency from us and from SunGard around the actual incident. And what we are doing about it going forward in terms of ensuring our ability to deliver service on critical activities and have systems in place that are more reliable and more resilient both from a vendor management perspective and our own internal system. So we are using every opportunity here that we \u2013 to learn from this experience and to actually make us a more resilient, reliable partner. And I think our clients appreciate that and are getting very good insight from us about that. In terms of the financial perspective, I will let Todd...","Todd Gibbons","Yes. At this point, we have not identified any material increase in costs as a result of this. We did incur pretty meaningful cost in the third quarter, which we ran through the numbers. But we \u2013 there could be some to your point, but we don\u2019t \u2013 at least we haven\u2019t identified any that would be material.","Adam Beatty","I appreciate that. Thanks. And then on the T. Rowe relationship, it sounds like there is going to be some layering on of costs and revenues, what\u2019s your expected timing given your implementation plan of number one, achieving kind of a net profit contribution from that and also in terms of just getting to steady state in terms of revenues and costs?","Todd Gibbons","Yes. We are still in the investment stage of the strategic relationship. And as you know, we have on-boarded a couple hundred plus people in August, and we began to receive some revenue although as Gerald mentioned, it\u2019s on the modest end. We will do the fund accounting conversion in 2016 and that will have the additional \u2013 providing more services and we will get some more revenue associated with it. And the final stage will be the middle office platform conversion, which I don\u2019t have the timing directly in front of me, but let\u2019s just say \u201817. And at the end of which, we expect to have a good strategic relationship that\u2019s profitable and beneficial to both parties.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question will be coming from the line of Mr. Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Sir, your line is open.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning. Todd, can you share with us on the deposits that you are assessing a fee on what percentage of your total deposits are actually in the environments that actually have negative rates and of that amount what percentage are you charging a fee and one non-interest bearing deposits included in that as well?","Todd Gibbons","Non-interest bearing deposits could be included in that, typically overseas. You can go either way. So about a third of our deposits are non-dollar and so of that, the majority are euro and so that would be the number that would be, at this point in time exposed to a fee. I mean, any other currencies like Swiss franc and the Danish currency, it\u2019s a pretty small number that doesn\u2019t even move the needle. So it\u2019s really basically the euro where we are assessing anything of any size.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. And then just as a follow-up, I may have missed it. You mentioned about the other operating expenses, including the one-time costs associated with the SunGard issue, what was the dollar amount of that, those one-time costs?","Todd Gibbons","We didn\u2019t disclose the dollar amount, Gerard. But if you look at that number and you can see the sequential increase in other, most of that was related to \u2013 or a substantial part of that was related to SunGard matter.","Gerard Cassidy","Great, thank you.","Gerald Hassell","Okay. Well, thank you very much everyone for dialing in. We really appreciate it and your questions. If you have additional follow-up questions, please give Valerie Haertel a call. And again, we thank you for your participation and support.","Operator","If there are any additional questions or comments, you may contact Ms. Valerie Haertel at 212-635-8529.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent.","I will now turn the conference over to Ms. Valerie Haertel. Ms. Haertel, you may begin.","Valerie C. Haertel - Global Head-Investor Relations","Thank you. Good morning, and welcome, everyone, to the BNY Mellon First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Gerald Hassell, our Chairman and CEO; Todd Gibbons, our CFO; as well as members of our executive leadership team. Our first quarter earnings materials include a financial highlights presentation that will be referred to in the discussion of our results and can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.","Before Gerald and Todd begin, let me take a moment to remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release, the financial highlights presentation, and those identified in our documents filed with the SEC that are available on our website, bnymellon.com. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only of today, April 21, 2016, and we will not update forward-looking statements.","Now I would like to turn the call over the Gerald Hassell. Gerald?","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Valerie, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to discuss our first quarter performance and our progress in driving our long-term growth strategy.","Now in difficult market conditions, actually more so than reflected in our underlying assumptions of our Investor Day target, we begin delivered what I think would be considered healthy results in almost any environment. Year-over-year earnings per share were $0.73, up 9%. Adjusted for the roughly $0.01 of litigation and restructuring charges, we had operating earnings of $0.74 per share, up 10%.","Now focusing on year-over-year comparisons on an adjusted basis, total revenue declined 1%, reflecting both the challenging revenue environment and our focus on driving profitable and disciplined revenue growth. Net interest revenue rose 5% as we benefited from the first full year impact of the December rate increase. Fee revenue was positively affected in some of our businesses as we recaptured some of the money market fee waivers. Total expenses were down 3%, driven by our business improvement process. We generated roughly 250 basis points of positive operating leverage, we increased our pre-tax operating margin by approximately 150 basis points to 31%, and our return on tangible common equity in the quarter was 21%.","Now looking at our progress against our strategic priorities. Driving profitable revenue growth remains our first priority. Growing revenue has been a challenge across the industry. We have a heightened focus on profitable and disciplined revenue growth. We are not just driving gross revenue, we're expanding market share at any cost. We're leveraging our scale and expertise to create new sources of value for our clients, and we're delivering innovative strategic solutions in areas with strong potential upside, and we're investing in technology to revolutionize the client experience and create a digital enterprise.","And we also have numerous long-term growth initiatives underway at different stages of maturities. Our collateral management solutions are a great example of where we are investing in capability with upside potential and where our business model gives us a competitive advantage. And we've been providing collateral services to the sell side for decades. We have leveraged these capabilities to assist the buy side. We now have a complete and mature products to help buy-side and sell-side clients solve pressing issues, and we believe offer unique value in the process.","We view foreign exchange capabilities as an essential client offering, adding value to the multiple business lines across our enterprise. As you recall, we recently added a new executive to head our markets team, Michelle Neal, who is reporting directly to me to ensure that we are fully optimizing the strategic long-term growth opportunities we see in this business. And we are also investing in electronic trading infrastructure to price and trade FX for our clients on a single platform, as well as multi-dealer trading venues, all for the purpose of capturing more client-driven flows.","We expect our NEXEN next-generation ecosystem to increase our technological edge and revolutionize our client experience. NEXEN will provide a consistent client experience across our businesses, enabling our clients access to all of our services through one portal offering, offering them increased flexibility and new opportunities to leverage services and data from us and third-party providers, who are integrated into our platform.","Now we've begun rolling out NEXEN to our clients in asset servicing, liquidity services, global markets and corporate trust, and we are collaborating with clients to deliver an enhanced experience. Now based on early client feedback, we are convinced this will be a real game changer and solidify our position as a technology leader. And we'll share more of this important strategic initiative as we continue to expand functionality and bring more clients under the NEXEN ecosystem.","We also have a number of initiatives focused on harnessing blockchain and distributed ledger technology. We see this as a potentially transformative technology and we're fully engaged. Blockchain has a broad range of possible applications for our business and we are working closely with FinTech firms actively participating in consortiums and running various pilot programs internally.","An investment management under Mitchell Harris, we are focused on executing the investment management strategy we have already laid out. During the first quarter, our focus on improving investment performance drove strong benchmark in peer-relative performance in a number of our equity strategies. We have a number of initiatives in flight to align our capabilities with the largest growth pools and deliver high-value investment solutions. The key initiatives include expanding our alternative multi-asset strategies and enhancing our distribution capabilities to our core institutional client base and building out our retail strategy.","On the institutional side, our focus is on extending our LDI strategies to the U.S. market, and we've launched a new U.S. multi-strategy fund that replicates the strategy that worked so well in Europe. With respect to retail initiatives, our focus on third-party intermediary advisors and expanding the Dreyfus distribution platform in the U.S. has led to solid organic growth. During the quarter, we were one of a handful of firms that saw positive flows into U.S. retail mutual funds.","And the growing synergies between wealth management and Pershing have also helped drive loans and deposits to record levels. The 50% expansion of our wealth management sales force is now complete and it's generating healthy new revenues backed by a strong pipeline. And earlier this month, we closed on our acquisition of a Silicon Valley wealth manager called Atherton Lane Advisers, strengthening our footprint in one of the fastest-growing U.S. wealth markets. As these examples demonstrate, we're investing for today and tomorrow, helping our clients achieve their goals.","Now, executing on our business improvement process has been a huge focus for us. We are leveraging our scale and expertise to deliver efficiency benefits to our clients and improved results for our company. We are on target to achieve the structural cost reductions we shared at Investor Day.","So, let me share a few examples of our progress. We have reduced rentable square footage by 1.3 million square feet and are moving forward on significant opportunities to further rationalize our real estate footprint globally. We have built out our Global Delivery Centers for further migration. During the quarter, we relocated more than 225 positions to low-cost locations to balance our workforce globally. And we have now migrated more than 3,300 positions since the inception of our program. And we also implemented an initiative to drive more corporate action instructions through our electronic means. The STP rates are increasing, efficiencies are being realized by us and our clients, and operational risk is declining. That's a real win for all of us.","Now our third priority centers on being a strong, safe, trusted counterparty. We have made significant investments to enhance our resolvability by substantially reducing risk, taking meaningful steps to prepare for multiple resolution contingencies, simplifying our legal entity structure, significantly improving our operational and financial resiliency, and increasing our financial strength. Clearly, we have more work to do on our living will, and we are committed to addressing the issues raised and meeting our regulators' expectations within the required timeframe.","Our fourth priority involves generating excess capital and deploying it effectively. During the first quarter, we repurchased 577 million in shares and we distributed $185 million in dividends. From a regulatory ratio standpoint, our key capital ratios again improved. This quarter, our CET1 ratio under the fully phased-in advanced approach increased by 30 basis points to 9.8%, and we increased our supplementary leverage ratio by 20 basis points to 5.1%. We also remain in full compliance with the liquidity coverage ratio, which became effective in 2015, with a full phased-in period that extends through 2017. We remain confident that we will be in full compliance with all of the regulatory ratio requirements at the time or ahead of the required dates.","Last but not least, people are our ultimate competitive advantage. Attracting, developing and retaining top talent is also a strategic priority. Within Pershing during the quarter, we announced two appointments. Lisa Dolly, who has been with Pershing for over 25 years and was previously the Chief Operating Officer, was promoted to the CEO, demonstrating our deep leadership talent bench. Lisa's former role was filled by Lori Hardwick, a successful and highly qualified leader with lots of investments, technology and advisory expertise and an extensive track record of success in business growth, most recently with Envestnet.","In addition, Piers Murray is joining us later this quarter as Chief Operating Officer of our Markets business. He comes from Deutsche Bank, and brings a proven history in a global markets products and solutions. He will work with Michelle in strengthening our Markets business.","Together, these moves are evidence of our ability to attract and develop truly outstanding talent, which is something we showcased in our first-ever digital People Report posted on our website. Our People Report tells the story of how we are invested in our people and building a winning culture, and I encourage you to take a look at it.","Now the bottom line is this, we are executing against each of our strategic priorities and it's coming through in our results. Our strategy is designed to produce client and shareholder value and perform well through all environments. We've shown you that we can do just that and our goal is to continue that trend.","With that, let me turn it over to Todd.","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Gerald, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will follow the financial highlights document, starting with slide seven that details our non-GAAP or operating results for the quarter.","First quarter EPS was $0.74, up 10% versus the year-ago quarter. On a year-over-year basis, first quarter revenue was down 1%, expenses down 3%, and we generated 250 basis points of positive operating leverage. As we've noted in prior quarters, the strength of the dollar continues to impact results, so it's negatively for revenue and positively for expense. However, the net impact of currency translation is minimal to our consolidated pre-tax income.","Income before income taxes was up 4% year-over-year on an adjusted basis, and on a year-over-year basis, our pre-tax margin increased approximately 150 basis points to 31%. Return on tangible common equity was 21% for the quarter.","Our results reflected the benefit of higher money market fees. Now, we previously indicated that we expected to recover roughly 70% of the fee waivers with a 50-basis-point increase in the Fed funds rate. As expected, with the first 25-basis-point increase in December, we were able to recover nearly 50% of the waivers. As you can see, the recovery is not necessarily linear. Therefore, additional rate increases are not expected to be quite as impactful as the first. Note that money market fees primarily affect clearing, investment management, issuer services and asset servicing.","Slide eight shows our consolidated fee and other revenue. Asset servicing fees were flat year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. Both comparisons reflect net new business and higher securities lending revenue, offset by lower market values. The year-over-year comparison was also impacted by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.","Clearing services fees were up 2% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Both increases primarily reflect higher money market fees, partially offset by the impact of lost business. The sequential increase also reflects higher volume. Issuer services fees were up 5% year-over-year and 23% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential increases primarily reflect higher money market fees in corporate trust and higher dividend fees in depositary receipts. Treasury services fees were 4% lower, both year-over-year and sequentially, and that reflects higher compensating balance credits related to clients, which shifts revenues from fees to NIR.","First quarter investment management and performance fees were down 6% year-over-year, and that was 4% on a constant currency basis. The year-over-year decrease on a constant currency basis primarily reflects the headwinds of lower equity market values and net outflows in 2015, partially offset by higher money market fees. The sequential decline of 6% reflects those items in additional to seasonally lower performance fees.","FX and other trading revenue on a consolidated basis was down 24% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. FX revenue of $171 million was down 21% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower volumes relative to the unusually robust activity that we enjoyed last year. The 4% sequential increase primarily reflects higher volatility, and that was partially offset by the impact of foreign currency hedging activity. If you exclude the hedging, the sequential increase would have been 12%.","Financing-related fees grew 35% to $54 million versus the year-ago quarter, and increased 6% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher fees related to the extension of secured intraday credit declines. The sequential increase primarily reflects higher underwriting fees. Distribution and servicing fees were $39 million, 5% lower year-over-year and sequentially, as the favorable impact of lower money market fee waivers was more than offset by certain fees paid to introducing brokers.","Investment and other income of $105 million compared with $60 million in the year-ago quarter and 93 million in the fourth quarter. Both increases primarily reflect higher lease-related gains. The sequential increase was partially offset by lower other income resulting from clearing service termination fees that we recorded in the fourth quarter, and lower income from corporate bank-owned life insurance.","Slide nine shows the drivers of our investment management business and help explain our underlying performance. Assets under management of $1.64 trillion were down 5% year-over-year, reflecting net outflows in 2015 and the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, principally against the British pound. Sequentially, assets under management were up 1%.","We had long-term net inflows of 1 billion, that was driven by $14 billion in liability-driven investment inflows, where strong client demand has attracted more than $40 billion in assets over the past 12 months. And we also saw flows into alternative investment strategies.","Long-term net outflows were mainly driven by passive investment strategies totaling $11 billion, which were recognized in index investments. Active equity outflows declined to $3 million, signaling a slower decline and may indicate that the industry is starting to see equity flows stabilize following one of the worst years on record in 2015. Additionally, we had $9 billion of short-term cash outflows.","Our wealth management business and U.S. intermediary expansion initiatives continue to show progress. Wealth management delivered the 20th consecutive year-over-year earnings growth and we're seeing above market share inflows in many of our intermediary channels. Investment management loans and deposits both reached record levels of 23% and 5%, respectively.","Turning to our investment services metrics on slide 10. I want to point out that in the first quarter of 2016, we reclassified the results of our credit-related activities that were previously recorded in the other segment to investment services. This reclassification to investment services better reflects where the client relationships and services reside. The reclassifications did not impact the consolidated results. Also, concurrent with this reclassification, the provision for credit losses associated with the respective credit portfolio is now reflected in each business segment. All prior periods have been restated to reflect that.","Assets under custody and\/or administration at quarter end were $29.1 trillion, up 2% or $600 million year-over-year, reflecting net new business and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar on a period end basis, principally against the euro which was partially offset by lower market values. The late quarter AUC\/A was up $200 billion. We estimate total new assets under custody and\/or administration business wins were $40 billion in the first quarter. In the last couple of quarters, we've seen slower than historic growth rates, reflecting our strategy of selectively adding new business versus simply growing market share.","Looking at the other key investment services metrics, the market value of securities on loan at period end was up 3% year-over-year. Average loans were flat year-over-year while average deposits were down 8%. Our broker dealer metric of average tri-party repo balances was down 2%, our clearing metrics are lower, and we again recorded a net decline in sponsored DR programs as we continue to focus on exiting low-activity programs at the lower end of our client base and programs that do not meet our profitability criteria.","Turning to net interest revenue on slide 11, you'll see that net interest revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was up 5% versus the year ago quarter and 1% from the fourth quarter. Both increases in NIR reflect higher yields on interest earning assets, partially offset by higher rates paid on interest bearing liabilities in the impact of interest rate hedging activity, which are primarily offset in FX and other trading revenue lines. Yield on interest earning assets was up 9 basis points year-over-year and 8 basis points sequentially.","Our net interest margin for the quarter was 101 basis points. That's a 4 basis point improvement from the year ago quarter, and 2 basis points higher than the prior quarter. If not for the impact of the hedging activity I previously mentioned, the net interest margin would've been 4 basis points higher for the quarter.","Turning to slide 12, you will see that non-interest expense on an adjusted basis declined 3% year-over-year, and 2% sequentially as we drove expenses lower in nearly all categories. The year-over-year decrease reflects the favorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, lower staff and legal expenses and the benefit of our Business Improvement Process. The savings generated by the Business Improvement Process primarily reflect the benefits of our technology insourcing strategy, and the implementation of our global real estate strategy. This was partially offset by higher distribution and servicing expenses related to fee waivers.","Staff expenses decreased year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower estimated 2016 incentives and a higher adjustment for the finalization of the annual incentive awards. So that was partially offset by the curtailment gain related to the U.S. pension plan that we recorded in the first quarter of 2015 and higher severance expense and ongoing support of our Business Improvement Process.","The sequential decrease on non-interest expense reflects lower expenses in all categories, except other and distribution and servicing expenses. The sequential decrease in staff expense primarily reflects lower compensation and employee benefit expenses, partially offset by higher incentives primarily due to the vesting of long-term stock rewards for retirement-eligible employees. The increase in other expense primarily reflects the adjustments in the bank assessment charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase in distribution and servicing expense is due to higher money market fees.","The sequential increase in head count reflects our campus technology recruiting effort to attract the best technologists. We expect the large recruiting class to account for anticipated turnover. In addition, the year-over-year increase also reflects the onboarding of employees to support strategic growth initiatives and risk-related activities. Our location strategy has helped us to increase our head count to support strategic initiatives, while we've been able to reduce total staff expense.","Turning to capital on slide 13. Our fully phased in advanced approach common equity Tier 1 ratio increased by approximately 30 basis points to 9.80. That was primarily driven by an increase to capital generation. Our supplemental leverage ratio increased to 5.1% this quarter, primarily due to increased capital and a reduction in our balance sheet and off balance sheet exposures.","A couple of other notes about the quarter. As you'll see in the release on page three, our effective tax rate was 25.9%, which is in line with our previous guidance. On page 11 you'll see some investment securities portfolio highlights. At quarter end, our unrealized pre-tax gain on our portfolio was $1.2 billion. That compared to $357 million at year end. The difference in value is primarily due to a decline in market rates.","Now let me share a few thoughts to factor into your thinking about the second quarter and the rest of 2016. Money market fee waivers appear to be recovering in line with our previous guidance. We would expect investment and other income to be in the range of $60 million to $80 million going forward. Staff expense should decline sequentially in the second quarter as a result of the acceleration that took place in the first quarter.","We expect to see an increase in resolution planning expenses as we work to address those issues raised regarding our living will. Given these pluses and minuses this year, we expect expenses to be flat in the second quarter versus the first quarter. We expect our effective tax rate to either be approximately 25% to 26%. And finally, we expect to continue to repurchase shares under our current authorization during the second quarter.","To sum up, we delivered a solid quarter in spite of difficult market conditions as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities. With, that let me hand it back to Gerald.","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Todd. And we can now open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","As a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up question. Our first question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So Todd, just picking up on the NII discussion, I think you answered part of that already in the prepared remarks with the hedging headwind, I guess, about 2 basis point incremental to what you reported. But just thinking through the puts and takes, where we are in the rate cycle besides the balance sheet, so how should we think about the rest of the year from an NII perspective assuming rates don't really change and again, the starting-off point on the NIM, I guess, would've been 2 basis points higher versus what you've reported, right?","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. That's correct, Alex. I would expect you'd see a couple of basis points higher on the NIM, and that would be reflective and a little bit higher NIR going forward. The balance sheet is relatively stable. It acted about as we had expected it would with the rate increase that we saw at the end of the fourth quarter, so client deposits were down a bit. So it looks to be very stable. We've adjusted further the negative interest rates with the move to (28:11) ECB and the euro.","And the thing that's a bit of a headwind is with the flattening of the yield curve, the reinvestment rates are a little bit less than we would have liked. But net-net, the hedging should normalize, and we would expect to see a couple of basis points of expansion if rates don't change from here.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks. And Gerald, a question for you. Along the lines of some of the new initiatives that you outlined in prepared remarks. So particularly in the investment servicing front, you highlighted collateral management, FX, NEXEN, which all seem to be in various stages of development. But taking a step back, can you help us contextualize that a little bit better, what it means for the servicing business' organic growth kind of over the next year to two years versus what we've seen over the last couple of years? Just trying to put some numbers around these initiatives.","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Sure, Alex. Appreciate the question. I would say the one that has the most immediate, greatest upside is in the collateral services side. As we've talked about over the last year or so, we really designed the collateral services businesses for the sell side and for firms like yours to be able to finance their positions and to be able to segregate collateral and to try to optimize the collateral for capital purposes.","We're also seeing increasing interest on the buy side and we're adjusting our algorithms to help the buy side better utilize our capabilities as they have to post collateral, and also as they invest in tri-party repo programs. So we see a pretty significant opportunity for us to do this, not only in the U.S. but around the world. And so whether it's segregation, optimization, transformation of the collateral and help reduce the capital costs for different firms, we think that's got some real upside potential. So I would say that's first and foremost at the top of the list.","In our foreign exchange and markets business, we think we have greater opportunities to utilize the electronic infrastructure that we're building to capture more order flow and do more netting across our businesses and improve the margins for us and improve the execution for our clients. So those are two areas that I cited in my opening comments that we think have some real upside to it.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. All right. Thanks for taking the question, guys.","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Alex.","Operator","Taking our next question from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse.","Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning.","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Gerald, on asset management and investment management and the margin profile there, appreciate this quarter was tough macro wise, but hoping you can provide an update on how you feel the plan to drive margins higher there is going versus the goals outlined at Investor Day? I'll leave it at that.","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thanks, Ashley. We've said at Investor Day, and recently at our last annual meeting last week, we think we have some more work to do in improving the operating margins with the investment management area without sacrificing the investment strategies and without sacrificing, or actually adding to the strength of our portfolio managers. We think a lot of those costs can be dealt with at the center of investment management, and also trying to better rationalize or make more efficient our distribution costs.","So we think there's opportunities to apply the same discipline to the rest of our businesses, to the running of the business of investment management and improve the ability for the boutiques to continue to drive their investment performance. So it is one of our goals and we're on track and we still have some work to do there.","Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then, Todd, on deposit costs, I was curious how you're thinking about passing on the benefit from higher rates to clients? It looks like the deposit betas are fairly low so far, but how should we be thinking about the next 25 basis points of high (32:35) so it's sustainable?","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, Ashley. I would say that our deposit betas are probably a little lower than we had anticipated, so that's the good news. We would've expected that we would've recovered most of the first 25 basis points, which is the case, although there is some deposit attrition that I mentioned. And right now, as we forecast looking out, we are adjusting our betas slightly favorably.","Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the quarter.","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. It's Betsy.","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Betsy.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","A couple of questions. You mentioned early on in the conversation around blockchain and the question I have is, how are you in determining how to make those investments and what kind of timeframe to return on investments are you anticipating? I noticed that you remember both of R3 and also the Hyperledger Project, and I know there's dual tracks in many cases on competing asset classes. So, I'm just trying to understand how you are allocating your resources.","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. No, you hit it right on. We are members of a variety of different consortiums and so we're participating in helping set the standards for the industry. I think that is one of the keys to the success of blockchain technology is standardization of the processes. We're also looking at it in our payments area and our corporate trust area and our broker dealer clearance business, particularly applied to repos.","We think blockchain can be transformative. We also can see it as being an ability to increase the resiliency of our capabilities. I think it's going to take time to fully materialize, and it does require, in all cases, a trusted counterparty. And we think that's one of the roles that we can play, which is what we play today, the trusted counter party that everyone can show up on both sides of the ledger and trust that it will be executed well, and we plan to play a role in the middle of that. So we are making investments. It's already in our run rates in terms of either the expense or the investments, which aren't really that big in terms of the R3 and Hyperledger and those sorts of investments. But we're spending a lot of time and energy on it, but I think it's going to take some time to see it play out in a full, meaningful way.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. But yeah, the question I'm getting is, is it like Betamax or VHS? Does it matter? Can we have a dual track of standard? In other words, can some asset classes be on one backbone and other asset classes be on a different backbone?","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, that is going to be one of the questions, is it beta max, or is it VHS or what is it? And that's why you're seeing so many different initiatives occur in the marketplace and why we're participating in a variety of them. We think trying to get to a better common standard, at least for certain asset classes, will be the way to go and that's why we want to be a leader in helping drive that exercise.","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Ultimately, Betsy, in order to get the network effect, you're going to have to have standardization. And also, we think that there will be a trusted counterparty because the proof of work costs are so high and there are going to be regulatory issues associated with it, so that's why we think there is a great role for us. So I think there's an opportunity for this to either reduce operating costs, but it will require significant standardization and is likely to start in smaller markets where those standards can be addressed.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, folks. Hey, maybe just, Todd, on the expense outlook. Good clarity on the second quarter and excellent expense control, of course, in the first quarter. But as we look out through the rest of the year, it looks like you'd be on track to reduce expenses at least another 2% or potentially more. I know they're seasonally high expenses you moved into the back end of the year. But maybe if you could just give us some color on what you're seeing for project spend coming into the back half of the year and whether you think you can do another 2% down on expenses this year?","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I think we're a little ahead of where we had expected to be, frankly, Brian. We did see \u2013 I just want to remind you, in the first quarter, we do tend to see seasonal lower legal expense, also a little bit seasonally lower business development and consulting. And the other thing we saw is revenues were down in our higher comps business lines. So as the market moves, we would expect revenues to pick up in those lines and the associated expenses with them.","We do think that around both the resolution plan, we're going to have to accelerate some of the investments that we intended to make. We had committed last year to invest $140 million over the next 18 months or so in order to build resilience and improve the probability of success in our plan. We may have to accelerate that a bit.","So there are some headwinds we're facing, but I think we've got some \u2013 we're basing it off of a lower base than we would've expected to be at this time, so we're probably a little ahead of the guidance that we had previously given.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And thanks for that. And then maybe either for Brian or Joe, I guess if you can talk about the dynamics in clearing, we have the previously announced client loss versus the impact of the money market fee waivers and client wins. And then maybe, Brian, if you want to comment a little bit about development of NEXEN in terms of the investment outlook for this year and how you're seeing -which stage of development you're in, in terms of bringing on new clients and that and whether you think there's a revenue generation component coming either this year or next year?","Brian Thomas Shea - Vice Chairman & CEO-Investment Services","Sure. Happy to. It's Brian Shea. Clearing services actually is suffering a bit from the loss of those clients that we talked about and shared with you in advance, but we're benefiting from the reduction in fee waivers driven by the December rate increase. So that's offset with, really, the loss of the client business in the short term. And we've also benefited from taking on a number of clients in the third and fourth quarters as a result of J.P. Morgan's exit. And we continue to see interest from self-clearing firms who are looking to outsource and we converted another self-clearing firm in the first quarter. So overall, the clearing services picture is solid. And they're executing very strong expense discipline so we think we'll have modest year-over-year growth from clearing services.","The other dynamic in clearing services is that the RIA custody business is growing and the DOL judiciary standard is likely to help accelerate that growth over time. So we feel good about our position there and the leverage of the private banking services of our wealth management group into that RIA and broker dealer market is also a very positive long-term development for clearing services.","Turning to the NEXEN question, NEXEN is no longer an idea or a vision, it's really a reality. It's in production. And we now have 3,600 client users across 950 clients, exercising and using NEXEN in production every day. It cuts across now AIS clients, asset servicing clients, broker dealer services, liquidity, direct and corporate trust, as Gerald mentioned. And we expect to have more functionality, more capabilities, more APIs, more third party FIN tech applications embedded in the platform over time, and we expect to roll this out to our entire client base over time. So we're getting real momentum and take-up, and the reaction from the clients is actually quite positive. The client experience is just better.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. And so the revenue expense dynamic in terms of \u2013 it sounds like you're through a lot of the investment phase and now you're closer to realizing potential revenue gains from this?","Brian Thomas Shea - Vice Chairman & CEO-Investment Services","Yeah. I guess the way I'd say it is, as part of the business of improvement process we're actually self-funding the development of NEXEN, so we continue (41:28). As we insource technology developers and we simplify our infrastructure, we are able to shift technology investment firm redundant, lights on-type investment to strategic investments. So that's enabling us to fund NEXEN and other market-leading solutions for clients without actually increasing our technology investment or expense.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC","Hi, there.","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC","A question about \u2013 Good morning. About some of the balance sheet remixing. Some of this just happened, some of it's purposeful. But security is down 4% year-on-year, loans up 6%. I noticed the 23% growth on the investment management loans, so curious what those are and if that's what the big driver is, driving the 21, 22 basis point jump in average loan yields year-on-year?","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Glenn. One of the strategies we've had is to growth the wealth management business, and so that's where the loans are booked. So those are either margin-style loans or mortgages to high net worth individuals. And we have had some meaningful success in expanding that mortgage portfolio. Most of those are jumbo mortgages arms, some of them would be floating, and that has helped drive the mix that you talked about and that's been planned.","Another area of loan growth that we've enjoyed is in our secured financing transactions. I would expect the rate of that growth to flow somewhat from what we've been doing to date. And the mix now, I think, will be more stable as we look out the next 12 months or so.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC","Got it. Okay. That's perfect. And then I know the jump up really happened last quarter but I'm looking at the year-on-year increase in non-performing loans and the decrease in the allowance, and I know it was stable quarter-on-quarter. So I guess the real question is just a quick comment on what you see credit-wise for your mix. Hidden within there is an energy question, but really, just overall credit.","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Glenn, that was just one loan that had to do with the Sentinel reversal of a court decision, and that became a non-performing loan. We took the provision against it to market to the current value, so that's done. The rest of the portfolio is absolutely stable.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC","And right coverage ratio?","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC","Okay.","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","You did see us increase our provision in the first quarter to $10 million, but the credit portfolio continues to be strong. We do have some exposure to energy, which we explained on the call in the last quarter. And there will be some migration even though that is almost entirely investment grade. There is some modest migration and we would expect some provision associated with that portfolio but we don't expect it to be material.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Can you give us a little more color? You've mentioned that on the fee waiver side you got about 50% back and the next hike won't be as incremental. But Todd, maybe you can just help us understand given that there are some of the expenses that come back in, what's the current existing drag still on a per share basis that you got from fee waivers, and how many more hikes would it take to get the rest of it back?","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. We had indicated that we thought there was about a $0.06 to $0.08 drag to EPS driven by fee waivers, and so we're getting about 50% of that back so, we got about $3.50 in these numbers relative to the fee waivers is our best estimate. That's probably a little bit better than we had anticipated. We did expect it not to be exactly linear. The first move is the best one, the second move will be not quite as great. But having had the experience of this, I would expect we would cover a little better than our previous guidance of 70% with a 50 basis point move. And I expect 100 point basis point move would cover all of it.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Okay, great. The second question just on the core (45:58) asset servicing business. After a really great run of big, big business wins, the last couple of quarters have been decent but in kind of the $50 billion-ish range, can you talk about the pipeline for just core wins and your outlook for growth in that segment of the servicing business?","Brian Thomas Shea - Vice Chairman & CEO-Investment Services","Yeah, this is Brian Shea. The new business signed number can vary reasonably significantly quarter to quarter, and we've had a couple of soft quarters. I would say it reflects a couple of things. Our focus on profitable client relationships over sort of just pure revenue and market share, we're being extremely disciplined and selective about the new business assignments we take on. And that's actually part of the reason you're seeing improved operating margins and you're seeing our fee to expense ratio improve significantly. But in terms of the pipeline, the pipeline remains actually pretty strong. It's up significantly on a sequential basis. And we still believe that this is a strong growth driver for the company going forward.","The secular trend towards asset managers wanting to outsource and refocus their energy on the investment process itself we think is continuing, and that's why we have invested in things like the real estate and private equity administration business. This, in 2016, after lifting out the Deutsche Bank team and serving Deutsche Bank will now be starting to take on third party clients. And in addition, we have a strong pipeline of middle-office services from asset managers and demand for the Eagle technology platform. So we still believe that we can drive long-term growth and we're confident in that.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi. So in aggregate, expenses are down, the pre-tax margin's up from 30% to 31. So in aggregate, that's moving in the right direction, but when I look at the investment management adjusted pre-tax operating margin of 30%, I'm not sure the last time it was that low, at least going back several years. And so I'll ask the same question that I asked at last week's annual meeting and that is, under what scenario would you consider more aggressive dispositions a part of your asset management business?","And along the lines of that question, I guess at the meeting you now have a new lead director, after the meeting and so what's his role, what's your interaction with him in the first week and what do you expect that role to be? Do you talk to him about things like hey, maybe the investment management business should be restructured more aggressively to help improve what's a margin way below peer?","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. A lot of questions in there, Mike. But I always appreciate them. First of all, we have a lot of confidence in our investment management business. It's been a tough quarter and we saw a lot of outflows not only in our firm but across the industry last year. 2015 was probably one of the biggest outflow years in traditional active equity. And as you know, that's one of the highest fee realization products across the industry. We feel better that the active equity flows have stemmed the tide. We saw some outflows in index, but our LDI strategy, our alternative strategy continues to pick up and so we ended up with positive, net long-term flows for this quarter which I think fairs pretty well against our competitors.","We do have work to do on improving the operating margin in the business, no question about it. I said it last week when you asked the question. I'll say it again, we have some work to do there. But I think some of the outsized margin performance by our peers, and really because they tend to be more active equity-oriented and they have higher fee realization to begin with. But we still have work to do there. We have a lot of confidence in the business. Mitchell Harris is here with me today, and I think Mitchell is the right person to improve the business and improve the performance overall. So we remain very confident in that and being a critical part of our company.","Regarding Lead Director, yes we announced the new Lead Director. Every company goes through a change in its director makeup. He, like all of our directors, are very active. We have an ongoing dialogue with him. The Lead Director's role is to interface actively with management, which he has already begun to do and represent the directors in communicating well with management. We're off to a great start and I have no concerns about how we're interacting with our board.","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","And then as a short follow up, earlier you said you might reduce distribution costs to help out investment management. Could you elaborate on that, or any other details on where you see the greatest potential?","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. What I referred to was making sure we're getting the bang for our buck for our distribution expense and make sure it's targeted in the right places where we're getting good results. And so maybe, Mitchell, you want to comment on a little bit.","Mitchell Evan Harris - Chief Executive Officer-Investment Management","Thank you. What I'd like to actually comment on is if you really look at our core business, Mike, it's actually pretty strong and moving up. The other revenue line is what's confusing things a little bit, and I think you have to keep in mind the first quarter of last year was very strong, especially on the seed capital front. And even when you look at our \u2013 and it wasn't as strong, obviously, in this quarter.","You also have the issue of internal payments that we've given to investment services on fee waiver abatements that's in that line; that stays within the company. So it's not really a weakness, per se, and as Gerald did mention, investment performance has been good; flows are abating. The first two months were weak. The \u2013 March was actually much better, and we're getting it in the right category. So you only had $3 billion down in equities, which was, on average, it was $8 billion down per quarter last year.","Alternatives are still improving. Our initiatives in terms of the retail \u2013 which was mentioned earlier \u2013 distribution, we had 300 million in positive flows. We were the eighth best performing retail out of 30. So I think our distribution is improving. Our performance is improving. The money market fee waivers help all of us. Flows are becoming less negative. And on the expense management side, we are looking at where there's overlaps between the boutiques, between the IM center and we will cuts those out. So I think we're going to continue to drive both expenses down. And I think there are significant revenue opportunities going into the year.","Brian Thomas Shea - Vice Chairman & CEO-Investment Services","And we've taken a hard look at the corporate overheads and those are coming down related to investment management as well. So I think there's opportunity...","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you.","Brian Thomas Shea - Vice Chairman & CEO-Investment Services","...Opportunity for both scale as well as other actions we can take.","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Mike.","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First, nice tip of the cap to Hamilton in your deck, by the way, on the back of the $10 bill brouhaha. Good to see that.","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. Thank you.","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Yes. We had a lot of emotional attachment to that one, and we're very, very pleased with the Secretary of Treasury's decision there.","Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","No doubt. So on expenses, can you quantify \u2013 I don't think, Todd, you did in your prepared remarks, how much was severance in comp this quarter and maybe how would that compare to last year and the fourth quarter?","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I think if you \u2013 there's a couple of things; one is when we finalize our actual incentive payouts, oftentimes there is either adjustment one-way or the other. That adjustment was favorable and it actually approximately offset the severance. So, on a year-over-year basis, the net of that was basically zero. I think a way to look at our expenses on a year-over-year basis and the staff expense, I'll give it to you very specifically, the acceleration was $9 million higher. And last year we had a pension curtailment when we curtailed our defined benefit plan, and that was a $30 million benefit. So we had a $39 million headwind, if you will, going into this year's first quarter from those two events.","Plenty of that was offset with, effectively, the benefit of curtailing the pension last year. So it wasn't frozen. We took the gain when we announced it, but it wasn't actually frozen until the third quarter, so we got the benefit of that. So there's about a $20 million headwind on a year-over-year basis from those various categories.","Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for walking me through that, Todd. And then issuer services, you guys called out depository receipt business and the strength there. Given the continued rally in the EM, should we assume that that's sustainable and is that still a reasonably good indicator for that business?","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Yes, DRs is \u2013 definitely tied to emerging market activity in issuance. And so a pickup in emerging market issuance will be helpful to DRs for sure. The other driver there is corporate actions tend to be helpful, so if you have a pickup in banking activity or merger activity, that tends to be a positive driver for DRs as well.","On the corporate trust side of issuer, we've signaled that the fee decline we experienced for the prior few years would moderate and level off, which it has done. They're benefiting now from the restoration of some of the fee waivers, and while bond issuance was down pretty significantly industry wide in the first quarter, our market share in corporate trust is picking up. And we think that'll be one of the drivers of growth in the future for investment services.","Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for the color.","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Adam Beatty from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.","Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you, and good morning. Question on asset management, particularly the positive U.S. retail flows. You mentioned multi-strat and alternatives. Is that what's driving the positive flows, or are there other products that are working? Thanks.","Mitchell Evan Harris - Chief Executive Officer-Investment Management","Well, this is Mitchell. You have LDI that you had $14 billion of positive flows, so that's contributed to it. And fixed is flat, but \u2013 meaning core fix, but it's primarily on LDI and on alternatives.","Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. And then maybe a broader question about the outlook for wealth management, particularly the retirement business. As the retiree population grows, are you seeing \u2013 I mean LDI has been strong on kind of the institutional side. On the retail wealth management side, are you seeing people do a similar kind of individual LDI where they're moving to fixed income and trying to immunize their savings? Or given some shortfalls in people's retirement savings, are they kind of going more towards equity and swinging for the fences in terms of building capital? Which trend is more dominant in your wealth management business?","Mitchell Evan Harris - Chief Executive Officer-Investment Management","They're definitely not swinging for the fences. It's more of a balance. People are confused. Most people don't have enough; the wealth obviously do. But they're looking for solutions in this market. Are interest rates going up? What's going to happen to fixed income? The equity markets have been very volatile, so they're looking at a more conservative balance type of approach, quite frankly. So equities remained a significant element but probably has come down a little bit, and they're looking more at corporate credit, munis have performed well and had to balance out their fixed income portfolios.","Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Very helpful. Thanks, Mitch.","Mitchell Evan Harris - Chief Executive Officer-Investment Management","Yep.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","Hello. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Very interested to hear you highlighting blockchain technology so much. How do you think about the possibility that all of this innovation kind of removed some of your technological modes and ultimately reduces the pool of revenues that could be available to the whole trust of custody industry?","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We actually see ourselves as one of the major participants in using the technology to improve the efficiency of our operations and the resiliency of our operations. And as I said earlier, the fact that no matter what technology is used, a trusted counterparty intermediary is required, we see ourselves playing in that role. So, while certain efficiencies and certain revenues may lessen the revenues, we think we're going to pick up that in the cost side as the technology gets improved and rolled out.","So, we see ourselves as being a critical player in the middle of this. As I said, we have pilot programs going on in the payments business, in corporate trust and our broker-dealer business, and particularly around repos. So, we're watching it carefully. We're participating actively. It's really hard to tell exactly how it's going to roll out, but we do see ourselves as being a major participant in it.","Brian Thomas Shea - Vice Chairman & CEO-Investment Services","Yeah, this is Brian \u2013 sorry.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","Just go ahead.","Brian Thomas Shea - Vice Chairman & CEO-Investment Services","I would just add that we're executing a NEXEN ecosystem strategy, which includes an app store. And part of the reason for being immersed in this FinTech world is to find solutions that can really add value to clients. And clients are obviously interested in getting the value with the new applications and innovative technology, but they frankly, in many cases, do not want to integrate it, do not want to do the work of managing that.","And so, our ecosystem will be enable us to embed third-party solutions in a much more easy streamlined way, which will reduce the client's under management cost. So, we think NEXEN enables us to leverage these companies and these innovative solutions, and it also enables us to actually help drive revenue growth and more value for clients. And we're \u2013 another example would be on NEXEN, we have a digital pulse big data solution in. We've invented client optimization technology, securities lending optimization technology, liquidity management optimization technology, all of which are sources of improving our clients' profitability and sources of revenue for the company in the future.","So, there's real opportunity here, as well as some risk, and we're immersing ourselves to try to make sure that the opportunities outweigh the risks.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","Great. And just a very quick numbers question. The expenses, what would the year-on-year change have been on a constant-currency basis?","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","It's about 100 basis-point benefit. So, it would've been about 100 basis points more, rather down three, they would have been down two.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","Perfect. Thank you.","Unknown Speaker","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. Thanks. I just had a quick question on the balance sheet. I know you gave kind of guidance as to what the margin would do if rates were flat over 2016, but if we do get another rate increase in 2016, would you expect a similar drop in deposits like you saw this quarter, or are you expecting stability kind of over the deposit base as rates increase from here? Thanks.","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. No, we expect that there will be further run off with additional rate increases. We think that, that deposit runoff, that attrition is probably a little bit less than we had previously guided. So we \u2013 back in our Investor Day, we had guided that with normalization of rates, let's say that's 100 basis points or so, we would've expected to see about $40 billion to $70 billion of runoff. I think we will see something to the lower end of that. So we've seen in the first $25 billion, we've seen about $13 billion or so. So, I think we would stick with that guidance. We do think the margin expansion will more than offset any loss of deposits, which will lead to higher NIR in a rising-rate environment. And when we model that and report that in our financials, we are reflecting the runoff that comes \u2013 our estimated runoff that comes with the movement in interest rates.","Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. Thanks.","Operator","And our final question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. I apologize if you addressed these questions, I had to jump on and off your call. But Gerald, can you share with us \u2013 there's a lot of disruption going on in the capital markets and many of the European and UK capital market players have downsized and are exited specific businesses in the capital markets such as FIC trading or equity trading. Are you guys seeing any opportunities to gain market share in your business lines in those markets due to the disruption that some of those companies are going through?","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the companies that are going through that are in, many cases, some of our largest clients, so some of their reduced activity is part of the challenges that we're trying to overcome in terms of the market activity. That being said, we are seeing some of the shift in that activity to smaller firms who also happen to be more rapidly growing clients, and we do see ourselves being able to provide, extend our service model to some of those firms who are picking up some of the trading flack or need the collateral services that I talked about earlier.","We do have what we refer to as prime custody, prime services solutions, so some of the activity we see ourselves being able to pick up on a direct basis without taking on the risks associated with normal prime brokerage activity. So, we try to do it in a conservative thoughtful way, but we do see ourselves being able to expand a little bit more in that space.","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","But I would add to that, Gerard, we're not interested in becoming a large, fixed income trading operation.","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, absolutely.","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","So, that's not what we're looking for. We do make markets for some of our clients, for Pershing clients and so forth, but it's a relatively modest accommodation business for us and we don't expect that to change.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. And then as a follow-up on CCAR, obviously this year we had the negative interest rate environment and I think most banks probably quantitatively will come out of it okay. But from a qualitative standpoint, from the systems stand point, are you guys comfortable with what you were able to submit to the regulators? I know many banks have addressed that their systems are going to be using manual overrides to handle that negative rate environment. Are you guys \u2013 is yours similar that or are you fully automated and you could do it without any manual overrides in negative rate environment here in the U.S.?","Thomas P. Gibbons - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, well, I think one of the benefits is we're mostly an institutional company, and so that we've had the experience of passing on negative interest rates through our systems in Europe and in a number of jurisdictions and now in Japan as well. So, we think that is something that we could operationally manage.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Great.","Gerald L. Hassell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thank you very much, everybody, for joining us this morning. Additional questions can be directed to Valerie Haertel and our Investor Relations team. And we look forward to engaging with you, and thank you very much for dialing in.","Operator","And if there are any additional questions or comments, you may contact Ms. Valerie Haertel at 212-635-8529.

You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent. ","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Andy Clark. Mr. Clark, you may begin.","Andy Clark","Thanks, Wendy, and welcome, everyone. With us today are Gerald Hassell, our Chairman, President and CEO; Todd Gibbons, our CFO, as well as several members of our executive management team.  Before we begin, let me remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement on Page 12 of the press release and those identified in our documents filed with the SEC that are available on our website, bnymellon.com. Forward-looking statements in this call speak only as of today, April 18, 2012, and we will not update forward-looking statements.","This morning's press release provides the highlights of our results. We also have the Quarterly Earnings Review document available on our website, which provides a quarterly review of the total company and individual businesses. We will be using the Quarterly Earnings Review document to discuss our results.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Gerald. Gerald?","Gerald L. Hassell","Thanks, Andy, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. For the quarter, we generated net income of $619 million and earnings per share of $0.52, which compares to $0.50 in the first quarter of last year and $0.42 in the fourth quarter of 2011. ","Total revenues were up 6% sequentially. If you exclude the Shareowner Services business that we sold right at year end 2011, on a reported basis, revenue was up 3%. Now that improvement reflected the solid sequential growth in investment management and investment services fees. We clearly benefited from new business coming on board and improved market values.  Now we achieved that growth in spite of the fact that levels of client activity remained lower than normal. Now as an indicator of that, volumes -- indicator of the volumes, the combined share volume on the New York Stock Exchange, the net effect was down 17% year-over-year and 10% sequentially. ","Lower volatility in the currency markets also negatively impacted our foreign exchange and investment services fee revenues. Most of our other core investment services metrics showed positive trends. And in investment management, the key metrics we focus on are flows and investment performance. We had our 10th consecutive quarter of positive long-term flows of $7 billion, and we're pleased to see nice improvements in the performance of our U.S. equity products.  So overall, the trends remain encouraging. While we can't control market conditions, we made good progress in controlling what we can, which is winning new business, managing our expenses carefully and strengthening our balance sheet. ","On the new business front, in addition to the positive long-term flows and investment management, Asset Servicing had its strongest quarter in terms of new business wins in 12 months. I should also mention that during the quarter, in Asset Servicing, we were ranked #1 in our peer group in terms of service quality in both the R&M and global custody surveys. That speaks to our success of maintaining our focus on our clients as we transform the Asset Servicing business to simultaneously improve the client experience and business profitability. In fact, our quality scores rose year-over-year, which is encouraging. ","On the expense front, we're seeing the early benefits of our operational excellence initiatives. On an operating basis, total expenses were up 4% sequentially, which mostly reflected higher litigation and legal expenses and some seasonal staff expense.  On an operating basis, again adjusting for the sale of Shareowner Services, revenues were up 6% sequentially while expenses were up 4%, producing 200 basis points of positive operating leverage.  In terms of capital, we generated nearly $700 million of Basel I Tier 1 common, and we delivered a strong 21% return on that increased level of equity. We also repurchased more than 17 million shares during the quarter. ","The strength of our balance sheet was borne out by the results of the latest Fed stress test, which reflects the strength of our business model and the excellent quality of our balance sheet. The results also show our continuing ability to return capital to our shareholders while maintaining our strong capital position.  As a result, there was no objection to our annual capital plan, which includes the continuation of our current dividend and the repurchase of up to $1.16 billion of outstanding common stock in the next 12 months. This is consistent with a combined dividend and share buyback ratio of 60% to 65% that we have discussed at our Investor's Day. ","So again, nice progress in those areas that we can control. Looking ahead, we continue to believe the lower level of client activity is a cyclical issue and that our fee revenue should recover quickly as we return to normal levels of activity.  In the meantime, we're focused on delivering a high-quality service and high standard of investment performance to support our revenue growth, reducing our cost through operational excellence initiatives and maintaining our financial strength, which is enabling us to rapidly return capital to shareholders. ","So in summary, it was a solid quarter, and we're delivering on all of the items we laid out for you back in November at our investor conference. So with that, let me turn it over to Todd to go through the numbers.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Thanks, Gerald, and good morning, everyone. As in the past, my comments will follow the Quarterly Earnings Review, and let's start on Page 2.  As I take you through the results, keep in mind that the first quarter of 2012 is the first quarter without our Shareowner Services business, which we divested at the end of last year, in fact, at the end of December.  As a result, many of my comments around fee revenue and noninterest expense will actually exclude the impact of Shareowner Services. I would also note that we have adjusted some of our disclosures on those schedules to reflect this divestiture. ","We had a solid quarter. Earnings were $0.52, which is a good reflection of our core performance, as we had higher litigation and legal expenses, and also had the impact, seasonal impact, of our equity compensation programs, and they were offset by an increase in securities and leasing gains.  This compares to $0.50 in the first quarter of 2011 and $0.42 in the fourth quarter. Recall that the fourth quarter included a restructuring charge. ","Highlights on a sequential basis. Total revenue was $3.6 billion, up 3%. If you exclude Shareowner Services, it was up 6%. Investment Services fees were also up 3% and also 6% excluding Shareowner Services. That increase was primarily due to improved market values, higher volumes and net new business.  Investment management fees, excluding the impact of the seasonal performance fees in the fourth quarter were up 7%, driven by higher market values and net new business. FX and other trading was down 16% due to the significantly decreased volatility in the first quarter. Net interest revenue was off 2%. That largely reflects a bit of a smaller balance sheet and lower accretion, both of which were partially offset by increased investments in the high-quality investment securities portfolio. The provision for credit losses was $5 million. Noninterest expense for the quarter was down 3% on a GAAP basis but up 4% excluding amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges, M&I expenses and most importantly, the direct expenses related to Shareowner Services. ","We did a pretty good job of controlling expenses during the quarter. The increase was primarily driven by higher litigation and legal expenses and the seasonal impact of stock awards, as I'll get into in just a minute. ","But first, turning to Page 4, we will call out some of the business metrics that help explain how our underlying performance is going. Here, you can see that AUM increased 4% sequentially and 6% year-over-year to a new record level of $1.3 trillion, with long-term inflows of $7 billion in the quarter. It benefited from strength in fixed income and actively managed equity assets. It was our 10th consecutive quarter of positive long-term inflows. While the level of long-term flows is lower than in some recent quarters, we saw a shift toward more active asset classes, which have higher fee realization.  Assets under custody was up 3% sequentially and 4% year-over-year, also to a record level of $26.6 trillion, driven by net new business and higher market values.  Most of the key metrics showed solid growth on a year-over-year basis. Loans and deposits are up. DR programs are up modestly, and most clearing and broker-dealer services metrics are up substantially. So the fundamentals that we control remain strong. However, there continues to be softness in volumes in volatility, and it has impacted our investment services business.  ","Looking at page -- the fees on Page 6, Asset Servicing fees were up 7% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. That's reflecting net new business and sequentially higher domestic equity markets as well as higher lending revenue, which was driven by better spreads.  We had our best new business quarter in 4 quarters with $453 billion in new AUC wins. Over the last 12 months, new assets under custody wins have now totaled $1.2 trillion, with approximately $450 billion yet to be converted. Most of those conversions, we expect to occur over the next 3 months.","Issuer service fees, excluding the Shareowner Services business, were down -- excuse me, up 2% sequentially and down 14% year-over-year. Sequentially higher DR revenue was partially offset by lower corporate trust fees. The year-over-year decrease resulted from lower money market fees and lower corporate trust fees. Those lower fees are driven by weakness in structured products, and we also saw a little lower DR revenue year-over-year. Our clearing fees were up 9% sequentially and up 4% year-over-year. The sequential increase primarily reflects higher trading volumes and growth in mutual fund assets. The year-over-year increase was driven by net new business and growth in mutual fund assets and retirement accounts, which was partially offset by lower trading volumes. So there were lower trading volumes year-over-year but higher sequentially, and there were also higher money market fee waivers on a year-over-year basis. ","Turning to investment management fees. It is important to understand the impact of the overall AUM on our level of fees. We do have a balanced AUM mix with roughly 1\/3 in equities, 35% in fixed income, 24% in money markets and the remainder in alternatives and overlay. In addition, we have a significant portion of assets under management that are impacted by global markets, more in international markets. Given these dynamics, roughly 50% of annualized investment management fees are actually correlated to equity markets.  Of that total, over 2\/3 are priced on a daily or monthly basis.  The average level of market indices is important. As noted earlier, our boutique-managed assets across international emerging markets, the value of the FTSE and MSCI indices are just as important as the S&P 500. ","Looking at the first quarter 2012 results, investment management fees excluding performance fees were up 7% sequentially and down 2% year-over-year. The sequential increase reflects the impact of net new business. The year-over-year decrease reflects higher money market fee waivers, partially offset by net new business. Equity values benefit investment management fees sequentially. That had little impact year-over-year and you can see this from the metrics. The S&P, FTSE and MSCI indices were up sequentially, both on a spot and average basis. But year-over-year, the S&P increased, but the FTSE 100 and MSCI indices were down, both on a spot and average basis. ","As we've reported in the past, fee waivers continue to impact a number of our businesses, and our estimated aggregate impact to EPS this quarter was about $0.06. In FX and other trading, revenue was down year-over-year and sequentially. And when we look at the underlying components, FX revenue totaled $136 million. That's a decrease of 26% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. Sequentially, volumes were flat, but volatility decreased substantially, while the year-over-year decrease primarily reflects both lower volumes and volatility. The standing instruction alternative continues to be very important to our clients. Although we saw a decline year-over-year on the use of standing instructions as a percentage of all transactions, it increased sequentially.  Other trading revenue was $55 million compared to $45 million in the fourth quarter and $25 million in the year-ago quarter. Both increases were primarily driven by a high fixed-income trading. ","Investment and other income totaled $139 million in the quarter. That compares with $146 million in the prior quarter and $81 million in the year-ago quarter. Sequentially, it was down slightly, and that's because of the $98 million pre-tax gain on the sale of Shareowner Services in the fourth quarter, and that was somewhat offset by leasing and seed capital gains in the first quarter of 2012. The leasing and seed capital gains also accounted for the year-over-year increase. ","Turning to page 8 of the earnings review. NIR was down $15 million sequentially and up $67 million versus the year ago quarter. The sequential decrease was primarily driven by lower average client deposits, a little lower accretion and that was partially offset by increased investments in our high-quality investment securities. This is consistent with what we told you what our NII strategy was going to be during investment -- Investor Day presentation in November.  I should add that we had expected, as occurred, deposits to contract from the sharp rise that we saw late in -- at the end of the fourth quarter, so those deposits did leave us. ","The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher average client deposits, increased investments in securities and higher loan levels, partially offset by lower accretion and narrower spreads. We would expect deposit volumes to continue to be volatile due to the uncertainty of the global financial markets and the potential for regulatory changes as we look forward. The net interest margin was 1.32% compared with 1.27% in the fourth quarter and 1.49% in the year-ago quarter. The sequential increase reflects increased investments in the securities portfolio and a decrease in lower-yielding interest-bearing deposits with banks.  The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by the increasing client deposits, nearly half of which were invested in liquid but very low-yielding assets. ","Turning to Page 9, you can see the total noninterest expense. And here, if you exclude intangible assets, restructuring, M&I and, most importantly, the direct expenses related to Shareowner Services, it was up 4% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. The biggest driver for the increase was litigation and legal expense, which was up $60 million sequentially and $70 million year-over-year. The sequential and year-over-year increase also reflect higher incentive expense due to the vesting of long-term stock awards for retirement-eligible employees as well as higher pension expense.  As Gerald noted, we are beginning to realize the benefits of our operational excellence initiatives, as reflected in lower business development, professional and other purchase services, compensation, net occupancy and software and equipment expense. ","Page 10 details our capital ratios.  Our estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio was up 50 basis points to 7.6% at quarter end. The improvement was driven by an increase in the value of our investment securities portfolio, earnings retention and lower risk-weighted assets, partially offset by share buybacks and dividends. Our Basel 1 Tier 1 common equity ratio was 13.9% at year end, also up 50 basis points from the end of December, driven primarily by earnings retention from the approximately $680 million of Basel 1 equity generated during the quarter. ","On Page 11, you can see that our investment securities portfolio continued to perform quite well. The pre-tax net unrealized gain in our securities portfolio increased by $389 billion to $1.2 billion. Looking now at our loan portfolio, you'll see that the provision for credit losses was $5 million. That compares with $23 million in the fourth quarter and a 0 provision in the year-ago quarter, and NPAs have declined from $341 million to $331 million. The effective tax rate of 28.7% compared with 29.3% in the year ago quarter. ","So looking ahead, in the second quarter, we should see a seasonal increase in DRs and securities lending revenues. NII should be relatively stable depending on the size of our client deposits. Fee waiver should be consistent with the last couple of quarters. The quarterly provision should be in the range of $0 million to $15 million. We continue to be focused on driving the expense savings through our operational excellence initiatives that we've laid out with you. We also expect to continue repurchasing shares in the second quarter. And as always, the time will depend on market conditions. The tax rate in the second quarter of 2012 should also be approximately 29%.","So with that, let me turn it back to Gerald.","Gerald L. Hassell","Thanks, Todd. And I think we can now open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Gerald, I was hoping you could update us on the pricing dynamics and how those dialogues with clients are going and, I guess, when we could see a little bit more of a tangible result on the servicing pricing?","Gerald L. Hassell","Sure, Alex, thanks. I'll start, and then if Tim Keaney wants to jump in. We're still in the very early stages of it. I think, as we laid out for you in last November, we're beginning with the smaller clients. We're working through that process. On a net basis, we're positive, but it's a long drawn-out process. We want to make sure we're handling it the right way and we're getting good information from the clients on how they react to it and -- but on a general basis, it's been net positive, and we're off to a good start. Tim, do you want to add anything?","Timothy F. Keaney","Sure, Joe. Yes, as you mentioned, we're starting at the smaller client range. We've identified a universe of about 700 clients to go after first. We're about 50% through that process. We hope to be done to the entire universe in June. We've had about a 70% success rate, keeping clients at an increased rate. And I'm also encouraged that we've had about 9 larger clients, so clients that pay us over $0.5 million a year or more, that have come up for review, we've retained 9 out of 9 with an increase in fees. So it's still early days.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. That's very helpful detail. And then just a follow-up on FX.  I mean, it feels like the sequential decline was a little bit larger relative to some of your peers, JPMorgan down 11, State Street flattish, Northern down 15 or so. So it feels like everybody was operating in a similar environment. Volumes were flattish. Volatility came down a lot. So something -- is there something else going on why your results are down more than 20 sequentially? Or is it just a -- or is it just a mix of business, the volatility incurrences that you are more active in was sequentially weaker?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, Alex, it's Todd. I would say it's consistent with what we have seen in the past. So the volatility impact was very direct, so the same percentage that we saw. The decline in volatility that would have impacted our earnings reflected right through to our numbers. The level of standing instruction actually rose a bit in the first quarter. But we saw, on a sequential basis, volumes, total volumes, were absolutely flat. I don't know, Tim, if you have anything to add to that.","Timothy F. Keaney","No, I would just say, Todd, looking forward, we see a huge opportunity to increase the percentage of volumes that should naturally be coming to us as custodian and asset servicer, and we're razor-focused on launching some new products to collect that volume. We're pleased with the launch of our Defined Spread program, which we launched in February. We've gotten around to about just about all the clients. Kind of it's very good news. About a little over half of the clients have decided to stay in our current range-a-day [ph] program. And about 40% or so have signed up for the new Defined Spread program. So we're watching very carefully. The key mission for us is to increase the volumes. And we're focused on launching the new products, and we'll be watching that quite carefully.","Operator","Our next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of questions. One on expenses. Could you quantify how much the cost save program impacted this quarter? And then as you're talking about the next quarter outlook, could you give us a sense as to how it's likely to trend, given that you usually have a step-up in salary in 2Q?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Sure, Betsy. The -- it's hard to decipher exactly how much the cost save program has benefited, to tease it out in its entirety. We are seeing some significant benefits on the technology front. And the best ratio that we provide, I think, that will help you look at this is if you look at our investor -- Investment Services revenues relative to the related expenses, they did move from -- revenues are now 94% of expenses versus 90% in the fourth quarter. So it looks to me like there's a 100 basis points or so would be my best guess for what we're getting out of that. And then there was the follow-up, the follow-up question was on the merit increase?","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Right.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, I think, seasonally, you're not going to see quite as much impact, because...","Gerald L. Hassell","In the second quarter.  It will show up in the third.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, it's going to show up in the third quarter. We're going to delay the increase until July 1.  And there's also -- I want to bring to your attention that the accelerated of our -- acceleration of our equity programs, there's a seasonal impact to that. So as employees near retirement age, we recognize 100% of that expense in the period that it's granted. So that had a quite a big impact, probably at least a $30 million delta to what we would see in the second quarter.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Right, okay. And then, separately, gross margins in your business and the Asset Servicing business obviously improved, which is different from what we've seen from other folks. Could you kind of speak to what you're doing there to drive that kind of result? And obviously, you've had the repricing, but you mentioned it's early days. So there must be something else going on there.","Gerald L. Hassell","I think, Betsy, it's really a function of good expense management.  And Tim can talk to it a little bit more, but last fall, we started -- not started, but we really focused in on reducing the expense base and the employee base to better match the revenue growth that we were experiencing. And so I think those programs have kicked in, and it's really been principally on the expense side, controlling that as new revenues are coming on board, and so that's allowed for the margin to expand.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. But even your gross margins have extended as well if I'm just looking at fees over AUC.","Gerald L. Hassell","I'm sorry, can you repeat it?","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Even gross margins have expanded recently if I'm looking at fees over AUC.","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes, higher margins.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, if you notice that our assets under custody are up about 3% sequentially. And I think you'll see out that our revenues are up about 6% sequentially in Asset Servicing. So Tim, you might want to comment on that.","Timothy F. Keaney","Yes, Betsy, it's really a mix point. We've been talking about this now a few quarters in a row. We've been winning a lot of new business in middle-office outsourcing and transfer agency, which really aren't geared to AUC. I think you see the opposite kind of playing through in the year-on-year results, but it's definitely a business mix point that you're -- you have raised.","Operator","Our next question is from Cynthia Mayer with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Maybe just to follow up on that briefly, I think you said that something like $30 million in the comp was from the upfront expensing of the equity awards. If all told, how much of the comp expense was seasonal?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, I would say that's about what the seasonality was. I think that's -- it kind of nets out to about that number, Cynthia.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Nothing beyond that, okay. And you mentioned also that you expect stable NII.  Depending on -- or NIM depending on deposits. So what kind of trend are you seeing so far this quarter? And what do you regard as sort of a normalized rate or normalized level?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, okay, I think normalized in this abnormal environment is about where we are. So in a 0-rate environment, it feels like about 130 to 135 type of range is what we could squeeze out of the NIM. But there are a lot of factors that will impact that, because if we see a shot, one way or the other, we could see balances grow. But if we don't see any meaningful change in behavior or any meaningful change in interest rates, our balance sheet seems to be behaving pretty stable at about this level, which is about where we closed to the third quarter -- it's about where we closed to the first quarter, I'm sorry.","Gerald L. Hassell","About $300 billion is the -- probably the average balance sheet size. The fourth quarter, we saw the spike in deposits when everyone was bleeding cash with us, and that's more normalized. So the $300 billion range in the net interest margin and this 130 to 140 is probably about right.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, maybe on the issuer services post the sale of Shareowner Service -- the Shareowner business.  Is that kind of a good run rate at this point?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, that line is now issuer services. It's just 2 of our underlying business. It's Corporate Trust and DRs. And Karen Peetz, the head of that business, is with us.  Karen, any comments there?","Karen B. Peetz","Yes, I mean, about half of the decline on the first quarter was corporate trust.  About half was DRs. Corporate trust has to do with the markets, and the global debt markets were flat for the quarter, and the U.S. market, though, showed some improvement. It was up about 2%. And we also had 12 CLOs for the first quarter. So that was very encouraging. So in that business, we are very much looking to decrease expenses and manage risk. And in the DR business, of course, that's emerging-market-related, and it's also impacted by our corporate actions.","Thomas P. Gibbons","So there's just a little less corporate action there. So the...","Karen B. Peetz","Yes, and global M&A is down.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Cynthia, I'd say the DR business is pretty volatile because it's episodic with corporate actions, and so that's a little harder for us to forecast.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Right, okay. And sounds like, overall, maybe cyclically depressed still a little bit.  So could bounce back, but as you say, volatile.","Thomas P. Gibbons","It is. I mean, it's -- and it's a reflection of activity that's going on primarily in the emerging markets. Corporate trust is a reflection of what's going on in the debt issuance. And with the lack of a structured debt market, it's a little more challenging.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Casey Haire - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","It's actually Casey filling in for Ken. Just a question, I guess, following up on the NII outlook. How much -- with the understanding that the balance sheet is probably at a right size, how much of the NIM improvement was due to just the excess liquidity drag coming off versus a slightly more aggressive investment strategy?","Thomas P. Gibbons","I'd say it's about half and half, Casey.","Casey Haire - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, got you. And then within expenses -- and there's a couple of specials within -- on the fee side, the investment income, obviously, was pretty high. And then on the expense side of things, the other line was pretty high -- due to the litigation expense. What do you see as kind of a good run rate going forward for these lines?","Thomas P. Gibbons","I think lower for both, hopefully.","Casey Haire - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, on capital.  The $1.16 billion for CCARs, are you looking to do that pretty ratably throughout the year? And then if you could share any thoughts as to why no dividend hike.","Thomas P. Gibbons","I'll take the -- when we submitted the CCAR, you do submit it on a quarterly basis, and our plan is to do it ratably throughout the course of the year and, actually, over the following 4 quarters, because now it does really stem into the first quarter of next year, so it's a continuous 4 quarters. In terms of the dividend hike, I mean, we had indicated at November that we'd be in the 20% to 25% range as a payout. And I think, we're -- given where consensus is, we're falling into that range. I don't know, Gerald, if you have anything to add.","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes, just a couple of quick comments on that. I think we were, as we are -- we tend to be relatively conservative in our approach to capital plan. When we submitted the plan, we did not want to break any ratios, even under a stressed environment. We also wanted to maintain that 20% to 25% payout for dividend and 60% to 65% payout in total, including buybacks. We were well within that -- within those numbers, even in a stress scenario. And I think it just shows the resiliency of our business model and the flexibility we have going forward. So time will tell on what we'll do beyond what the plan is today.","Operator","Our next question is from Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a follow-up on that fairly large buyback approval you have. Assuming just no more frictional deposit roll-off, when does leverage become a potential constraint again, as we saw a little bit when the market was choppier at the end of the year?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, we're up to a 560 leverage ratio. So we're pretty comfortable with where we are right now. We can actually take on quite a significant increase in deposits. And so we build, I mean, as you can see, we're building even with this type of activity. So we bought back a lot in the first quarter and paid our dividend. We continue to build both tier -- Basel I and Basel III capital. So we think that's much -- going to be much, much less of a constraint for us on a go-forward.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And given the world's just fragile, Todd, I mean, what is that kind of like leverage constraint or target that we should be thinking about in the back of our minds...","Thomas P. Gibbons","I'd like to see us keep it above 5.25 or so. We have gotten as low as 5, 5.2, 5.10, something like that.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then another one on the numbers.  Apologies if I missed this in your remarks. But leasing and seed capital gains were elevated again. I know that's probably the core business. But could you just provide some more detail on all of that and maybe your outlook for the sustainability of that going forward?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes. In the other income line, you can see we've had some volatility that's probably been in the $60 million to $150 million type of range, depending on some of the one-off items like seed capital, the sale of Shareowners Services, the -- and we do from time to time as we're winding down our lease portfolio sell off some of those leases at a gain. I think the normalized, what's the normal in that line item?  It's probably in the $80 million to $100 million range.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just final one for me. As the statute of limitations is ending here, it appears we're seeing some more mortgage-related lawsuits for the industry targeted at more the trustee rather than the originator. Gerald, I know you've made some fairly strong statements on all of this at the Investor Day. But I'm just curious if you had any evolved thoughts on that and how you all are preparing for some of this that's coming down the industry pipeline.","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes, no, we continue to feel very good about our position as trustee as these cases have been going through the process. As you may have seen, we got a favorable ruling here in the state of New York around the BofA settlement. I think it endorsed, again, our role as trustee and the limitations of our liabilities. So we still feel quite good about our position as trustee in these situations.","Operator","Our next question is from John Stilmar with SunTrust.","John W. Stilmar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just one quick question for you. Obviously, deposit outflows have been persistent across the space. I was wondering, given your vantage point, have you any sense as to where those flows are moving back into? I mean, obviously, we've seen some volumes trying to move into equities, and there's a general re-risking theme. But are most flows moving back into 2a-7 funds? Or where does this capital that's been sloshing around the system that's sitting on your balance sheet, where does it kind of ending up today?","Thomas P. Gibbons",",","I'd say, generally, it is a re-risking theme, John. Let me turn this one over to Curtis Arledge, our Head of Asset Management. Curtis?","Curtis Y. Arledge","Yes, we've definitely seen flows out of those deposits and money funds generally moving back into re-risking. Flows have been into international equity markets and bond markets. So there's definitely been a theme of investors who are re-risking being more diversified in their approach. It's hard to know exactly where deposit flows and money flows go. But from AUM flows, there is some re-risking going on.","John W. Stilmar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And then, given the fact that you have your strong position with your clients and the balance sheet, there's always a debate about whether the custodians have the ability to potentially cross-sell their asset management business to some of those deposit bases. How would you say your ability to retain those deposit outflows from the balance sheet back into sort of some of your Bank of New York asset management businesses? Can you talk about where those funds might have been recaptured and that as a potential opportunity to grow the asset management AUM or prepay AUM?","Curtis Y. Arledge","Yes, I mean, we obviously, have clients that have relationships across many of our asset management boutiques. And when they have a relationship with us and they also use our money funds or our deposits to hold cash, we're always talking to them about their holistic needs, whether they are positioned well against their liabilities, do they have the appropriate amount of diversification, again, around their global portfolios. And I'd say we're actually making real progress. It's one of -- I'd say it's one of the biggest opportunities for us as a company is to continue to mine the holistic relationship. Clients can hold cash with us. They can also invest across a wide array of equity and fixed-income products. We're going to be announcing later this week a new head of our client distribution function, really to continue to work very closely with the investment services team around broad relationships, and so I think it's a really big opportunity for us.","John W. Stilmar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Would you say that the progress now is better than it was maybe a year ago in terms of being able to capture that [indiscernible]?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, absolutely, yes.","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes, John, I'd just add on to that. I'm quite encouraged with how the teams are collaborating across the businesses and really focusing on the client and the client needs and whether it's investment management providing products for those who are looking to invest their monies or a variety of different other services that we offer to our clients. I just think we're really working much better together across our businesses, and at the seams of our business is to provide solutions to our clients.","Operator","Our next question is with Brian Bedell with ISI Group.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Todd, you were talking about the excess deposit trends and potential impact of regulatory changes on that. Could you just elaborate a little bit more? And also the non-interest-bearing deposits obviously declined a lot on a period-end basis. Do you think that's sort of just noise? Or is that indicative of a substantial downward direction into the second quarter?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Sure, Brian. Why don't I start with the last question. I think the period-end point was really a spike, and it was a spike in the fourth quarter, and that was mostly noise. I think there was a little bit of a move into risky assets, as we just discussed. In terms of the -- looking out, I mean, there are a couple of things to look at that could have different impacts, I would say, on the deposit base. One would be if there is a significant -- if the rating agencies significantly downgrade other financial institutions, we may see more deposits directed here. Another item is what I mentioned, regulatory reform, both money market reform and, for that matter, FDIC insurance. So depending on what happens, whether there's an extension of the significant FDIC insurance that exists today, that could be -- could go either way for us, since we're so -- since we have such a strong balance sheet, we could end up seeing more deposits, or you could see the deposits moving elsewhere into some other lower-risk type of assets, such as treasuries. In terms of money market reform, you could -- depending on how significant it was, obviously, that will take some time. You could see a move out of money markets into the deposit base. So there's a lot of uncertainty and variables that -- which is what I was alluding to there.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then on the money fund reform, you wouldn't see any impact in that to at least 2013, I would think.  Is that what you're understanding also?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes. Curtis, you might be in a better position to answer that.","Curtis Y. Arledge","Yes, no, I think that we -- 6 months ago, I would have thought that there might have been something in place by the end of the year. As all of you have read, the SEC proposals or suggested proposals, they're still, I think, discussing with themselves exactly what they're going to put out. So I do think it's going to be more of a 2013 implementation here. Obviously, there are other regulators besides the SEC that are focused on this. So we do think that something is forthcoming. But I think the industry has definitely helped the regulators understand the dynamics of floating NAV, the challenges that, that would create, both operationally and really limit the convenience of the product. And so there's a lot of active dialogue going on, as you well know, but I think it will take the rest of this year, really, to figure it out.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then a question for Tim on the -- on Asset Servicing. Obviously, the growth's pretty good at 6.5%, linked-quarter. Can you describe what contribution came from broker-dealer services in terms of the growth? Or was that mostly really driven by the mix shift that you alluded to as converted over the middle office? And then the new business that you are still bringing on this, the $400-plus billion still yet to be converted, how should we think of that from a revenue capture rate relative to your overall capture?","Timothy F. Keaney","Yes, Brian, I would say overall, broker-dealer services was a small portion of the story. I think it's absolutely a net new business and flow story. I think Todd might have mentioned the $450 billion still to convert. We converted just over $300 billion in the last quarter. We expect to convert what hasn't been converted in the next 3 months, and it's an excellent mix of business. It's good, solid, core fee business in middle office outsourcing custody and transfer agency. And I think as we've talked about before, that's really sticky business.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And the 70% success rate that you mentioned.  Can you just define exactly what that is? Is that 70% retention or success relative to your objective?","Timothy F. Keaney","Yes, the 70% of the clients have agreed to the repricing, Brian. And of the clients that haven't yet, that doesn't mean they won't. A very small majority, a very small number of the clients, pardon me, that have said they're leaving us actually haven't told us whether or not they found a custodian to take the business. So it's 70% have accepted our new pricing. And as I mentioned, we're only halfway through that 700-client base. So it's still early days. And I'm just reminded to say it's a very different story at the high end of the business. So the largest clients that are multiproduct that are in the securities lending and foreign exchange program, it's still very, very price-competitive.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great, okay. That's very helpful. And just a couple of housekeeping ones.  The level of discount accretion on interest revenue in the quarter and also the money fund fee waivers on pre-tax income?","Timothy F. Keaney","Yes, the accretion was down a bit to about $80 million on the quarter, and that's probably about where it should run for the next few quarters. And the fee waivers were just about flat with the fourth quarter, maybe slightly improved. And that's costing us somewhere between $0.05 and $0.06. It's kind of in the middle of that, Brian.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Is that $70 million, about, approximately?","Timothy F. Keaney","It's actually a little bit higher than that.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Closer to $90 million?","Timothy F. Keaney","Yes.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Closer to $90, Brian.","Timothy F. Keaney","$90 is [indiscernible].","Operator","Our next question is from Glenn Schorr with Nomura.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Can we go back to asset management just for a sec and talk about what products are just bringing in the money? You noted the last -- what, 10 quarters in a row of positive, long-term flows. It seems pretty consistent. Can you just talk about what the greatest asset gatherers are?","Timothy F. Keaney","Yes. And actually, I think it's really important to understand the composition of the flows, because -- too often, I think we use AUM as a blunt instrument to describe what's going on. If you go back to a year ago, first quarter of 2011, a lot of the flows were very much index-oriented and fixed-income-, sort of low-fee-oriented. So we actually had a $31 billion positive flow a year ago and it generated about $26 million in net annual revenues. The flows have definitely shifted more toward active mandates, again, with an international flavor. Both international stock and international bond flows have been favorable. And then within bond flows, we've seen more of a move to emerging market debt. That's true for us. I think those trends are generally true for the industry. We are well-positioned. We have good performance, good investment teams in those categories. So the flow numbers are not necessarily as big. The $7 billion of long-term flows this quarter actually generated more net annual revenues. So I really do think it's important to understand both the AUM and the net revenue composition of the flows. And again, I think it's too early to say that people are re-risking aggressively, but there absolutely is a shift away from more passively conservative-oriented products to investors, thinking that at least some of the chaos and volatility is behind them and they are putting money back to work, maybe to eventually earn a return, and in a low-rate, low-return environment, they are deploying more capital.","Gerald L. Hassell","And I'd say, Glenn, just add to it. Again, the beauty of our business model is we have a whole series of boutiques with a variety of different investment strategies. And so as people shift their thought process to different types of asset classes, we're able to capture those flows and internalize it.","Timothy F. Keaney","One of the -- maybe one other point I would make is that there definitely is also a trend away from investors buying products, and they are definitely looking more for solutions. The types of investment offerings that we have that appeal to them really are in the absolute-return, asset-allocation, real-return categories. So I mean, the balance fund of old is, in many ways, making a comeback as investors really are spending more time looking at their liabilities and trying to find a solution that is well-matched to it. And again, we have a number of investment offerings there. I'd actually say it also fits BNY Mellon well as a firm. The clients are trying to figure out what is my overall solution? They're actually asking who understands my overall needs? And when you have a large institution where you are both their asset servicer and manage a lot of their assets, you tend to be one of those people who really does have a holistic perspective on the entire client issue.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","All right, I appreciate that. The $60 million increase in litigation cost.  Is there any allocation you can give us towards what that's for? I know Howard pointed out some of the ongoing mortgage issues, but you also have that STARS case picking up steam.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, there's -- no, Glenn, we really -- I don't think it would be in our interest to disclose which items any of the provisions are related to.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And on that front, my gut it's the same answer, but have you given us a number on what your total litigation reserve is right now?","Thomas P. Gibbons","No, we have not.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just making sure, on the STARS tax case, there's no reserve against that, correct?","Thomas P. Gibbons","No, we have not indicated what our provisions are. But we do give a very clear indication with what the potential risk to us is on STARS. By the way, that trial just began this week, and we continue to believe we've got a very strong tax position there.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. Last one, the jump-up -- this is not a this-quarter issue but just more making sure.  The jump-up from Basel I risk-weighted assets to Basel III, it's bigger for you guys than a lot of other companies.  Is that just the low-rated securities in the investment portfolio that eventually run off?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, it's really -- there's 2 contributors there. We have a little higher operational risk, I would think, than average. But by far, the largest contributor is the treatment of the sub-investment-grade securities portfolio, and that portfolio was almost $4 billion. It's attracting about the equivalent of $50 billion of risk-weighted assets. So that's burning off a few billion dollars of risk-weighted assets a quarter.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Got it. And obviously, that's incorporated into the capital plan CCAR process?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes.","Gerald L. Hassell","That's correct.","Operator","Our next question is from Andrew Marquardt with Evercore Partners.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Back to the margin.  Can you just remind me, apologies if I missed it, the amount of excess deposits that you guys are thinking about that are still sitting on your balance sheet? How do we think about that potentially in a more normalized environment?","Gerald L. Hassell","Well, again, I think we are in a more normalized balance sheet environment. We have to remind you all that right at year end last year, we had a significant spike in deposits, as everyone was in a risk-off mode. We probably had $20 billion to $30 billion of \"excess deposits\" right at year end.  That has more normalized and burned off, so to speak, and we're running at an average balance sheet in the $300 billion range, and that feels about normal for us, given our client activities.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then you had mentioned that the discount accretion this quarter was about $80 million and that should hold for the next couple of quarters. After that, will that trend lower? Or how do we think about that?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, the -- that's probably got about a -- it will slowly trend lower as you see prepayments in that portfolio. So you can pretty much just look at it as a yield adjustment on a portfolio at a little -- that's now a little over $3 billion, and that's probably amortizing at about 20% per annum. So you can just look at it that way, Andrew.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then you had mentioned the normalized margin in an abnormal environment is now 130, 135. Remind us the normalized -- in a normalized environment, should that still be in the 160, 180 that you had mentioned at your Analyst Day?","Thomas P. Gibbons","I think it would be, Andrew. That's our best guess. There's probably still some deposits here, some free deposits that are here because of this \"extremely low interest rate\" environment. That if we do go into a normal environment of a \"couple of hundred basis point\" Fed funds rate, we'd see a little smaller balance sheet, but we'd see a heck of a lot higher yield on it.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it. And does that include or exclude the discount accretion benefit?","Thomas P. Gibbons","You can -- it would -- basically, before I think we're going to see that environment, that discount accretion is going to have burned off. So I think we can pretty much the -- what we tried to point out in November is we're adding -- we're putting some assets to work at enough yield to offset the discount accretion burn-off.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. And then just lastly, in terms of the expense initiative that's gaining traction, how do we think about the ability to achieve positive operating leverage this year in still what is still a tough revenue environment? Is it possible to get positive operating leverage with that new initiative in this environment?","Gerald L. Hassell","It certainly is our goal. And just as we laid out for you in our Investor Day in November, even in a slow-growth environment with the kicking-in of our initiatives, we expect to produce positive operating leverage over the course of the year.","Operator","Our next question is from Greg Ketron with UBS.","Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. One on -- in general, you've touched on this a couple of times this morning, but pricing overall.  As you have built a very nice pipeline, we've heard a couple of people talk about looking at pricing and trying to improve the pricing that exists out in the marketplace. Are you seeing any better pricing as you move forward on bidding on contracts?","Thomas P. Gibbons","I'll take this real quick, and then we can turn it over.  The -- of our businesses, the one that's getting the most attention in regard to pricing is Asset Servicing. We're not seeing a lot of pricing pressure or noise elsewhere. So for us, our Asset Servicing business is 25% to 30% of our business. And I think that's gotten the most volume on this topic. So Tim, you want to address it further?","Timothy F. Keaney","Sure, Todd, I think I just -- maybe at the risk of repeating myself a little bit. I think on the very largest end of the market, the very large clients by asset terms that are looking to leverage a number of our products and services, including securities lending and foreign exchange, it's just still really competitive. But for us, it's about trying to do more business with those firms, given the range of products and services that we have. I have seen a bit more pricing pressure when you get to smaller clients and unbundled clients. So I think that's probably the best way to characterize it at this point. And if there's an area where there might be still a little bit of pricing and rationality, I would say, it's just generally in the public fund sector. And as we've said before, we're just staying incredibly disciplined, making sure that every client, no matter what size it is, is hitting our minimum profit thresholds. And if that means we lose a couple of clients, we lose a couple of clients.","Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. And then if we can get an update on the asset sensitivity.  You had mentioned the fee waivers have reached maybe close to $90 million a quarter.","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes, the -- it is a little higher than we had indicated in the past. What we had indicated historically for the past number of quarters here is that 100-basis-point immediate shift in short-term interest rates would have something like a $500 million pre-tax income impact to us, assuming there wasn't a significant change in our client behavior. That number is probably a little higher now. It's probably over $600 million.","Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Over $600 million, up 100 basis points?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Yes.","Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And would that just be the revenue impact? Or would that include also any related expenses like comp on the higher revenue?","Thomas P. Gibbons","Greg, that includes our best guess at related expenses. That's pre-tax.","Operator","Our final question today is from Jeff Hearte with Sandler O'Neill.","Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","On the FX, a theme we have been hearing from kind of bank FX trading operations has been a lot of margin compression in developed markets, but things going a little better in the emerging markets. Can you talk a bit about to what extent your franchise touches the emerging markets versus being very developed-market-centric in FX trading?","Gerald L. Hassell","Yes, we provide FX services across all the markets, the developed and emerging, to a pretty broad-based client base. And therefore, we do trade and provide capabilities across all the markets. And I think that's one of the reasons why when we describe a decline in volatility why it impacts us the way it does. And as Tim mentioned earlier, we're continuing to address the market demands and provide services that meet their needs. And it's not surprising with a low-growth environment for everyone across the board and slow economies that this kind of activity is viewed very, very competitively. So our job is to try to capture as much volume that touches us as humanly possible and to be sensitive to client demands.","Timothy F. Keaney","Yes, Jeff, we cover over 100 markets, so our revenues are very client-focused. So it depends on our -- what the business activity our clients is, and that's what's driving our revenues. But we do cover just about every conceivable market.","Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","And to the extent you cover non-, say, developed markets, is that a function of where client assets are? I mean, the FX is theoretically largely tied to asset under -- your asset under custody clients.","Gerald L. Hassell","That's exactly right. ","Well, thank you very much, everyone, for joining us this morning. If you have any further questions, please give Andy Clark or [indiscernible] a call. And we appreciate you dialing in. Have a good morning.","Operator","Thank you. If there are any additional questions or comments, you may contact Mr. Andy Clark at (212) 635-1803. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

[Operator Instructions]. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent. ","I will now turn the call over to Ms. Valerie Haertel. Ms. Haertel, you may begin.","Valerie Haertel","Good morning, and welcome to the BNY Mellon Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Charlie Scharf, our CEO; Mike Santomassimo, our CFO; and members of our executive leadership team. Our fourth quarter earnings materials include a financial highlights presentation that will be referred to in the discussion of our results and can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.","Before Charlie and Mike discuss our results, let me take a moment to remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release, the financial highlights presentation and in our documents filed with the SEC available on our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, January 18, 2018. We will not update forward-looking statements. ","Now I would like to turn the call over to Charlie.","Charles Scharf","Thank you, Valerie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let me cover a few items before turning it over to Mike, and then we will open it up for questions. As you can see, the quarter was impacted by two significant events, first, the new U.S. tax legislation added $0.41 per share this quarter; and second, a series of actions we took reduced earnings by $0.24 in the quarter. I'll talk more about this in a second. If you look beyond those items, our underlying results benefited from the strong equity markets, and we continued to show modest underlying growth in revenues and reasonable profit growth across the firm. ","I'll let Mike walk you through the detailed financial impact of the tax legislation and our other actions when he takes you through the financials, but I do want to make a few comments, first, regarding the new tax legislation. In addition to the favorable impact this quarter, we expect to see our effective tax rate go from approximately 25% to approximately 21% in 2018. We expect to reinvest the vast majority of the tax benefit in to our employees and our businesses in 2018. I will discuss this more later. In addition, we're hopeful that the increased competitiveness of corporations due to the lower effective tax rates and related investments those companies are making will result in a continued strong business environment both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S., which should prove beneficial to us. ","I've already mentioned the $246 million or $0.24 in significant items impacting our net income. The biggest piece of this was severance, which is part of a broad-based effort to improve the efficiency and effectiveness across the company. This includes the 2 significant actions we took since we last spoke, the senior management leadership changes and the changes in our U.S. asset management business. The leadership changes and organizational realignment are going very well. We've reduced layers, aligned more closely around our clients, created more business representation on our executive committee. I'm confident that these actions will enable us to serve our clients more effectively and holistically but this is a work in progress. ","We also consolidated our 3 largest asset management firms in the U.S., Mellon Capital Management, Standish Mellon Asset Management and The Boston Company, and announced the launch of a specialist multi-asset investment management firm with $560 billion of assets under management, which combines the best of these companies. This combined business will improve our positioning in the marketplace with our clients and the consulting community. Secondarily, the combination will enable us to drive efficiencies by consolidating non-investment functions such as trading and operations to continue the improvement in our margin over time. ","Aside from the tax impact and these significant items, our underlying business performance in 2017 reflected continued consistent and steady improvement, and most importantly, our client franchises continue to grow. On a segment basis, we have strong performance. Investment Management revenues grew 9%. This includes 12% in investment management fees and strong performance fees for the quarter. We were clearly beneficiaries from the strong equity markets, but we also saw some benefit from flows this quarter with net positive flows of $12 billion, including strong performance from our LDI strategy. On a full year basis, flows were up $64 billion compared to last year's outflows of $23 billion, marking a significant turnaround for this business. ","Our performance continues to improve across our active strategies with 87% of active assets under management above their 3-year benchmarks and 77% above their 5-year benchmarks for the fourth quarter. We ended the year with record assets under management of $1.9 trillion. Our full year adjusted pretax operating margin continue to improve, adjusting for the significant items. In order to maintain momentum, we will continue to develop client solutions in alternative and passive strategies to meet our clients' needs. ","Our wealth management business also performed well and also benefited from the strong markets and investments we made to grow our client-facing teams. To further our progress in wealth management, we will continue to grow our client-facing teams and continue to improve our technology platform to provide a better client interface and analytics, including mobile capabilities. ","Let me now move on to talk about Investment Services. The segment grew revenues 8%. This includes 5% growth in investment services fees. Asset servicing results were helped by the strong markets and new business, particularly in collateral management. As I've interacted with our clients, I continue to believe we have more opportunity to partner with our clients across the many services we offer. We had strong estimated new business wins this quarter of $575 billion in assets under custody administration. ","Clearing services got the benefit of rising interest rates through additional money market funds and, at the same time, grew long-term mutual fund balances by 16%, some of which was market-driven. Although we lost a couple of clients recently, the pipeline is strong. While our Depositary Receipts revenue was lower due to volumes and the timing of corporate actions, our offer remains competitive and we're continuing to win our fair share of new issues coming to the market. ","Consistent with last quarter, total revenues in our Corporate Trust business were up mid-single digits. We're continuing to invest in the business to regain our share and are seeing some green shoots to progress. Lastly, in treasury services, the fees are just part of the story. We're seeing steady, consistent growth in total revenues in the business, which includes both fees and net interest revenue, up low double digits this quarter. All in all, while it takes some work to parse through the quarter, we feel good about our underlying business results and remain very focused on driving longer-term franchise growth. ","As I've said on the third quarter call, we've undertaken a review of the company timed around the annual planning process with the goal of prioritizing opportunities to strengthen the firm. Some of the charges in our significant items this quarter are a result of that work but we expect there will be more in 2018. We are at the tail end of our review, and we'll provide an update at our March 8 Investor Day. We would expect to be in a position to provide more commentary around our growth opportunities then as well. ","As you've seen, we've had consistent revenue growth but aspire to increase the rate of growth over time while maintaining a consistent risk profile. When we meet in March, we intend to review how the parts of our company work together to provide a unique value to our clients, how we will use technology to drive our business forward, what we intend to do to continue our drive for efficiency as well as actions we will take to strengthen and streamline our infrastructure. I do want to remind you there are no silver bullets here when it comes to revenue growth, meaning any improvement in increasing the growth rate will take place over multiple years. We're focused on building our client franchise, supported by strong and innovative products, and our business is categorized by long sales cycles with relationships that last multiples longer. And I do want to reiterate an important comment I made last quarter, we like the businesses that we're in. ","Now over to Mike.","Michael Santomassimo","Thank you, Charlie. Good morning, everyone. Before I begin my prepared remarks, I would like to congratulate Todd Gibbons on his new role as CEO of Clearing, Markets and Client Management and thank him for all his hard work and accomplishments as CFO. I can attest that Todd is an aspiring leader, and I think all of us here at BNY Mellon agree the Clearing, Markets and Global Client Management business is in very capable hands. ","Turning to the quarter. It was a busy quarter on many fronts. In mid-December, we were pleased to receive a positive response to our Title I resolution plan submission from the FDIC and the Fed. The regulators acknowledged the important steps we have taken to enhance the firm's resolvability and facilitate our orderly resolution in bankruptcy. The agencies found no deficiencies or shortcomings in BNY Mellon's 2017 plan, which validates the enormous efforts we have made to enhance our resolvability. As we move forward, we will continue to maintain our focus on resolvability and resiliency. ","During the quarter, the macro environment continued to improve, and as expected, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates by 25 basis points, which slightly improved our fourth quarter net interest revenue. Additionally, the strong global equity market performance helped to drive a record quarter for AUC\/A and AUM. Also, as you are aware, the tax legislation was passed in late December. The bill is complex and will take some time to fully implement. The amounts reflected in the earnings release represent our best estimates of the impact from the legislation to date. ","With that, let me run through the details of our fourth quarter results. All comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless I note otherwise. Consistent with previous quarters, the impact from foreign currency translation had an essentially neutral impact on net income on a total company basis. ","Beginning on Slide 3. In the fourth quarter, we reported earnings per common share of $1.08. There were 2 significant items recorded in the quarter that impacted the results. First, we recorded a $427 million after-tax or $0.41 per common share gain related to the new U.S. tax legislation. And second, we also recorded a $246 million after-tax or $0.24 per share negative impact related to severance, litigation and asset impairment and the sale of certain securities in our investment portfolio, the majority of which will better position us for the future, as Charlie noted. ","Revenue of $3.7 billion was down 2%. This included a $320 million negative impact from the U.S. tax legislation and other charges, which decreased total revenue by 8%. In addition, each of our segments saw growth in revenue with investment management and performance fees increasing 13% and investment services fees up 5%. Expenses of $3 billion were up 14%. This included a $282 million pretax impact for severance, litigation and other charges, which increased expense by 11%. ","For full year 2017, we reported earnings of $3.9 billion or $3.72 per common share, up 18%. The results included revenues of $15.5 billion, which were up 2% and noninterest expenses of $11 billion, up 4%. The significant items in the quarter decreased revenue by 2% and increased expenses by 3% full year and earning -- and increased earnings per share by 5%. In addition, in the fourth quarter, we returned $900 million to shareholders via share repurchases and dividend payments and $3.6 billion in full year 2017. ","Moving to Slide 5. We will discuss the impact of the new tax legislation. The table summarizes the financial impact. I'll start there. There was a $1.2 billion tax benefit to net income associated with the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities at a lower statutory corporate tax rate of 21%. The net deferred tax liabilities were primarily associated with goodwill and intangible assets. ","The estimated repatriation tax on foreign earnings amounted to $723 million. The impact on our renewable energy investments was de minimis to net income as the pretax accounting resulted in a reduction of $279 million recorded in investment and other income, which was offset by the tax benefit from remeasurement of associated tax-deferred liabilities. The new tax legislation also reduced our regulatory capital by $551 million, driven by the repatriation tax offset by the tax benefit related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax liabilities. ","Turning to how this will impact us going forward. As Charlie mentioned, we are hopeful that the new legislation will help stimulate economic activity, which had proved to be beneficial to us and our clients over time. Our effective tax rate for 2018 is expected to be approximately 21%. We do not expect the BEAT or the Base Erosion Anti-abuse Tax to have an impact in 2018. The impact beyond 2018 is uncertain, but based on what we know today, we expect it to be immaterial. We expect to repatriate a limited amount of cash from our non-U.S. entities due to the capital and liquidity requirements of those entities. And lastly, our capital distributions in the first half of 2018 will not be impacted. The remainder of the year's buybacks will be subject to the CCAR process. ","Turning to Slide 7. The consolidated fee and other revenue was $2.9 billion, down 3% year-over-year and 10% sequentially. The U.S. tax legislation and the losses related to the sale of certain investment securities reduced fee and other revenue by 11% year-over-year. Asset servicing fees increased 6% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher equity market values; net new business, including growth in collateral management; and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. The sequential increase was primarily driven by net new business, securities lending, equity market values and money market fees. ","Clearing services fees increased 13% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primary reflects higher money market fees and growth in long-term mutual fund assets. Both periods also reflect the impact of termination fees due to lost business recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. Issuer services fees decreased 7% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower volumes, fewer corporate actions, lower fees due to reduction in shares outstanding in certain Depositary Receipt programs, primarily offset by higher Corporate Trust revenue. The 32% sequential decrease primarily reflects seasonality in Depositary Receipts revenue. Treasury services fees decreased 2% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, primarily reflecting higher compensating balance credits provided to clients that reduce fee revenue and increase net interest revenue partially offset by higher payment volumes. ","Investment management and performance fees increased 13% year-over-year and 7% sequentially, primarily reflecting higher equity market values, money market fees and performance fees. The year-over-year increase also reflects the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar principally against the British pound. On a constant-currency basis, investment management and performance fees increased 11% compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. Foreign exchange and other trading revenue increased 3% year-over-year and decreased 4% sequentially. FX revenue of $175 million was unchanged year-over-year and up 11% sequentially. Year-over-year, higher volumes were offset by lower volatility. The sequential increase was driven by higher volumes. Investment and other income decreased $278 million year-over-year, primarily reflecting the impact of U.S. tax legislation on our investments in renewable energy. As I mentioned, the net impact of U.S. tax legislation on our renewable energy investments was offset in the tax line. ","Now on Slide 8, Investment Management achieved record assets under management of $1.9 trillion, up 15% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher equity market values, the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar and net inflows. We experienced total long-term active inflows of $17 billion, driven by $23 billion of flows into our liability-driven investment strategies due to high demand from clients and $2 billion of inflows into multi-asset and alternative investments. These inflows were offset by outflows of $6 billion from active equities and $2 billion from fixed income strategies. ","Additionally, we had $1 billion in outflows from index products. We experienced cash outflows of $4 billion in the quarter. If you recall, we had cash inflows in the first three quarters. And our U.S. money market funds, the largest segment of our cash business, have grown 22% for the full year 2017. Our wealth management business continued its positive trend with fees up 9% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Higher net new business, continued loan growth, which was 7% higher year-over-year, helped to drive performance this quarter. Investment Management's adjusted pretax operating margin was 31%. The significant items in the quarter impacted the margin by just over 300 basis points. ","Now turning to Slide 9. Investment Services achieved record assets under custody and\/or administration of $33.3 trillion this quarter, up 11% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, reflecting higher market values. We estimate total new assets under custody and\/or administration business wins were $575 billion in the fourth quarter. ","Average loan balances declined 15% year-over-year, driven by higher interest rates and increased 2% sequentially. Average deposits declined 4% year-over-year, mainly the result of actively managing our deposits lower to meet regulatory ratio requirements, and increased 3% sequentially. Lastly, average tri-party repo balances grew 13% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, mainly the result of organic growth from existing clients and the onboarding of new clients. ","Turning to net interest revenue on Slide 10. You will see that on a fully taxable equivalent basis, net interest revenue of 100 -- of $862 million was up 2% from the year-ago period and up 1% from the third quarter. This resulted in a NIM of 116 basis points. This quarter included $15 million negative impact of lease-related adjustments, including $4 million related to the new tax legislation. These items reduced the NIM by 2 basis points. As a reminder the fourth quarter of 2016 was positively impacted by $25 million of interest hedging activities and a $15 million premium amortization adjustment. The impact of these items in both quarters negatively impacted the growth in NIR by 7% or the NIR would have been up 9% if you adjusted for those items discussed. We experienced moderate noninterest-bearing deposit runoff in line with our expectations following the rate increase. Interest-bearing deposits increased sequentially. ","Turning to Slide 11, you will see that noninterest expense increased 14% year-over-year and 13% sequentially. This includes $282 million pretax for severance, litigation and other charges, which increased total expense by 11%. Let me highlight a few of the year-over-year changes in the table. The sequential increase in staff expense was primarily related to higher severance expense. The year-over-year change was also impacted by higher incentive compensation expenses, driven by stronger underlying performance. The increase in software and equipment and professional, legal and other purchase service expenses was primarily the result of an asset impairment in the quarter. ","Lastly, turning to our capital and liquidity ratios on Slide 12. Our capital ratios were modestly lower due to the impact of the new tax legislation. The fully phased-in supplementary leverage ratio was 5.9%, which meets the 2018 regulatory requirement of 5% with a reasonable buffer. We also remained in full compliance with the U.S. liquidity coverage ratio requirements. Our LCR was 118% in the fourth quarter. ","Before turning to Q&A, in addition to Charlie's comments, there are a few things to factor in your models for 2018. We expect net interest revenue and the NIM to continue to benefit from higher rates and the small securities portfolio repositioning and that the benefit may be offset slightly by lower balances if noninterest-bearing deposits contract as expected. Net-net, NIR should continue to grow. The quarterly investment and other income line is expected to be in the range of $40 million to $60 million for 2018. In the first quarter, we expect to be at the higher end of the range due to the gain on the sale of our investment boutique, CenterSquare. Also, in the first quarter, I would like to remind you that staff expense will be impacted by the acceleration of long-term incentive compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees that typically takes place, the impact of which should be similar to last year. And as I mentioned, we expect our full year 2018 effective tax rate to be approximately 21%. ","With that, Charlie wants to make a few more comments about 2018.","Charles Scharf","Thanks, Mike. As we look forward to 2018, we think about our performance in 3 distinct pieces, first, any additional charges resulting from the review underway that I've spoken about; second, the impact of tax reform and the effect of investments we will make in our employees and businesses a result of the tax reform; and third, the core underlying franchise performance excluding these 2 items. While we aren't giving forecast or guidance, I thought it would be helpful to put some specificity around our thoughts for 2018 by talking about these items individually. ","First, regarding additional charges, as we finish our review of the businesses, we would expect to have additional charges during 2018. These can include severance, real estate, the impact of programs to bring more automation to our activities and other items. As of today, our expectation is that it would be something similar to the charges we reported in the fourth quarter, but this, of course, could change. ","Second, regarding the impact of tax reform, we are anticipating that the impact of the lower tax rate would be almost entirely offset by the actions we will take to reinvest this benefit in our employees and our businesses. I believe we've been prudent in how we've thought about our excess capital generation. We believe that the first call should be on building the appropriate capital base for the company; second should be on organically investing inside the company when those investments meet the appropriate hurdles; thirdly, acquisitions if they meet the same criteria; and lastly, return to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. We think we have done this and have returned in excess of $9.8 billion to our shareholders over the last 3 years. ","We still intend to return substantial capital to our shareholders this year, subject to approval through the CCAR process, but we've thought how best to use this additional ongoing benefit from the change in tax law. We believe that we've got a responsibility to our employees to share the benefit as well as to invest as much as we intelligently can to build the company for the future so we can serve all of our clients, communities and shareholders for the long term. We believe these investments are the right thing to do and good for all. This includes increasing minimum wages for all employees to $15 per hour in the U.S. and other actions we're currently contemplating. ","In addition, we intend to meaningfully increase the amount we spend on technology. We know we're a bank and are proud of it, but we're different from other banks. 75% of our company is a technology-based processing business and 25% is investment management, where technology will continue to become a more important tool for success. Our technology will define our future, and we need to ensure we're investing to create the highest quality infrastructure and a platform which allows us to both drive significant efficiencies in the future as well as be agile enough to allow us to move quickly as we expand our product offerings. We are well into this journey and seek to accelerate the effort. ","The third item is how we think about our performance excluding these items and also excluding the significant items in 2017. As an illustration, if you were to use the revenue growth included in your models, which is roughly between 3.5% to 4%, and our expectation that all other non-technology expenses would grow at a very low rate, this would result in EPS growth of low to mid-double digits, which is consistent with our actual performance over the last few years. ","Now I know this is high level but we thought it would be helpful to give you some context. As I've said several times, we hope to answer all your questions on March 8, and we'll do the best job we can. But for now, we'd love to answer whatever questions you have, especially about this quarter.","Valerie Haertel","Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken","Just a quick one here on comments initially on the tax benefit. I believe you said that your intention is to spend the 2018 benefit on investments and sharing with employees. So just wanted to tease out, does that mean that, once we get through the next 12 months, that there will be less pressure on investment and, therefore, more benefit from taxes? And then on top of that, maybe the payout rate begins to kick in from those investments and we should see improved returns. Is that the right way to think about this? Or am I reading too much into your comments, Charlie?","Charles Scharf","Thanks, Brennan, for the question. I guess the way I would say it is the way we're thinking about it is -- I mean, this is -- it's clearly a step up in the level of technology spend that we have going on at the company. So when we get to 2019, we certainly wouldn't expect to see anything like this. We would expect to see just however we would normally manage our expenses, which hopefully would be very prudently, but nothing like this. I think relative to the benefits that we would get, I think, listen, there are obviously a couple of different reasons why we spend money in the world of technology. ","We do want to make sure that we've got the right kind of infrastructure, right risk resiliency, but, certainly, to build products and to create an environment here where we can continue to gain more efficiencies. So we'll try and spend more time on this on March 8 when we have more time together. But certainly, we do hope that post 2018, we would be able to start seeing some kind of benefits, whether it's on the revenue side or the expense side, because of the amount of money that we're investing. But at this point, hard to put a number on it.","Brennan Hawken","Sure. That's fair. And not trying to front run your big day here in March, just was curious about that, whether or not that distinction was an important one, which sounds like it was. And then my follow-up, can you expand on the kind of competition for talent that you're seeing, which is compelling you to share the benefit with employees? And when you use that term sharing the benefit with employees, maybe can you expand on that a little bit? Are we talking about increases in bonus and incentive comp? Are we talking about base salary increases, which prove more durable? Just if you could frame that a little bit, that would be really helpful.","Charles Scharf","Sure. Listen, I would put a lot less -- I mean, relative to the amount of money that we're spending and the emphasis on this comment, I'd put a lot less on that, quite frankly, than on the technology piece. We do think that we should look at what's fair and right amongst our employees given the changes that were made and, certainly, what some of the goals of it are. Moving minimum wage to $15, I mean, I'd love to sit here and tell you that we're leading this country to some place where it isn't but that's not the case. It's just others have done it. We're -- we'll do what it feels like the right thing to do. And so it feels like sharing that portion with our employees is the right thing to do relative to the tax law change. Again, in the big scheme of things relative to the impact of this, it's a small number, and there are other things that we're thinking of. But I would also put them in the context of thinking of other things relative to all of our compensation plan and all of our benefits that we have here. And so I wouldn't expect anything else that we would do from your standpoint to be material. But it might -- hopefully, if we do things, it'll be things that our employees here appreciate.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.","Glenn Schorr","Just a little follow-up on the spending commentary and without running the risk of front running March 8. Could you talk at a high level of the money that you have earmarked? Is it technology and investments for expanding and improving your current mix of businesses? You mentioned things like alternatives and passive strategies earlier in asset management, but what I'm trying to get at is how much is current line of businesses. And is there anything in there for what we would just call white space businesses that BK is not in today?","Charles Scharf","I want to say almost all of it, if not all of it, is for the existing businesses that we have here as opposed to businesses that we're not in. But I would think about it in several different categories. I think about it in terms of infrastructure, I think about in terms of cyber and I think about in terms of just technology development work to expand the product set that we have here or to electronify things that are done manually, and that can be both in operations functions or in businesses where we create electronic products. The focus that we have is on continuing to build the quality of the businesses that we have and build adjacencies where we have, and that's where the money is intended to go.","Glenn Schorr","I think we've seen a lot of operating leverage and operating efficiency improvement over time. And a lot of these investments that companies in the industry have made, I think the big challenge has been getting discrete pricing on something new. It's a business where clients just take, take, take, and thank you very much. Within these investments, are there things that you think in the future you'll be able to price explicitly for?","Charles Scharf","Well, you said a couple of different things in there, and so I'll make just a couple of comments, which is, first of all, as we look at our performance in terms of where we're going in 2018 -- I want to make sure that at least there's some degree of clarity on this comment, which is we still expect to see operating leverage improvements next year even with this additional technology spend. Now obviously, it will be less than it otherwise would have been because it's a meaningful number. But when we think about the dynamics of our business and what we're shooting for, that's not something that we're just putting on hold and saying we'll revisit that in 2019. That is very much still part of our core thinking. And quite frankly, as we see the revenue environment pan out through 2018, we still have levers to pull. So when we talk about the way we're thinking about spending, you and I both know that you don't make these commitments on, what is today, January 18 and put yourself in a position not to be able to do something about it. So that's something which is still very much part of the psyche of the way we think about the company. And I know you've asked something else beyond that but...","Glenn Schorr","No, no, I definitely hear you loud and clear. Revenue should outgrow expenses, and that'll be good for margins. The tagalong question was, of the things that you're investing in, do you believe some of them will get explicit pricing as opposed to the bundled relationship that you have with these complex clients?","Charles Scharf","Yes. I'll deal with 30,000 feet. And then maybe -- Mike and Todd are here and may want to chime in a little bit. I think -- listen, I think it's a little bit of both. I mean, I think, when we think about expanding the product set that we have, whether it's improving or building adjacencies, sometimes the things that you do support the price you have in the marketplace and make you competitive when you're sitting in front of a client. Other times, they insert you into a market that you're not necessarily in. And still, there are third times when there are things that you can charge for because clients directly see the benefit of something and are willing to pay for it, and we've got examples of each. And Mike and Todd, you guys might want to talk about it a little bit.","Michael Santomassimo","Yes. Glenn, it's Mike. And while it's still pretty small in the scheme of the overall revenue base, we are seeing examples in some of the products, like collateral management, where we have been investing in more sort of innovative adjacent products to help clients optimize their collateral across the globe, and we have been able to expressly charge for that product. So I think, as Charlie said, I think it would be a mix where part of it is making sure we stay competitive to keep growing and service the clients we've got and then part of it will be things that we can expressly charge for. And we're seeing some real examples of that now. Anything to add, Todd?","Thomas Gibbons","Yes. I'd add a couple of things. I think it's actually pretty exciting, some of the opportunities we're seeing. Mike alluded to one in collateral management. We're also building out in our tri-party operations an automated rules engine so that the buy side or the sell side for that matter could more easily change margins on collateral, and therefore, we think that will enable them to do more with us. So I think it'll help the growth and not necessarily change the pricing. We're also looking into making things smoother and connecting our multiple -- our domestic and our global collaterals so clients can easily and seamlessly move collateral around the globe. That would be a unique capability that we can offer, and we think that should build greater adoption. We're investing in things like enhanced FX trading platforms. We should -- we're already seeing some benefits of improved volumes there. We're investing in real-time payments. There's quite a few choices that we have. I think the challenge is we got to pick the right ones.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein","Just another follow-up around the spending and kind of, Charlie, to your commentary around low to mid-single-digit EPS growth. And I guess the 2 questions are, a, in terms of expense flexibility, if the environment gets a little bit tougher -- obviously, we've enjoyed really nice equity market backdrop last year and continuing this year, but if things were to get a little bit tougher, how should we think about the ability to scale back on some of the initiatives or cut back on kind of the core expense base to still deliver positive operating leverage next year? That's part one. And then part two, I guess, with EPS growth commentary, this is more clarification, should we be thinking about 2017 really kind of as the core number ex all the charges, as the base to layer on sort of the low to mid-single digit -- sorry, low to mid -- double-digit EPS growth?","Charles Scharf","So a couple of things. So on the first piece, as I said a little bit earlier, I mean, there is -- we don't, as I -- we don't make budget decisions, planning decisions and then tell everyone just, \"You're done and go off and do it, and we'll see you next December when we're planning 2019.\" We have a high degree of flexibility with a significant portion, certainly, of our technology spend. I personally would like to do as much as we possibly can. If we didn't want to do it, we wouldn't be doing it, meaning we're not just sitting here saying, \"Okay, there's this big tax benefit coming through so let's go figure out how we can go spend it.\" In some respects, they're related; in some respects, they're totally independent, right, which is we've been -- you all know we've been going through this review thinking very much about what we think we need to do for the future, and we came to the determination that we think we can intelligently spend this amount of money. But as I said, there are -- it's not one big spend.","There are hundreds of discrete things that are embedded in there that we could decide to delay or go forward with in the time frame that we're planning for. So -- and then relative to the rest of the expense base, as I said in the comments, I think we're going to continue to be very, very prudent about watching everything else that we spend. And if pushed, there's probably more that we could do there as well, but that's something that we really need to think through. So as I said earlier, I think this business, run properly, creates operating leverage. That's something that we continue to believe is important. It's important for you all, but it's important for us to be able to remain relevant in terms of how we price and how we deliver our products and services. So as we look through 2018, it's very much like you're sitting in the cockpit of an airplane and we're ready to pull different levers. The way I described how 2018 could pan out is what we would like to do based upon what we know now, but we're very much willing to rethink it if circumstances warrant it. ","But again, it's what we think is prudent right now. And the second part of the question about how to think about the base, I think you captured it right, which is it's 2017 adjusted for tax and adjusted for the significant items that we spoke about. And I just want to mention one other thing real quick just as we think about 2018 because, again, we haven't thought about these things in a vacuum. One of the things that's -- I mean, which I just feel very good about the operating model that we have is, even if you exclude the tax benefit that we have for next year and when we think about, again, the -- 2018 the way it was laid out, our ability to spend this additional amount of money in technology. And if you work through the math, the effect on -- the effect of tax is something like 4 points or so on the EPS growth rate. So the ability to still get close to a double-digit EPS growth with this kind of step up in the technology spend says an awful lot about the model and the company. And then beyond that, as I said before, our anticipation is we go back to a more normalized increase year-over-year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Maybe just to circle back on the expense growth just to make sure I understand this. So just looking at sort of the tax benefit, I guess it would imply, when you do the math here, a little over $250 million of additional reinvestment spend. And if we think about how that -- so I guess, first of all, is that around what you're thinking? And then would that imply more like mid-single-digit expense growth from your core 2017 base? Or are the efficiency gains that you've achieved through your 4Q '17 actions of reducing the layers of management, improving the asset management with the consolidation and other things, creating more like a low single-digit type of core expense growth in 2018 like you've been sort of -- you've been running at?","Charles Scharf","Yes. So a little bit definitional here. I mean, meaning year-over-year, we might have had some technology increase anyway. But the way we think about it is, again, you can think -- the minimum wage increase is not a big number in the context of this. Your calculation on going from 25% to 21% is a little less than $250 million or so. And so that's a good way to think about it in terms of range, the way we're thinking about the increase in technology spend. And away from that, we would assume that there is very, very little other expense growth as of now.","Brian Bedell","Okay, that's helpful. And just to clarify, the additional spend is -- does not include severance that you talked about for 2018, and you framed that well. The additional tech spend is outside of that -- or of the additional spend, reinvestment is outside of the severance charges for 2018. Is that correct?","Charles Scharf","Yes.","Brian Bedell","Yes, okay. Great. And then just, I guess, longer -- maybe bigger picture, as you invest in the business -- and I know we'll get a lot more clarity on Investor Day, but how are you thinking about this in terms of positioning versus your trust bank peers? Obviously, they're going through spend programs. Do you think this will sort of ignite additional spending at your peers so that you will sort of be in line? Or do you see yourself actually improving your capabilities versus peers and potentially grabbing market share over time?","Charles Scharf","Yes. Listen, I have no way of knowing what peers will do and what they're currently doing other than what we all read about. I would say and I think this is a -- as we've been thinking about Investor Day, one of the things that we hope to spend a fair amount of time on is to talk about the uniqueness of the Bank of New York Mellon franchise. And the -- meaning, we're not just -- I mean the word trust bank, it's like the word boutique. It's just they're kind of funny words given the size and the scope and the breadth of what we do. We do some things that some of our competitors do, and we do it well and they do it well. But we also have some things that are very unique to what we are and to the kind of conversation that we can have when we sit across the table from clients. And so one of the things which is high in our list to talk through in detail on March 8 is exactly how we think we're differentiated versus the other people that you often think of as our competitors. So more to come on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","It makes a ton of sense to reinvest in technology, so I applaud what you're doing on that. Question on the capital return piece of this. I'm wondering if you're thinking about keeping the dividend payout ratio in line with what your earnings trajectory is likely to be. Or would you be keeping -- would you be looking to keep more to the divi where it is today and reinvest that as well?","Michael Santomassimo","Betsy, it's Mike. Obviously, as you know, we need to work through the whole CCAR process to sort of get that all approved and worked through. I think the only thing I would say is there's no need to sort of stay within sort of 100% payout as we look forward that we're aware of. And so I think we're sort of thinking through that now as we go through the CCAR process.","Charles Scharf","So let me just make sure -- I've tried to cover this in my remarks a little bit, which is we've given a tremendous amount back through dividends and buybacks. And so as we think about what the future looks like, that hasn't changed. And so relative to the core incremental capital generation here, we would assume that through dividends and buybacks, you would continue to see the same types of trends that you've seen in the past, subject to CCAR. So that hopefully does mean increasing dividends and whatever the difference is in terms of buybacks. So when we talk about the increment -- the capital needed for the incremental spend, the way we're thinking about it now, this is it.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. You're talking about the tax, the benefit of the tax, using that. That's what you need for the incremental spend. You don't have to touch the capital return piece.","Charles Scharf","Correct, correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.","Michael Mayo","Just some clarifications. What is your annual technology budget?","Michael Santomassimo","I think, Mike, this is Mike. What we said last quarter was we spend a little over $2 billion a year on technology. So that's the disclosure we've given.","Michael Mayo","And so you'll be spending an extra $250 million this year in terms of reinvesting the tax benefits. So should we think of that as 10% of...","Michael Santomassimo","Fairly close, I guess. Yes.","Michael Mayo","Okay. I guess the $250 million would be more of the investment spend. Or how should we think of that?","Michael Santomassimo","Sorry, say it again, Mike.","Michael Mayo","How should we think of the $250 million extra technology investment relative to that $2 billion base? Because it might not be apples to apples in that comparison.","Michael Santomassimo","Well, I think, I mean, I think, of the $2 billion, that includes all the centralized spend plus our estimate of all kind of decentralized spend that takes place in -- within the company. And so I mean, I would expect -- the way we'd think about is that it's a little less than $250 million, but that would be additions to the infrastructure spend, the cyber spend and the core development spend that we have at the company. So I'm not sure if I'm answering your question, so tell me if I'm not.","Michael Mayo","No, it sounds like you're investing in a wide range of areas, as you said. You said 100 discrete projects. So that's helpful. Mike, main question is just the combination of the three largest asset managers. I think you said Mellon Capital, Standish and Boston Company. So I'm not sure we've heard much about that. What will be the name of the new combined entity? And what's the structure of the new entity? Anything else you can elaborate on?","Charles Scharf","So Mitchell's here. Why don't...","Mitchell Harris","Mike, in terms of the name, we'll make that decision toward the end of the year after the consolidation is completed. In terms of what we're doing, I mean, we're clearly consolidating the trading activities, the back office and -- all the various back-office activities. So that's operational, technology, support functions in compliance and HR and finance. All of those activities are being combined into one. The firm has some great products across its platform. Mellon Cap is distinguished through a lot of its passive activities. You have The Boston Company in equities. And they complement each other. The thing we are probably under-invested in has been in the multi-asset where clients are going. This gives us a much easier platform to develop more multi-asset and solution type products. So the end game would be that we would keep the best of breed in equity fixed income and passive and develop the multi-asset capabilities along with that.","Charles Scharf","And the only thing that I would add, Mike, is just a couple of things, which is, first of all, on brand. You might sit here and say, \"Well, why haven't you chosen a brand?\" We've got -- if you look across the company here, we've got lots of things going on with brands, and so the work to consolidate these 3 entities does take quite a bit of time. And so what we've said is let's try and be really smart, do some real work to try and figure out what makes the most sense for the long term for the brand as opposed to just pick something which feels good in the moment. And my own comment just on this, because Mitchell was obviously well underway with this before I got here, is it just -- I mean this makes all the sense in the world. We have 3 entities that are relatively subscale who we think we can drive significant benefits by creating more scale both internally in terms of the things that we spoke about, the efficiencies in the back office and the trading operations and things like that, but also how we present ourselves to clients in the consulting community. So we do have a year of consolidation work to do, which is never easy in these businesses. But for the long term, just -- to me, it makes all the sense in the world.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.","Vivek Juneja","Just a couple of more clarifications. On this tech spend that you all talked about, somewhere in the $200 million to $250 million extra in 2018, is that the amount that will be the annual amortization of the tech spend so that will continue at that rate? Or is it just all being expensed in '18 and we are done with that? Can you give a little more clarity on how to think about it? Because your software and equipment line jumped up quite a bit this quarter, and Mike, is that the new run rate?","Charles Scharf","Go ahead, Mike.","Michael Santomassimo","I'll start with the last piece, Vivek. The software and equipment line jumped up as a result of the charges we took, with an asset impairment there. So don't think of the fourth quarter number as the new run rate for that line.","Charles Scharf","But on the technology...","Vivek Juneja","So how much was it -- go ahead, Charlie, sorry.","Charles Scharf","No, go ahead.","Michael Santomassimo","How much -- I'm sorry, what...","Vivek Juneja","Mike, my question was, of that $297 million, how much is asset impairment just so we can think about more correctly looking forward?","Michael Santomassimo","Yes. I mean, we haven't disclosed the exact number, Vivek. But it'll be a little bit higher -- as we go into Q1, it should be -- it'll be a little bit higher than what we saw in Q3.","Vivek Juneja","Okay. Sorry, Charlie.","Charles Scharf","And on the first part of your question, again, we would -- the $250 million, that is -- assume that's P&L and assume that's, at this point, a way to think of ongoing P&L as well.","Vivek Juneja","Okay, very helpful. Shifting gears slightly. Issuer services, that line was down $90 million this quarter, linked quarter, a little bit more than is expected. Even the uptick in Q3 was less than -- are you continuing to lose share? Any more color on that business? What's your plan for that business, Charlie, as you're looking at all of this?","Michael Santomassimo","Vivek, I'll start. It's Mike. I think the linked -- the primary driver of the linked-quarter decline, as you probably know, is the seasonality that we see in the third quarter. I think the volumes that we saw in sort of the core issuance, cancellation, cross-border settlement area was a little bit lower than we expected, and that really drove the further decline.","Vivek Juneja","Okay. And so given that, what's your thinking on the business just given that you're losing share? Is that just price competition still continuing? Or maybe, Charlie, from your perspective, as you're relooking at all of this, what's your thinking at the moment?","Charles Scharf","Yes. Again, so issuer services is two different businesses.","Vivek Juneja","Yes. And I guess I should clarify, DR really.","Charles Scharf","Yes. Listen, these guys know it better than I. We're spending -- I'm spending more time on it. When we were sitting here last quarter, there were some very, very large specific transactions that we did not win that we were all very knowledgeable about and, quite frankly, we're fine not winning, either because of price or because of terms. As we sit and look at the business levels this quarter, it doesn't look like we've lost anything significant. It looks like we maintained share in the business. It was a question of business activity. Hopefully that helps.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth Usdin","Charlie, you talked a little bit about CCAR and how you guys are planning on still returning a lot and that 100% shouldn't be limitation. But in your prepared remarks, you categorized acquisitions ahead of returning dividends and share -- and buybacks, and I just want to make sure that you -- how you're talking about that. Is that in an increment perspective or just in terms of the prioritization of M&A versus incremental buybacks? Just how you're thinking about the push and pull there.","Charles Scharf","Listen, that's a great question, and I probably wasn't as clear as I could have or should have been. When we think about how we invest inside the company and how we invest outside of the company and just -- I've been critical of things here and I've been supportive of things. I would say we have a very strong analytical framework for how we think about how and where we're investing. And when -- so when I talked about -- I forgot a word I used. I used the word -- when we look at the different criteria that we look at for these things and I talked about hurdles, I mean, we're clearly making a decision whether we're investing inside the company, whether investing on acquisition or we're buying our stock back. Those are all investment decisions, and we look at what all of those things return on behalf of the shareholder over the long term. And so the way I laid it out, we would -- we're here to build the company for the future. We think there's tremendous opportunity so we would love to spend -- to build if it has the right returns, but those returns have to be better than returning it to you and what you could do with that. So returning to shareholders is part of the criteria that we will continue to use to evaluate that option versus doing other things with the capital.","Kenneth Usdin","Okay, got it. And if I could ask then a second question on just organic wins and losses. And kind of I'll just put it in one question but there's two pieces. One is just can you characterize the $575 billion of core asset servicing wins and where they're coming from? And then in clearing, can you talk about that termination fee and either -- help us size it and what the go-forward effect is of losing that client or clients?","Thomas Gibbons","Sure, Ken. This is Todd. I'll take that. We had 3 very significant wins in the quarter, some of the big players. So we do feel some -- now it's particularly in asset servicing. So we see some pretty good momentum there and some continued pipeline, but I think it was a little bit episodic. And your second question was around the termination fees in the clearing business, and that did have a positive impact. Probably it was about 4% of the year-over-year growth. And we've probably called this out in the past. But I looked over the last 10 years. Over the last 10 years, we only have -- of our 10 largest customers, only 2 of them are with us 10 years ago. So there's constant change in here, as you would expect, with consolidations and other things. And during the quarter, we also won some very nice business in the clearing business, so I'm still feeling pretty good about it.","Charles Scharf","The sizable wins, they are episodic in nature. And so as we look at what was won in the asset servicing business, these are things that people are working on here for a long time, hopefully get implemented within 2018 and we can do the work on the things that go beyond that. In clearing, I think we've talked about this. We have -- we've won and lost from some of the consolidation that's taken place in the industry over the past bunch of years. There were couple that we have lost. But we feel very good about what, I would say, as we get towards the end of 2018, 2019 looks like based upon other wins that we've had and how long it takes to implement some of these things.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl","I just want to do -- get some clarification around your positive operating leverage comments for 2018. I mean, you said that was post -- or includes the tech investment spend, but are you including all targets in that? Because I mean the way we're looking at it, expense base could be going up by 5%, if you include those additional charges, including the reinvestment of the taxes. So are you saying that expenses may be going up by 5% and you're still expecting positive operating leverage?","Charles Scharf","I'm excluding the significant charges that we had in 2017 and whatever we could have in 2018 when I say that.","Brian Kleinhanzl","And that excludes the reinvestment or just the additional charges?","Charles Scharf","That includes the full incremental technology spend and what we expect the growth to be in the rest of our expense base.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. And then you said you want to increase the market share in the Corporate Trust business. Can you just give us a sense of how you're viewing or what -- how you look at where the market share is today? Where was it previously? And where do you think it can go to?","Michael Santomassimo","Yes. I mean, Brian, as you can imagine, like getting exact numbers on market share -- this is Mike, by the way. Getting exact numbers on market share and some of the subcomponents on -- in Corporate Trust is pretty difficult. But when you look at the structured product market like CLOs, we saw a big decline in market share over the last 3, 4, maybe 5 years, probably down 30% or 40% over that time period. And so we're very focused on making the investments we need to sort of regain some of that share in some of those particular products. Having said that, there are parts of the Corporate Trust business where our market share has been stable or growing over that time period as well. So this is really a focused effort on some particular product sets in that business.","Charles Scharf","So just on that for a second -- and Todd's sitting here. Todd has been very, very direct about what we've done and not done in Corporate Trust in our conversations over the past bunch of years. And I think we have a -- Corporate Trust is an important and a strong part of our business. We went through a process here several years ago where we thought about whether it belonged here or not. We -- after going through a process and thinking it through, the conclusion was made that it does belong here, it's an important part of the future, and we suffered from that. We suffered from that in the marketplace. And even internally -- again, this is -- Todd, I'm echoing what you've said, is, we moved very, very quickly to reestablish ourselves in the business and we lost salespeople.","We didn't necessarily invest in all the places we should have, and that's what resulted in the decrease in share. When we sit here today, when we think about some of the things that we've got to do, we've got new leadership in there, Frank La Salla, who is laser-focused on doing the things that are necessary, which include hiring back salespeople, building out the appropriate product structure and ensuring that we do everything we can to our -- with our Corporate Trust business to leverage all the relationships that we have with those people that make the decisions on who the trustee is going to be. So it's very much part of the investments that we're making and what we've talked to you about, and it's very much part of the talk track we have with Todd's GCM organization.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Unidentified Analyst","This is actually Sean Kelman [ph] on for Mike. How should we think about the impact of the renewable energy credits going forward now that tax reform is completed?","Charles Scharf","Todd, you want to handle that?","Thomas Gibbons","Yes. So right now, we will still get the benefit of those renewable credits. So if you think through our tax rate, we effectively expect to be at the statutory rate of 21%. But remember, we're paying still the state and local taxes as well, so it would have been higher if it wasn't for the benefit of things like the renewables. We do invest in the bank on life insurance, and we also have some tax exempts on -- in there as well. So the combination is what's holding it down. So there was a little bit of restructuring in the value of those, which run through the asset investment and other income, and so the negative drag on investment and other income is going to be slightly less than it otherwise would have been. But the net benefit is still there's still credits, and we still are going to get the benefit of those credits.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott","When you're thinking about these tech investments, what sort of back is acceptable? How far out are you willing to look?","Charles Scharf","What sort of what, I'm sorry?","Michael Santomassimo","Payback.","Geoffrey Elliott","So you make an investment upfront, and then it generates revenues in future years. I'm just trying to understand, do you expect to get a positive earn-back over a certain number of years on these?","Charles Scharf","Yes. Listen, I mean, there's no easy answer to the question. It depends on the type of investment that we're making. I mean, we are increasing our cyber spend in these numbers by over 50%. Honestly, we don't spend a lot of time talking about the payback in those terms. We talk about what we can do to strengthen the walls around the company and the monitoring and protection process inside the company. We're spending a tremendous amount more on infrastructure, a great deal of which provides us with a platform to create more efficiencies and to create a different kind of product set than we have today. And so when it comes to an infrastructure spend, very, very hard to put specifics around that. When it comes to product development spend, there are 2. I think it becomes -- it's very different in terms of what we're willing to accept in terms of payback relative to the strategic nature of what the investment is. Maybe we'll think a little bit about whether we could put a little bit more clarity around that when we get to March 8 for you.","Geoffrey Elliott","And then just a quick follow-up to clarify. On the low to mid-double-digit EPS growth, is -- you're talking about the base for that being the $3.72 GAAP full year 2017 EPS? Or is it something else? I'm just getting a bit confused on all the discussions about charges and what's in and what's out.","Michael Santomassimo","Yes. We said before, think about it as the GAAP number adjusted for the fourth quarter impact of tax and the other significant items that we disclosed.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Steven Duong","This is Steven Duong in for Gerard. Just two questions. First, on the regulatory front. With regulation continuing to loosen up, what regulation are you guys most focused on for regulators to review? And then on the second question, just more on the HR front. How competitive is it in attracting tech talent? And is there a region or area that you guys are focused on in attracting those talents?","Charles Scharf","Sure. Listen, I think, on the first, I think if you went around and asked people in this room, you might get nuanced answers. My point of view is really focused on CCAR. CCAR is a -- it's a huge effort inside the company. I'm sure you've heard this. It is not particularly transparent. And there is -- and it's obviously just extraordinarily important relative to its outcomes for how we run the business and what we do with capital, which is, obviously, a hugely important responsibility you have as a management team. So I think as we think about what could get done, I think there has just been very positive commentary about taking -- keeping the good pieces of CCAR and continuing to focus on how it can be made into a better tool both for regulators, for the beneficiaries, ultimately who's -- our customers and their customers and for us as well. The second question was?","Michael Santomassimo","Tech talent.","Steven Duong","Technology...","Charles Scharf","Yes. Listen, I think, one of the things that we -- one of the benefits I think that we have when it comes to technology is we're not dedicated in any one specific part of the country or part of the world. We have technology resources in Pittsburgh, in New York, in India, in different parts of Europe. And I think the -- I had to say this. It's -- I don't feel like the war on talent in technology is something, at this point, which is holding us back. I think it's there. I think it's real. But I think the more interesting things that we do as a company and the more people in that space understand how what they're doing impacts what we can do as a company, we become an even more important place to work. When you look at our turnover, not excessively high in any way, shape or form, so I feel okay about where we are there.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Just one other clarification. I guess, if you could just talk very briefly about your market assumptions for your low to mid-double-digit EPS growth in 2018 just in general, if it's improving -- continued rise in equity markets and the amount of Fed hikes that are factored into, say, the future's curve, and then whether -- on a GAAP basis, so from that $3.72 basis, including the charges that you talked about for 2018, which sounds like about $0.25, whether you'd still have GAAP EPS growth in 2018.","Charles Scharf","Yes. So on the first point, just a point of clarification. We're not assuming is using your estimates for revenue growth, when you look at the analyst estimates for revenue growth. We haven't told you what we think revenue growth will exactly be or what our embedded assumptions are within that. But I would say just, if you were to characterize it, it's a continuing relatively strong business environment for the places where we operate, not worse, not substantially better from today, but looking very much like where we are. That's the way we're just internally thinking about it. The second...","Brian Bedell","And then just on the GAAP EPS for 2018.","Michael Santomassimo","Sorry, Brian, you were breaking up there. What was the second part of your question?","Brian Bedell","Just on a GAAP basis, yes. The second part was with $3.72 of GAAP EPS in 2017, it sounds like there'll be another $0.25 of charges based on how you outlined the charges for 2018. So would we still have -- on a GAAP basis, do we still have positive EPS growth in 2018? Just to tie that with the adjusted EPS growth.","Michael Santomassimo","Brian, the way I would look at that is -- what Charlie explained is it's not $3.72 because that includes both the tax benefit as well as the significant charges that we called out. So if you take that combination, that's, I believe, about $0.17. That's what you have to start with for those numbers to play themselves out. You'll be able to work through all that information. We don't need to triangulate it with more.","Valerie Haertel","Okay. Thank you, everyone. Appreciate you joining the call today.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent.","I will now turn the call over to BNY Mellon. You may begin.","Magda Palczynska","Good morning. This is Magda Palczynska, Head of Investor Relations. Today, BNY Mellon released its results for the first quarter of 2019. The earnings press release and the financial highlights presentation to accompany this teleconference are both available on our website at bnymellon.com.","Charlie Scharf, BNY Mellon's Chairman and CEO, will lead this morning's conference call. Then Mike Santomassimo, our CFO will take you through our earnings presentation. Following Mike's prepared remarks, there will be a Q&A session.","Before we begin, please note that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release, the financial highlights presentation and in our documents filed with the SEC all available on our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, April 17, 2019, and will not be updated.","With that, I will hand over to Charlie.","Charles Scharf","Thanks, Magda. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Before turning over to Mike to take you through the first quarter financials in more detail, let me share some high level thoughts about our performance. Reported earnings per share were $0.94, down from $1.10 a year-ago. Revenue was down 7%. Both fees and net interest income declined. Expenses were down 1% and after-tax earnings decreased 20%. Return on tangible common equity was 21%.","A few thoughts on our results. Our performance this quarter was mixed. Several of our fee-based metrics in Investment Services were consistent with recent results, while we experienced weakness in Investment Management and net interest income. The year-over-year declines in revenue and earnings per share were primarily driven by the changing mix and cost of our deposits and the impact of the prior year asset management outflows. We also saw lower foreign exchange volumes and volatility, volume reductions and spread compression and securities lending and lower clearance volumes in Pershing.","In addition, the impact of divestitures and asset gains and particularly strong markets and deposit balances in last years first quarter also made the year-over-year comparison more difficult. Last quarter, we said that if our rate assumptions played out, we would expect net interest revenue to be flat to a little up versus the fourth quarter.","As you'll see, it was down 5%. Subsequent to our last earnings call, rates across the entire yield curve declined versus our assumptions, deposit balances declined and we saw changes to the mix between interest and non-interest-bearing deposits. We see significant competitive pressure for deposits. I'll let Mike discuss that in more detail.","As we've said, we remain focused on our expense base and our overall expenses remained well controlled while we continued to significantly increase our investment in technology and infrastructure. Our assets under custody and\/or administration reached $34.5 trillion, up 3% reflecting higher market values and net new business partially offset by change in foreign currency translation rates.","Let's go through our businesses starting with Asset Servicing. Asset Servicing fees were down year-over-year largely due to lower foreign exchange and securities lending volumes and lower activity from existing clients. On a linked quarter basis, fee-based metrics were generally consistent. We continued to see growth in alternatives with recent wins and a strong pipeline in real estate, credit funds, private debt and private equity.","Let me make a few additional comments about our BlackRock strategic alliance. We have said we will work with third parties to more closely integrate the front-to-back operating model, and this is one meaningful example of how we will use data and tools to benefit our clients, working on our own solutions and with third parties.","For the past few years, we've been working with BlackRock to transform the investment manager operating model. Through our collaboration, we've driven increased quality and efficiency with high straight-through processing rates, increased transparency throughout the investment lifecycle, accelerated information delivery and synchronized data that supports core functions for asset managers. Those benefits are available to our common clients in addition to benefits related to our new integration.","By integrating our data insight, accounting and servicing tools into Aladdin, we offer seamless connectivity, transparency, and near real-time insight to our common clients through a single platform. These joint capabilities bring immediate benefits across the investment lifecycle by helping clients simplify workflows, improve efficiency and drive performance. In addition, we're working closely with BlackRock to bring more tools and functionality to the market soon. This is the beginning of us offering additional value-added services ourselves and working with third-parties.","In Pershing, revenue was down year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of the two previously disclosed client losses, which will no longer impact year-over-year growth after the first quarter. We also experienced lower clearance volumes than a year-ago quarter when they were particularly strong. This was partially offset by growth in total client assets.","We've been successful in converting our Broker-Dealer pipeline into signed business and are currently onboarding more new business than we have in many years. This will start to show up in our results in the latter part of the year, and we will have a more meaningful impact next year. In addition, the pipeline remained strong.","In Issuer Services, revenue was down reflecting lower fees in Depositary Receipts. The Corporate Trust business continued to grow despite a slower debt issuance market. We are acting with a greater sense of urgency and our work in repositioning our sales and service teams has yielded incremental growth in rising asset classes like insurance-linked securities and CLOs.","We're continuing to focus on the structured finance market where we are capturing additional market share and will benefit when issuance volumes recover. We have begun converting clients onto our new CLO platform, which we got up and running in less than six months.","Clients are already benefiting from our loan reporting platform, which provides them with access to high quality loan and CLO compliance data. The combination of the two platforms will allow us to automate a number of functions and become more scalable.","In Treasury Services, revenue was down slightly due to lower net interest revenue, while total client deposits continued their upward trend. The benefit was offset by the change in mix between non-interest-bearing and higher cost interest-bearing deposits as clients more actively managed their balances.","We're focusing our relationship and sales teams on growing higher margin areas of our business, including electronic payments, liquidity and trade, and associated deposits from our global clients. We have seen some very positive results year-to-date in terms of client wins in these higher margin areas. Our focus on FX payments is showing early signs of progress with a growing pipeline.","In Clearance and Collateral Management, we reported 8% revenue growth. We again benefited from the full run rate of the newly converted government clearing Broker-Dealer clients, higher clearance volumes related to the heightened level of U.S. Treasury issuances and increased market volatility, and growth in collateral management activity from new clients as well as increased activity from existing clients. We're investing to extend the service to market participants, help clients optimize their funding needs and provide more options for our clients.","As part of those investments, we've been developing capabilities to help market participants with new margin requirements for derivative transactions not cleared with the Central Counterparty Clearing House. Since 2016, we've been providing services to over half of institutions that are currently effective and we will start to assist smaller institutions that are coming into scope later this year.","Turning to Investment Management, it was another tough quarter for asset management with revenues down to 17% reflecting the impact of divestitures and cumulative assets under management outflows over the last 12 months.","On the positive side, outflows have slowed significantly from the fourth quarter and investment performance across some key strategies has been strong, which contributed to the improvement inflows and generated solid performance fees.","To further abate outflows, we\u2019re developing multi-asset capabilities at Mellon. We're realizing savings and supporting back-office functions, and reinvesting and developing enhanced capabilities that deliver solutions for our clients.","Wealth Management fee revenue was mainly impacted by lower net interest revenue and lower fees. While still small, we\u2019ve seen positive flows over the last few quarters. In terms of talent, last month we announced that Senthil Kumar will be joining our Executive Committee as Chief Risk Officer in July. Senthil is an accomplished risk executive with extensive experience. He knows the global financial markets. He has a deep understanding of the regulatory agenda and he's the right leader to continue to strengthen our risk culture and capabilities while partnering with our business to support our growth agenda.","Lester Owens has joined us as Head of Operations and he is beginning to revisit how we process securities and cash with the goal of gaining material efficiencies and improving service quality. And we made several important hires in the digital area to focus on building and launching new digital offerings and reimagining the end-to-end client journey.","As we look ahead, while the current expectations for the yield curve will likely negatively impact our revenue growth for the next several quarters, we will remain disciplined on expenses and continue to build-out capabilities which should eventually enable stronger growth.","As you can see on Page 3 of the financial highlights document, we're adding new capabilities and unique functionality to help our clients become more efficient and make better investment decisions. We're building and upgrading platforms in many of our businesses to better support our clients, attract new clients and capture market share, and we're investing in technology and digitization to drive a more efficient and complete product set than we have today. While we certainly aren't happy with this level of performance, we remain focused on building the franchise and remain confident in the actions we're taking.","With that, let me turn the call over to Mike.","Michael Santomassimo","Thanks, Charlie. Let me run through the details of our results for the quarter. Note that all comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise specified.","Beginning on Page 4 of the financial highlights document. In the first quarter, total revenue was down 7% to $3.9 billion. Total fee revenue was down 9% year-on-year with just over a third of that driven by adverse currency translation due to a stronger dollar, the impact of divestitures and asset management and asset gains in the first quarter of 2018. I will cover the other drivers later in my commentary.","Sequentially many of the investment services, fee-based metrics were consistent with or had small variations versus the fourth quarter with the exception of Issuer Services or volatility quarter-to-quarter is normal. Within Investment Management fees were down due to the timing of performance fees and lower Investment Management fees.","Net interest revenue was down 8% driven by lower non-interest bearing deposits and loan balances, higher deposit rates and the impact of hedging activities. This was partially offset by higher yields in the securities and loan portfolios. The lower day count is a revenue drag of approximately 1% versus the fourth quarter.","Non-interest expense was down 1%. The stronger U.S. dollar had a favorable impact of approximately 1% and sequentially expenses were down slightly excluding the notable items booked in the fourth quarter of 2018.","This resulted in a 17% decline in pretax income to $1.2 billion, $910 million in net income applicable to common shareholders, a 15% decrease in earnings per share to $0.94 which was helped by our common stock repurchases, which reduced the share count and partially offset decline in net income, and our pretax operating margin was 31%.","Now moving to capital and liquidity on Page 5. Our capital and liquidity ratios remain strong. As of March 31, our key ratios increased since year-end primarily due to earnings, unrealized gains on our investment securities portfolio and capital related to stock awards offset by capital distributions. Common equity Tier 1 capital totaled $18.2 billion as of March 31 and our CET1 ratio was 11% under the Advanced Approach.","Our average LCR in the first quarter was 118% and the SLR was 6.3%. In response to legislation passed last year, the U.S. agencies released a proposal at the end of March that would exclude central bank placements with some limitations from the denominator in the SLR for us and a couple of our peers.","As written, this proposed change would add about 130 basis points to 140 basis points to our SLR. While we support this proposal and it adds flexibility to our day-to-day balance sheet management, our binding capital constraint remains the Tier 1 leverage ratio in CCAR.","Looking at net interest revenue on Page 6. First quarter net interest revenue was down 8% to $841 million and was down 5% sequentially. Sequentially, the day count accounted for approximately 1% of the decline in net interest revenue. Year-over-year, our deposit balances decreased. As discussed last year, our deposits in the first quarter of 2018 were higher than expected.","Given the elevated deposits last year, it might be more helpful to look at the sequential change in deposits. Non-interest bearing deposits continue to decline as clients redeployed balances the higher yielding alternatives or used the cash for other needs. Our interest-bearing deposits were also down slightly versus the fourth quarter.","As I've mentioned each quarter over the last year, pricing continues to be competitive and betas are high. The rates on interest-bearing deposits increased from 86 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2018 to 99 basis points this quarter. On the surface, this would imply the positive beta of approximately 50% across all currencies.","When you focus on core interest-bearing, U.S. dollar client deposits, excluding wholesale funding, betas have been on average a little lower than 100%. Although the rate curve is flattened and expectations for future hikes have lessened, we have not seen \u2013 yet seen a decline in the competitive pressure for deposits.","Higher yields in our securities and loan portfolios where the primary driver in the increase of the yield on our interest-earning assets, which was partially offset by the impact of lower deposits and loans and higher deposit pricing. Loan balances decline year-over-year and sequentially driven by lower margin loans in Pershing due to lower client activity and lower volumes in other areas due in part to normal paydowns.","The net interest margin decreased 2 basis points to 1.2%; sequentially the NIM declined 4 basis points. Also note that the effects of certain hedging activities are recorded in fee revenue and not reflected in net interest revenue or the net interest margin is negatively impacted net interest revenue by a little more than 1% and the NIM by approximately 2 basis points, against both comparative periods. The offsetting benefit is reflected in FX and other trading and is not included in the net interest margin.","Page 7 details our expenses. On a consolidated basis expenses of $2.7 billion were down 1%. The stronger U.S. dollar had a favorable impact of approximately 1%. We remained vigilant on managing expenses and funded our increased investment in technology with ongoing efficiency efforts and other decreases and expenses, including lower incentive expense, volume related expenses and lower bank assessment charges.","Please note that the technology expenses are included in staff, professional, legal and other purchase services and software and equipment expenses. We continue to believe we have opportunity to drive more efficiency across the organization in the coming quarters.","Now turning to Page 8. Total Investment Services revenue was down 5%. Asset Servicing revenue was down 7% to $1.4 billion, primarily reflecting lower foreign exchange activity, lower net interest revenue due to lower deposit, lower client activity and the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.","We are asked a lot about pricing pressure and asset servicing, while there continues to be pricing headwinds, the pressure has been consistent with recent years. We haven't seen a meaningful uptick from the trend.","Pershing revenue was down 5% to $554 million, previously disclosed loss business impact at growth by approximately 3%. The remaining decline was primarily related to lower clearance volumes compared to the first quarter of 2018 when volumes were particularly strong. The decline was partially offset by growth in client assets and good growth in the RIA Servicing business. Although RIA Servicing is a smaller piece of the revenue, it grew roughly 10% year-over-year.","The sequential decreased reflects \u2013 lower net interest revenue primarily due to lower margin loans, which was a result of lower client activity. As discussed previously, the new business that we were onboarding will start to show up in our results and a lot of part of the year and have a more meaningful impact in 2020.","Issuer Services revenue was down 5% to $396 million, primarily reflecting lower fees and Depositary Receipts and lower net interest revenue due to lower deposits in Corporate Trust, partially offset by slightly higher volumes.","Given that the timing of fees in Depositary Receipts can vary quarter-to-quarter based on client activity, it's more meaningful to focus on fees over the full-year versus one single quarter. The sequential decrease primarily reflects lower Depositary Receipts fees, volumes and net interest revenue in Corporate Trust.","Treasury Services revenue was down slightly to $317 million, primarily reflecting lower net interest revenue. Although total deposits are up in this business with the greatest traction coming from clients in Asia, we were seeing the impact of lower non-interest bearing deposits and higher competitive pressure on pricing for interest-bearing deposits.","Clearance and Collateral Management revenue was up 8% to $276 million primarily reflecting growth and collateral management and clearance volumes, while the majority of the growth in this business was driven by the conversion of new clients due to a competitor exiting the U.S. government clearing business, we are seeing growth from other new clients and also increased activity particularly in the U.S. Average tri-party collateral management balances were up 21%, reflecting the strong growth.","A few additional items of note, as you can see, foreign exchange and other trading revenue was down 7% within that foreign exchange revenue within the segment was down 18% driven by lower client volumes and lower volatility, and securities revenue was down 8%.","Assets under custody and\/or administration increased 3% year-over-year to $34.5 trillion, primarily reflecting higher market values and net new business offset by the impact of stronger U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted assets under custody administration growth by approximately 2%.","Turning to Page 9. Although we have already covered all the details for Investment Services, hopefully this will be an easy reference page for you. It summarizes the key drivers that affected revenue versus the first quarter of 2018 for each of the Investment Services businesses.","Now turning to Page 10 for the Investment Management business highlights. Total Investment Management revenue was down 14%. Asset Management revenue was down 17% year-over-year and 3% sequentially to $637 million. Almost half of the year-over-year decrease resulted from the impact of the 2018 divestitures and the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, principally versus the British pound.","The rest of the decrease primarily reflects the cumulative impact of assets under management outflows over the last year in lower performance fees. The sequential decreased primarily reflects the timing of performance fees and the impact of outflows partially offset by higher equity market values.","Our overall flows were flat in the quarter. We had $4 billion of outflows from equities driven in part by lower performing strategies in a shift to pathos and $2 billion of outflows from index products, primarily driven by two clients withdrawing assets.","Multi-asset and alternative outflows were $4 billion. Fixed income and cash turned to inflows with $3 billion and $2 billion respectively. Our liability-driven investment strategies had $5 billion in inflows after strong inflows in the second half of last year and the pipeline for LDI remains strong. Overall assets under management of $1.8 trillion is up 7% versus the end of the fourth quarter primarily due to higher markets.","Wealth Management revenue was down 5% year-over-year and essentially flat sequentially to $302 million with a year-over-year decrease, primarily reflecting lower net interest revenue and fees. Within Wealth Management, client assets decreased 1% and were up sequentially to $253 billion. Wealth Management client deposits grew both year-over-year and sequentially. However, net interest revenue overall decline due to lower loans and higher deposit pricing.","Now turning to our other segment on Page 11. Fee revenue decreased year-over-year primarily reflecting asset-related gains recorded in the first quarter of 2018. Also just to reminder that the last year, we recorded $49 million of net securities losses related to the sale of approximately $1 billion of debt securities.","Non-interest expense decreased year-over-year reflecting lower incentive expense. The sequential decreased primarily reflects the expenses associated with severance and relocating our corporate headquarters both recorded in 4Q 2018.","Looking ahead to the second quarter, there were a few things to consider for your modeling. With respect to the net interest revenue, I'll walk you through the assumptions for the key variables impacting NIR.","As of today, our total deposit balances and non-interest bearing deposits are a little lower than the average deposits in the first quarter. We are expecting net average non-interest bearing deposits will continue to come down. Short-term rates have declined since the first quarter and the yield curve has flattened. As a result, we expect the yield and our securities portfolio to be relatively flat to the first quarter.","As I mentioned earlier, competition for deposits is still high and thus we expect that the rate paid on interest-bearing deposits will increase a little. Given these assumptions, we would expect net interest revenue to decline between 3% and 5% in the second quarter versus the first quarter. Given the levels of assets under management, we should benefit modestly versus the first quarter in Investment Management fees. And lastly, we continue to expect the full-year 2019 effective tax rate to be approximately 21%.","With that, operator, can you please open the lines for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Elizabeth Graseck","Hi. Good morning.","Charles Scharf","Good morning, Betsy.","Elizabeth Graseck","Couple of questions. One on the deposit guidance \u2013 the NIR guidance that you just laid out. I know you gave us a lot of detail around 2Q and I guess I'm just wondering as we think forward from there, do you anticipate that the deposit competition would slow and then really it's a function of yield curve or is there anything that you expect you\u2019d be doing in the balance sheet to shift the trajectory of NIR if this current rate environment held?","Michael Santomassimo","Yes. Hey Betsy, it\u2019s Mike. I'll take a shot and Charlie can add if you want. I think if rates sort of stay where they are, we would expect over time that pricing sort of stabilizes. As I said in my remarks, we haven't quite seen that yet, but we would expect pricing to stabilize as we go. And as you sort of think about the new rate environments and things we can do on the balance sheet, we're doing all the things you would sort of expect us to do as we sort of look to optimize, as we look forward both on the funding side and how we sort of manage the securities portfolio primarily.","Elizabeth Graseck","Okay. Anything on like bringing down other wholesale cost of funds or shifting the liability structure at all that might help out here?","Michael Santomassimo","Yes, we're looking at all of that and I think there's things we can do both on our long-term debt that we've got both on tenor and quantum as well as sort of all of the funding sources that we\u2019re sort of looking at.","Elizabeth Graseck","Okay. Thanks. All right. And then separate topic on the efficiency improvements that you outlined. Maybe give us a sense as to the quantum of that and kind of the time frame that you think that that would occur over?","Charles Scharf","Sure. Hey Betsy, it's Charlie. So when we talked last quarter, what we said was we're continuing to significantly increase our investment in technology and we wouldn't expect to see a meaningful change in expenses this year. So obviously embedded in there are a whole series of efficiency improvements that we expect to get throughout the year, and we feel very good about our ability to deliver that.","I'll say that we are in the early stages of figuring out kind of what's next taking it to the next level. We have several new people who have joined us. As I mentioned Lester, who runs over 20,000 of the 50,000 people, I think we all have \u2013 we all believe that there's continued meaningful opportunity to become more efficient and improve the quality. And so hopefully we would expect there to be more, but not quite sure on the timing yet.","Elizabeth Graseck","Okay. And then just lastly on\u2026","Charles Scharf","All I can say is just you can assume that we're pushing as hard as we can.","Elizabeth Graseck","Okay. And then just lastly on the announcement that you made with BlackRock regarding the Aladdin functionality that you're enabling your clients to benefit from. Could you give us a sense as to how much you think that is going to help out either on your efficiency or your client's efficiency? And I know in the press release, you highlighted this was the first of many or \u2013 enhancements that you're anticipating, maybe give us some color on the roadmap that you're expecting with this strategic alliance.","Charles Scharf","Yes, so I put it into two different categories. There\u2019s series of things that we've been working with BlackRock for a long period of time line. That relate to the processing requirement that we have between what Aladdin does and what our capabilities are. And as we have gone through that journey with them, and by the way, just to be clear, a lot of it is \u2013 I'm not saying this is just us.","We\u2019ve just taken the efficiency with which we process our transactions to an extraordinarily high level that we haven't seen in many other places, and so that's an opportunity which benefits us because we become more efficient, but it obviously benefits to the asset manager as well because they see efficiencies on their side as well as quality improvement with the extraordinarily high rates of straight through processing that we ultimately have.","So those are our opportunities that common clients have. And then in addition to that, we've introduced a series of analytical capabilities that benefit both operations professionals and investment managers embedded in the Aladdin technology that we think provides further benefits.","So I think as we look at it, it benefits us for sure, but it also creates additional capabilities for clients that today \u2013 that are available in the marketplace today. This isn't something that we're dreaming of. This isn't an idea that we have. It's there today. And our goal is to continue to expand the integration and to think about other third parties that are important for our clients, who are non-Aladdin clients.","Elizabeth Graseck","Got it. Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you so much Charlie.","Charles Scharf","Thanks, Betsy.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Glenn Schorr","Hi, thanks so much. Looking for a little more color on the comments around the significant deposit pressure, and we all know it's real and ongoing, but I'm curious on how it manifests itself, how the dialogue happens. And more importantly, if you have metrics around overall client profitability that you can price per client, I'm just looking for a little bit behind the scenes if I could?","Michael Santomassimo","Hey, Glenn. It\u2019s Mike. Sure. So as you know, most of what we do is a \u2013 it operates in a pretty competitive marketplace right across lots of strong competitors both here in the U.S. and outside the U.S., and so our clients are \u2013 and many of our clients are doing business with multiple providers both in the Asset Servicing space and the Treasury Services space.","So the price transparency around deposits is there for clients and so they're very well informed and in dialogue with all of those competitors, and so it happens naturally and sort of the conversation around what am I getting paid on my deposits and here's what so and so is sort of offering. And so very natural conversation sort of with clients and that \u2013 as I said, that transparency is very much there in the marketplace.","Now just keep in mind, as you know most of our deposits are linked to operational activities, but there is ability for clients to sort of move deposits on the margin to take advantage of where there are differences and what clients are sort of paying. So I think that's the nature of that. What was the second part of the question?","Charles Scharf","Our client profitability.","Michael Santomassimo","Client profitability, sorry. Yes, so we do very detailed client profitability for our clients and have a very good sense of what's driving that and can be smart about pricing both deposits as well as sort of the overall relationship in a way that optimizes it by client. So we feel pretty good about that.","Charles Scharf","Yes. And I'll just add to it. I think it's a strong discipline that exists, not just in how much we make on NII of the client, but it's a relationship view where we see all the activity that we do with the client across the entire firm. And I think we try and be smart about maximizing profit and returns relative to what the relationship looks like.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. I appreciate that. Just one other quick one. And we could stay high level, but the notion of non-transparent ETFs obviously is on display with the SEC\u2019s recent comments. So the question is from both Asset Management, Asset Servicing, I would think from asset management\u2019s stand point, I'm curious on your thoughts on how much of a benefit and how much product design you might have in motion?","And on the flip side, is there risk on the Asset Servicing side simply because I think of a generically of \u2013 look these products, if they succeed in the future or succeed because they bring a lower cost and lower cost Investment Management fee, lower cost on the Servicing side. So how much of an impact is that there for you guys?","Charles Scharf","Glenn, we're looking at that now. As you know, it's not a big piece of the pie now, nor do I personally think it will be a big piece anytime soon. But we're spending some time looking at it now both in the Asset Management side and Asset Servicing make sure, we understand it fully.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. I appreciate it guys. Thanks.","Charles Scharf","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll next go to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Hi, great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. I just to go back to the deposit questions to Charlie and Mike. Can you talk a little bit about some of your organic growth initiatives, the progress on the priorities that you highlighted in the presentation in terms of the ability to grow deposits organically. And then you\u2019ve potentially stabilized the net interest revenue profile, maybe regrow it maybe later in the year or is that longer-term?","Michael Santomassimo","Yes, I think \u2013 just sort of think about the organic growth initiatives, I mean Charlie sort of highlighted a bunch of them by business. And as we said, this will take some time to really be meaningful across any of the businesses or sort of in total. But we're seeing good traction in a lot of it. Charlie highlighted the Corporate Trust activity that we're seeing. We're seeing some green shoots in sort of that business as we sort of build-out the capabilities.","Pershing continues to be strong and getting stronger in terms of the pipeline. Asset management has been doing a good job, building out some differentiated strategies, like risk parity and a whole bunch of other items that will build over time.","We've seen \u2013 also seen some good performance in some of the key strategies that will take in that business as well. And so I think, we feel confident sort of our ability to sort of execute on these. But as we've said, it will take some time to see it come into the picture.","I think \u2013 do you want to add anything Charlie?","Charles Scharf","No. I just \u2013 we're going to hide behind the facts of the quarter, right? They are what they are. NII is disappointing. That's obviously clear when you look at the results. But when we look at the underlying metrics of the progress that we're making, which is what will drive the long-term performance within the Asset Servicing business, we feel very good about the pipelines and the types of things that we're seeing.","The things that we've announced with BlackRock and other things we're working on are what's going to drive the success in the future, both in fees and ultimately in our ability to attract deposits, which come at that business. We've talked about Pershing extensively about getting through these couple of losses that we've had, but we've got a lot more coming and we feel great about the pipeline there.","Issuer Services, we talked about the share that we're taking or I should say winning back in some respects. In the Corporate Trust business, Treasury Services, we feel very good about the way we're building the business and what the opportunities are there.","Clearance and Collateral Management is done extremely well, not just because of the conversions from JPMorgan, but just the underlying growth that we've been able to generate there. And Investment Management, we had the outflows last year, but performance is coming back. So I just \u2013 we do have to get through the reality of the interest rate environment, but the things that we're doing to drive growth over a period of time, we don't feel any worse about. And I think on the margin, we feel slightly better and we're continuing to drive it. But it will take time to show up in the numbers.","Brian Bedell","That's super helpful. And then just on the back to the BlackRock announcement, I think its 40 or so clients said \u2013 I think we saw in the press, in terms of common clients between BlackRock and Bank of New York? Can you just talk about the timing of the integration of their services on the two platforms?","And then the organic growth potential from that combined offering as you look to your other BNY clients that are not using Aladdin right now, but maybe could either switch and sort of how you think about that in the long-term paradigm of integrating the front through back office given the sort of industries shift in that direction?","Charles Scharf","Yes. As I said before, the additional capabilities and the widgets in the apps that we have created, the integrated into Aladdin are available immediately, and our ability to integrate data in a more seamless way to help drive the more efficient operational process that's available today.","So we made the announcement. We're in conversation with the common clients that we have to make sure they understand what the capabilities are. And so we'll see what the next couple of months what the uptick is. Again, we feel very good about the value add that's there.","And as I said, we're continuing to \u2013 the capabilities that we announced aren't the end of the road. We're continuing to build new capabilities, which will be integrated. Beyond Aladdin, as I said, we believe that we should be an open platform. In fact most asset managers use more than one provider. To the extent they want to use Aladdin. We're obviously there to support them today, but we also want to be where our clients are.","And so there are a lot of very strong platforms out there that our clients use. You can assume that we're having lots of discussions and the benefits that we've been able to bring to Aladdin. We would assume we would able to bring to other providers as well so we can help a bunch of broader set of our clients.","Brian Bedell","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Michael Carrier","Thanks guys. Maybe just a two part question. You gave a lot of guidance on the net interest income. Just wanted to get sense given the rebound in the markets, can you provide some context on how you see that benefiting some of the fee revenues ahead? And then have you seen any improvement on the transaction side across some of your businesses like throughout the quarter given the weak start that we saw across the capital markets at beginning of the quarter?","Charles Scharf","Yes, I'll start on the second part first, Mike. I think transaction volumes were pretty muted all quarter. So we didn't see really any big uptick in the second part as we sort of came out of the quarter. So it was pretty consistent. And if you recall last year, last year's volumes were very high particularly in the first half of the first quarter of 2018. So we certainly didn't see even as the market rallied in the first quarter, at least in the U.S. We didn't see that transaction volume sort of follow with it. So I think that's the case.","I think on just the overall market impact, I think you can see in our disclosures in asset management what the AUM looks like. So that will give you a good sense of how we're entering the quarter by asset class and how to think about that. And then on the Asset Servicing side in particular just if you recall, roughly two-thirds are a little less of our ACI is fixed income and so we get the benefit of the market impact on the rest of other pieces of ACI \u2013 so you get a sense of how to model that as you go into the second quarter.","Michael Carrier","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.","Adam Beatty","Thank you and good morning. This is Adam Beatty in for Brennan. Just wanted to step back for a sec and talk about EPS growth. You guys said earlier, you outlined being able to grow adjusted EPS off for 2018 base. Could you just outline for us what are the key building blocks or drivers of that? Where you expect to have that growth? Thanks.","Michael Santomassimo","Well, just to be clear as we've laid out here, it's a different environment today than when we made those remarks. And so our ability to fill exactly those words is certainly far more challenging. And I'm not sure how to answer the question other than revenues and expenses, right.","I mean, we have the pressures that we've seen in NII, which we've laid out, fees presumably will continue to grow both with the net wins that we\u2019re seeing in our businesses, the improved flows in asset management and the market levels. And as we've talked about, we're going to continue to be very disciplined on expenses and continue to see what else is available.","Adam Beatty","Understood. Thank you. Then just to hone in on deposits, particularly non-interest-bearing deposits, they were down a fair bit and you've talked a bit about that. How much of that do you view as seasonal versus the yield seeking that you identified and what's the outlook? Should we expect the stabilization from here?","Charles Scharf","I wouldn't think of the decline as seasonal. I don't know that would be the right way to think about it. And look I think as we've said for a while and as I said in my remarks, we would expect those to come down a little bit more in the second quarter and I wouldn't go any further than that at this point.","Adam Beatty","Great. Thank you for taking our questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alexander Blostein","Thanks. Hi, guys. Good morning. So first question, just looking for a little bit more color on [indiscernible] beyond sort of second quarter commentary and specifically as the yield curve has flattened out here. Can you help us think through the repricing risk on the fixed side of the securities portfolio to kind of where you reinvested today, what\u2019s rolling on versus what's rolling off? And if the curve kind of stays at its current state, what sort of the spread pressure we should anticipate over the next coming quarters?","Michael Santomassimo","Yes. So Alex, this is Mike. So I think what we've said in the past which is still the case, call it a third of the securities portfolio reprices every quarter, roughly a third. So that's either maturing securities or floating that sort of coming into what the current rate \u2013 what the yield curve looks like. So I think you can sort of use that as the basis to do your modeling. And then I think as I said for the second quarter, we would expect pricing to inch up a little bit on interest-bearing deposits and so that'll give you a sense of how to think about the compression there.","Alexander Blostein","Okay. And then on the expense outlook, I don't know if I heard you guys update the guidance there, but I think on the last call you talked about sort of flattish maybe slightly higher expenses for the year, which I think, call it $10.9 billion expense base last year. Obviously, the environment has changed where you guys are doing what you can on that front, so a nice reduction in the headcount this quarter. But I guess as you look beyond, does the expense got hold, still kind of flattish expenses for the year or should we anticipate slightly lower costs?","Charles Scharf","I think I answered this earlier, I think we are still very comfortable with what we've said, which is we're continuing to significantly increase the investment in technology and offset it with efficiencies that we're getting elsewhere. And so our ability to deliver on that, I think we still feel very, very good about. We've got some new people in some big jobs here that are continuing to dive in and figure out what comes next. We all feel like we've got a lot more opportunity than we've currently addressed, but not exactly sure what the timing is. So more to come as the year unfolds.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Vivek Juneja with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Vivek Juneja","Hi, thanks. Charlie, I just wanted to follow-up on something you mentioned earlier. You said the widgets are already for the Aladdin to be able to roll that out to all your clients. But you also talked about developing stuff for the others. Are you already ready with developing products for other providers like Aladdin or is that something in process? Where are you in that process?","Charles Scharf","Yes, that's a good question. And so just to be clear, the capabilities that we have in these applications in widgets can be integrated into countless operating environments elsewhere as long as they can accept them. So these weren't built necessarily for one specific environment and so we're going full speed with others.","Vivek Juneja","Okay, great. And so is the next step now just sort of going out and offering this to your Asset Servicing clients and is this something that you'd get paid, for Charlie, a separate fee? Or does it roll into the overall fee rate? Can you walk through sort of what it means from our revenue and business standpoint now that you have this and can provide this?","Charles Scharf","Yes. So for the things that we have rolled out now, these are \u2013 they're actually capabilities that existing clients currently have in our Asset Servicing space. And so whatever we get paid for the business we have with them they have access to those capabilities. What the integration with Aladdin does is it makes it far, far easier to actually access our capabilities at the act. At the same time, they're accessing, all of the information and capabilities that lead up to the time we get involved in the trade.","So just think of the ability to be \u2013 have one screen with your front-end on one part of the screen, your backend on the other, and being able to answer questions real time effectively on one screen. And so to the extent that we build-out additional capabilities, just like we wouldn't our typical business, those are things that we might or might not charge for. But what we're doing today is what we're getting paid for.","Vivek Juneja","Okay.","Charles Scharf","But I would say that there is relatively little uptick on the things that we have created because it's hard to use them in concert with the front-end and what we've done with Aladdin solves that problem.","Vivek Juneja","Okay, great. Now if we \u2013 compare this with what State Street did by buying CRD? Do you feel this sort of completely fills that without having \u2013 you having to do the acquisition or does this more stuff that you need to add or built from a capability standpoint?","Charles Scharf","Yes, listen. I think, we've been very, very clear that we don't believe that owning a front-end is necessary or even the right thing. I'm certainly given what our businesses. As I said before, many \u2013 most asset managers use multiple providers.","Staying at the forefront of building capabilities on the front-end is an entire business unto its own that has changed and will continue to change dramatically. That's not our sweet spot. But there are others that do nothing but this that focus on that. And some of them are really good at it.","And so what we want to do is make sure that we're working as closely together as we can, not just on integrating capabilities, but working on common data sets in a whole series of things that do make the process much more seamless than it's been. And so that's the journey that we're on and we think that's it would be extremely attractive to asset managers and asset owners.","Vivek Juneja","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll next go to the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Usdin","Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just a big picture question on just the activity levels, I think for the last couple of quarters we've been understanding just how good the year-ago was and getting down to some different level now? Can you just characterize what do you think of the activity that we saw across the businesses in the first quarter, and if you're getting any sense that you're feeling that this is either a baseline or more stable or more just and trying to put it into perspective, and how you would think about a kind of a normal environment?","Michael Santomassimo","Hey, Ken. It\u2019s Mike. I think given sort of the moves in the market that you've seen over the last couple quarters, I think the activity is definitely a little more muted than what we would have expected, in terms of just pure transaction activity across the different businesses.","Is it a new normal? It's hard to say, right? I think that could change tomorrow depending on sort of how investors are sort of feeling and the activity levels that are sort of coming off the back of that. So \u2013 but I would definitely say it's a little more muted than what we would have thought, just given the moves and that are happening in the market.","Kenneth Usdin","Okay. Follow-up on the deposit competition that you mentioned, last quarter you talked about a 100% betas, obviously with rates stopping, we can't really measure beta anymore, but when you talk about competition for those deposits, how do you gauge when that starts to abate? What do you think it\u2019s driving that pressure and do you have a feel for the magnitude of deposit costs increase you're still expecting?","Michael Santomassimo","Yes. Look, I think it's \u2013 I think the way we're going to know, it\u2019s abating is based on the client dialogue that we're having, right, which is happening every day, right across different teams. So we get real time information about sort of what we're seeing in the marketplace. And so I think that will be the best judge as we start to see those dialogues, change a bit. But do you would expect as we discussed earlier that as rate sort of stayed here for a while that that pressure would it be at some point?","Charles Scharf","Yes. And just how we're building on it to that, the way we know is we sit in the room with the business leaders and we'd go through exactly what they are seeing in the marketplace as they talk to clients because it's not like we just sit and look at a bunch of reports and see numbers go up or down.","Those conversations, where's the money coming from? Where's the money going to and exactly what rates are we paying? What rates are others paying? And I just echo what Mike said is I think as we've gone through a period of change, people have done some different things in the marketplace, but as rates stabilize, you would expect deposit \u2013 the rates that people pay to do the same as well.","Michael Santomassimo","Ken, I would just add, I think if you looked across the folks that we compete with every day in our businesses and you could actually see into those businesses, you would see the same dynamic. It's just more transparent here.","Kenneth Usdin","Yes. Okay. Last quick one just on CCAR, obviously we know you just submitted. You guys did a nice job asking for that re-up for last year. Capital ratios continue to build. Can you help us frame just how you're thinking about capital return in the context of still being in a really strong position versus still waiting for some of the things from the fed to swing one way or the other?","Charles Scharf","I think we've said what we have to say on capital, right, which is to the extent that we're not going to be using it to grow. We believe we should return it, and we feel good about our position and the process is the process.","Kenneth Usdin","Okay. Very good. Thank you, guys.","Charles Scharf","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning. Following up on the deposit commentary that you guys had this morning, have you been able to determine from your customers \u2013 the customers that are taking deposits out of non-interest-bearing, which ones are putting into interest-bearing versus putting it into their own businesses? Have you been able to decipher how much is going into their own business versus than just moving in over for a higher yielding deposits?","Michael Santomassimo","Yes, I think it's almost an impossible question to answer with any degree of like certainty by client. But I think as you sort of look at the themes, like it's clear, people are managing their cash more \u2013 they're trying to optimize the yield to get on their cash and being a little \u2013 having more urgency around that. And some are \u2013 some asset managers are putting to work, some companies that we deal, other corporates that we deal with maybe investing, but it's hard to say that with any degree of certainty.","Gerard Cassidy","I see. Okay. Thanks. And then second, if Chairman, Paul pivots similar to what Fed Reserve Chairman, Greenspan did following the 1994, 1995 tightening cycle where they were raising rates in the spring of 1995 and cut by July. If we see rate cuts and some of the futures markets is calling that the Fed funds are able to be cut this year. How quickly do you think your deposit betas could fall in that kind of environment?","Charles Scharf","I think it's \u2013 I mean obviously we'll have to see what's happening at that time, but if rates start to decline, we would expect that we would recapture that very quickly.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. Thank you.","Michael Santomassimo","Thanks, Gerard.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Great. Good morning. Quick question on the loans, you mentioned that there was lower client activity driving down the balances in the lending. Can you just maybe highlight it or give a little bit more color as to what the client activity was? Was it decreasing? And is that expected to increase at any point?","Michael Santomassimo","Yes, like loans are really small driver for us as you know from our balance sheets. But just to give you a sense of a little bit of color, we have margin loan activity or other securities-based lending activity in Pershing as an example, and we saw that come down. We don't think that's a permanent decline, but we saw that come down based on activity in the quarter. That's just an example, but it's a pretty small driver overall for the results.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. And then just separate question on Asset Servicing. You mentioned you saw a growth in the alternatives. Was that new or was it alternative clients new to outsourcing? Or was it just building relationships from clients that are already outsourced?","Charles Scharf","The mix, both.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. Thanks.","Charles Scharf","Okay. I think that's the last one. Thanks. We appreciate everyone dialing in. Thanks for the time. We'll talk soon.","Michael Santomassimo","Thanks everyone.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call webcast. A replay of this conference call webcast will be available on the BNY Mellon Investor Relations website at 2 p.m. Eastern Standard time today. Have a good day."]}}
