All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Ms. Tracy Ward, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin your conference.","Tracy A. Ward - SVP-Investor Relations & Corporate Communications","Thanks, Kyle and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2015 conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations.","This morning, we'll hear from Hamid Moghadam, our Chairman and CEO, who will comment on our company's strategy and the market environment; and then from Tom Olinger, our CFO who'll cover results and guidance. Also joining us for today's call are Gary Anderson, Mike Curless, Ed Nekritz, Gene Reilly and Diana Scott.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to state this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates as well as management's beliefs and assumptions.","Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance, and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings.","Additionally, our second quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures, such as FFO, EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures and in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Hamid, and we'll get started. Hamid?","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Tracy, and good morning, everyone. We just finished the great quarter and our financial results reflect very favorable market conditions and solid execution by the Prologis team. In fact, this year is shaping up to be one of the strongest in my 35 years in the business. We're halfway through the three-year plan we outlined for you at our Analyst Day in September of 2013.","Let me take a few moments to highlight our key accomplishments since that date. Capitalizing on the imminent rental recovery was the most important objective among our three key priorities as outlined in the plan. Our market rent growth forecast of 20% to 25% between 2013 and 2017 was viewed as quite bold at that time. Yet with the Americas and Asia slightly ahead of forecast and Europe slightly behind, the rent recovery cycle is unfolding pretty much as we expected leading to substantial growth in our earnings.","The strong rental recovery has been particularly pronounced in the U.S. where the increases are becoming evident in our rent growth and financial results. Our investment strategy with this focus on global market has enabled us to achieve rent increases of 22% with our share of same-store NOI exceeding 7% in the second quarter.","New supply in the U.S. continues to be absorbed at a rapid pace, driving vacancy down to 15-year lows. Our forecast calls for declining vacancy rates in the U.S. through the end of 2016 with supply and demand reaching equilibrium in 2017.","As the largest owner in the sector, we're constantly on the lookout for signs of overbuilding, as we have a vested interest in preventing oversupply in our markets. We'll not be shy about sounding the alarm bell at the first sign of undisciplined development. Don't be surprised if our future spec starts remain flat or even moderate compared to starts this year.","In Europe, improved customer sentiment is leading to growth in occupancies and rents, especially in the UK and Northern Europe. Markets in Central and Eastern Europe are also on demand, albeit at a slower rate. Even Southern Europe, which has lagged the other regions, is showing modest improvement.","The big story in Europe, however, is continued cap rate compression, which began about two years ago. The rates on the continent have tightened by about 150 basis points since 2013 and we expect them to drop another 50 basis points to 75 basis points over the next 12 months. In addition, appraisals in Europe continue to lag real-time transactions by about 50 basis points.","Turning to Asia, rents in Japan are growing at a healthy pace and vacancies are low. Competition, however, is seeding up, putting pressure on land prices and development margins. In China, procuring land in the top-tier markets remains a challenge, but high-quality product continues to lease in line with pro forma.","Our second key priority was to put our land bank to work to realize its embedded value, while meeting the needs of our customers. Midway through our three-year plan, we've generated $540 million in value creation or about a $1 per share in NAV on $1.9 billion of stabilizations.","At full build out, our land bank can support more than $10 billion of additional development or about four years of activity at our current pace. Our development margins will remain elevated and our closure rate on built-to-suit is running very high. We'll remain disciplined with our development starts and expect to create about $400 million or $0.75 a share of incremental NAV annually through our development activity.","Our third priority was to use our scale to grow earnings with minimal incremental overhead. At this point in the cycle, asset growth is likely to come through development and less from pure acquisitions, unless of course we're able to capitalize on a competitive advantage in a given situation; for example, through the use of appropriately priced OP units.","The KTR transaction is an excellent example of these principles and action. It's rare to have the opportunity to deliver significant immediate accretion to shareholders by finding a portfolio of such quality, which is so consistent with our own. The KTR transaction reduced our G&A to AUM ratio by more than 15% to 54 basis points. The continued build-out of our land banks will make us even more efficient as we scale our portfolio organically.","Turning to capital flows, globally we see considerable investor demand for high-quality industrial real estate. In the U.S., we announced these stabilized cap rates in the mid-to-high 4% range in our best global market. And as I've mentioned before, in Europe cap rates continue to fall as demonstrated by our fund valuations, where cap rates compressed by another 30 basis points in the quarter.","Before handling the call over to Tom I'd like to leave you with a couple of thoughts. The benefits of scale are clear and manifest themselves in important ways such as lower G&A costs, lower financing rates, and wider array of financing options and a higher share of wallet from key customers.","However, size alone does not make us better. We are better only when we deliver profitably on our objectives. Over the past several years, we've taken great care to position our portfolio to where it is today and we're confident that our efforts will pay off in terms of superior same store NOI growth in the coming years.","Factoring in core FFO growth in 2014 and the midpoint of our 2015 guidance, we'll have averaged 15.5% annual FFO growth over this two-year period. AFFO is growing even at faster rate, requiring us to increase our dividends three times over the past 18 months for a cumulative increase of 43%. With two years of results in, we've already surpassed what was considered to be an ambitious three-year plan as presented on that Analyst Day.","With that, I'll turn it over to Tom, who'll take you through the numbers and guidance.","Thomas S. Olinger - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Hamid. We had an outstanding second quarter and strong first half of 2015. Before I begin with our results, I want to remind you that we completed the acquisition of KTR on May 29. The properties were acquired by USLV, our joint venture with Norges. You'll see the impact run throughout our financial statements since we consolidate this venture. The portfolio is fully integrated. The assets have been successfully on-boarded in the day-to-day management of the properties has been transitioned to our regional teams, a terrific example of our ability to scale efficiently.","Now let's start with results for the quarter. Core FFO was $0.52 a share, up 8% over Q2 of 2014. For the first half of the year, core FFO was $1.01 per share, up 11% over the first half of last year. Based on feedback we've received from investors and analysts as well as that our share of operations and deployment drives our earnings, this will be the focus of our disclosures going forward. We will, however, continue to provide owned and managed information in our quarterly supplemental.","Quarter-end occupancy excluding the KTR assets was 95.6%, up 100% basis points over the second quarter last year. The KTR portfolio was 89% occupied at the time we announced the acquisition. The operations team is making great progress placing this portfolio, which was 92% leased at the end of the quarter.","GAAP rent change on rollover was 16.6% and the highest quarterly level we recorded to-date. Rent change was positive across all regions and led by the U.S. at 22.2%. GAAP same-store NOI increased 5.9% in the quarter and was led by the U.S. at 7.1%.","Now moving to capital deployment for the quarter, which again is on an our share basis. We continue to deliver very profitable developments. Development stabilizations were $578 million, with an estimated margin of over 31% and value creation of $179 million or $0.34 a share.","Development starts totaled $799 million with an estimated margin of 19.6%. Acquisitions were driven by KTR in total $3.2 billion at a stabilized cap rate of 5.5%. And contributions and building dispositions totaled $415 million with a stabilized cap rate of 5.9%.","Turning to capital markets, we continue to tap the foreign debt markets at very attractive terms. We completed $3.1 billion of financing activity in the quarter at a weighted average interest rate of 1.6% and term of almost five years. This included $1.6 billion, which was denominated in euro and yen.","Leverage at quarter end was 40.2% on a gross book value basis and $39.2% on total market capitalization basis, which is how most REIT's disclose leverage.","Debt-to-adjusted EBITDA and fixed charge coverage excluding realized gains was 7.6 times and 3.7 times for the quarter respectively. We have approximately $1.3 billion of short-term financing related to KTR, consisting of the $1 billion term loans due in 2017 and the remainder on our line. Our plan is to repay this balance through asset sales, and I'll get into the specifics of that in a moment. We continue to maintain significant liquidity subsequent to the closing of the KTR acquisition, with over $2.4 billion at quarter end, plus we have no unsecured debt maturities until 2017.","Now let's turn to our outlook and guidance for the year. For operations, we're maintaining our year-end occupancy range of between 95.5% and 96.5%, and continue to expect development stabilizations for 2015 of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. We're establishing guidance for our share of GAAP same-store NOI to range between 5% and 5.5%. Looking forward, the majority of our same-store NOI growth will be driven by capturing the current spread between in place and market rents as leases roll.","To put this into perspective, even with no further market rent growth, our share of same-store NOI in 2016 should grow at about 4% from just capturing today's rent spread. Our assumption, however, is that market rents will continue to grow. We continue to expect net G&A for 2015 to range between $235 million and $245 million.","On the strategic capital front, we've increased our expected revenue range to between $200 million and $210 million. Also included in our guidance is an expected net promote from our PELP venture in the fourth quarter of 2015 of about $0.04.","In terms of capital deployment, I'll refer you to our supplemental, page eight, for detail on our updated guidance ranges and our share of each activity. You'll note the most significant change is the increase in disposition guidance, as well as we believe this is a great time to sell non-strategic assets that we have value maximized.","At the midpoint, our share of the expected net deployment for the second half of 2015 is about $350 million proceeds. But I need to point out that the Morris industrial transaction is included in our acquisition guidance, which we will fund with approximately $400 million OP units. Therefore, the total cash net deployment proceeds for the second half will be approximately $750 million.","Now let me spend a minute discussing the plan to permanently capitalize KTR and focus on three aspects. First, we will retire the short-term KTR borrowings of $1.3 billion through a combination of dispositions and contributions, primarily in the U.S. and Europe. With the proceeds generated in the back half of this year, we will repay approximately 60% of this balance and take our leverage to roughly 37%. We'll complete the remainder of the plan in the first half of next year to fully retire the KTR borrowings and fund our development needs. At that point, our leverage would be in the mid 30%s, in line with our target credit metrics and on a path to an A rating.","Second, this plan does not assume any sell down of our fund interest. The reason we've prioritized dispositions in this plan is because we expect substantial increases in European valuations over the next year. Since the downturn, we have opportunistically acquired additional interest in many of our ventures, particularly in Europe. As a result, we are well above our long-term ownership target of 20%, and giving us significant financial capacity. For example, reducing our interest to this level in our ventures would generate upwards of $3 billion of capital at today's values, providing substantial embedded liquidity, optionality, and capacity to fund our capital needs beyond the conclusion of this plan.","Third, given our confidence in this plan and the embedded capacity within these ventures, we have no need to issue equity, as it'd generate excess liquidity based on our current deployment outlook, and is also consistent with our view of attaining an A rating.","Putting our guidance all together, we're increasing the midpoint of our 2015 core FFO, which we now expect to range between $2.18 and $2.22 per share. This represents 17% year-over-year growth, or an increase of $0.32 at the midpoint of our guidance, which follows 14% growth last year.","As Hamid mentioned, our AFFO is growing faster than our core FFO in 2015, and as a result, we announced an increase in our third quarter dividend to $0.40 a share. In closing, we had a great quarter and our outlook for our business is equally as strong.","With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI","Thanks, good morning. Tom, I was just wondering if you could provide a little more clarity on I guess the cap rates that you might expect, a range of cap rates from the asset sales to fund the KTR deal? I'm just trying to think about maybe what the negative arbitrage would be between what you bought KTR for and the cap rates on dispositions?","Thomas S. Olinger - Chief Financial Officer","The cap rates are going to be on average; again, you need to think about this as just being not only dispositions but contributions. I think overall, you're going to see those be in the mid-to-high \u2013 the low 5%s on contributions, all the way up to the \u2013 maybe the mid-to-high 6% on some dispositions. When you blend that all together, one thing you need to take into consideration, though, is, when we contribute assets for funds, we also get incremental fees, which certainly offsets the dilution.","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The other thing is, Steve, there's some land sales as well in that, and of course, the cap rate on land sales is zero. So, I think it will end up being in the mid-to-high 5%s, when you blend it all together.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Auerbach from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","George Auerbach - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks, good morning. Tom, with KTR closed, can you now talk more specifically about which portfolios, or the overall size of the assets that you have in the market for sale in the U.S. and Europe to fund KTR? And in addition, can you just clarify your comment on PELP, the sell-down? It sounded to me like, from your comments, that we should no longer expect a sell-down of PELP this year.","Thomas S. Olinger - Chief Financial Officer","That's correct. So, to be clear, our plans is not \u2013 our plan to permanently finance the KTR outstanding balance of $1.3 billion assumes no sell-down in our European ventures. And again, as I mentioned, the reason we're focusing on dispositions and contributions for this plan is because we expect substantial cap rate compression in Europe over the next year, and as we look at how we're value maximizing assets on sale, we're prioritizing dispositions and contributions.","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The other thing I would add to that is actually selling in our funds would be the easiest execution that we have out there, because really all we got to do is look at the NAV at the end of the quarter based on appraisals and make a phone call to actually to get that done.","So, there is very little execution risk on that. It's just that as I mentioned to you, there is a lag in cap rates from reality. There's about 50 basis points of lag between appraised cap rates and reality in the marketplace, and we think the reality of the marketplace is poised for further compression. So, yes, we could go do the easy thing and put this thing to bed tomorrow, but we'd be leaving about 100 basis points of value on the table and we have lots of other ways of getting to the same place. But we have this as a plan B with $3 billion of cushion. So, we're not losing a lot of sleep over this.","Michael S. Curless - Chief Investment Officer","This is Mike. In terms of the geographic distribution of the portfolios that we currently have in the marketplace or will have very shortly out there, it's a good spread of about a dozen markets, some global markets as well as some regional markets. I think it's a good mix of product that'd be attractive to what we're seeing as a very large buyer pool out there. And in terms of pricing, we have high expectations given the outstanding cap rates we're seeing now in the U.S. It's a really good time to put incremental portfolios out in the market and we're bullish on our ability to get that done by year end.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman from KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Craig Mailman - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Just want to follow-up on the disposition theme here. Looking at where you guys are trading relative to private market cap rates, just thoughts on ramping the disposition program even further to potentially buy back stock.","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, one thing at a time. I mean, first, our dispositions I want to emphasize the plan \u2013 the disposition plan actually has nothing to do with KTR. We would have sold these very same properties as the final step in the clean-up of our portfolio to align it with our strategy, just like the properties we sold in 2011, 2012, and 2013 and 2014. So, it's just basically the last phase of that. So, KTR, other than a few properties out of KTR itself, does not really impact our disposition plan. It's business as usual. It happens to coincide with paying off the financing that we took on in connection with KTR. But that's just coincidental.","So, that's the way we're looking at financing our business and any of you guys have anything else to add to that?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. You mentioned that the development margin should remain elevated. Could you comment on development yields by market first across the U.S.? We've heard there are some cities where it could be as low as 4%, others more like 6% or higher. And then if you could also provide the international color on the build yields as well. Thanks.","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Gene, will address that question. I did not address one part of Craig's question, which is on stock buyback. Look, we're going to continue to execute on our disposition plan and also the fund sell-down to align with what our long-term ownership plans are in those funds.","Obviously, we'll be in a substantially liquid position. We'll be a lot more liquid than what we need to achieve our A rating. And that capital is available for all kinds of purposes, including potentially stock buyback, but we are nine months to a year away from that because that would be the last thing we would execute on.","So, depends on where the stock sits at that point in time, and right now we think our priority should be selling our non-strategic assets and paying off the financing associated with KTR and the stock buybacks are something that will come later, and we'll have the capacity to do a lot of that obviously. So this whole issue of equity issuance, which is \u2013 everybody keeps worrying and talking about, honestly we don't get it, because the problem we're trying to solve is excess liquidity not a lack of liquidity. Gene, you want to start?","Eugene F. Reilly - Chief Executive Officer-Americas Region","Yeah, yeah with respect to the development margin, so the U.S. will be sort of high teens and as we've said that we're going to remain elevated in margins, I would say at least over the next 12 months, that I could see. In terms of where that actual returns on cost are, I mean it really range from the mid to high 5%s, in LA for example, if you were to do a build to suit in a 4.5% cap rate environment, it could be that low and they range into the mid 7% depending on U.S. market. So if you look at Mexico, you're going to be in low to mid 8%s, and then of course in Brazil you're going to be in the 10% to 13% in terms of return on cost.","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Our development yields in Europe, Continental Europe I'd say 7%, 7.5% something like that, in the UK probably in the 5% to 6% range depending on the market. Obviously, if you're in the London market, it's going to be lower than if you're up in the Midlands. In China, I'd say they're close to the same as Continental Europe probably in that 7%, 7.5% range and then Japan, obviously lower than that 5.5% to 6%. But again, we expect yields to be pretty healthy for the foreseeable future, cap rates are compressing in Europe and values are strong in Asia.","Thomas S. Olinger - Chief Financial Officer","And our land bank is still \u2013 books substantially less than fair value.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Maiorana from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, good morning. I wanted to ask about the dividend raise. Your AFFO, Hamid, I think you mentioned has grown pretty nicely, grown faster than FFO and probably somewhere around $1.80 or $1.85 share annually. So you've got nice coverage relative to the dividend but you guys do capitalize G&A into development, so that doesn't hit the P&L and then you capitalize some interest expense as well. And we're at a good point in the business cycle. But if development slows down and you start to expense some of those costs that are capitalized, do you still feel like you'd have solid coverage of the dividend at $1.60 relative to an AFFO number if you had to expense a few more of those items?","Thomas S. Olinger - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Hey, Brendan. Brendan, this is Tom. So, absolutely we have very strong coverage when you look at where our payout ratios are, we look at this with realized gains because that's TI and that's got to go out the door or a proportion of it does. So we're in a low 60% payout ratio. If you want to exclude realized gains, which we don't look at, but we would be in the mid to high 80%s exactly where we've been long-term after this divined raise.","So we feel good about our coverage. We actually need to raise our dividend, not only \u2013 we're not trying to just meet our payout ratios or our target, we're really trying to make sure we're paying out the statutory minimum. So we've got TI pressure that we need to increase \u2013 continue to increase the dividend to make sure we're getting the right amount of TI dividends out the door. Now on your question about capitalized cost, to put in perspective, we'll capitalize about $70 million of development overhead this year and maybe $65 million of capped interest. So when you look at that $70 million against midpoint of starts for $2.6 billion, that's about 2.6% or 2.7%. So it's a fairly conservative cap \u2013 fairly conservative capitalization ratio when you think about what is actually out in the marketplace. So, even if you would cut those capitalized costs by $10 million or $20 million, which is I think would be a pretty substantial cut that would have a very minimal impact on our AFFO given the nominal amount of AFFO that we have out there. So bottom-line, we feel really good about our coverage and in that scenario, I don't think it would materially cover \u2013 materially impact our dividend payout ratio, particularly as we look at our growth prospects going forward from rents rolling to market.","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Brendan, can I give you one little other piece of color. I mean, we've got a big advantage in that we're a global developer, and we've talked about this in the past. Look at the spread of our development activity, it is very broad and there's one building per market, we've got \u2013 we're building in each one of the geographies, $2.5 billion of development spend is not a big deal for us, we can certainly do more, but we have the advantage of literally picking the markets that we want to develop in. So I think $2.5 billion run rate is a pretty safe rate.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel from Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.","Eric J. Frankel - Green Street Advisors, Inc.","Thank you. I wanted to touch upon the operating portfolio a little bit. First, I'm not sure, do you ever mention what your cash releasing spreads were by market? And second, regarding releasing spreads, which markets benefited the most? Were there global markets, were there more of the regional markets or just like to get a little bit of more color on that. Thank you.","Thomas S. Olinger - Chief Financial Officer","Eric, I'll take the cash rent change on rollover question. So, I did not mention it, but the cash rent change on rollover was about 4.5% for the quarter as compared to the GAAP rent change. Now that's spread a little wider than what we've had in the past, but what's happening is given the significant spread between market and rolling rents, our customers are asking for help to mitigate really the sticker shock that's happening with the significant rise in market rates, just look at this quarter alone. In the U.S., we saw 23% increase in spot rates to rolling rates and as a result, we're trying to help customers ease into these higher rents with escalations, and really just in the initial part of the lease. So that's why it's really important to look at the net effect of rents calculation, because that captures the economics of the overall lease. Looking at the cash rent change, you pick up just that spot change from the last lease to the initial lease, which clearly doesn't represent the economics of what you're signing up for. So we focus on the GAAP net effective.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee from Stifel. Your line is open.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great, thank you. Here's my question, I'm trying to get to the bottom of it, is you've got great same-store NOI growth. You've got excellent mark-to-market. You have a good value creation and development pipeline. But if I look at PLD at a 5% fixed cap rate, your per share in 2013 was $46.80 and your per share (31:07) for 2015 is $47.70, which is less than a dollar of value creation from 2013 to 2015. So I can't quite see where the leakage is and do you guys have any explanation for that?","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm not sure how that math works, John. I mean the NOI number is growing. If you're taking the same cap rate and applying it, actually interest rates are increasing, so the mark-to-market on the debt should be getting smaller and we're creating $400 million of NAV though the development process every year. So I got to look at the detailed math of what you're talking about, but I'm not sure I totally understand it. There is some degree of FX factored into that, but again, most of that is mitigated because of the fact that we have matched liabilities with our assets overseas.","So, I mean I can't do that math for you right now but would be happy to take you through that analysis. By our estimation, our NAV should grow by about a $1 a share, a little less than a $1 a share though the development activity and in the foreseeable future, we see earnings growth in the low-double digit range and probably even 10% just to pick an easy number. So that'd be $3 to $4 of NAV growth. So I don't know what you're doing with your math, but happy to take a look at it.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Am I still on the line?","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You are.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Oh, this math just comes from page 34 to 36 from your NAV. This is not anything I'm doing creatively or uniquely. I'm just tracking your NAV as presented in your supplemental every quarter for the last three or four years.","Thomas S. Olinger - Chief Financial Officer","Well, the other piece of it, John, would be the cap rate that you're assuming as well, on that NOI.","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","There's definitely been cap rate compression over the last 12 months, for sure. And I don't know if you're using a constant cap rate or what you're doing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brad Burke from Goldman Sachs.","Brad K. Burke - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning guys. I wanted to ask about your leverage mix. Obviously, you're able to issue a lot of debt this quarter at a very low rate. Just want to get an update on how you're thinking about the mix of floating rate in non-U.S. dollar denominated debt versus where you're at today?","Thomas S. Olinger - Chief Financial Officer","Brad, this is Tom. So, today, we're at about \u2013 in the high teens on variable rate debt. Prior to the KTR funding, we were in the high-single digits. We're going to get back to that high-single digit range once we complete the permanent funding plan, and with selling dispositions and contributions that will fund this. So we'll get back down to that range. Our bias is to go long and to fix as much interest as we can at this point, just given where rates are. Regarding the mix of foreign currency debt versus U.S. dollar debt, based on where our U.S. dollar net equity is, we're at about at 90.6% at the end of this quarter, once we complete the KTR plan, we're going to be pushing more of the middle, middle 90%s, of U.S. dollar net equity. So, we don't have really any room today to move up our proportionate of foreign dollar debt. Going forward, we will do our best to match fund our foreign-denominated asset growth with foreign-denominated debt.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Dave Rodgers from Baird. Your line is open.","Dave B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yes, good morning, guys. Maybe for Mike, a question on construction cost. Can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of the construction cost components increasing? And maybe a second part to that is, how do you see construction cost keeping pace with rent growth here, particularly in the U.S., in the near-term?","Michael S. Curless - Chief Investment Officer","Dave, in terms of construction costs, we're seeing there has been increases in the U.S. over the last couple of years, in the 3% to 4% range, perhaps as high as 5% in select markets where competition is more intense. For the most part in the global markets, we're seeing rents outpace that, that's why you're seeing some construction, that you are from a supply standpoint. Going forward, we anticipate that moderating a bit, maybe into the 2% or 3% range, but I think there is still some pretty significant competition for construction services, given the heavy load of development activity that's out there.","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And in Europe, I'd just say, we haven't really seen significant construction cost increases, because there isn't a lot of development going on today, maybe just a bit. China, we're seeing some small increases as supply continues to move forward, and Japan is the interesting one. Japan, we had a spike right when the 2020 Olympics were announced, and then it peaked and it basically stopped. And we think that, as you get closer to the 2020 Olympics, you're going to see construction cost increases in Japan. At the same time today, we're seeing land increases, very significant land increases, in Japan. So, I think that underpins a pretty healthy story for rent growth in Japan over the next several years.","Michael S. Curless - Chief Investment Officer","And land is increasing pretty much across the board in the U.S., along with entitlement cost. So, while construction increases have been moderate, we think they're going to outpace inflation. Overall replacement costs are going up pretty rapidly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vin Chao from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, good morning, everyone. I just want to go back to the rent spreads here, which were quite strong in the quarter, accelerated from the first quarter. But I think, when they were talked about originally, there was some negative mix in the first half, more European leasing than in the second half. Just curious if that maybe didn't play out the way you thought, and that was part of the reason why we saw such strength in the first half spreads, or if that's still going to be a positive tailwind to you in the back half, and if you could maybe quantify that, how that mix is changing?","Thomas S. Olinger - Chief Financial Officer","Vince, this is Tom. We've really normalized the mix, starting in Q2. Q1, we were \u2013 and part of last year, as you point out, we were more heavily weighted towards Europe, and particularly Southern Europe and Central and Eastern Europe, so it's moderated. So that would be one thing. And then second would just be the strength of the U.S. markets and the proportion of leasing with the U.S. markets driving these returns. So going forward, I think we'll expect \u2013 I don't foresee any real mix issues like we had in the past with Europe, with U.S. being disproportionally different.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman from Citi. Your line is open.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey guys, good morning. If we could just go back to your earlier comment on cap rates compressing in Europe and your hesitation to sell there at the moment, can you balance that against, A, your acquisition plans for the rest of the year, maybe into next year, and how much of that will be in Europe? And B, how you get comfort (38:47) buying in the U.S. and selling in the U.S. at the same time?","Thomas S. Olinger - Chief Financial Officer","Well, from a mix standpoint, if you look at our acquisitions this year, it's very much \u2013 you really need to look at the remainder of the year. It is weighted towards the U.S. and the Morris industrial transaction, which we agreed upon pricing there probably six to nine months ago. So, from that standpoint, we are focusing on \u2013 that's a big driver of the U.S., as well as, we do have some U.S. 1031 activity going forward. When it looks about balancing, buying in the U.S. versus Europe, we're always looking at the relative returns, and the overall growth profile of what we're buying and what we're selling. And as \u2013 looking at the KTR portfolio, in particular, very high quality portfolio that we expect to perform right in line with the rest of our U.S. portfolio. Look at how our U.S. portfolio is performing right now. We expect the KTR portfolio, similar quality, to perform equally as well. I think that is a big testament to why we wanted to buy that portfolio.","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The only comment I'd make with respect to Europe is as Tom said in his prepared remarks, we've obviously increased our ownership position in our funds, that's the best acquisition that can make. Over the last several years, we've been buying portfolios and as we've told you there, well, we'd like to buy more in Europe, there aren't a lot of portfolios to buy, so we're focusing our time on those one-off acquisitions, and those value-add deals, and you can see it coming through in our numbers.","We did two building acquisitions, one in Prague and one in Netherlands in the second quarter, and a total of $144 million year-to-date. If we could get more in Europe and it was good quality stuff, we would do that. At the same time, we will be selling non-strategic assets in Europe, when we feel like they're value maximized. So we are going to be both buyer and seller in a market like this.","Thomas S. Olinger - Chief Financial Officer","And rounding out the activity in the U.S. the majority of it outside of the large portfolios of Morris and KTR are the value-add acquisitions in U.S. as well, where our local teams identify those, those aren't subject to the same pricing pressures in general that we see on the larger portfolios and it's a way we keep our acquisition activity strong in U.S. more on a case-by-case, project-by-project basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust Robinson. Your line is open.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. So Hamid, maybe we can go back to the earlier conversation regarding capital deployment and KTR. And I think I heard you correctly when you said that you didn't fully understand the market's reaction to equity overhang risk, some of the things that you've heard from the buy side. If you could reflect on just what has happened in the past four months or so with the KTR deal, what are some of the things that you possibly learned or maybe you could have done differently maybe a forward equity issuance or maybe just a whole host of things that you could have done differently or not. I was just curious what your reflections are regarding that and how your stock price reacted post the deal and what feedback you received from investors?","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. That's a really good question. The thing that I learned is that you can be totally honest with people in the way you present something. And in the interest of being super honest and straightforward with people, you could convey an impression that could be really inaccurate. So let me elaborate. Every M&A deal that a company does, they talk about its accretion using the capital structure that will be deployed immediately to fund that acquisition, which in our case is 1.5% debt. And we should have come out maybe and said this deal is not only NAV neutral because we're buying in the (42:51) market, but it is accretive to the tune of 15% or some crazy number like that because we're financing it on the margin with 1.5% debt. And that would have been the least if you will honest thing \u2013 honest way we could have portrayed it. So we elected not to do that. We used the word, this is how accretive it is on a leverage neutral basis. And I think the market read that as, we are immediately going to finance this on a leverage neutral basis, and I think it created an overhang. I mean, remember, we own a lot of the stock. We're not selling our stock at a 10% discount or now 20% discount to real estate value just to buy fully-priced real estate. We get that math. I mean come on guys, we've been doing this for a while, okay.","So, clearly, that is not what we intended to do. We know all the sources that we have. We know how much non-strategic assets we have that we're going to have to sell, anyway whether we do KTR or not. Sure we have to sell a few more with KTR because as we've mentioned to you, about 5% of KTR is long-term non-strategic. So, yeah, we're going to sell our non-strategic assets and that happens to fully fund this transaction over a 12-month period, and to us that's very comfortable.","We are committed to our single A rating, but that doesn't mean we need to achieve it tomorrow. We're heading in that direction. We are not telling you different story to the rating agencies that we're telling to the equity holders, all of what we've told you has been consistent and in my belief presented in the most responsible way possible.","But I think the issue about the leverage neutral language and the talking about the timing that was assumed that we're going to get this in balance right this second half after it closes. I think we're actually misinterpreted by the market and we'll take the responsibility for that miscommunication.","But the reality is, we'll clearly fund this transaction within a year. Our leverage ratios will be back in line consistent with that single A rating and above and beyond this, we've got about $3 billion in effect equity firepower sitting in our funds that once those funds and ventures are valued properly, particularly in Europe because of continued cap rate compression and closure of that appraisal lag. We'll take advantage of those in a way that it matches with our needs \u2013 with our capital needs. So we don't have a big capital drag on our income statement. I hope that clarifies.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum from UBS. Your line is up.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, thanks. Hamid, you had commented that we shouldn't be surprised if the development pipeline stabilizes or goes down as we look out over the next few years. I'm going to assume that we should also expect the same from the land bank but perhaps you could comment a little more, is there any expectation the market should have that the land bank could really move down beyond what happens to the development pipeline just so that you get more of these non-income producing assets off your book so that your earnings multiple isn't negatively impacted by that?","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, that's a really good question. To be perfectly candid with you, not all of our land is strategic. In fact, we've quantified, classified about $400 million of our land as non-strategic, meaning that we don't intend to develop it, either somebody else is going to develop it or we'll sell it to user or something like that. So of our book value of land bank that you see today, $400 million of it should not be there, and we're going to sell that no matter what and not replace it with anything else. So the land bank for sure would come down. Then in a normal market, we will be acquiring land at the same rate as we'll be putting land into production. We'll reach some level of equilibrium at some point. Our best guess is that in that situation, we would have a $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion of land, which is about two years of development at the run rate of $2.5 billion and the math on that is pretty simple.","Two years of $2.5 billion development is $5 billion and land is about 25% of the total. So that gets you to about $1.250 billion of land that we need to carry around here. And so if you want to be in the development business and generate whatever we generated, I think it was 17 unleveraged by IRRs over a period of 15 years, you've got to have land.","The unfortunate thing as you all know in our business, we don't get to cap that as earnings, and that's fine, because I think when industry counted that as earnings bad things happened. So we're good, but it's real money. It's real cash that comes in the bank in the company and it's real NAV that's created and we can patient to realize that value. So the bottom line is, we like the development business. You have to have some land to account for it to be able to play in that business. It's the highest rate of return business we have, but we have too much land in relation to our development volume going forward.","As to my comment that we're going to moderate it is that look four years ago, five years ago, before there was a development business in the depth of the crisis, we told all of you that our annual development volume is going to normalize from $2 billion to $3 billion a year globally and in some markets and in sometimes, it's going to get closer to $3 billion and in sometimes, it's going to get closer to $2 billion. And I guess what I'm saying is that it's been going steadily up in the last three or four years and now it's about $2.6 billion, $2.7 billion. Don't be surprised if that comes down to $2.4 billion, $2.5 billion or something like. I mean that's very normal, and we're going to bounce around numbers like that going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Jamie C. Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thank you. I'm here with Jeff Spector as well. Can you just talk a little bit about the KTR yields and how they came in or how they are coming in versus your original expectations? I think on the first quarter call you guys had said the in place was a 5.2% cash, this stabilized was a 5.5% and if you backed out the CIP in land it's a 4.85%. And along the same lines if you look at there was an occupancy dip across the portfolio in the second quarter, can you talk about how much of that was KTR versus the rest of your portfolio and what gives you comfort on getting to the guidance you've laid out which is at least a 10 basis point growth if not more?","Eugene F. Reilly - Chief Executive Officer-Americas Region","Yeah. So, Jamie. It's Gene. I think KTR had a 20 basis point effect globally. But let me get to your yield. So things are playing out as expected, if anything the rents we're getting on new leases. And by the way we've signed about 40 leases since we've announced this transaction about 2.5 million square feet in that portfolio, but we're right out of 5.5% yield on a stabilized basis. So this is the same way we describe any acquisition. So that's 95% occupancy.","At 89%, you're correct, it was around a 5.2%, but we're already at 92% leased in this portfolio. And our plan is to be just under 95% by the end of the year. So we're a little ahead of schedule relative to the 12-months timeframe that we outlined to get KTR in line with the rest of the U.S. portfolio, or said another way, around 96%. So, hopefully that clears up the yield. I mean I see upsides in the yields because the rents coming in a little better than we expected.","Thomas S. Olinger - Chief Financial Officer","Jamie, on your point about the 4.9% cap rate. I think you meant to say that if you include the land in the CIP, in addition to the operating assets, the yield would be 4.9%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman from KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hello. Can you hear me?","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Go ahead, Craig.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, it's Jordan Sadler here with Craig. Just a clarification. Can you \u2013 are you saying that and I think I understand the sentiment, but there's no equity in the plan any longer. I think last call and where some of the confusion came in was, Tom, you gave the example on a leverage neutral basis talking about the issuance of potentially $1.5 billion of equity. So obviously there's some communication about that ultimate financing, which I know I now understand was not imminent necessarily in terms of how you were trying to communicate it. But now you're saying the plan just does not assume equity, this is going to be done through asset sales.","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","If I may take that question because it's my bad more than company's or Tom. I think we laid out alternative financing plans for you. I think we laid out three financing plans and one of them included equity, and two of them did not include equity. And we wanted to be \u2013 we wanted to give you the bookends of what could happen in terms of financing this deal. Our current plan and the one that we're executing right now assumes no equity, the only equity that exists is in effect the OP units that are part of the Morris transaction that go with the Morris acquisition. I mean if you want to really define equity in a broad way and just by way of reminder the valuation of that equity is fixed at where our NAV was on whatever we negotiated that deal about a year ago. It's $43.11, which by the way after discount, issuance discounts and all that is equivalent of $45 a share. So that's the only equity that's ever been in the plan before or after KTR and there is none contemplated in the current plan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee from Stifel. You line is open.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes, on a lighter note, going back to Europe, I've been watching the Tour de France almost every night, and I have yet to see a PLD roof or a PLD sponsor on any of the teams. Are you guys doing that this year over there?","Unknown Speaker","(54:25)","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's too expensive, John. It's too expensive to get your name on that \u2013 on those jerseys, as you know, so we're going to keep our money for dividend growth, but...","Timothy D. Arndt - Senior Vice President, Strategic Planning and Analysis, Prologis, Inc.","You may see something on the roofs, though.","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, so John, you asked a good question, and Tim Arndt, our Treasurer, has been actually trying to reconcile the numbers for you, so instead of waiting, I think he is prepared to talk about it right now. So let's answer your last question now.","Timothy D. Arndt - Senior Vice President, Strategic Planning and Analysis, Prologis, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, John. I'm guessing, I think, between the two periods you described, you're seeing, if we look at, (55:02) I believe you're holding cap rates constant, understand that; the NOI growth is flowing through; you're probably seeing an addition of something like $3 to $4 a share on that basis, and I'm guessing you're also seeing something on the order of $1.50 a share in terms of development value creation added over that period.","I think the components you're missing are, we had about a $1 come through, the way we present our NAV in the supplemental, what would appear to be loss from debt extinguishment, which is a temporary phenomena, we bear those debt premiums initially and we earn them back in a period of about two to three years through lower interest expense subsequently. So that'll be coming back through the NAV statements through about 2018, 2019.","The other component that would deserve acknowledgment is, it's really 2013 when we got ahead of all of our hedging and debt placements, and until that got up and running, it's a fact that we probably saw about $1 to $1.50 of NAV loss before that program got completed. If you looked at what we did in terms of bond financing in the euro market, as that market opened up, that principally got done in 2014. So, you know we're fully hedged now, we won't see any further loss from FX in NAV today, and we'll earn the debt extinguishment back in about two to three years.","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And John, so that you understand the strategy behind the timing of that euro match funding. The time we did the merger, 40% of Prologis' equity was in foreign currencies \u2013 I mean, I'm sorry, in U.S. dollar. 60% of Prologis' equity was in foreign dollars and to that date we had \u2013 certainly I had not ever heard a single call about currency exposure in this company. One of our first objectives, the day the transaction closed, that we said we're going to neutralize and insulate this company against currency movement. But we couldn't do it immediately because remember, the PEPR was a big component. We had to bring PEPR in and then recapitalize it with PELP, all that stuff, until we could get all the puppies in the right pond, we couldn't really refinance the transaction.","So, as soon as we got these pieces in the right buckets, we basically executed on our immunization strategy on FX, which is \u2013 it's really like debt extinguishment. Basically, you had an FX hit upfront, and you're going to earn it back over time in terms of earnings and matching on the debt side. So, if we hadn't done that, at that time, the launch that Tim just qualified for you for $1.50 would have been in excess of $5 a share.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel from Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.","Eric J. Frankel - Green Street Advisors, Inc.","Thanks for all the questions. Tom, not to beat a dead horse, but regarding the releasing spreads, could you clarify what the average rent bumps you're getting on new leases? Second, regarding disposition plans, how many market exits do you guys plan over the next year or so? And then third, related to the KTR deal, it looks like New Jersey had the biggest dip in occupancy, so just want to understand if there's any particular buildings that need to get leased up? Thank you.","Thomas S. Olinger - Chief Financial Officer","Eric, I'll take the first part of that. So our bumps over the life of the lease really aren't changing on a long-term basis. What's really happening is, the initial rent in this, call it the first maybe six months of leases that are getting stepped up. So instead of walking somebody to market day one, the sticker shock that is happening, tenants would like to walk into that say, over three months or six months. So that initial rent, you're not seeing the full mark-to-market day one, but you are going to see it over the next quarter or two.","Eugene F. Reilly - Chief Executive Officer-Americas Region","Eric, let me give you an example. And this is real life and, during this past quarter, we had like a dozen examples like this. So put yourself in a tenant's position, you're paying $3 a foot in rent and the market rent today is $5. That exists all over the United States, okay? That's real sticker shock, and we may cut a deal at $5 flat, okay, in which case you'd have a 66% cash rent change, or you may say, all right, we're going to give you $3 for the first year, then it's $5, then it's $6.25 for the next two years.","That's a 0% cash rent change. And that second deal has a higher net present value to us. So, it's \u2013 the problem with this statistic is that, in volatile periods on the upward cycle and the downward cycle, it doesn't really tell the whole story.","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, with all due respect, and we should stick to real estate, which is our business, and leave analytics to you guys. But in any asset class where the duration of the leases is longer than one year, the concept of cash to cash comparison becomes a little problematic. In apartments and hotels that \u2013 or whatever \u2013 that concept works just fine, because there is no profile through the term of the lease. But the minute you get into four or five year leases, you can do all kinds of shapes of leasing with different present value implications that will affect that number, but really doesn't affect the effective rent. But we'll continue to report it and I'm sure you'll continue to look at it, but honestly in the way we run our business, we're not that focused on that number.","Eugene F. Reilly - Chief Executive Officer-Americas Region","Yes, we could also make our teams confirmed to a policy that would make us look better, but I want to do that. I want these guys to do smart deals based on what the market gives them. So your other question was on New Jersey. So we have 750,000 square foot development go into the operating pool this quarter and that really is the driver of the occupancy. With respect to that building, we've good activity one it. We're not really worried about it and New Jersey overall has frankly had quite a bit of construction over the last year, but that's very much moderated, not much in the pipeline. So, we feel good about that market long-term, but it's that development that was pulled into the pool that caused that.","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And it was a Prologis development, not a KTR development.","Eugene F. Reilly - Chief Executive Officer-Americas Region","Correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Maiorana from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. A follow-up for Tom. So the property operating margin in the quarter was pretty high. It was close to 73%, which I think is one of the highest that you guys have had in Q2 for the past several years and was up sequentially from Q1 pretty materially even though occupancy levels were down. Just wondering if there was anything unusual that hit this quarter such that the operating margin might be impacted from the run rate \u2013 from the Q2 level for the back half of the year or as we think about it for 2016?","Thomas S. Olinger - Chief Financial Officer","Nothing unusual that would move that materially. We're \u2013 just given where occupancies are trending, right, very high and where we're seeing \u2013 revenues are certainly growing a heck of a lot faster than expenses and occupancy is going up, so our operating leverage is increasing meaningfully and that is what's going to drive that margin.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sumit Sharma from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Sumit Sharma - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Sorry, no questions. They've all been asked. Thanks","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Great. I think that was the last question. Again, I want to thank you for participating. We're really feeling good about our business and we are not taking our eye off the risks that are entailed in our business.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Ms. Tracy Ward, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Tracy Ward","Thanks, Suzanne, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2015 conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations.","This morning, we\u2019ll hear from Hamid Moghadam, our Chairman and CEO, who will comment on the company\u2019s strategy and the market environment; and then from Tom Olinger, our CFO, who\u2019ll cover results and guidance. Also joining us for today\u2019s call are Gary Anderson, Mike Curless, Ed Nekritz, Gene Reilly, and Diana Scott.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I\u2019d like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates as well as management\u2019s beliefs and assumptions.","Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance, and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings.","Additionally, our third quarter earnings press release and supplemental do contain financial measures, such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures and in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Hamid, and we\u2019ll get started.","Hamid Moghadam","Thanks, Tracy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter call. Let me start with some brief introductory comments, and I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom for more details on the quarter.","In most markets, business just keeps getting better. The operating environment is stronger than I\u2019ve ever witnessed in the U.S. In Europe, rents are flat and occupancies are trending up, cap rates continue to compress. Let me call out Paris as the only major submarket in Europe that I can think off.","In Japan, we have a mixed picture. Development is up 26%, but surprisingly sentiment is strong, and there\u2019s quite a bit of preleasing, rents remain strong. China is slowing, but less than the media headline suggest. In fact, the business relating to this domestic consumption is very strong, and it\u2019s only the export locations that are experiencing some softness.","In Brazil, demand for industrial real estate is holding up despite a weak overall economy. Overall, I would summarize demand as being ahead of our expectations and supply below. We\u2019re seeing bidding words between customers for space something we hadn\u2019t seen in many, many years. As the difference between in-place and market rents widened, there is a multiyear driver of NOI growth that\u2019s created, which is almost independent of market rent growth assumptions from here on now. All of these factors have led to very strong financial results for the quarter and the year so far.","I want to address the issue of supply, because I get a lot of questions on this. We just came from ULI in San Francisco, and I must say that the memories of the great recession are quite fresh. The toll that it took on real estate will not be forgotten soon. Nobody seems to want to go there again, and all of us are looking for sustained long-term growth in rents. While it\u2019s the best of times in our industry, our takeaway is that the tone is very conservative in our new development.","Customers on the other hand are pressing us for more space to fulfill their needs. We get hurt this over and over again at our recent Customer Advisory Meeting in New York. We said we\u2019d be vigilant on supply, and in that vein, I\u2019d like to call out Houston, as a market that has the potential for getting overbuilt. There are 7 million feet of construction coming online, mostly in the port market and 3 million square feet of that is spec. So that\u2019s a market we are watching very carefully.","Globally, we\u2019re cautious with our development starts, particularly on the spec side, because supply and demand are not closer to equilibrium. On the other hand, our built to suit volume has moved up from the low-30% range of total starts in 2014 to the low-40% in 2015, and we\u2019ve had some major wins with companies, such as Menlo Logistics and BMW. Bottom line, there\u2019s quite a bit of discipline around spec development, and our focus remains on profitability and markets.","Let me talk a bit about the investment sales market. We\u2019re still living in an era of wallet capital being interested in real estate. Demand is robust for high quality well located industrial assets. We\u2019re confident we\u2019ll be able to meet our disposition goals, the majority of that work is well underway. In the long-term, our emphasis is going to shift to calling the portfolio when appropriate. Most of the heavy lifting is behind us.","Let me give you an update on KTR and its impact on our overall operations. The KTR portfolio is exceeding our expectations. We\u2019re leasing at the higher than expected rent and on pace with our projections. While bigger isn\u2019t always better, the benefits of scale are becoming increasingly clear. We\u2019ve grown our market-leading positions around the world in many locations. But perhaps the most important thing is that, we\u2019re driving G&A down. The transaction has allowed us to reduce our G&A as a percent of assets under management from 65 basis points last year to about 55 basis points this year.","With that, let me turn it over to Tom, for the details on the quarter.","Thomas Olinger","Thanks, Hamid. Operating results and cash flow growth remains strong and we\u2019re generating significant value creation through development stabilizations and VAC dispositions. I\u2019ll start with our Q3 results. We generated core FFO of $0.58 a share, up 21% over the third quarter of last year. Occupancy, excluding the KTR portfolio was 96.2%, up 60 basis points sequentially. This is essentially at an all-time high. The team is making great progress on the KTR portfolio, which was over 93% leased and had releasing spreads of 20%, exceeding both our underwriting and the remainder of our U.S. portfolio.","Our share of GAAP rent change was 12%, driven by the U.S. at 16.4%. GAAP same-store NOI continue to improve as our share increased to 6.2% in the quarter, again, driven by the U.S. at 8%. In the third quarter, the amortization of lease intangibles from the merger, which has been negatively impacting GAAP NOI since that time finally fully burned off. This has had a positive impact of about 100 basis points on GAAP same-store for the quarter.","We expect the impact for the year on same-store to be about 50 basis points from this burn off of the intangible asset consistent with what we outlined at our investor event last fall. Regarding cash same-store NOI growth, we would expect it to converge with GAAP during the back-half of next year.","Moving to capital activity, year-to-date, our share of dispositions and contributions totaled $1.7 billion at a 4.8% stabilized cap rate, generating over $210 million of realized development gains and $165 million of value creation from VACs. Pricing on our third quarter activity was equally strong at 4.9%. The profitability of our overall development program continues to be outstanding. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve stabilized $1.4 billion of developments at a 34% margin, generating about $460 million of NAV accretion, or about $0.86 per share.","Let\u2019s switch to 2015 guidance. I\u2019ll highlight only the key points here, so for a complete detail, please see page 8 of our supplemental. We\u2019re increasing the bottom end of our year-end occupancy guidance with the range now between 96% and 96.5%. Our share of GAAP same-store NOI growth for the year remains unchanged at between 5% and 5.5%.","We now expect net G&A to come in lower for the year, ranging between $235 million and $240 million, a decrease of 4% at the midpoint over last year. At the same time, assets under management have grown by 13%. For strategic capital, we continue to expect a net promote from our PELP venture in the fourth quarter of about $0.04 a share.","We are nearing the range of our development starts to between \u2013 to be between $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion. The slight decline is timing related as some build to suit activity moved to Q1. But having said that and as Hamid mentioned, we are being diligent with speculative starts, so don\u2019t be surprised the total starts next year are flat or slightly down. We\u2019re focused on profitability, not trying to reach a volume number. We\u2019re seeing the profitability of our developments coming through realized gains, which we now expect to be between $300 million and $325 million this year.","As we discussed last quarter, we had $1.3 billion of short-term debt related to our acquisition of KTR. This consisted of $1 billion term loan during 2017, and $300 million drawn on our line of credit. We continue to plan to repay the short-term debt with proceeds from dispositions and contributions.","In the third quarter, we reduced our line balance by $232 million leaving less than $1.1 billion of this to be repaid. The reduction is consistent with our expectations as a majority of disposition and proceeds from the third quarter were used to fund planned development spend and acquisitions. We expect to generate about $500 million of proceeds from our net deployment activity in the fourth quarter. You can get there using our fourth quarter guidance factoring in the OP units issued in connection with the industrial portion of the Morris transaction, as well as using development spend. We\u2019ll use the net proceeds from the fourth quarter to further reduce our short-term debt for a total reduction of about $750 million by year-end. As a result, leverage on a gross book basis and debt to EBITDA should be about 38% and seven times respectively by year-end. This will leave us with approximately $550 million of short-term financing, which we expect to repay by the middle of next year. We\u2019re very confident that we\u2019ll complete our planned fourth quarter capital recycling.","As Hamid mentioned, buyer interest from our dispositions is strong and diverse. For contributions, our ventures are well-capitalized, and we are far along in the process of completing property appraisals and fund approvals. As we mentioned last quarter, we have substantial embedded capital in our ventures, given our ownership as well above our long-term target of 20%. The ability to reduce our interest to this level provides us with significant flexibility and optionality to fund our future capital needs.","Putting our guidance together, we\u2019re maintaining the midpoint and narrowing our 2015 core FFO range to between $2.19 and $2.21 per share. This represents 17% year-over-year growth, or an increase of $0.32 at the midpoint.","In closing, we had exceptionally strong operating results, cash flow growth and significant value creation. Looking forward, we have substantial liquidity and a high degree of confidence, as well as optionality in our capital recycling plan.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brendan Maiorana of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Brendan Maiorana","Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask a little bit about rent spreads. They were about flattish with where they\u2019d been in the past couple of quarters, and it look like your scheduled expiring rents moved up a little bit. So with the change in the expiring rents that just a mix issue, or were you able to pull forward some of those low expiring rents this quarter, and how should we kind of think about the change in rents going forward from here?","Eugene Reilly","Yes, Brendan, it\u2019s Gene, let me take that. We\u2019re always pulling forward rents, so it\u2019s difficult to look at a schedule and sort of predict what\u2019s necessarily going to happen in the next quarter. But let me draw your attention a couple of changes quarter-to-quarter that are worth noting. We had a heavy volume of leases in the Northwest and Southwest. In the U.S., we had 40% of the leases rolling, wherein those regions, those are the highest rent change regions. In this quarter, it\u2019s just 22%, and virtually all of that was taken up by the East, which actually has the lowest.","So you are going to see this sort of quarterly volatility just based on the mix. But to answer the \u2013 your last question or last segment of it, if you look out into next year, just take a look at page 22, what we\u2019re rolling next year and frankly, what we\u2019re rolling in 2016? Now that mix won\u2019t tie exactly to what we actually lease next year, but it\u2019s a pretty good proxy, the \u2013 and the comps look really, really good going forward. So bottom line is that the trajectory is going to look just like it has. It will have an upward slope to it, I think it\u2019s going to have an upward slope to it going into next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman of KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.","Craig Mailman","Hey, guys. Tom, just on the high-end of guidance, just curious what really brought that down, because when you look at some of the operating metrics year-end occupancy trended a little bit higher, you had the $5 million reduction in G&A at the high point and really kind of an increase in net investment activity, given some of the slowdown in dispositions relative to what you guys have thought about before. So just maybe clarify that and just one other quick one on, Hamid, your comments about feeling good about the disposition pipeline here for the fourth quarter. Could you maybe just give us an update on what kind of volume you guys have under contract grow in line and maybe expected timing on that $1.3 billion?","Thomas Olinger","Hey, Craig, it\u2019s Tom. I\u2019ll take the \u2013 both of those questions. On the guidance change, really note, the only reason why the top end is down slightly as this deployment mix. Actually, what we\u2019ve sold to-date has been right on time, actually even a little bit ahead of what we talked about on an R share basis, so what you\u2019re seeing in the fourth quarter is purely timing around deployment.","Just regarding a similar color on our plan contribution disposition activity in the fourth quarter, our share of the contribution disposition activity is $1.3 billion, that\u2019s $900 million of dispositions and $400 million of contributions. Taking the contributions first, as I mentioned earlier, the funds have adequate capital. They\u2019re extremely well-capitalized, low leveraged. We\u2019re very far long in getting the appraisals done and standard approvals done. And these contributions have been in their deployment plans all year. So this is what we\u2019ve been planning for, and we feel very good about that happening by the end of the year.","On the disposition side, as Hamid mentioned of our pools very deep, pricing is meeting and in some cases even beating our expectations. If you look at the contributions plus the dispositions where we\u2019ve already identified a buyer, that represents about 80% of our Q4 activity. So as Hamid said, we\u2019re well on our way of knocking this out by the end of the year, and so we feel good about our progress to-date and what we\u2019re getting done right now.","Hamid Moghadam","Yes, and the other 20% by the way is in the market or shortly be in the market. So just to put this in context, the kind of disposition volume that we\u2019ve done in prior years post merger is orders of magnitude larger than this. So we\u2019re not losing a lot of sleep on the ability to execute here.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Vincent Chao","Hey, good morning, everyone or good afternoon. Can you just talk about, I think I heard KTR renewal spreads about 20%, so better than the overall portfolio. Can you just remind us where you\u2019re at on the leasing side, I think, you was 92% last quarter, and is that part of the uplift in the occupancy guidance here as just KTR leasing up faster as well?","Eugene Reilly","Yes, it\u2019s Gene, let me take that. We\u2019re 93% leased to this point, so it\u2019s up marginally. It\u2019s not, I mean, given the size of that portfolio, it\u2019s not going to have a meaningful impact on the overall numbers. So but we\u2019re on track. My guess is, we\u2019re going to beat our estimate. When we announced this deal that within a year, this portfolio would basically be \u2013 have this similar occupancy as the overall portfolio, so we\u2019re on track for that.","In terms of the spreads, you\u2019ve got to be a little bit careful, a quarter is a quarter and those will bounce around a lot. But deal by deal, we are beating the underwriting so far, so that\u2019s good news.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman of Citibank. Your line is open.","Emmanuel Korchman","Hey, guys, good morning. Maybe as you look at your portfolio being near peak occupancy levels, is there anything changing the way that your approaching deals or approaching relationships with customers or anything else that\u2019s changing the business?","Thomas Olinger","Yes. So the last time we were in the 96% plus range was briefly in 2008, but really you got to go back to 1999 before you see those kinds of occupancy levels. We try to balance occupancy with rent, so we definitely push harder on rent when occupancy levels are at this level, particularly in the U.S. In Europe, we\u2019re not obviously pushing quite as hard on rents. Rents are up slightly, but our pricing power is not as strong as it is in the U.S. clearly.","The other things that we\u2019re doing with these \u2013 this leases is that, we really focus on term and credit, so this enables us at this point in the cycle to lock in rates and escalations and good credit all at the same time. And this is \u2013 those are the variables we play with at different points in the cycle.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Your line is open.","Ki Bin Kim","Thank you. Could you just comment on how to praise \u2013 cap rates are looking like in Europe? What\u2019s your kind of current view on when those cap rates reach a 6% or sub-6% level that would maybe accelerate some of your European asset sales?","And the second question, any commentary on directional fund flows into your funds right now?","Gary Anderson","Yes. So, Ki Bin, it\u2019s Gary. Let me take that. So for the quarter core cap rates in Europe are down about 20 basis points. The secondary market has basically been flat, they haven\u2019t moved much. So overall you\u2019re sub-6 today. You\u2019re somewhere probably between 5.75% and 6% in our fund, so certainly an improvement. We\u2019re obviously looking at dispositions in Europe, where they make sense, and where we feel like we\u2019re getting value, and we\u2019ll execute on those as and when they come.","With respect to fund flow, we actually have a pretty deep queue in our open-ended fund today. And I\u2019d say that even that is underestimated, there\u2019s a shadow queue behind it. So I think we\u2019re in pretty good shape in Europe today.","Hamid Moghadam","Yes. Let me just add to that. I think the reason we\u2019re not taking more capital and adding to the queue is that, we want to get people\u2019s money invested in a reasonable periods of time, and we don\u2019t want to take on capital that we don\u2019t see opportunities for in terms of investing in the marketplace. Also, the sub-6 cap rates that we\u2019re seeing, obviously the UK is really low. I mean, UK many instances is in the 5, and in some cases we\u2019ve actually seen the 4 in front of some of the cap rates in London and Southeast type markets.","But the Continent, even the worst markets on the Continent are now in the low to mid-sixes. So the Continent alone would be also under 6 on a blended basis. Cap rates in Europe, I think, when we talked to you a couple of years ago when there was a lot of concern around CapEx in Europe, our estimate was that, they were going to compress about 1.5%, 150 basis points. And at that time, cap rates were about 8%. In fact, that\u2019s what we recapitalized taper at with the largest transaction.","I got to tell you, we were conservative. Cap rates in Europe have declined already by about 200 basis points from those days, and we just had a very recent conversation with our team about this. The feeling is that, there\u2019s probably another 25 to 50 basis points of cap rate compression remaining, so that our old 150 may end up being 250 basis points. We\u2019re not there quite yet, but we already passed the 150.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum of UBS. Your line is open.","Ross Nussbaum","Hey, guys. Good morning out there. You touched briefly on \u2013 some thoughts on development starts for next year, saying, don\u2019t be surprised, if they could be flat to down. I was hoping you could expand on that a little bit, because I think one of the potential concerns out there is the development start have ramped for the company annually into this cycle. And at some point, the market is probably going to look to see that number back down. So can you talk about how you think not just about 2016, but how you think about capital allocation and risk over the next couple of years with respect to those development starts?","Hamid Moghadam","Ross, this is Hamid. Let me take this since I was here during the entire cycle what we talked about development volumes. Going back to actually right after the crisis, I think, in one of our analyst days in New York, we talked about across the cycle development volume is being between $2 billion and $3 billion. And that was a time, I think, where we were doing $300 million or $400 million of development in the really low point to the cycle. And I think the market had a hard time getting its head around sort of $2 billion to $3 billion type numbers.","We said the average across cycle would be about $2.5 billion. Well, we\u2019ve now slightly exceeded the $2.5 billion. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we\u2019re really cautious about starting spec. And I think the entire market is really cautious about starting spec. That\u2019s why our built to suit ratios are up from the low-30s to the low-40s.","Look, we\u2019re getting 30% plus margin. This is not because we\u2019re geniuses, it\u2019s because we have some cheap land and we\u2019re getting cap rate compression in some of these exits. And those two factors are contributing to strong margins. But every time we look at a spec development, we really look at it against the alternative of selling the land to that market. In fact, we analyze it with land being price of market, because that would be the other way for us to \u2013 our best value out of the portfolio.","And so we\u2019re much more interested in getting strong margins out of our development pipeline than driving the volume by a couple of hundred million dollars. You should not read too much about \u2013 my commentary about development volume. The point I wanted to make is that, we are not building to some magical volume number. We don\u2019t have internal goals that we need to meet in that regard. We\u2019ll build as much or as little as we think we can prudently lease and realize margins on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers of Baird. Your line is open.","Dave B. Rodgers","Yes good morning out there and maybe this question is either for Hamid or Gene and probably for Tim mostly the U.S. but with occupancy guidance of 96 and 96.5 the spread that we\u2019ve seen retention, kind of pushing 90%. Do you think you\u2019re pushing rents harder than as you think there is a greater ability to do so clearly the spread should get better based upon your comments earlier, but just kind of curious about hey cautious or more aggressive tone regarding taking retention down maybe pushing occupancy down a little bit to get better rent growth?","Hamid Moghadam","Hey, Dave, that\u2019s a really good question and I want to hear and I want to hear, Gene, please go ahead.","Eugene Reilly","It is great question and the answer the honest answer is no. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re pushing rents hard enough we\u2019re pushing them harder than they\u2019ve ever been pushed in the history of industrial real estate I would point out and I feel great about our spreads maybe, compared to competitors or the rest of the market.","But it becomes a very psychological game at this point and I don\u2019t think we would look at let\u2019s strategically take down retention for example or get that nuance, but I can tell you in our leasing discussions it\u2019s a different environment and we ask our teams different questions.","One of the questions we\u2019ve added is tell us about the deals you said no to, tell us about the leases that you backed away from, and told the customer we\u2019re serious about this rent and if you need to go to another building we understand and I\u2019m serious about that, so we\u2019re having those discussions we\u2019re going to follow those transaction see what happens to those spaces it\u2019s a sort of a new world here I mean I\u2019ve been doing this for 30 years, so I\u2019ve seen cycles and we have had very strong cycles in the past, but nothing even approaching this.","And next year I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if eight or nine U.S. markets have a three handle on actual vacancy probably three or four already do that\u2019s just uncharted territory so your question is a very good one I can\u2019t give you a scientific answer, but we\u2019re really focused on it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Jamie Feldman","Great. Thank you. I\u2019m here with [indiscernible] as well. So looking at the third quarter development starts it looks like it was pretty light in the U.S. overweight in Europe and lighter in Asia. Can you talk about the composition of what you think you might start in the fourth quarter the $1 billion of starts and then as we think about the next year being flat to down what\u2019s the U.S. composition. And then in addition just kind of thinking about what are these numbers tell us about what\u2019s to come and how you\u2019re thinking about the market?","Michael Curless","Jaime, this is Mike Curless. With respect to the Q3 volume just natural things going on there with some build to suits that are been moved into the fourth quarter nothing unusual into the third quarter we have a heavy set of volume plan for the Q4, which is very typical for our company we\u2019ve done that for the last several years.","And if you look at the overall volume this year it\u2019s going to be up over call it 20% at least over last year we\u2019ve increased our build to suit percentage to well over 40% all, while keeping the margins around 20%, so we as a company feel really good about the quantity and the quality of this work to Tom\u2019s point earlier.","And as we look into the next year we would expect the build to suit volume to continue to increase and we have volume that will be more measured, compared to this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brad Burke of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brad Burke","Everyone just a quick one on FX, I realize you are hedged for the remainder of this year and you\u2019ve also done a lot to hedge your FX exposure on the debt side. But can you give us a sense of what kind of FX impact we should expect as those hedges start to roll off the timing and the magnitude of any headwind they might have?","Thomas Olinger","Hey, Brad, it\u2019s Tom. So on the earnings side, we actually hedge out on the earnings side 6 to 8 quarters ahead of where we are. So we\u2019re always hedging and we walk ourselves into that hedging we don\u2019t do 100% of Q3 of 2017 at this point we\u2019re probably we\u2019re almost fully hedged for our estimated earnings in 2016 and we probably have hedged for estimated earnings in 2017 and those are just simple straightforward contracts that we do.","From an earnings perspective from Q from 2015 to 2016 the earnings impact from where we walked in rates is probably $0.02 to $0.03 of an earnings drag on 2016. That being said, I \u2013 we still feel good about where 2016 earnings will come in, we\u2019ll give you guidance next quarter on that, but we feel really good about maintaining strong growth into 2016. So it\u2019s baked into our numbers and we feel good about our growth prospects.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee of Stifel. Your line is open.","John Guinee","Great. Thank you. Just a couple of comments, which will lead into a question. It appears that looking at the fund flows out there that the incremental investor in the REIT space might be a generalist as opposed to the rededicated crowd and as well, we can manage FFO versus the degrees of leverage and whether your borrow short or borrow along. So, Tom or Hamid, when you\u2019re looking at managing your valuation metrics, NAV versus FFO, how you\u2019re thinking about managing those valuation metrics vis-\u00e0-vis the incremental buyer out there of your shares?","Hamid Moghadam","John, we manage our business for cash flow in our pocket and ultimately dividends to our investors and the growth for that, because I don\u2019t think dedicated or non-dedicated investor have different appetite and interest in making money. I think, they\u2019ll want to make money, and at the end of day it\u2019s cash in their pocket and the growth in that cash profile.","So we are being real estate people, so by definition we\u2019re more NAV focused, but those two things are not unrelated. I think the issue that I think you brought up last quarter and I think your question implies this quarter is that, has there been a lot of NAV creation in a constant cap rate environment? Well, that would not be an appropriate way to look at our company, because we sold the bottom 20% of our portfolio. We sold our highest cap rate assets, and we\u2019ve acquired in our target market presumably at the lowest cap rates and the best growth potential.","So, people can do any kind of analysis they want. But at the end of the day, I think, what you should focus on, what I\u2019m focused on is dividends paid and the growth rate in those dividends over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vance Edelson","Thanks. Hamid, you mentioned export oriented softness in China. Are you seeing the same dynamic in the U.S., in other words, what effect is slower global economic growth having on your U.S. domestic business when it comes to your more export oriented tenants? Do you hear anything about sluggishness in their business that might affect leasing demand?","Hamid Moghadam","So exports have never been a really big driver of demand in the U.S. And a lot of the containers that go out of the U.S. are actually going out empty these days because of the strong dollar. Imports are much more significant in terms of driving demand. And the weakness in the ports \u2013 port markets in China compared to the consumption type buildings is mostly because of very imports of raw material and parts and things of that nature, none necessarily to our exports, because exports generate a warehouse demand not at the port and not at the market that we invest in, they generate that demand near the factory, where the goods are produced on the export side. So exports are usually not a big deal in terms of industrial demand.","Now, I\u2019d like to do one thing before we take the next question. I think, Jamie, asked about the mix of our development business. And, Mike, skipped over that part of the answer. Based on our current projections and this will change the Americas in the fourth quarter remainder of the year, we think about 40% of our business will be in the Americas, 30% in Europe, and 30% in Asia.","For 2016, it will be about a third in the Americas, a quarter in Europe, and about 40% in Asia. And the Asian numbers are probably more driven by Japan and China; Japan will be bigger. And we have \u2013 all those projects identified and it\u2019s pretty well known what we\u2019re going to build next year, because we have the land and they\u2019re designed and they\u2019re ready to go. So take that for whatever it\u2019s worth, I think it\u2019s going to be closer to those kinds of numbers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Miller of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael Miller","Core opportunities for promote in 2016, so wondering if you could talk about the potential magnitude of those compared to 2015?","Thomas Olinger","It is Tom. So, again, we\u2019ll give guidance in the next quarter, so I won\u2019t get specific, but if you look at where we\u2019re promoting next year we\u2019ve got our two open-ended funds in Europe PEPF II and PTELF those last were eligible for promote in 2013 they did not promote at the time they\u2019re up again and I think the second or third quarter. I think third quarter of next year and think about what cap rates \u2013 Hamid\u2019s comments about what cap rates have done over that period of time of pretty meaningful drop and the promote is going to be calculated as a point-to-point valuation return, so\u2026","Michael Curless","I\u2019m Mike, they\u2019re going to be lot higher, but please don\u2019t get excited, because I think this business promotes are the last bit of residual that remains after you get the capital back and the preferred return, so a little bit of movement on the terminal cap rate or on what happens can really move around promotes in a big way based on what we see to-date they\u2019re going to be quite significant.","But in terms of the way you should think about them in valuing the business my sense is that across the cycle those promotes net to the company are about 15% to 20% about this under management on a fairly regular basis once you average it out over time take this point I\u2019m saying I wish you would...","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel of Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.","Eric Frankel","Thank you. Two quick questions. First it seems like you\u2019ve sold a lot more impaired land this quarter, so I was hoping you can comment on that and who the buyers were at that land. And second I noticed that your free rent balance went up pretty significantly from the second quarter to third quarter so any color would be appreciated thank you.","Thomas Olinger","Hey it\u2019s Tom, I\u2019ll take the free rent one first it\u2019s twofold. First is remember I talked about in my prepared remarks the burn off of that lease intangible from the merger that was a negative item that\u2019s burning all that fully burned off in Q3 for the first time, so that\u2019s part of it.","And then the second piece would just be we\u2019ve got a bigger portfolio right, so think about adding KTR and the like and the volume of leasing activity we\u2019re doing that would be the \u2013 those would be the drivers.","Hamid Moghadam","Yes, I can remember. KTR was disproportionate, because KTR had more vacancy and therefore more space to lease than the average of our portfolio.","Michael Curless","And Eric with respect to this is Mike, with respect to land sales we\u2019ve an active quarter and the primary buyers of our non-strategic land have been users and some developers for building product that we don\u2019t tend to build.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick of Capital One Securities. Your line is open.","Thomas Lesnick","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I just want to talk about the potential for going vertical for a second where rents are right now and into locations in San Fran and Seattle how close are those rents to justifying going vertical and what is that potential repositioning opportunity represent for those markets for Prologis as a whole?","Hamid Moghadam","So, Tom, did you actually think into our customer advisory meeting guy at New York and, because this is the exactly the two markets that we talk to customers around we went as far as actually taking design specific designs and getting their input on it on some very specific sites and based on that we tweak some of our design ideas, so I think we you\u2019re going to see us going probably two-story anyway maybe three in San Francisco on a couple of places as we fine-tune this product, we\u2019re going to experiment with it we\u2019re not going to all of a sudden go nuts with it, but it\u2019s certainly something that I think the market is ready for.","Let me also mention another way that we go vertical on our site that that you may not normally think of and that is in the last year we sold about over $500 million of real estate that $0.5 billion of real estate to users and companies well-known technology companies with hundreds of billions of dollars of market cap you can figure out who they are and they\u2019re going to go vertical on those properties, because they\u2019re going to knock down our beautiful one-story warehouses and build corporate campuses or are ready on them to house their employees. So I think when you own infill real estate as we said many times good things happen to it than I think we\u2019re beginning to see those good things happening to some of our properties.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Maiorana of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Brendan Maiorana","Thanks, Tom. I had a follow up. So you mentioned by end of the year, I think 38% leverage is where you expect to get to seven times debt to EBITDA. And I think you said you\u2019ve got $550 million of short-term refinancing that would be left at year-end that you expect to get done by the middle of 2016. From a leverage perspective, how should we think about net dispositions and the pace of dispositions and contributions in 2016 to get to your leverage targets?","Thomas Olinger","Well, I think, so two things. So when we\u2019re looking going forward, we\u2019re thinking about not only funding this remaining $550 million into next year, but we also plan to sell fund all our deployment activity, so starts as well. So when you think about, I mean, rough, I will give you some rough numbers just our share. So think about the $550 million we have to spend.","And then if you think about how we recycle capital with our development program, right? We build \u2013 we contribute in the funds. We hold what\u2019s on the U.S. on our balance sheet. We need to raise about $600 million, maybe $650 million a year to kind of keep that cycle going. So if you think about the $550 million plus $650 million, that\u2019s $1.2 billion. Now acquisitions are going to be what acquisitions are and we\u2019ll fund those most likely through our joint ventures whatever they are. So if you kind of think about the level of our share proceeds, we need to do it in knockout development next year, as well as the $550 million would be in that range.","Hamid Moghadam","Yes, and I think the best way for you to monitor that is to look at our land balance, and it will be lumpy, it will bounce around, because we can\u2019t find everything perfectly. But I think it would be a very low-level balance on our line moving around quarter-to-quarter.","Gary Anderson","Brendan, I should add, I didn\u2019t answer your question about just trending up where our leverage and debt to EBITDA will go. I think, if we look at this plan all encompassing this self-fund next year. I think by the end of next year, you\u2019re going to see us back in the mid-30s LTV wise. Again, this is on a book basis, not a market cap. So we\u2019re being consistent here. And I think debt to EBITDA is going to \u2013 without any gains, is going to get into the low-6 range, I think that\u2019s where we\u2019ll be.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman of Citi. Your line is open.","Emmanuel Korchman","Hey, Tom. In the past, I think you\u2019ve given releasing spreads for the other regions outside the U.S. Could you provide those and could you also give us some color on same-store NOI growth U.S. versus Asia and Europe?","Thomas Olinger","Okay. I\u2019ll start with the same-store NOI growth. Basically, you saw in the U.S., we were on a GAAP basis 8%. We were flat to maybe up 1% in Europe, and we were up, call it, 5% give or take blended Asia. So when you put that altogether and you think about our share, that\u2019s how you get to 6.2% our share same-store. An easy way to think about how to calculate our share is roughly about 80% of our NOI comes from the Americas, 15% from Europe, and 5% from Asia. So that\u2019s how \u2013 so roughly weight the different parameters.","As far as releasing spreads, again, we talked about the U.S. leading the way. We were at over 16%. I think in Asia, again, releasing spreads were around 3% to 4%, and in Europe, it was fairly flat, because what we\u2019re seeing in Europe is those \u2013 a large percentage of releases there are actually index based on CPI, there\u2019s not a fixed factor, that is what the market is. And inflation has been pretty low, if not zero in Europe, so we\u2019re not seeing a lot of year-over-year rent increases.","However, a lot of that has to do with and maybe more of it has to do with cap rate compression, right? That a real headwind for earnings. So you\u2019re only seeing part of the picture, right? You\u2019re seeing all the cap rates come through valuations. You\u2019re not seeing that yet in earnings. And we got to have cap rates bottom out. And once they bottom out, we\u2019ll start to see rent growth. But I\u2019ll tell you, it\u2019s a great problem to have when you have $12 billion of real estate in Europe and cap rates continue to grind tighter. We\u2019ll \u2013 I\u2019ll patiently wait for rent growth. I\u2019ll take that trade any day.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman of KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.","Jordan Sadler","Hey, Tom. It\u2019s Jordan Sadler here with Craig. I had a follow-up, but I heard you say couple of times in the last answer about self funding development I think that was probably pretty intentional, but just as a clarification is that self fund can we use that you across sort of the broader spectrum of investment activity meaning including acquisitions as well as this point. And then separately I had a question on expense growth in the quarter if there was anything that drove the same-store spends up as first as it was?","Thomas Olinger","Yes, so I\u2019ll answer the expense growth first no there was nothing with expense growth it was really all around reimbursable expenses increased so lot of it is real estate taxes and the increase in property dollars, but again we\u2019re almost majority triple net that passes on right to the onto our tenants pay that.","The other thing I would out with our occupancies becoming this high are real slippage is getting lower as well. On your other question about self funding I do mean to say all-encompassing as Hamid, has said in the past acquisitions are hard to predict and those will get funded if they\u2019re in a fund within in the fund so I would say, yes I think were in a position if we want to be able to fund all of our deployment this business development acquisitions anything we do by recycling capital.","Hamid Moghadam","It\u2019s interesting I think KTR was almost a $6 billion company that we bought I don\u2019t think there are too many companies around that can actually do a $6 billion acquisition put away half of it at the time of close and have the plan that within 3 to 4 quarters our self fund that size of an acquisition I think we\u2019ve done that, but I don\u2019t expect you shouldn\u2019t expect and I don\u2019t expect us to be able to do major deals like that and still be self-funded obviously if we do major deals like that we need to capitalize the company, but in terms of our regular day-to-day acquisitions and development so yes self-funding is the way to go.","And actually the other thing you should think about is that we are very over funded and in our funds in terms of our percentage interest, so we can let that glide down to the 20% and in effect have the funds be the source of our capital or 100% of the investment in those fund so there\u2019s a lot of room on the balance sheet than in the funds take care of what we need to take care.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee of Stifel. Your line is open.","John Guinee","Great. Hamid, I would just recommend you, because two or three quarters ago 80% of the questions were about your need to raise equity, which you successfully deflected and proved that you don\u2019t need to, so congratulations.","But turning to the dividend question when I look at your sizable gains and contributions into the funds are you able to do that on a tax efficient basis or does that generate some tax impact and so Tom, where are you on the dividend versus your taxable minimum and how you\u2019re thinking about the dividend going forward given your successful development pipeline?","Hamid Moghadam","Yes the bulk good questions John, thank you so from a tax perspective the activity outside the U.S. is subject to tax and when we show you our margins those margins are net of any taxes we pay, so those are reflected, so you\u2019re seeing that already we can be pretty efficient tax wise overseas with our developments, and but we do bring it back and that TI the taxable income does sit in our dividend. So I feel good this year about our ability to, but our dividend will cover our TI it\u2019s pretty tight, so what there\u2019s not a lot of room for margin there i.e., meaning that or I as I look at our earnings going forward and pace of development or that that\u2019s a good trajectory for future dividend growth.","Hamid Moghadam","John, I will tell you that it had been five or six years since I had a meeting with the Tom, and his team about taxable income I find myself in one of those meetings once a week so I don\u2019t know he\u2019s working pretty hard at it.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel of Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.","Eric Frankel","Thank you. I can imagine many REIT teams are too pleased with their share prices here, but I was hoping you, could comment and how that is impacting your capital allocation plans if at all?","Hamid Moghadam","Well, I think, the right answer that would get us in there in the past would be that to the extent that we\u2019re selling at a discount to NAV. We should be selling assets and buying stock back and the vice versa of that, we get that, we really do get that. But unfortunately with a business that has time frames of a year or two, we don\u2019t run our business quarter-to-quarter and that tightly.","So we need to think about where do we point the ship over a long periods of time and we\u2019re very focused on NAV. I think your point is valid and well understood. But incremental returns on our land bank and our development at 30% margins are very attractive, and it is a constant balancing that we do. What I tell our people every time they walk in here to investment community with that proposed acquisition or proposed development, I tell them, how do those returns compare to my calling 1-800 your favorite investment banker buying back stock? That\u2019s the answer that we compare it to. And those answers need to be compelling and that\u2019s how we allocate capital.","Operator","And there are no further questions.","Hamid Moghadam","That was the last question. So thank you for your interest in the company and we look forward to talking to you in 2016, if not sooner, actually at NAREIT. Bye-bye.","Operator","And this concludes today\u2019s conference call.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Tracy Ward. You may begin.","Tracy Ward","Thanks, Christine, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2017 conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. This morning, we\u2019ll hear from Hamid Moghadam, our Chairman and CEO, who will comment on the Company\u2019s strategy and outlook; and Tom Olinger, our CFO will cover results and guidance. Also, joining us for today\u2019s call are Gary Anderson, Mike Curless, Ed Nekritz, Gene Reilly, Diana Scott and Chris Caton.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I\u2019d like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry, in which Prologis operates, as well as management\u2019s beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors.

I would like to begin with a few comments on the operating environment. In the U.S. market conditions remain excellent. Consumption has been growing at a faster pace than available stock, leading to vary tight market conditions. At the beginning of the year, we highlighted an elevated level of development starts which will show up in higher deliveries over the next few months. However, new starts moderated in the second and third quarters, leading to development volumes that fell short of demand. This shortfall is further boosting market rent growth across our U.S. portfolio.","For the first time in my career, net absorption is being constrained by a serious shortage of space. Tight land and labor markets are acting as governors on new construction. We are hearing consistent feedback from our customers to tell us that they are operating at capacity and that is difficult for them to find additional quality space in the right locations. These favorable conditions have elevated the mark-to-market in our portfolio. In-place rents in the U.S. are now 18% below market, expanding our organic growth for a long period into the future.","A similar dynamic is playing out in continental Europe which is likely U.S. by more than four years in this cycle. Construction costs are escalating rapidly, driven largely by labor which is making new development more difficult to pencil. Market rent growth has been muted over the last several years largely due to the massive headwind from cap rate compression as well as on even demand.","As you will recall, we anticipated this cap rate compression and invested heavily in the region between 2011 and 2014. Two recent portfolio transactions in the market point to the significant value uplifting Europe. Going forward, rental rates will be driven higher given improving customer sentiment and record low vacancies. Continued recovery in the continent will extend the growth trajectory for our company beyond what would have been possible with an exclusively U.S. portfolio.","Looking to our business strategy I would like to highlight two key points. First, our initiative to simplify our business is now complete. Last night, we closed on the combination of our two open-end funds in Europe. This marks the combination of our efforts to reduce the number of co-investment ventures from 21 at the time of the merger to eight today. Over the same period, we doubled third-party assets under management to 30 billion and increased the proportion of perpetual for a long-life vehicle from 60% to over 90%.","We now have a single sector-leading core open-end fund in both Europe and the U.S. that are each over a 9 billion in assets. Our current structure is far more streamlined, understandable, and I might add profitable and will allow us to grow in the consumption markets that matter the most. Second, our ability to source and allocate capital globally is unparallel. Our scaling global reach give us access to attractive capital sourcing and deployment opportunities around the world. So far this year we've raised over $5 billion in long-term debt at a weighted average interest rate of 1.7%.","The vast majority of which was in the yen and sterling and matched against our assets in those currencies, this quarter we deployed 450 million in Brazil to buy out our partners and to control our platforms at a 9.2% cap rate for operating the assets. While the sourcing and investing of capital were not explicitly linked, these transactions illustrate the advantages of a global platform in terms of opportunistic capital allocation, all while reducing the currency risk in our portfolio.","I'll sum it up by saying that I feel great about where we are today. Operating conditions continue to test new limits and market selection has never been more critical. Looking forward our portfolio quality, streamlined strategic capital franchise and global reach will further separate us from the path. The next few years it will be all about organic growth and the opportunistic capital allocation.","With that, I'd like to hand it over to Tom.","Tom Olinger","Thanks, Hamid. I'll cover the highlights for the quarter and provide updated 2017 guidance. We had another great quarter with core FFO of $0.67 per share. Operating condition in our market continued to be excellent and our results reflect our customers intensifying need for well located logistics facilities. In this environment, we continue to push rents versus occupancy to maximize overall lease economics.","Our results reflect the success of this strategy. Our share of net effective rent change on rollover was 22.7%, led by the U.S. with a record 31.9%. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of U.S. rent change above 20%. Global occupancy at quarter end was 96.3%, an increase of 10 basis points sequentially, but 30 basis points lower year-over-year. Our share of net effective same-store NOI growth was 4.1% with U.S. leading the way at 6%.","I want to point out that we had a 20 basis points drag from Brazil in our same-store results due to the acquisition of our partner's interest in the lower occupancy levels in their portfolio. The third quarter is the first time this cycle our same-store growth was driven exclusively by releasing spreads and not by occupancy gains, which have been a meaningful contributor for several years running. For a reference, we had a 100 basis points of occupancy pick up in our second quarter same-store results with no such benefit this quarter.","Given further market rent growth and the cumulative effect of rent change, same-store will accelerate into the fourth quarter. In addition the spread between market rents and our in-place leases widened again this quarter and is now 14% globally and 18% in the U.S. This further build up our embedded earnings potential and lengthens our runway for NOI growth.","Moving to capital deployment for the quarter, margins on both starts and stabilizations continue to be strong and build-to-suit projects accounted for nearly 50% of our starts. Dispositions and contributions are ahead of plan and buyer interest has been excellent with activity from a wide range of buyers. The large contribution volume in the quarter was driven by assets we sold to our J-REIT.","We had an active quarter in our strategic capital business closing out both the acquisition of our partner's interest in Brazil and contributing our former NAIF portfolio to USLF. These two transactions generated a one-time non-FFO gain of approximately $560 million, the majority of which is attributed to asset appreciation in NAIF since the acquisition of this portfolio.","As Hamid mentioned, we just completed the combination of two of our European ventures. This $9.7 billion vehicle has been upgraded to an A minus rating has significant liquidity. While this transaction was not a liquidity event for Prologis, we have created a single profitable open-ended vehicle that is poised for growth. There is no shortage of demand for well located logistics real estate and experienced management teams. Year-to-date, we have raised over $2 billion in new capital from our co-investment partners.","Turning our credit metrics, we ended the quarter with leverage below 24% on a market capitalization basis. Debt-to-adjusted EBITDA of 4.3 times and liquidity of $4 billion including $568 million in cash and no outstanding balances are aligned. These are the strongest credit metrics in our history, positioning us with significant capacity for growth.","Moving to guidance for 2017 which I will provide on an our share basis. We're maintaining our occupancy and same-store guidance ranges for the year. Where we end in our full-year, same store range will ultimately depend on average occupancy given our focus on pushing rents. In addition, our increased investment in Brazil will also have a moderate drag on the full year; however, both of these strategies will bolster our same-store NOI in the long-term which is always our focus.","We expect our G&A to now range between $228 million and $232 million up from our prior guidance due to FX as well as higher compensation expenses related to our share price. Strategic capital revenue will range between $240 million and $245 million up from our prior guidance due to FX and higher transaction fees. Given continued robust demand, we're increasing our starts guidance by $450 million to range between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion. Built-to-suit will account for approximately 50% of this volume.","Based on very healthy market conditions, strong demand from buyers and visibility into our pipelines were also increasing our disposition and contribution guidance by $500 million. These changes highlight the fact that we have no need to rely on the capital markets to fund the increase in our development pipeline. In addition to our $4 billion of liquidity, we have $3.4 billion of internal capacity to self-fund our growth for the foreseeable future. These one-time sources include the rebalancing our ventures to our long-term ownership targets and selling our remaining non-strategic assets.","I want to point out that we will be building significant liquidity and leverage capacity in the fourth quarter given the timing lag to reinvest disposition and contribution proceeds back into development. Based on our revised guidance, the development pipeline at the end of 2017 will be approximately $600 million higher than it was at the end of last year. Putting this all together, we're holding the midpoint of our 2017 core FFO guidance and narrowing the range to between $2.79 and $2.81 per share.","At the midpoint, this represents 9% growth over 2016 both with and without net promote. Our AFFO growth will be even higher driven by cash same store NOI growth of more than 6%. To wrap up, we had an excellent quarter and are on track to close the year with strong continued momentum.","With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Mailman from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Craig Mailman","Maybe on the development starts. I know you said build-to-suit was 50% of the increase and maybe just give a little bit of color of how much you are pulling forward from what you thought you would start in 2018, and maybe a little bit on which geographies are driving the ramp here? And then maybe also second Tom, just on the timing differential on dispositions and redeployment, is there any way if you give us sort of a sense on FFO in terms of pennies, kind of as we think about transitioning from 4Q to 1Q '18 run rates?","Mike Curless","This is Mike Curless, when I hit kind of the geographic distribution on the first part of your question. The way we see it shaking out this year is approximately 45% in the Americas, 25% Europe and 30% in Asia, which is pretty typical over the last couple of years and we are seeing good solid demand in all three of those geographic segments.","Hamid Moghadam","Yes, and in terms of going forward from next year, we are not going to get into providing guidance, but I think you should expect us to be doing a similar volume to the range that we have indicated for the long term next year as well. So I don\u2019t think there is any pulling in going on here.","Tom Olinger","And then Craig as far as your question around the drag, in my prepared remarks I talked about the increase in our development pipeline based on our starts and this guidance we would be up about 600 million year-over-year. So if you think about that 600 million and you think about yield on that you are looking really at $0.4 to $0.5 impact from that on a year-over-year basis.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Metz from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Metz","Hamid, as we sit here today, you mentioned the portfolio was about 14% global mark-to-market and the U.S. is around 18. So when you think about closing that gap and getting to -- as you think about closing that gap, you know, how many more years runway do you think this is going to provide us if market rents were flat from here? And as we go down 2018, not looking for guidance, but as we thinking about 2018 rent expirations, how do they compare to that? Is there more room in '18 and then maybe slows the difference there? Or is there a bit less in 18 in the mark-to-market opportunity accelerates from there? Thanks.","Hamid Moghadam","Sure, every time I answered that question I find myself coming back day year or later and basically giving you the same answer because the rent growth has last couple of years exceeded our expectations. So the runway, the mark-to-market is getting extended. You may remember that couple of quarters ago maybe a year ago, we had a 12% mark-to-market. We have burnt through a lot of those early lower leases, yet our mark-to-market is now high. So it just seems like we are chasing really incredible rental growth and we have been conservative, certainly in last couple of years. And surely that will change at some point although I don\u2019t think it's changing again soon.","So, we would have said '18, '19 is the year probably now we'd say '20, '21 is the year because even if rent growth flattened out, and it's not going to go from 9% so far this year in the U.S. and Europe, I mean will gradually moderate. You can see multiple years of 4% or 5% same-store NOI growth. And then the great news about our portfolio is that that's just the time that the Europe is really coming through in a big way. So I think absent the calamity, I think you can kind of count on many-many years of strong same-store growth going forward. I don't think this is one of those things that -- I think people pay entirely too much attention to quarter-by-quarter trends as opposed to sort of longer term trend. And the longer term trends have been remarkable. I mean far in excess of our expectations.","Mike Curless","I'll give you a little color on same-store. So some things to think about as we mentioned, this is the first quarter where we had no occupancy pick up in our same-store pool. So from here on out, you should think about same-store being driven almost exclusively by rent change on roll and not by occupancy. We think occupancy levels are pushing rents as you know, so occupancy levels don't see any upside from here at all. So now you got to think about what rent change is, and if you really need to think about rent change on a rolling fourth quarter basis because that's what impacts your same-store flow.","And when you look at trailing rent change for the last four quarters, Q3 '17 was the first quarter that's above 20%, it's about 20.7% rolling four quarters. And when you think about what that number is going to do going forward, that number is going to grow. I would expect that number to consistently be in the 20% range all next year. And if you look at just the component, our rent change in Q4 2016 by itself was 16%. So we're going to drop off at 16% rent change quarter, we're going to have something in the fourth quarter that's got a 20 in front of it. So I think the trend is -- the rent change on roll is only going to increase. When you look at roll for 2018, I don't think there's anything you need in 2018 versus '17 with the exception of roll is going to be a little lower.","Operator","Thank you. Our next comes from Manny Korchman from Citi. Please go ahead.","Manny Korchman","Maybe, Hamid, as we look at sort of that growth and your accelerating development pipeline. How do you think about sourcing land? And has your approach to either where the land is or the type of land you're buying changed?","Hamid Moghadam","Not really. It's -- buying the land is getting more and more difficult because the buildings are getting bigger, which means the land requirements are getting bigger and also coverage is getting lower by the way. So the pieces of flat land that you need in these major metro areas where we're active is getting really hard to come by. So -- and we're fortunate to have fair amount of land on the balance sheet and so I think the opportunity is pretty good for us for the next couple of years, but I'm going to tell you sourcing land is one of the most difficult things in our business. There's plenty of land and it's just good land that, that's hard to source. And as about things are getting very difficult with respect to approvals and exactions and cost for services and everything, and then in some jurisdictions, the unions are getting very tough and construction costs are getting more and more difficult. So I would say land generally just becoming a more difficult topic.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Jamie Feldman","I guess thinking about the consolidation of the funds business, your investment this year is kind of doubling down in Brazil. Can you just give us your thoughts on the global landscape? Where you think the best opportunities are? And what we might expect to see, I know you're not giving guidance for '18, but just as you guys look ahead to '18, how much large scale investment activity might we expect to see and how much consolidation activity?","Hamid Moghadam","Yes, we're not planning on any of it, Jamie, because we tend to be opportunistic. And it looked the lot of big portfolios have transacted in the last couple of years that we've not participated in. We've been in every one of those. We've looked at every one of those. We've evaluated them, but we've been pretty disappointed in our pricing. And frankly, our proprietary deal flow in our funds and all that has been better than external deal opportunity, so that's where we've chosen our capital dollars that and development.","Going forward, we're just going to have to see what the opportunities are. We do not as I said many many times, when it comes time to giving guidance and people say what's your acquisition guidance for next year, and I say zero to 10 million. And we've exceeded the 10 million in one year actually. So, it's not something that we budget or predict because it depends on pricing. We can make it be whatever we want to be, but that's if we're not disciplined the various price which we are.","So we're just going to have to wait and see. Qualitatively, I would tell you that more of our acquisition activity is likely to be value added where because of our customer franchise and our development expertise, redevelopment expertise et cetera. We can create a lot of value. Good example of that would be for example this building that we recently built in the Bronx. So where you can see us expect us to do a lot more of those kinds of transactions, but going out and getting into a war on declining IRRs rates to zero on cap rates, that's kind of not our deal. We got to have some kind of a competitive advantage.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks, good morning. I mean I guess to follow up on your comments about you know kind of the slower pace of leasing being a function of how well occupied you are and tenants operating that kind of full capacity. Are you sort of changing your thought process on development and kind of the mix between the build-to-suits and the spec? Just given maybe the opportunities that are out there and how do you sort of think about that going forward?","Hamid Moghadam","Steve, I don't think the pace of leasing is slowing down. I think absorption is slowing down because there isn't much space to lease. So I think the -- I guess I would say the interest and the desire on the part of tenants to lease space is as high as it\u2019s ever been. It's just not translating into as much absorption because they can't find the space that they need. And we're hearing that time and time again, we had our customer advisory board meeting about a month and a half ago in Atlanta. And the uniform message was, guys, we never thought we would say this, but we don't kind of care a lot about price, we just lease the space because our business really needs to grow. We've never heard that before from customers and we're hearing it from multiple customers at the same time.","In terms of the implications of that for a development business, I would say at the margin the thing that's going to surprise is the volume of build-to-suit. And the volume of build-to-suit is because people can't find that readily available spec space that they can go a lease, and we\u2019ve been able to de-risk build-to-suit at very significant margin. So, if there's a surprise anywhere in this is that our normal 25% build-to-suit is now 50% and that's translating into incremental volume. The 50% spec that we were kind of doing is the same number overtime. It's the build-to-suit that are way up.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Blaine Heck from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Blaine Heck","Hamid or maybe Gary, can you guys talk a little bit more about operations in Europe? Occupancy slipped 80 basis points sequentially, but I'm wondering if that's because you guys are actually pushing more on rents. So if you can give any color around that and maybe what were your rents spreads in Europe during the quarter that'd be helpful?","Gary Anderson","Yes, so it's Gary. The occupancy drop, I wouldn\u2019t get too worried about the drop to 80 basis points in the quarter down to I think 95.4%. There was no real single driver. We had a handful of fairly large recent rollovers in the UK, France, Belgium and Poland. But I wouldn't dig anything into that. In fact, I would expect occupancy to kick up next quarter. In terms of rents, the thing that has held rents back in Europe is the significant capital compression that Hamid talked about in his opening remarks. But if you look at our trailing four quarters or even five quarters for both rent change and same store NOI, both have an upward arrow. And I think that should be indicative of how we were thinking about that market going forward.","Hamid Moghadam","Yes, Mike. Just to reinforce what Gary is saying. The cap rate compression in Europe has just been incredible. And we've created a lot of NAV, maybe not quite the same rent growth as the U.S. But certainly more NAV, there has been more cap rate compression in Europe in the last two years than there has been in U.S. by a factor of three. So we're getting it in NAV, we might not be getting it quite in rent growth. But NAVs can go down to -- I mean cap rates can go down to a certain level, and then at that point they're going to stop and it's going to translate into rental growth.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Michael Carroll","Can you provide us some color on the supply outlook? What happened that drove the activity to pick up in the 1Q? And why this drop-off in 2Q and 3Q? What's limiting this activity, especially given the rent trends and your comments that tenants are less worried about the price today?","Hamid Moghadam","I don't think it was anything conscious. I think it was just quirk and you had a bunch of starts at the beginning of year. Maybe it was weather related. I don't have the good theory on that. But all I can tell you is that facts are we have the high level starts in the first quarter, and it petered out in the second and third quarter. So supply is pretty tight. And, you know, there is a lot of discussion about when is supply going to finally exceed demand. And we've been torturing ourselves for the last two years trying to get that number.","The numbers are between 220 and 225 one way or another kind of in that order of magnitude that's what we see going forward. Whether supply and demand are $5 million pretty short or $5 million to be too much doesn't matter, vacancy rates are under 5%. There is ample pricing power. And frankly I think there is pricing power of up to 6% to 7% of vacancy. Some of these markets are 2% vacant. So I think we should watch the absolute level of supply and demand, how they relatively compare to one another on the margin when the differences are so minute, I think -- I don't think it's as instructive.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Dave Baird from Baird. Please go ahead.","Dave Baird","Hamid and Tom, you've talked about I think the three major capital sources for your businesses internally, non-core asset sales, development contributions and fund rebalancing. Can you talk about how the capital that's chasing your business or looking to partner with you today, helps you rank each of those three, just trying to get a sense of? Are we seeing any meaningful shifts in capital where it might make sense to pursue one versus the other? And a clarification time that you say same store NOI would accelerate into the fourth quarter or just the rent change on rollover? Thanks.","Tom Olinger","I'll take the last piece first. Same store NOI growth will accelerate from Q3 to Q4 level.","Hamid Moghadam","So I would say a lot of our -- the way we approach the business is that we have a business to run, that\u2019s a first set of decisions we make. Where do we want to develop? Where do we want to acquire? How do we well serve our customers? That\u2019s where it all starts. We don\u2019t go talking to the investors to figure out, what -- how much we need capital. We talk to our customers. And that\u2019s what drives the opportunities. Then we go look around and see where the best place of funding in it. So, obviously, we have idle cash that\u2019s earnings nothing on the balance sheet, that\u2019s just good place for it to go because in effect, the opportunity across that capital is the lowest.","And frankly we have been in that most of the time, that\u2019s why all the development is taking place on balance sheet essentially, 85% of the development is placed on the balance sheet. Because combined with the low opportunity cost to that capital immediately there is also a land which we are beyond. So the return on the incremental investment which is just to building is really high. So the first order of investment priority for us is to put our land to work with incremental capital from the balance sheet and development. And then we have these vehicles established which set our strategy for the long-term ownership of these assets. And that\u2019s where these assets end up.","So we need to capitalize those vehicles in usually the private market in the case of Mexico and Japan actually from the public market in those places. But then we go find to capital for doing that. The rebalancing of our interest in the ventures is a really good way for us to deploy capital when we have excess capital. When you see us having excess capital like right now, that\u2019s when you see investments and our ventures being 30% or 28% or whatever high percentage. Our real long-term strategic objective is to be around 15% in those vehicles.","So, there is a lot of excess capital in those ventures today that in the long-term will come down. And by the way, our investors are totally fine with that because even 15% of capital in 9 by then $10 billion to $12 billion capitals, couple of billion dollars capital. So nobody is worried about or not being focused on this. So that\u2019s how we approach the business, starts with customers, starts with the opportunity cost to capital, and then we need to find permanent homes for these assets that are creative, and that\u2019s where we go to our strategic capital.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Guinee from Stifel. Please go ahead.","John Guinee","Just a comment, Hamid, it seems like a long-time since you are rationalizing and getting a lot of pushback on the KTR deal. Congratulations. Couple of things, one is the we noticed that the debt plus preferred stock went down about 900 million quarter-over-quarter combined with cash on hand up by 300 million. If you could talk about what major transaction drove that unusual combination? And then second, looks like your net earnings for 2017 is about $3 a share and I understand that\u2019s not taxable earnings. Can you talk about dividend pressure? I think the dividend is about $1.76 a share right now.","Hamid Moghadam","John, let me start by thanking you for making that comment about KTR. I really appreciate it, but let me turn that heavy lifting on your question to Tom.","Tom Olinger","So, on the debt drop, it's largely attributable to the NAIF transaction into USLF. So, we transferred debt in there as well. So you have to look at the transaction by its components. So that was the main driver of the decline in debt. And plus, we did generate significant proceeds during the quarter primarily through the Japan contribution, so that was also used to reduce leverage.","Regarding the dividend, I don't foresee any need for a special dividend in 2017, but I would tell you we're sort of at the limit of paying out the -- covering our taxable income. So, I would think we're going to see dividend increases going forward, somewhere between that base level of -- to cover the TI up to what our AFFO growth is.","Hamid Moghadam","John, I can't tell you how stressed he looks when he says all of that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Frankel from Green Street Advisor. Please go ahead.","Eric Frankel","First, I want to thank your team again for hosting that investor tour in Europe. Last week, it was quite informative, so thank you for that. Second just related to global trade, which has obviously been a traditional driver of your business. Any comments on the NAFTA discussions that are taking place? It doesn't seem to be going all that well. I think the U.S. seems to be -- I think there seems to be little bit higher odds that the U.S. is going to back out of the trade agreement. So any thoughts that you can share or what your customers are thinking would be appreciated?","Hamid Moghadam","We'll let Chris Caton cover that one because it's in the realm of speculation.","Chris Caton","Eric, thanks for the question. Yes, indeed, there seems to be a bit more news and noise on NAFTA lately. And it seems as if to regard to pace and tenure of those negotiations and it's something suggest new risk to the agreement. But I also think it's symptomatic of a change in how the U.S. negotiates agreements. And so look on NAFTA, I think we'll continue to see that noise. The U.S. may initiate a withdrawal, which is a six month window to continue discussions. And indeed, the discussions are slated to continue into next year anyway, but regardless of direction on NAFTA, more important is its implications for our business.","Gene Reilly","Eric, it's Gene. Just to on that note, we have not seen any fall off in demand, and if anything and you can look at the fundamentals in Mexico as easy as weekend, that market has been strengthening. And recently -- look, if we go back a year and a half, the NAFTA dialogue has gone one direction to other direction, does have an effect on currency which we pay attention to. But during that entire period of time actually demand has probably grown slightly and the conditions right now in Mexico are actually pretty good.","Hamid Moghadam","And the only thing I have to add to what Chris said is that it makes it sounds like U.S. has a very clear and deliberate strategy which at least judging by everything else that we've done off late. I don't see quite that level of sophistication in that strategy, but that's more commentary than fact.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Nick Stelzner from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Nick Stelzner","Can you give us an update on your multi-storey warehouse initiatives in the U.S.? What's the demand and pricing been like across the different levels of the building and also relative to the other buildings in the area?","Hamid Moghadam","We've leased a multi-storey building that we acquired. The rent has been about 20% higher than our expectation, and probably between double and triple what quality space is in a traditional industrial location in the same metro area. Our Seattle building is too early, it's not going to be even completed until mid-to-late next year. We're having the dialogue on it, but we don't lease that prematurely. And the San Francisco project is not even approved yet, so it's early.","Oh, the opportunity is, I don't know I think there are six markets for sure that can benefit from this type of development and it would not be unusual to think of those markets as sort of 5 million square foot opportunities in the next call it five years. And if you do the math that's 30 million feet, these buildings are about double to triple the price of traditional industrial. So it\u2019s equivalent to roughly a 100 million square feet call it 60 to a 100 million square feet of regular industrial.","So if you compare that to our U.S. portfolio, we've got 400 million feet. It's probably a 20%, 20-25% type growth opportunity if we can find the real estate and execute successfully. But that's speculation, so we'll take it a deal at a time in those six markets.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Frankel from Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","Eric Frankel","Just one quick follow-up. Is there a specific market or geographic area where you're increasing dispositions to fund your additional development activity? Or is it just kind of the bottom rung of the portfolio, generally?","Hamid Moghadam","Yes, Eric, the answer to that question always is Tampa. Because we've sold out of Tampa three times and we keep getting back into it. No, I'm just joking. We're basically selling our other markets first, and we're pretty much done with that. And then we go to the regional markets, and the regional markets we only want to own the very top-tier product. So we're selling sort of the less high quality product in the regional market. And then in the core markets and the global markets that we're really interested in long-term, there is always some level of you know 2% to 5% pruning of the portfolio that goes on all the time in terms of upgrading the quality.","So when you add up all those, it's a pretty significant number. I would say we're essentially done with our non-strategic sales in the U.S., essentially in the last $100 million to $200 million of that stuff. And Europe, we've got less than a 1 billion to go, so we are -- we sold $14 million of real estate since the merger, so we're really getting to the bottom of the barrel in terms of what's left. And there will be the regular calling of the portfolio that will go on every year even after that, and there're always some opportunistic sales that you know we get an outrageous offer or there's a build-to-suit that we do that we don't want to hold. So there will be some dispositions, but the volumes are likely to decline. Of course, if we buy a major portfolio or a company or something, there could be more dispositions in that, but I'm not aware of any of those things right now.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vincent Chao","Just a quick question on construction costs and maybe inclusive of land, but at this point I mean are you seeing construction cost growth faster than rent growth? And then second question just on demand, just any changes in the source of demand by tenant type or an industry in the past three to six months?","Hamid Moghadam","Yes, construction costs are driven by labor cost in a big way, pretty much everywhere around world. I would say given the 9% rental growth in the U.S. to-date, it would be hard to say that construction costs are growing faster than that, but they are -- there is 5% to 6% anyway and maybe a little bit higher U.S. In Europe, construction costs are going up a lot and they are going up faster than rent. So, I think development is getting tougher and tougher to pencil out, which I think is a really good for rental growth in Europe in the long-term. What was the second part of your question?","Tom Olinger","So in the U.S. in the recent quarter cyclical has picked up in a particular residential construction and related usage to that. And then of course the e-com related usage which in the transportation sector as well as packaging has also been strong during the quarter. And I think last quarter we highlighted that we saw a weakness ahead for auto related demand and we'll have some sort of temporary reversal of that with the at least a 1 million vehicles damaged these hurricanes.","Hamid Moghadam","And then in Europe, I'd say the monetization of the supply chain is obviously a big driver. One of the categories within that sector is consumer goods up 20% and up 20%, it was 20% a share this quarter. Interestingly, automotive was 12% this quarter. So, it continues to be pretty strong in terms of their modernizing the supply chain. For those of you that was -- were on the tour last week, you would note BMW and Jaguar Land Rover both preparing for electric cars and really alternative revenues. In JLR's case, you saw the classic car division and special vehicle unit. Within cyclical this quarter, home appliances were 18% share and they're across both of those two. Obviously, e-commerce continues to be a pretty significant driver and it was about 17%.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Petersen from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Jon Petersen","Thank you. Can you talk about the lack of labor as a limiter on supply? Hope you can provide a little more color on that. And where you think the longer term impacts are? But logically you think customers are going to have to increase wages to find people. Maybe that limits the ability to pay higher rents on warehouses, obviously things really tight and I'm not sure about that. Just trying to think more of what the longer term implications are there with the labor market?","Hamid Moghadam","Yes, there are two kinds of effects of the labor market. One is that the shortage of construction labor is really driving up construction cost. And therefore we're putting pressure on rents that you need to justify replacement cost. So that tends to push rents up. In terms of what customers are doing with respective to the operating the buildings and the shortage of labor, actually what we hear from them in the U.S. is that they really are having hard time finding customers that actually -- I mean employees that pass the drug test, which I hadn't thought about that. But apparently this opioid epidemic is quite a big factor in terms of hiring a warehouse labor.","Anyway, I think what they're doing is they're improving working conditions, they're paying more to get labor, and they're introducing more automation, and because they have to so business isn't slowdown because of that. But remember there are a lot of things in the supply chain cost that are actually going down in terms of cost. The cost of energy is generally being going down that's transportation that's a big component of the supply chain cost. Interest rates are very low, so the cost of carrying an inventory is much lower than it used to be.","A lot of retail real estate is being skipped over in terms of the supply chain through bricks-and-mortar jumping over to e-commerce. So, it\u2019s a dynamic mix, some cost going up and some cost going down. But what we are hearing from our customers really for the first time in my career which is remarkable is that they are a lot less price sensitive on warehouse rent, which represents about 3% of their total supply chain cost, maybe 5% in some cases than they have appeared to be in the past. I mean they are openly telling us that. I have never heard that before.","Operator","Thank you. And your last question comes from Manny Korchman at Citi. Please go ahead.","Manny Korchman","Just looking at your supplemental here, it looks like to the occupancy with your -- the largest boxes in your portfolio dipped quarter-over-quarter. Was there anything specifically around there or might be a mix issue or something else going on?","Gene Reilly","This is Gene. There isn\u2019t anything particular. And that segment as you probably follow, we have been extremely high levels of occupancy about 1 million footer goes dark, it makes the difference. So, I wouldn\u2019t read anything into that.","Hamid Moghadam","Okay, thank you. That was the last question. We really appreciate your interest in the Company and look forward to seeing many of you in Dallas again, I guess, pretty soon. Take care.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Tracy Ward, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Tracy Ward","Thank you, Kim. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Prologis conference call. If you have not yet downloaded the press releases or acquisition presentation related to this call, they are available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations.","This morning, you will hear from Hamid Moghadam, our Chairman and CEO; Gene Reilly, our CEO of the Americas; Tom Olinger, our CFO; and also joining us for the call today are Gary Anderson, Mike Curless, Ed Nekritz, and Diana Scott. After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll host a question-and-answer session.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I\u2019d like to state that this call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, and projection about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates, as well as management\u2019s beliefs and assumptions.","Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance, and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings.","Additionally, our first quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures, such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures and in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. As is our custom, after our prepared remarks, we will please ask you to limit your question to one.","With that, I will turn the call over to Tom, who will begin with the highlights from our earnings from the first quarter.","Tom Olinger","Thanks, Tracy. Good morning. As you\u2019ve seen from our earnings press release, we had a very strong start to the year. Core FFO was $0.49 per share, an increase of 14% over the same period last year. Occupancy at quarter end was 95.9%. Leasing volume was very good, and as a result, we saw a lower than normal seasonal dip in first quarter occupancy.","GAAP rent change on rollover was 9.7%, positive across all regions, and led by the U.S. at 15.1%. Cash rent change on rollover for the quarter was 3.3%. GAAP same store NOI increased 3.5% on an owned-and-managed basis, and 3.7% on an our-share basis.","CAM true-ups negatively impacted same store NOI by about 50 basis points in the quarter; however, this is isolated to Q1 and will not impact our same store NOI run rate for the remainder of the year. Given the momentum and occupancy in rent change, we feel confident about same store NOI and are increasing the midpoint and narrowing the range on a GAAP owned-and-managed basis to 3.75% to 4.5%, with our share expected to be 50 basis points to 100 basis points higher.","On the capital deployment front, starts and acquisitions totaled $421 million, while dispositions and contributions were $494 million. The weighted average stabilized cap rate on dispositions and contributions was 3.6%, which includes the previously announced value-added conversion sale on a 56-acre industrial park to Facebook.","Turning to capital markets, we converted $460 million of convertible debt to equity during the quarter, helping drive down leverage, which was 34.4% at quarter end. Debt to adjusted EBITDA, including realized gains, improved to 5.8 times and to 6.4 times without gains. We also continue to have significant liquidity with $2.8 billion at quarter end.","Our USD net equity increased to 91% from 89% last quarter. Looking further at foreign currency, we continued our efforts to mitigate the impact on both NAV and earnings. Notably, we\u2019ve now fully hedged our estimated sterling, euro, and yen earnings for both 2015 and 2016. As a result, movements in these currencies will have no impact on our estimated Core FFO throughout next year.","Let\u2019s turn to 2015 guidance, which does not reflect any impact of the KTR transaction, as we\u2019ll discuss this separately in a moment. We have included guidance in our press release and supplemental, so I\u2019ll focus only on significant changes from last quarter.","Starting with deployment, we\u2019re increasing our disposition range to between $2.1 billion and $2.5 billion with activity coming from non-strategic asset sales in Europe and the U.S., and we\u2019re increasing our share of contributions to co-investment ventures to 65%. As a result, we now expect to fully fund our 2015 deployment activity through capital recycling. In addition, we\u2019re increasing the range of realized development gains to between $250 million and $300 million for the year.","Putting this all together, we are increasing the midpoint and narrowing our 2015 core FFO to a range between $2.07 and $2.13 per share. This represents year-over-year growth to 12% or an increase of $0.22 at the midpoint. This is on top of the 14% growth we had in 2014. Again, our 2015 guidance here does not reflect any impact from the KTR transaction. Our existing portfolio continues to benefit from strong operating fundamentals and we\u2019re well positioned to deploy capital at favorable returns.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Hamid to discuss the KTR transaction.","Hamid Moghadam","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your joining us today to discuss this exciting transaction. Yesterday, we announced the signing of definitive agreements to acquire KTR\u2019s $5.9 billion business at a stabilized cap rate of 5.5% and in line with replacement costs. The transaction is summarized on page three of the presentation.","The portfolio comprises of all of KTR\u2019s funds and will be acquired by our consolidated joint venture with Norges Bank. As we\u2019ve discussed on previous occasions, we\u2019re interested in acquiring stabilized assets in the U.S. only when we see a strong alignment in quality and location with our own holdings and when we bring significant competitive advantage to the table. This transaction is an excellent example of these principles in action.","First, it\u2019s rare to find a portfolio that aligns so perfectly in terms of asset quality, customer profile, and market composition with our own. We believe this synergy enables us to add immediate value through leasing and portfolio operations. Second, we worked hard to position our balance sheet and our institutional capital relationships to pursue significant investment opportunities such as this as they arise.","And third, our OP unit structure, the attractiveness of our currency, and our ability to execute reliably and expeditiously give us an important edge on large, complex portfolios, as evidenced in both the KTR and Morris transactions.","Let me add that I\u2019ve known the KTR leadership team for 15 years and have always considered them to be knowledgeable investors and among the most astute competitors in the U.S. industrial market.","I would now like to walk you through the strategic rationale for the transaction, which is summarized on page four of the presentation. First, the portfolio strengthens our U.S. presence with highly complementary assets, representing a 95% overlap with our existing U.S. operating portfolio.","Second, the acquisition presents a rare opportunity to deliver immediate accretion to our shareholders as we build an even stronger platform for sustainable growth. Third, this transaction advances our important partnership with Norges. Specifically, it will expand the assets under management of the USLV venture by 6x to $7 billion and grows our partnership with this leading investor to more than $11 billion of assets on two continents.","And fourth, this acquisition expands relationships with our current customers and establishes some important new ones. It also adds to our development pipeline, driving incremental NOI growth as we lease up these properties.","With that, let me turn it over to Gene to walk you through the details of the portfolio.","Gene Reilly","Thanks, Hamid. Please turn to page five of the presentation deck and I\u2019ll start with some background on KTR for those of you who are not as familiar with them. KTR Capital Partners is an investment development and operating company focused exclusively on U.S. industrial real estate since its founding in 2004. The company is a significant player in the sector and would actually rank second among public companies here excluding Prologis.","KTR\u2019s investment strategy has been very similar to ours throughout its history. They've been our toughest U.S. competitor over the years and have consequently constructed a portfolio that is an extremely good fit for Prologis.","The real estate assets include three categories. First, a 60-million square foot operating portfolio of very high quality assets located throughout the U.S., with over 70% focused in LA, New Jersey, Chicago, South Florida, Seattle, and Dallas. 87% of the assets are located in global markets, and as Hamid noted 95% are located where we currently operate real estate leading to the terrific operating synergies we\u2019ll have here going forward.","Second, there are eight well conceived development projects totaling 3.6 million square feet, two-thirds of which are located in California. 50% of the development will be delivered at or near shale completion at closing and the remainder will be shale complete before year-end. And finally 438 acres of land capable of supporting 6.8 million square feet in nine markets, all of which appeal the targets and places in which our land bank needs to be restocked.","While the development portfolio and land complement our strategy and meet current needs combine they represent less than 6% of the transaction and our percentage of non-income producing assets actually declined post closing.","Turning to page 6, this really speaks for itself in terms of depicting the common market selection preferences between the two firms and the clear operating synergies of this combined portfolio. Turning to page 7 and 8, we described the effect of the acquisition on the Prologis U.S. and global portfolio metrics. Key takeaways here are as follows, obviously a very well aligned portfolio, as compared to ours.","The KTR portfolio is slightly younger with a longer remaining lease terms. The portfolio is also under leased at 89% occupancy currently. We are highly confident in our ability to bring this occupancy in-line with the rest of our U.S. portfolio within 12 months. We are active in these markets, know all of these assets and actually look forward to taking this on in the current operating environment. This gap by the way represents about two or three weeks of normal leasing volume for us in the U.S.","Finally, U.S. equity is up significantly on top of a nice quarterly improvement in the metric pre-acquisition and finally turning to page 9 from the customer perspective the addition of this portfolio will expand relationships with over 150 multi-market customers that today lease space from both firms. Like Prologis KTS a sophisticated customer outreach strives to develop strategic, not purely transactional relationships with the customers and their roaster.","And with that I am going to turn it over to Tom to discuss capitalizing and transaction.","Tom Olinger","Thanks Gene. I will continue on page 10 of the presentation. While this transaction provides immediate accretion to core FFO and to cash flow it also has other significant financial benefits. First the acquisition will increase our share of U.S. dollar investments. Our U.S. dollar net equity post the KTR transaction will increase to 93%. As Dean mentioned, we can efficiently integrate these assets and as a result we expect to lower G&A as a percentage of AUM by about 12%.","Let\u2019s move to slide 11 to discuss how we plan to finance the transaction. We are committed to maintaining a very strong balance sheet with significant liquidity. This transaction has proof of why a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity is a strategic advantage. Longer term we will finance the transaction at line with our capital strategy, which includes both debt and equity on a leverage neutral basis. In the interim we have many different options to fund the transaction and it\u2019s important to remember we\u2019ve already financed 45% of the deal through USLV.","Let\u2019s look at the book ends of our options. On the asset side, this includes incremental dispositions of non-strategic assets and fund contributions in addition to the potential sell down of our interest in PELP, our European venture with Norges. If we assume funding the transaction using a mix of accelerated dispositions of non-strategic assets contributions and sell down of fund interest, the annual stabilized core FFO accretion would be about 5% or $0.11 per share with year-end leverage of about 35%.","On the debt side, we have significant availability on our line and capacity for more unsecured and secured debt. We have also obtained a commitment for a bridge loan from Morgan Stanley for up to $1 billion to ensure we continue maintaining significant liquidity regardless of how we elect to fund this over the near term. If we assume we fund the entire transaction with long term debt, the annual stabilized core FFO accretion would be about 9% or $0.18 a share with year-end leverage of about 38%. We also have a 750 million ATM program in place. Regardless of the various combination of capital in the interim over the long term, we will fund this on a leverage neutral basis. We will provide more information on financing plans at the appropriate time. ","Turning to accretion on slide 12, on a leverage neutral basis we expect the transaction to deliver accretion of $0.14 on an annual stabilized basis. We expect to hit this annual stabilized run rate in mid-2016. This represents about 7% growth over the mid-point of a revised 2015 guidance. When you consider our net deployment for the rest of the year, including funding this transaction on a leverage neutral basis, our leverage at year-end would decline to approximately 33%.","From a cash flow or AFFO perspective we expect growth in-line with core FFO. The impact of this transaction on 2015 core FFO will vary based on the closing date of the deal and how we finance this in the short term. However, assuming we close in June and fund initially on our leverage neutral basis 2015 core FFO accretion would be approximately $0.05 a share.","To wrap-up on page 13, we are very excited about this transaction as it meets all of our strategic objectives. It is very high quality and consistent with our long-term investment strategy, provides significant accretion to core FFO and cash flows on a leverage neutral basis, increases our U.S. dollar net equity, lowers G&A as a percentage of AUM, and expands our relationship with Norges Bank.","With that I will turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instruction] And your first question comes from the line of George Auerbach from Credit Suisse, your line is open.","George Auerbach ","Thanks. Good morning. Tom, just a few questions to help us in the street models. First, the deck noted it's a 5.5% stabilized cap rate. Can you comment on the cash yield today? Second, maybe for Gene, the 89% occupancy, where is the vacancy in the portfolio, just to help us think through just how fast you\u2019ll lease that up? And three, Tom, the $0.14 of accretion to core FFO, is that a GAAP number or a cash number? ","Gene Reilly","I\u2019ll start \u2013 go ahead.","Tom Olinger","Gene will start and I will answer the last question.","Gene Reilly","Yes, George I\u2019m going to start with the leasing. So, one of the things, first of all the vacancy is actually distributed pretty much throughout the portfolio, so we don\u2019t have pockets of vacancy. We have a couple of large buildings but nothing worth pointing out. One thing I didn\u2019t mention in the prepared remarks, we have leases signed that haven\u2019t yet commenced or leases out for about 240 basis points of occupancy right now. So, we hit - the timing just happens that it\u2019s 89%, but actually we are going to start quite a bit higher than that and as I said we are not concerned about getting this amount. So, your first question was related to cash yields and I don\u2019t know Tom you probably want to talk that one.","Tom Olinger","Well George I\u2019ll answer your question on $0.14 a share that is a GAAP measure and that includes about $0.02 to $0.03 of non-cash items, which would include any impact on resetting straight line rent, any impact on resetting lease mark-to-market, as well as debt mark-to-market. So, again the $0.14 is on a GAAP basis includes $0.02 to $0.03 of non-cash items and when you think about what the impact on AFFO is, we think the AFFO growth from this transaction will be right in line with our core FFO growth. So, any of the scenarios I talked about you should consider AFFO growing in line with that \u2013 those growth rates. ","Hamid Moghadam","Yes, let me answer George\u2019s first question. George, if you stabilize the portfolio to 95%, which is in line, actually a little bit lower than our existing portfolio that\u2019s when you get to your 5.5%, at the current 89%, you are at 5.2%. So, I think that\u2019s the number you were looking for.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citigroup, your line is open.","Manny Korchman","Hey, guys. Manny Korchman here with Michael. If we just think about the value that you ascribe to the operating platform and Jeff and his Team, is there a non-compete there? Can you help us think about those two topics when you approach this transaction? ","Hamid Moghadam","Sure, I mean the operating platform, you can approach its value from two places. One is, how would the market value this and there are fair number of comps for investment management organizations. Their EBITDA round numbers was in the mid-to-high $20 million range and at 2.30 that works out to a little under a nine multiple on EBITDA.","On our side, from our point of view, given the synergies that we have on the overhead side and the arrangements we have on the investment management side, our EBITDA is actually \u2013 going to be a little bit higher than that in terms of synergies. So the multiple to us would be a little bit lower than it would be to the upside market. So, depending on which of those two measures you want to look at, somewhere between a seven and a nine multiple on EBITDA.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Specter from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Jamie Feldman","Good morning. This is Jamie Feldman here with Jeff. If I could just ask a follow-up to the prior question and then I'll ask my question. The follow-up being, what are the synergies? And do you expect to maintain a lot of the KTR staff and platform? And then my actual question is just following up with Tom on slide 11, can you talk us through the magnitude of some of these financing options? Getting a lot of questions about how much equity you'd actually need. And then also thinking about maybe the PELP ownership or some of the other things you could have prefunded, what was the thought on not having all the financing in place at this point? ","Gene Reilly","So Jamie, it\u2019s Gene. I will answer your first question. So, we have the opportunity to recruit talent from this team and we certainly hope to hire a number of people. We are taking on 60 million square feet here. As you know, we manage our real estate in-house with an in-house property management team. KTR, also ran their business in an integrated model. ","And you know, frankly, besides sharing an investment strategy that was pretty much in common with Prologis, their approach of running the business was also very similar. I think they have some of the best people in the business. And they work within a platform that treats customers the same way and approaches the brokerage community and the broader real estate community in the same way. So that is very attractive for us. So we certainly will be taking on a number of their people, primarily in property management roles in terms of numbers, but also some of their investment folks as well.","Hamid Moghadam","Yeah. Just to be clear, I think in the past you have heard us say that we can take between $10 billion to $20 billion of incremental assets in our markets without any increase in G&A. This transaction is totally consistent with that, notwithstanding what Gene said, which are those additions are on the property management leasing side which are attributable at the property level and are already factored into the cap rate and all the things we just talked about.","In terms of the bottom line G&A of the company, we anticipate no change. And in fact, having gone through this exercise now, we are even more convinced that we can take on maybe $10 billion or $15 billion more of assets, again without a commensurate or without any increase in the below the line G&A.","Tom Olinger","And Jamie, this is Tom. I'll answer your question. First on being prepared, we have been getting prepared for a transaction like this for the last four years and getting our balance sheet to where it is with high liquidity, low leverage, strong cash flows. I'll walk you through some of the assumptions on the different scenarios. ","So first on the leverage neutral scenario, where earnings were $0.14 on a leverage neutral basis, so what we are assuming there is equity of approximately $1.7 billion, so that would include the units of $230 million and the balance of common equity. So call it $1.5 billion. About $1 billion dollars of debt. About $400 million which is assumed, so incremental new debt of about $600 million. And then we've got a combination of other assets, which is cash, and some other liquid assets plus some additional asset sales of about $500 million. So those are the three components that get you to our share of the funding of $3.2 billion. ","Again 1.7 of equity, $1.5 billion which is common, a $1 billion of debt and about $500 million of other assets. That takes our leverage in combination with our deployment guidance for the full year, without KTR, all of that in combination gets us to LTV of about 33% at year end. ","The asset sales scenario we talked about simply replaces that $1.5 billion of common equity, with a combination of asset sales and fund contributions and sell downs of interests. So the debt component's exactly the same. That results in earnings accretion of about $0.11 a share and we end up with leverage at the end of the year of about 35%. The last scenario is if we fund this transaction all with debt and that scenario is $0.18 of accretion, and we would end up the year at leverage around 38%. So we feel really good about our ability to fund this in a variety of different ways. And our leverage in all of these scenarios continues to be very good even in the fully debt scenario. So we feel good about where our balance sheet is, we feel really good about our liquidity through any of these various iterations, and we feel good about our rating as a very solid BBB+ BAA1 company.","Hamid Moghadam","I would like to add one more thing. A couple of years ago, we did our first joint venture with Norges in Europe, basically recapitalizing pepper and some other assets in Europe. And at that time, you may recall that we did it on a break-even cost basis about an 8 cap. And the reason we retained a 50% interest is that we were confident that there would be some value appreciation in that portfolio and we negotiated the right to sell up to 30% of that venture down to 20%.","Well in the interim two years, cap rates have in that portfolio, compressed from 8 to about 6.4 as of the end of the year. We believe that those cap rates will continue to compress just based on real-time transactions in Europe to probably 6 or a little bit under. And that is a negotiated right that at any time we can basically pull that lever, and generate a $1.1 billion of capital to fund this or any other activities we might have. So to think of it as a built-in equity issuance out there that we can always use, we have great optionality there to fund our business.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Gabriel Hilmoe from Evercore. Your line is open.","Gabriel Hilmoe","On the 5.5 stabilized cap rate, does that include all the current developments in process as well as the land being built out? If not where does the yield move to assuming those are built out and stabilize? And then just one for Gene, as far as market rents, where is the KTR portfolio relative to market today?","Gene Reilly","So let me take your last one first. We think that their portfolio is under rented pretty much in the same neighborhood as our U.S., so call it 10% under rented. Relative to the yields, the numbers we gave you were for the operating portfolio. If you add the development portfolio, those yields go up a little bit, as you can imagine, because we have a margin in there. But it is such a small component, you are talking about basis points. And the land is priced as we would buy land okay? So when that is put into production, again that is going to push the yield. But it is $90 million of land and that, again, is basis points.","Tom Olinger","Yeah, the projected value add on the development portfolio is about 7%. Now, remember the development portfolio is almost all under construction and in various stages of being completed, so a lot of the risk has been taken out of it. And but there is still a pretty good spread of 7%, between it and its retail value.","Operator","And your next question comes from Ross Nussbaum from UBS. Your line is open.","Ross Nussbaum","Hey guys, a couple of part question on the fee side. Tom, first, of the $0.35 to $0.37 of accretion that that you talked about that was NOI plus fees, how much of that was fee income? And then the second question I have was, you are buying I guess the KTR platform here. What's just simply buying the assets and not paying the $230 million for the platform just simply not an option in this deal structure?","Tom Olinger","I\u2019ll take the first question. On the incremental fees, it\u2019s about - it\u2019s between $0.02 and $0.03 is the incremental fees in that caption on page 12.","Gene Reilly","And it\u2019s Gene, I\u2019ll take the second one. First of all, no, that was not an option. And second of all, we wanted it. We are getting benefits out of this we\u2019ve already described and there is a lot of intangible benefits as well that come along with this, mostly in their people, reputation, brand in the industry. As we said, this is a tough competitor who we think is really, really good.","Operator","And your next question comes from Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is open.","Ki Bin Kim","Thanks. Just a couple of quick questions. I'm not sure if I missed it, but what is the total value of the plus CIp? And second question going to the equity portion for funding for this deal, I mean, about a $1 billion to do right? Your stock, I have a trading around 10% discount to NAV. Just curious to know what is your thinking process in terms of timing? Like you know, is it within a couple of years? Maybe slightly I don't want to say agnostic to the pricing but is $42, $43 a share is that in the range where you would commit to that equity neutral statement? Or is it longer term where you want your stock price to be closer to NAV before you actually pursue a equity or leverage neutral transaction like this? And maybe tied to that you know I thought the whole point of having a low levered balance sheet was not to maintain that low leverage but was actually to use it and maybe take leverage up for a deal like this. So curious why you even have to keep it leverage neutral. Thanks.","Hamid Moghadam","Okay, those are all good questions. So let me take them one at a time. The land bank is $90 million of the total deal and the construction in progress is $260 million of the whole deal. Secondly, in terms of how we think about equity, first of all, it would be really unfair and, and misleading if we reported the accretion of this deal on a levered up to 38% basis using debt which is something we can do, but some of that benefit $0.04 of that benefit would come from levering up and we can lever up anything and generate that. So really we chose to describe the transaction on a leverage neutral basis and that leverage neutral level is pretty consistent with our goals, because remember this company is still driving towards a single A rating and we are committed to that.","In terms of the level of equity that we need to generate, actually to do it perfectly on a leverage neutral basis if we were doing nothing else the number is about $1.5 billion and we are issuing about a little over $200 million of OP units to the seller. So the number is $1.5 billion. When we would do that totally depends. We are going to be opportunistic. We know what the value of our properties are and we are in no rush. As you heard from Tom, we have multiple ways and multiple levers to pull in terms of financing this transaction. And hopefully we'll be thoughtful about when we take advantage of the equity markets. But we don't need to do it today, tomorrow or even six months from now. We have plenty of runway to do that but we will equitize this transaction.","Operator","Your next question comes from Blaine Heck from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Blaine Heck","Follow up on that last one. Can you tell us where the $44.91 share price for the OP units issued to KTR came from? And then maybe can you comment on the timing of the deal at this point in the cycle versus maybe investing more in Europe where you guys have said that value seemed to be accelerating a little bit more?","Hamid Moghadam","So in terms of $44.81, our deal was the stock price for the 20 trailing days of trading with a floor of consensus NAV which on the day that we shook hands was $44.81. So that\u2019s where that came from. So actually consensus NAV is higher than that now, but it happened to be that on that date. In terms of, what was the other question?","Blaine Heck","Timing of the deal, why this is opposed to Europe?","Hamid Moghadam","Well, we are doing both. I mean this is, we can't exactly time strategic transactions like this and we can't plan for them. So, and as you know, we are not in the business of buying a lot of companies. Because frankly, every time we look at a portfolio, we realize that there is no fit between it and our business. And if we want to buy something we usually have to go through I don't know selling half of it, so it is pretty complicated. This is the one portfolio that has almost a perfect match with our own holdings, so we have been very excited about it because of these synergies. ","And that doesn't mean that we are not active in Europe, we continue to be pretty active in Europe and we have a good capital recycling model with our funds that adequately capitalizes our development business in Europe. And we did a lot of acquisitions in Europe in the last 24 months before the pricing really started tightening up. Pricing is tightening up. We think there is more room on the cap rates, but there has been 100 basis points to 150 basis points of cap rate compression in Europe since we started investing there in this cycle. There is probably another 50 basis points to 75 basis points left and we'll be opportunistic to take advantage of those deals as well. So it is not an either or. We just can't plan on transactions like this.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Mailman from KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Jordan Sadler","Good morning. It\u2019s Jordan Sadler with Craig. My question is something a follow-up on that last question. I guess based on the commentary we've heard from you most recently, I think we would have felt that you have thought that the U.S. was longer in the tooth as it relates to the stage of the rental rate growth cycle, and as it relates to where cap rates are, evaluations are, whereas there seem to be more room or upside in Europe. And so I guess this transaction comes as a little bit of a surprise in that you seem to be buying the U.S. here. So is there anything that's changed relative to maybe the comments in February and March?","Hamid Moghadam","So I think at one of the conferences, somebody asked me where we are in the cycle of what inning we are in. And I think specifically about the U.S., I answered the question that we are in the eighth or ninth inning on the cap rates. And by the way, I have been wrong about that for the last two to three years. Cap rates have continued to compress. But we think cap rates are pretty much there. We said that we are in about the fifth or sixth inning of market rents recovering. And as you know, for the last three years, we have been talking about the market rent recovery and actually had some pretty specific projections that we shared with you which, to be honest with you, were controversial at the time but turned out to be really correct and in fact, a little understating the rental recovery. ","And most importantly, in terms of rents in the portfolio, we are in the second maybe third inning. Because these market rents have only started escalating in the last two to three years and it takes awhile before all these things are all through the portfolio. So really, the attractiveness of this portfolio, in addition to its fit, is the opportunity to capture some of those rents as we work our way through the portfolio.","Europe, just to be clear, has had cap rate compression, significant cap rate compression, very consistent with the way we call it. The rental upside in Europe will be less, because the rental declines in Europe were less during the downturn, so we think we are in the early stages of rental recovery in Europe, probably in the first or second inning of the rental recovery, other than the UK. The UK is very use-like. But most of Europe is in the early stages of rental recovery and the real story in the short term in Europe is cap rate compression. So they are flipped, Europe is cap rate compression, modest rent recovery. U.S. probably not a lot more cap rate compression but pretty robust rental growth.","There is also one other thing I would like to say, because it's really important. We all sit around and throw around cap rates, because they are just really easy things for people to discuss. But there is an underlying quality and the ability of the portfolio to generate same store growth over time. You are seeing that in the Prologis portfolio today. We have worked hard to prune our portfolio down to the key global market and you are seeing that our U.S. rent change this quarter was 15%, up with that up against anybody else\u2019s numbers, and the KTR strategy is very consistent with the Prologis strategy. So, we think these high quality portfolios will outperform in terms of same store NOI growth over time and frankly to buy another portfolio and there have been portfolios for sale for another 40 basis points on the cap rate and giving up just upside we don\u2019t think it\u2019s too wise even though it sounds like a better cap rate. That\u2019s how we think about it. ","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel from Green Street Advisors. Your line is open. ","Eric Frankel","I was hoping you'd comment on these types of deals and how you view your development platform franchise? I see, you guys, you talked about in the past, you guys have ascribe a lot of value to it, so I just wonder, if you think about dilution, when you think about these larger types of deals, especially relative to your cost of capital now, which we will argue is not particularly strong. Thank you. ","Tom Olinger","Well it\u2019s all a big circle isn\u2019t it. I mean, yeah we do think our development business has value. We have done everything we can, you know last two to three years to show its ability to generate profits and that continues and we\u2019ve talked about maybe getting your 5% or 6% multiple, 5 times or 6 times multiple on those sustainable development gains, but we are not getting it and all the NAVs that people throw around are exclusive of that development platform. Some people are beginning to give us a little bit of credit for that, maybe on the order of $0.50 or $1 a share, but certainly not on the order of $3 to $4 a share, which has six multiple on those earnings would imply. So, and the reason our cost to capital is in your view not very attractive is because we are not getting full credit for that development business.","Now with this transaction, we really are reducing the percentage of the company always that has non-income producing asset because this is a large portfolio operating asset and actually the other thing we are doing is actually cranking up their percentage of assets in the U.S. and those two things over time should make this debate about the development, the value of the development business less important as the value of the operating \u2013 as the size of the operating portfolio gets bigger and bigger because our development business is not going to get proportionally bigger, but the underlying operating portfolio will continue to grow.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Vincent Chao","Hi, everyone. Just wanted to see if we could get some more color on just the background of this deal, obviously, you've been working with these guys, or aware of them, dealing with them for a long time. But just curious about the timing, and maybe coincides with the cycle question, but why now? And maybe the decision to bring Norges in, were they the driver behind this? Or did you consider this for the wholly-owned portfolio at all? ","Tom Olinger","Yes, Gene.","Gene Reilly","Yes, I think - first of all Norges wasn\u2019t the driver of this. I think it was pretty well known that KTR was exploring opportunities for its first two funds kind of throughout last year and we are aware that engage in dialogue and took into a bit of different direction, but as you said we\u2019ve known these guys for a long time, and we\u2019ve competed against this business for a long time. We always have respected how they do things, and we like to real estate. So this naturally went in the direction of basically buying the entire business. Once that was solidified, then Norges came into the transaction, but they didn't drive the deal. ","Tom Olinger","Yes, our understanding was that the alternatives they we\u2019re looking at and you would have to ask them about it, but primarily was focused on recapping the first two funds and continuing the investment of fund three, as we understand it. Also, the other alternatives probably did not include attractive currency like we have, that would be desirable to certain of the investors. ","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of John Guinee from Stifel. Your line is open.","John Guinee","Hi Tom, and I guess your team there, I\u2019m sure you have done a lot of forward NAV numbers and if you hold your cap rates fixed is this going to end up being a value creative or value destructive two or three years down the road.","Tom Olinger","This deal as Hamid talked about will be value creative for sure. When you look at the growth potential of this portfolio, and its fit, the efficiencies in which we can integrate this portfolio, I think those two things alone will create a lot of value over the next several years. And notwithstanding the immediate accretion of this deal, most importantly on a cash flow basis. We talked about the $0.14 of earnings and there is about $0.02 to $0.3 estimate in there of noncash items, but our AFFO should grow toe-to-toe with core FFO. So, I think there is value creation all around this thing whether you want to take an earnings cut, or a quality slice, a growth cut, we are very excited about the upside here.","Gene Reilly","John, let me give you a couple of numbers so you get a sense for this. This portfolio, once you look at the operating assets, is about $92.50 a foot. And if you look at the U.S. portfolio that Prologis has, it's a little over $82 a square foot. So there is about a 12% difference in terms of price per foot between these two portfolios. But there is a 15% rent difference between the portfolios. In other words, this transaction, average rent market rent is $547 and the Prologis portfolio prior to this deal is $4.73. So 12% more price per foot, 15% more in rent.","So, in terms of metrics, it's very comparable and actually attractive, compared to our portfolio. Now, why is it a little more expensive and higher rent? Well, because it has, the Prologis portfolio is about 50% focused on the top five markets, and this portfolio is about 56% focused in those markets. So slightly higher concentration in the bigger markets, and longer average lease terms. The average lease term in this portfolio is about six and change, and our portfolio, before this deal is about four. And finally, in terms of age, the Prologis portfolio is about 20 years, 21 years, this is about 17 years. So on a couple of parameters, mix of market, age, and duration of leases, if you adjust for it, you can very quickly get to the same evaluation and the rents lineup exactly with that.","Now, why did I take you through all this? Because we are a big believer on rental growth in the Prologis portfolio absent this. Remember, last year we grew our earnings and the leverage by 14%, our FFO per share. This year at the mid-point we are growing our earnings even before this deal at 12% per share, again with neutral or slightly declining leverage. And this transaction adds another 7% on top of that, when fully equitized. So obviously those are pretty good numbers. And to have more of the kind of the real estate aligned with ours that can produce those kinds of growth numbers we think is a pretty attractive proposition.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Sumit Sharma ","Sumit Sharma for Vance Edelson. Most of our questions have been asked. But I guess what I'm wondering is, is there any part of the portfolio that you would consider noncore or something that you would sell immediately? And also, going back to your question on pricing, I guess this particular deal changes the competitive landscape of \u2013 at least from an e-commerce fulfillment category because I see that one of the most telling charts is slide 9, which has Amazon shooting up like crazy. The question really is, having picked up one of the top three e-commerce fulfillment center developers, are you seeing higher pricing power as part of the revenue synergy eventually? Or if not, what else is there driving up the revenues? ","Tom Olinger","Yes, let me just address the question about Amazon, and Gene can talk about the other part of your question. I wouldn't exactly use the words shooting up. Amazon when it is fully shot up is 2.4% of our global rent roll. So it\u2019s an important customer, but our rent rolls are very, very diversified across different players. Gene, do you want --?","Gene Reilly","Yes, so your last question, which is a good one is did we factor in any sort of competitive advantage in pricing power with Amazon or other ecommerce? No, we did not do that. Having said that, that\u2019s kind of part of the platform. KTR has probably the best relationship with that particular company on the build-to-suit than anybody and we\u2019ve done a lot of business with Amazon ourselves, by the way.","So, what was the first question? Yes, sales, sales. So there is a, an immediate sale portfolio and immediate probably means the next couple of years, 4% to 5%. It is small, and basically, it\u2019s kind of flex the assets in south Florida, some in California. But it\u2019s very, very, very small.","Operator","And you next question comes from the line of Mike Salinsky from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Neil Malkin","Hi, this is Neil Malkin, I\u2019m with Mike. A couple of questions. On the KTR, portfolio you guys cited a good amount of vacancy that you can lease up. Just wondering how you factored in the fact that you can get to 600 basis points, 700 basis points of occupancy increase within a year, KTR was an astute operator? And then also are the prop 13 resets and the occupancy growth, are all those things factored into that 5-5 stabilized yield?","Gene Reilly","Yes. Let me take the first one. So KTR is a very astute operator. But they are also a private equity investor with finite live funds and I can tell you they don\u2019t manage the occupancy, they manage the value. And you should call them up and ask them, what they focus on. Our approach is more balanced. But frankly, to move this, we have 250 basis points pretty much in the bank. This is like a couple of weeks of leasing. I\u2019m really not that concerned with it. So we can maybe go into that in more detail. But our teams are the best leasing teams in the country, and I think that our stats speak for themselves. As to your other question, do we have everything baked into the stabilized returns? Yes.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Michael Bilerman","Yes, I just had two questions. One was, Tom, I think you mentioned $1.7 billion of equity and I\u2019m just curious, if you think about 85% leverage, call it, 6.5 times debt to EBITDA that is an equity commitment closer to $2 billion to $2.1 billion, so I wasn\u2019t sure if I heard the $1.7 billion wrong.","And the second question was just related to earnings. You took up your current 2015 guidance $0.2 at the midpoint, and I was wondering if you can walk through the drivers of that increase, because anything you start thinking about the changes it would seem more that it\u2019s tilted down because you are selling a lot more assets, contributing more, you have lower strategic capital revenue, you have slightly higher acquisitions and slightly higher same store, but I would argue the dispositions and the lower strategic capital revenue would have offset both of those.","Tom Olinger","Okay, Michael, I\u2019ll take both of those. On your first question the stock, when we talk about the $0.14 of earnings and leverage neutral, that assumes 1.5 billion of common stock and 230 million of units, so $1.7 billion in total. And that relationship, when you also consider the debt we are issuing and the $500 million of other assets, so there is cash in that number of other assets. There are some other assets that we are utilizing.","So that is a perfect 65%-35% equity debt split, which is debt in line with where our leverage was at the end of the quarter. We ended leverage at the end of the quarter at 34.4%. So that is the equity number that is needed $1.7 billion all in with the units that keep us in our quarter relationship.","Your other question about Q1 earnings, and thank you for asking a question about Q1 earnings. We got them out early. Yes, we are up $0.2 at the midpoint and that is really driven by operations. Yes, we did have some deployment move around, we increased our dispositions, but that was a fairly wide range that we gave you initially and we tightened that up. But when you look at the year the increase, the midpoint of $0.2, it\u2019s really operations driven and it\u2019s the fundamentals that you hear us talking about that we have confidence in and we are seeing come through our numbers.","Hamid Moghadam","Hey, Michael, there is one other really important transaction too that helps with this equity math that you were trying to do. Remember, we sold something that was in our NAV probably for low $100 million range for about $400 million and that was the Facebook campus. So that obviously generates a lot of capital.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel from Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.","Eric Frankel","Thank you. Just speaking of earnings, Tom, can you go through the expense true up process and just talk about how expenses can ramp up like that? And second, just in terms of dispositions now a factor for the year is this at all related to the KTR deal? And third, it looks like Amazon\u2019s roughly 10% of the KTR, portfolio. You know from what I understand there is a lot of highly amortized improvements that go into those developments; I know KTR has done a lot of that. Can you talk about the economics of those deals and what do you think the long-term rent for those facilities matches up to typical brand new generic asset? Thank you.","Gene Reilly","Questionnaire Eric, it\u2019s Gene. I'll take the last question first, relative to Amazon. So, you are correct. I mean what really drives the longer lease terms in this portfolio would, the Amazon leases represent a lot of that and that \u2013 those will have slower growth over time. And if you look at this portfolio, probably the trade-off is longer lease terms, slightly slower growth because you are not capturing what we believe market rent growth to be. But in terms of above standard tenant improvements, I mean we strip those out in terms of how we analyze any acquisition, including this one.","Hamid Moghadam","Yeah, those are not in the numbers that are reflected in the cap rate analysis.","Tom Olinger","Eric, I\u2019ll take your other two questions. First in the CAM true up, we go through CAM analysis every quarter. And we do a true up to billings for the prior year in every Q1. When you look specifically at Q1, what happened this time, it\u2019s not a relatively large, big expense number. It is about $3 million. But what you have is, we had a slight positive true up in the Q1 of 2014, a slight negative true up in 2015, and the delta between those two was about $3 million. But that\u2019s far less than 1% of total operating real estate costs for the whole year, which is really what this is driving to. So it has a really surprisingly disproportionate move in your same store.","Your second question about deployment changes, the deployment changes that we made absent KTR were made independent of the transaction. We\u2019ve talked about accelerating sales of non-strategic assets, particularly in the U.S. We are also looking at the sale of non-strategic assets now in Europe. And we just tightened up the range, and tightened up our approach with that to sell into this market right now.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of John Guinee from Stifel. Your line is open.","John Guinee","First, Hamid, great insight and value add on the per pound and rents versus the two portfolios. Second, you may have said this and I just didn\u2019t catch it, but is Norges also buying a 45% interest in the platform, the land and the underdevelopment? Or are they only a 45% interest in the 60 million square feet?","Hamid Moghadam","We are 45-55 across the board.","John Guinee","Okay, everything?","Hamid Moghadam","Yeah.","John Guinee","Got you. Thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Brad Burke from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Hamid Moghadam","Let\u2019s move on.","Brad Burke","Sorry about that guys. Good morning. I had you on mute. Just a quick one from me. Can you comment on the $5.9 billion paid? How that will compare potentially to the estimates that you have for total replacement costs for the entire portfolio?","Gene Reilly","Yeah, sure. Brad, its Gene. We think we are buying this right at replacement costs. And by the way, in terms of kind of timing and the cycle and so forth, remember we think replacement costs are going to move up pretty dramatically. They certainly have in the last year or two and we think that's going to continue. So we like this entry point. But it's right at it.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Michael Bilerman","Yes, one last one. Yes. One last one. Just in terms of that 5.5% yield I think you talked about being stabilized with the increase in occupancy by next summer. And I think Tom, you said there is $0.02 to $0.03 of non-cash. I don't know how much of that is actually in the 5.5% quoted yield, it is all in about 40 basis points. So maybe you can just help us. What is the going in current cash yield, day one, at 89% occupancy with the current rents? And then what is that next summer what are you assuming that occupancy goes to? I assume it's 95% if you are taking it to stabilize, how much market rent growth are you assuming? And what is your, I think the \u2013 you said the rents were similar below market to your, so I assume seems there is some pickup also from whatever their role is next year. Maybe just help us current to next summer.","Hamid Moghadam","Okay. All the numbers that I'm going to mention to you are this instant's numbers. No rental growth projection from this point forward okay? At 89% occupancy, which is what the portfolio is, by the way, for another nanosecond, because we think there is another 2.5% of leasing coming through immediately. But at 89%, if you took a picture of that, it's 5.2% yield, if you lease it at today's rent, no inflation in rent. At today's rents, up to 95% leasing, that number goes up to 5.5% yield. And that, neither one of those two numbers includes land and CIP, which are currently non-income producing.","If you throw those in the denominator and say we are not getting any return for $260 million of CIP, and $90 million of land the yield goes down to 4.85% yield, but that would be kind of a misleading number. If you then say what happens when you lease up the development that is underway, that 5.5% goes up to like a 5.6%, because those developments are coming in at a slightly higher yield. And none of this assumes any rental growth because it is a cap rate. It is a static measure. For the more dynamic things we look at IRRs and things like that.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman from KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Craig Mailman","Just two follow-ups here. Tom, I was hoping maybe you could give us the number on a cash basis for the U.S. that kind of equates to the 15.1%. Then just secondly, as we look out maybe five years, just curious to the earlier question you guys had talked about the amazon leases. But just curious if you were to compare PLD\u2019s legacy, same store NOI outlook that you guys kind of talk about versus what the KTV would be, are the same store kind of outlook similar? Or is this one slightly below where the legacy portfolio would be?","Hamid Moghadam","I would say this one is slightly above where the legacy portfolio would be because the concentrations of this as I mentioned is about 5 points more in the what we consider the very best markets, good demand and supply constraints. As to when you\u2019re going to get to those rental changes, it would be slightly delayed in this portfolio because the weighted average lease term is longer. So the potential is more here. You are just going to get to it a little bit later. But if you took a seven year view, it would be higher.","Tom Olinger","On your second question, I don\u2019t have that exact number in front of me, but I think it\u2019s going to be something in the 6% to 7% range. Because we\u2019ve always talked about our GAAP rent spreads in the U.S. were about 15.1%. We would see the spread between GAAP and cash at any one point in time average between 600 basis points and 800 basis points. So I think it will put you in that range.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Jeff Specter from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Jamie Feldman","Hey, thanks. It\u2019s Jamie again. Just a couple of quick follow ups. One, the yield you\u2019ve just quoted, I mean, does that include your fee stream from Norges?","Tom Olinger","No.","Jamie Feldman","So that\u2019s before fees?","Tom Olinger","Yes.","Jamie Feldman","What\u2019s the incremental yield on fees?","Hamid Moghadam","It is a cap rate, so it doesn\u2019t have fees in it. You can assume that our investment management teams are around 50 basis points of assets under management.","Jamie Feldman","Okay.","Hamid Moghadam","Round numbers.","Jamie Feldman","All right, great. And then, Tom, I guess for the guidance, I think you guys took down your strategic capital income. Can you talk us through that?","Tom Olinger","Yes. That is all related to FX movements. About two-thirds of our strategic capital revenues are outside the U.S., so euro and yen denominated. So that reflects marking down the revenues to those spot rates today. Now, however, but remember, we are, hedging our net earnings in both euro and yen, as well as Sterling. So, even though you are seeing revenues go down, you are going to see the offset of that sitting in our income statement in our FX and derivatives line. That\u2019s where the hedges that are in place sit. So that\u2019s the benefit. Likewise, we would see some small benefits in G&A for example going the other way because of FX movement. So bottom line is, it\u2019s all FX movements, but the offset is all sitting down in the net hedge FX line that you\u2019ll see over the rest of the year. So no impact on earnings.","Hamid Moghadam","Okay, great. I think that was the last question. So let me summarize the key takeaways from this call. First and foremost, even though we didn\u2019t really talk about it that much, we had pretty good earnings in the first quarter, we are pleased with it and we think it\u2019s going to continue to get better throughout the year.","But let me just go back to the merger, which is now almost four years ago. We worked very hard to realign our portfolio with our investment strategy, to strengthen our balance sheet, to create a very attractive currency, through our OP unit structure and to form really strong relationships with strategic sources of capital. That was a lot of hard work, but I think that hard work has now positioned us to be a very efficient and effective acquirer of assets. And the platform is scaled to a level that we can do that with no or minimal incremental additions to our overhead. So we are very excited about that.","Thank you for participating in our call, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Tracy Ward. Tracy, you may begin.","Tracy Ward","Thanks, Cynthia and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2017 conference call. The supplemental document is available on our Web site at prologis.com under Investor Relations. This morning, we\u2019ll hear from Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover results and guidance and Hamid Moghadam, our Chairman and CEO, who will comment on the Company\u2019s strategy and outlook. Also, joining us for today\u2019s call are Gary Anderson, Chris Caton, Mike Curless, Ed Nekritz, Gene Reilly, and Diana Scott.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I\u2019d like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry, in which Prologis operates, as well as management\u2019s beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings.","Additionally, our second quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO, EBITDA and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures and in accordance with Reg G we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. ","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom, and we\u2019ll get started.","Tom Olinger","Thanks, Tracy. Good morning, and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. I\u2019ll cover the highlights for the quarter, provide updated 2017 guidance and then turn the call over to Hamid. We had another strong start with core FFO of $0.84 per share, which included net-promote income of $0.18. Net promote income came in above our guidance due to higher real estate values in our USLF portfolio, as well as $4 million promote from our FIBRA that was not in our forecast. Core FFO, excluding promotes of $0.66 per share, up $0.03 sequentially, driven by same-store NOI growth. We leased almost 47 million square feet during the quarter and have just 4% of the portfolio rolling in the second half of the year as our customers are securing space well before their leases expire.","As we\u2019ve discussed on previous calls, our strategy has been to push rents to maximize overall lease economics. And as a result, occupancy could decline modestly. Our operating results reflect this strategy. Global occupancy at the end of the quarter was 96.2%, a sequential decrease of 40 basis points. Market rent growth exceeded our expectations, which help drive our share of net effective rent change on rollover to a record 24%. The U.S. was 29%, the sixth consecutive quarter above 20%. Our share of net effective same-store NOI growth was 4.6%, primarily driven by releasing spreads. U.S. led the way with growth of 5.2%.","Moving to capital deployment for the quarter. Development starts were the highest quarterly level in the last several years at approximately $900 million. Margins on both starts and stabilizations continue to be very good at over 20%. Dispositions and contributions are on track as buyer interest remains strong and cap rates continue to compress. Recall, we\u2019ve been focused on streamlining our ventures into fewer more profitable vehicles. I\u2019d like to discuss two transactions that further this initiative and highlight our unique ability to source capital through this business.","First, as previously announced, we entered into an agreement to acquire the remaining partner\u2019s interest in our Brazil platform for approximately $360 million; second, after quarter end, we contributed $2.8 billion in U.S. assets from our former NAIF fund to USLF at stabilized cap rate of 5.4%. This valuation was structured to be consistent with the buyout of the remaining NAIF investor in the first quarter of this year. Investor interest was very strong and USLF raised over $950 million from 14 new and existing investors to fund this transaction.","We received cash proceeds of $720 million and additional units valued at $1.2 billion, which increased our interest in USLF from 14% to 27%. Our current ownership leaves us with another $1.3 billion of built-in liquidity as we redeem our position down over time to our long term target of 15%.","Turning to capital markets. We continue to access debt globally at very attractive rates. We completed $2.9 billion of financing activity with the vast majority denominated in sterling and yen. As a result of this activity, we extended our term, lowered our rate and increased our U.S. dollar net equity. Leverage, following the USLF transaction, was approximately 25% on market capitalization basis and debt to adjusted EBITDA with gains was less than 4.5 times. Our balance sheet has never been stronger with liquidity of $3.7 billion and significant built-in capital from future co-investment rebalancing. As a result, we're extremely well positioned to self-fund our future deployment for the foreseeable future.","Moving to guidance for 2017 which I will provide on an our share basis. We're increasing the midpoint and nearing the range of our year-end occupancy forecast to be between 96.5% and 97%. We now expect same-store NOI growth for the year to be approximately 5%. Cash same-store NOI growth should be over 6% for the year as a lag from longer lease terms and steeper rent bumps begins to close. Given the increase in market rents, our in-place leases are now under rented by 13% globally and 17% in the U.S. This further builds our organic earnings potential and will drive strong NOI growth for the next several years. Given continued strong demand from customers, we're increasing our starts guidance by $200 million to range between $1.8 billion and $2.1 billion, built-to-suits will comprise about 45%.","We're also increasing our disposition and contribution guidance by $250 million in total. Full year deployment guidance excludes the contributions to USLF and the planned acquisition of our partner\u2019s interest in Brazil. Our strategic capital net promote income will be $0.16 for the full year as we have no other promotes scheduled for the remainder of 2017. Again, I want to highlight there'll still be a difference in the timing of promote revenue and its related expenses. We will recognize $0.02 of additional promote expenses over the balance of this year.","Putting this all together, we're increasing our 2017 core FFO by $0.05 at the midpoint and nearing the range between $2.78 and $2.82 per share. The main drivers of our guidance increase includes $0.03 from higher promotes and $0.02 from core operations. Our revised guidance, excluding promotes, represents year-over-year increase of 9% at the midpoint. To wrap up, we had a great quarter and are entering the second half of the year with strong momentum.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Hamid.","Hamid Moghadam","Thanks, Tom and good morning, everyone. I'd like to spend my time with you today sharing my perspective on the current state of the industry and trends that will affect its future. Market conditions in the U.S. continue to be very strong. We remain vigilant in monitoring potential risks to development starts and oversupply. During the first quarter, we called out several markets with elevated construction starts. But this trend did not continue into the second quarter.","On the margin, we\u2019re now even more positive on fundamentals. We're hoping our 2017 forecast as net absorption is constrained by the lack of available space, but we're slightly increasing our expectations for both supply and demand in 2018 when the higher volume of completions will offer more space for customers to absorb. Supply and demand will effectively offset one another and we expect to remain at historic low levels of vacancy. As we discussed at the outset of 2017, we expect that the rate of market rent growth to moderate as the rent cycle matures, and the difference in performance between the best coastal markets and the rest of the country to expand.","Our forecast is proven to be too conservative as record low vacancies mean customer have limited alternatives. We see increased activity from our customers and a greater willingness to pay up for quality spaces and locations. Our initial forecast for 2017 called for market rent growth in the U.S. of 4%. Instead, rent growth is on pace to approach 8% this year, driven primarily by high barrier coastal markets, such as New Jersey, Los Angeles, Seattle and the same Cisco Bay area, where we have dominant market positions. Outside the U.S., market conditions are also favorable and the institutional capital continues to chase logistics product, driving cap rates to all-time lows.","On the operating side, notwithstanding the quirky quarterly end occupancy stats which doesn\u2019t reflect the additional 450 basis points of leasing we've already completed, Asia remains in line with our expectations. Europe experienced record net absorption and we\u2019ve seen surprisingly limited development starts on the continent. The election result in France is constrictive for economic expansion, which is expected to read nice growth. The UK is the one market that has called slightly and it's coming on several years of exceptional fundamental. Recently, I\u2019ve been fielding many questions on drivers of demand for our product and would like to offer a few observations. I think of demand in three categories; consumption, cyclical and structural.","Historically, our business has been highly correlated with consumption and serving basic daily needs as populations grow. This includes categories such as consumer products, food and beverage and apparel. These segments will continue to expand in line with population growth, shifting demographics and consumer confidence. Requirements for our space are also driven by spending on segments that are more closely tie to economic cycles, like residential construction and autos. Logistics space needed for residential construction will increase as the housing recovery accelerates.","Housing starts still need to rise by 30% to normalize to a level consistent with population growth. By contrast, we're keeping a close eye on the auto segment as declining sales may dampen growth. Net-net, the changes in housing and autos should be a positive for demand. The remaining drivers are structural and involve fundamental changes in the way businesses operate. E-commerce will remain the most significant of these drives as shopping habits continue to shift online, and will be future energized by millennials for entering their peak spending years.","We do, however, expect that the 3x multiplier on demand from e-commerce, that we\u2019ve identified in our research, will decline overtime as customer become more efficient and online sales cannibalize some of the space required by bricks-and-mortar retailers. Lastly, I want to highlight healthcare as a potential new structural driver in the future. We expect its category, which currently represents only 4% of our space, to grow as baby boomers age.","In closing, I feel great, even better than last quarter, about the trends that will drive ongoing demand for logistic space located close to end customers. Our portfolio and strategy will further bolster our performance.","With that, let me now turn it over for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Craig Mailman with KeyBanc. You may begin.","Craig Mailman","Maybe if we could hit some of your commentary on leasing and rent growth here. Maybe if you could just give us a little bit of color, where you are seeing tenant spike for spaces at only in infill locations, or is it more like Inland Empire market? And then maybe you could also address the 3X multiplier decline there. Is that a function of some of these ecommerce guides Whole Foods, Amazon type deal where they\u2019re just going to buy brick-and-mortar, and do more of a hybrid model over there?","Hamid Moghadam","Let me take the last part of your question first, and then I'll turn it over to Eugene and Gary to talk about the first part. The 3X is coming down really for three reasons, one, their infrastructure is going in for us. So obviously, there is a lot of space demand. And then the sales are going to follow. So the online customers are squeezing more volume through the warehouses and they\u2019re getting more efficient in how they use their footprints. There are also technologies emerging that are going to make returns smaller, as smaller portion of returns better fit, better sizing, et cetera, et cetera. We\u2019ve talked about that, obviously, virtual reality and augmented reality are two big ones that overtime will affect the return ratio. So those are two biggies.","Also, when you get the 3X expansion of ecommerce, you were getting cannibalization on the bricks-and-mortar end. So you have the offset of the 1X happening at little bit later and with a delay. So I think overtime it is likely for that 3X to end up being somewhere in the low 2s, but that\u2019s going to be a decade long process. So still very positive, still any multiple bigger than one is a strong tailwind, and we think it's going to stay way above two, and it's going to take a long time to gravitate that.","Now, let me turn over to Eugene and Gary.","Eugene Reilly","So on the rent growth question, in the U.S., we have pricing power in lot of markets. In fact, we have pricing power in most. And most U.S. markets are in 6% vacancy range or lower, and that\u2019s where your pricing power is. But clearly, the global coastal markets, as mentioned in the preliminary remarks, are leading that. And to give you a sense of it, the first half of this year leasing rent growth in those markets at nearly 7% just in the first half of the year. And they all trend towards 10% the year. So no question, more power there and good example of the L. A. County that\u2019s a billion square feet of real-estate that has about 1%, so tremendous pricing power.","Gary Anderson","And then in terms of the markets, I'll discuss on Europe real quick. The Northern European markets are very strong, Germany, the Netherlands, the UK is still quite strong. Candidly, I would say that companies are starting to compete for space on a broad base basis across Europe. It's one of the strongest markets that I've seen in quite a while. Market vacancy rates across Europe have dropped to 5.6%. They've got a down wheel on them as we approach the back half for the year. So we're now in a position where we're actually pushing rents. So our own portfolio is performing well. We\u2019re over 96% occupied and rate change is starting to come through positively in almost every market. So it's a very good story.","Operator","And our next question comes from Dan Occhionero with Barclays. You may begin.","Dan Occhionero","Two question. Number one, can you just touch on the strategic rationale behind increasing your exposure in Brazil? And secondly, could you just elaborate a little bit more on the difference between leased and commenced occupancy in Europe and Asia, and what specifically drove that?","Hamid Moghadam","So let me talk about the strategy for Brazil. Nothing new that we, like the Brazil market, that there\u2019s long-term fundamentals. It's been a tough two years, following three or four years of excellent performance, two years of slowdown. We think it's a great entry point into Brazil in terms of doubling down. The currency is very attractive and fundamental are kind of at the bottom of the market. And the political change that they went through and the rule of law and it worked, and that's pretty unusual in many countries. I was going to say Latin America, but may I'll drop the Latin point and just talk about America.","So I don\u2019t know, I just think that in terms of entry point, it's very attractive. We wanted to control the platform also because eventually we\u2019re going to recapitalize it. And we need to own 100% of it. So for a variety of reasons, this was a good time to try to accomplish this objective. Gary, you want to talk about\u2026","Gary Anderson","On the leased occupied spread in Europe, there is not a big new story that we\u2019re sitting at 96.2% occupied and got a 60 basis points spread to for a lease percentage. So typically, you would see some upward movement in occupancy with that greater spread. The real news is in Asia, particularly Japan. If you look at page 16 of our supplemental and you see the Japan today is 92% occupied, but 96.1% leased, that's more than 10 basis points spread. And the story is a simple one. We had a single 1.2 million square foot building, a speculative building that we leased but the tenant had not occupied the building before it moved into the operating pull from the development to the operating pool. So you should expect not only the Japan occupancy to tick up in the third quarter but all of Asia above 95%, so no real big news there.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. You may begin.","Ki Bin Kim","Could you just talk a little bit more about your development pipeline? I noticed a bigger percentage point to expect, I know it's just one quarter and not really a trend but I wondering if you could comment on that. And tied to that, I noticed the development yield is coming down little bit further across the regions.","Mike Curless","You hit on a key point there, development stars relative to those is definitely very lumpy, 77% in the first quarter, 35% in the second. Over the year, that 45% as Tom mentioned, that\u2019s indicative of where we see this heading for the year. And in terms of yields, we focused on margins and you see our margins in the 20% range. And through the first half of the year and through the balance of the year, those might normalize a bit into the high teens as we chew through some of the less expensive land. But we feel pretty good about those margins.","Operator","And our next question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi. Your may begin.","Manny Korchman","Can I just go back to your commentary, and realizing that things are outperforming your expectations; what has sort of changed in the 12 weeks since we last spoke that you\u2019d go from talking about oversupply in a few key markets to, no it's not really oversupply anymore. By the way, we think you\u2019re delivering some continue, and not only that we\u2019re going to increase our starts and the proportion of those starts is going to remain 55% spec. So how do we put that all together over the course of time since we last spoke?","Hamid Moghadam","Nothing about supply that I talked about last quarter has changed. You will see a rise in supply in the first quarter in those markets that I indicated on the last call. So that elevated level of starts that we saw will translate into those projects that were started, hitting the market in the first quarter of next year, that remains. What has changed is that that elevated level of starts did not continue in the second quarter. The level of deliveries in the second quarter was actually in a little bit lower than the norm, in line with norm but little bit lower than the norm. So that\u2019s pretty easy to put together.","With respect to our rent expectations, we call them as we see them. I mean we went into the year thinking that after multiple-year of almost double-digit growth and the rents nearing replacement cost that it was prudent to be banking on less rental growth, and that\u2019s what we indicated in our internal planning. The reality is that in the markets, particularly the coastal markets, it\u2019s becoming very, very difficult to get built in the space. And remember the buildings are getting bigger, much bigger in the cycle. These buildings require lot of land, transportation areas are getting bigger. So all of a sudden, it is very hard to find flat large sites in these large metro areas, and that\u2019s driving pricing power, because product that already exists there is becoming very scarce. So again, we see them as we call them. And it could be back here next quarter, talking about higher or lower rental growth. We don\u2019t have a perfect crystal ball.","Operator","And our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. You may begin.","Steve Sakwa","I guess just sort of follow up on that. I mean, if supply and demand are roughly in equilibrium next year and the vacancy rate, I think, is probably getting closer with 20 or low. Is there any reason to think that rent growth next year wouldn\u2019t look very similar to rent growth in \u201917? And I guess secondly, I noticed the occupancy drop in Japan. I am just wondering if I missed any comments on that. Could you just touch on that? Thanks.","Hamid Moghadam","The occupancy drop in Japan is a blip, the quirky number in the other quarter. We\u2019ve actually leased that vacancy of a building that came online and the lease is signed, but it doesn\u2019t hit the occupancy statistics till next quarter. So that number, if we were reporting here, that would be 450 basis points higher. And as Gary said, the occupancies in Asia are going to be north of 95%. So don\u2019t even spend a moment on that one. I don\u2019t know what rents are going to be. It's kind of like predicting the stock market to a certain extent.","I think all I\u2019m telling you is that the momentum is really good and we are feeling -- we were good last quarter. I got tired of every quarter saying this is the best quarter in my career. And I\u2019m just saying I am even feeling much better than the way I felt last quarter. And the interesting thing about all of this is that with every passing quarter, we have leases that are expiring that were signed at the bottom of the downturn. So you would expect that our mark-to-market would shrink.","But given the pace of rents accelerating, our mark-to-market is expanded actually and that expanded mark-to-market not only means that rents are strong today, but it means that the recovery, the glide path for the next three or four years looks really, really positive as we absorb those mark-to-markets. So I think the runway has been certainly extended and somewhat elevated, whether it will continue to get more and more elevated, we\u2019re just going to have to wait. But we\u2019re feeling pretty good.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. You may begin.","Jamie Feldman","Tom, going back to your comments, so I think you had said cap rates continue to compress across markets. Can you give more color on where you\u2019re still seeing that and what\u2019s driving it? And then also, can we expect to see more large-fund transactions in the future, like Brazil and the North American one that we saw?","Hamid Moghadam","Let me take that last one. You know that our goal is to get to down to one open-end fund in every major region, and we have two in Europe. So that will be a good place to look, not for certain, but that\u2019s the one that have rationalization I see. Tom, you want to take\u2026","Tom Olinger","On the cap rates, we\u2019re seeing cap rate, I\u2019d say, modestly decline in the U.S. probably 10 basis much lower Q1 to Q2; probably expect similar levels in Europe but given some transactions that we expect to close; in the third quarter, we would certainly expect Europe more expansion and contraction start in Europe in the second half of the year; in Japan, given some pending transactions as well, we would expect top rates to continue to go lower; and with our other pending transactions that are rumored to be potentially closing in third quarter; in Asia, I think it would also be another strong indication of compressing values for assets, but I\u2019d also say how asset management business get valued.","Hamid Moghadam","Well, let's be specific on that. I mean logically we\u2019re basically traded at about 10% to 12% higher than what our internal carrying value for, once adjusted for quality and location to our own internal portfolio. And that leads to in a quarter roughly of NAV increase. We and you are looking for more details on the GLP transaction. But the couple of estimates that were out there on this trade were at 260. Actually that\u2019s their IFRS carrying value on their portfolio, which is mark-to-market and the rumored price is 330, something. So there is a 30% difference there in valuation.","So I'm not saying that -- we don't have perfect visibility in business transactions, but those bode very well for values outside the U.S. So the cap rate compression issues are much greater or the compressions are greater outside the U.S. than they are inside.","Tom Olinger","Jamie, one thing I just would add. What's really driving the compression, particularly in the U.S., is rent growth. And I think given the trajectory of rent growth, higher rents, higher rents are causing valuations to go up and cap rates the cost of that for higher growth expectation.","Operator","And our next question comes from Nick Yulico with UBS. You may begin.","Nick Yulico","Just looking at your re-leasing spread on a cash basis is highest you've reported this cycle. And you talked about rent growth being even better in the U.S. this year now on track for 8%. So hoping you could give a little bit of perspective on how your mark-to-market spread might look for remainder of this year and even heading into next year?","Tom Olinger","So if you're talking about mark-to-market for rents, basically where we are right now looking at our re-leasing spreads, if rent is growing market rents are growing more than 4% or 5% that spread will expand. And that's what we saw in the first half of the year and that's opposite of what we expect. So this year for sure, it'll stay where it's at and maybe expand a little bit. But that's a bit of a threshold that I want to keep 4% or 5% in excess of that you're going to see the mark-to-market.","Hamid Moghadam","Our mark-to-market in the U.S. has gone from 15% to 17%. The overall has gone from 12% to 13%, 14% today as we sit. If those trends continue, it could approach 15% as we crossed into 2008.","Operator","And our next question comes from Sumit Sharma with Morgan Stanley. You may begin.","Sumit Sharma","Hamid, to your comments on the 3X number, I agree, I think it should over time tend to go down just as the supply chain models achieve greater operating leverage. But what caught my attention was you said returns would be one of the variables that bring it down slightly. I guess if returns are just 30% of ecommerce gross merchandize volumes, and my sense was this was always on the fringes of the supply chain with facilities being located away, more labor, everything that points to a sleepy corner of warehouse land. I'm struggling to understand how this materially moves the demand variable, or did I misread your comment?","Hamid Moghadam","No, I think the returns are very space intensive, because the inventory needs to be accepted unpacked, restocked and all of that is labor intensive and space intensive. So as technologies allow fit to get better, particularly with the apparel, I think returns are going to go down and that on the margin will affect the amount of the space in the warehouse that's devoted to handling returns. So that's really what's going on. But that's a very long process. I mean some of these technologies I'm talking about don't really exist today, or they exist in very limited ways.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Guinee with Stifel. You may begin.","John Guinee","Great, okay\u2026","Hamid Moghadam","Let me just say that that was absolutely the best rendition John that I've ever heard.","John Guinee","Tracy is going to allow me two questions I'm sure. Refresh my memory, Hamid, have you turned 60 yet, because your stock just did?","Hamid Moghadam","Unfortunately, I lost that bet. I\u2019ve turned 60 about nine months ago.","John Guinee","And then second, Tom, your revised net earnings estimates about 280 a share. Are you able to shelter all those gains via 1031s, or would we expect your $1.76 dividend to increase, one way or another?","Tom Olinger","No, we do not expect any special dividends we can shelter that income. The big increase that you're seeing in our EPS guidance is the expected gain, book gain on the USLF transaction, that\u2019s about $0.87. But we can defer that gain, because the vast majority of that gain, we sold down roughly a third part of the $2.8 billion we put in there. So the other is just basis switching out from direct ownership to indirect ownership. So that gets sheltered.","Hamid Moghadam","But I think the gist of your question is still valid. It is not a piece of cake to manage or dividend around here. We\u2019re devoting more and more time on deferral strategies, 1031s and all that. I'm not a big fan of special dividends, but we try to make our dividend policy to be pretty stable, reliable and consistent as it's been in last couple of years.","Operator","And our next question comes from Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. You may begin.","Blaine Heck","Just wanted to touch on the increase in development start guidance. Hamid, given what you're seeing with higher than expected rent growth and also what's on the horizon is our supply and demand dynamics are concerned. Do you think this case of starts that you're guiding to this year is sustainable into next year, or do you think this is likely to be the peak level for you guys?","Hamid Moghadam","I think in the depths of the downturn or shortly thereafter in 2010-2011 time frame we had an Analyst meeting in New York and at that time that\u2019s even before the merger, we said that the responsible level of starts given our global platform is going to be between $2 billion and $3 billion depending on the day in the cycle. And that\u2019s been where we\u2019ve been, sometimes it's in the low 2s now it's approaching mid to high 2s. We make the development decisions from a bottoms up opportunities identified in the marketplace.","We do not sit around this table with the executive team and say, we will drive to, I don\u2019t know, $3 billion of starts. I think that approach was tried in previous cycles and what shows in that be a very successful way of doing developing. So bottoms up, deal-by-deal and they have to pass a very rigorous test for market conditions and competitive set and the like. So that\u2019s a long winded answer. I don\u2019t really know what development starts are going to be next year, but we\u2019ll have a better idea of when we rollout guidance towards the end of this year. Mike, if I were going to guess, I would say it would be between 2 in the quarter until now. It\u2019s really tough to find win in some of these markets.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. You may begin.","Michael Carroll","Can I also, the last question, look like the Company is being a little bit more aggressive starting projects outside of the U.S. with about half of the deals in Europe and Asia year-to-date. Is there anything to read into that?","Hamid Moghadam","In the last 15 years, this is a little secret of our business. Two thirds of our starts have been outside the U.S. and about 75% of our value creation has been outside the U.S. And I just am amazed that I get questions about why you\u2019re global, because we make a lot of money developing outside the U.S. There is no logistic supply chain much smaller than the U.S., so the opportunities and the run way is actually pretty big outside the United States.","Gary Anderson","Just to add, I would say, the markets are very tight. And if you look at the first half of the year for us in Europe, we started 11 buildings -- we started 13 buildings, 11 of them were built-to-suits. So there\u2019s just not space available for our customers so were having to build it. And I would say in China the market dynamics are good for speculative in Japan we\u2019re doing more built-to-suit as well. So it's a pretty well fostered strategy, I would say.","Hamid Moghadam","Probably what I\u2019d point out is that while there was a quite a bit of international activity this quarter, the long term next several years that has end up at 45% Americas, 25% in Europe and 30% in Asia, which is pretty consistent with our vision 2020 long view. So give you a perspective on how that looks over the long haul.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Mueller with J. P. Morgan. You may begin.","Michael Mueller","Real quick one, back at Brazil for a second. Can you comment on what the pricing was at a buyout? And I guess that the plan is to ultimately recapitalize it anyway, whether the partner that wanted to sell or can you just give us a little more color on that?","Hamid Moghadam","The partner, I don\u2019t think it really wanted to sell, but their primary focus is on their other businesses, retail and office. And I'll let them speak for their strategies, their reasons for selling. We see the opportunity as a really good opportunity, and so did they. But they also see significant opportunities in the other sectors where they can execute better. So also the strategy of recapitalizing Brazil, we\u2019ve talked about this for a number of years. And it's consistent with what we\u2019ve done in China and in other platforms in terms of really building a private or public capital vehicle for owning assets long term, particularly in markets where currency hedging and the like are difficult and the debt markets are not very developed. So we want to manage our currency exposure as well. So all of those things will lead you to a strategy of controlling the platform and then recapitalize it. Tom?","Tom Olinger","Michael to your question, so from a yield perspective think about cap rates for operating assets, stabilized operating assets, cap rates for the nine in front of it. We also acquired land as part of this. So I think the yield on combined basis for the four investments we will make is going to have a seven in front of it. And when you think about total NOI from Brazil going forward after we close on this last transaction for Brazil, we\u2019ll be around 2% of our NOI our share.","Hamid Moghadam","Yes, I just wanted to be clear, that seven is a combination of operating assets at the nine and then construction in progress and then land inventory. So all of it blend in together, including non-income producing assets are in the seven, one other thing that I would just mention, because it's related to your question. Although not probably directly, the ability for Prologis to source capital around the world and match it with investment opportunities around the world, it's pretty unique because if you would look at the quarter, we bought out our business, our partner in Brazil and we source capital in the UK.","Now, within those two things that fund each other directly, because we manage obviously each debt and asset and liability in each country to manage our currency but if you really think about it, we were able to borrow money in the 2s before for a dozen years in the UK and deploy it in the 9s in Brazil at what we believe to be a pretty low point in the currency. We\u2019re not in the currency speculation business, but it's certainly a lower point than the past couple of years in the cycle. I think that's a pretty unique platform that allows you to do that. And I'm not sure that's totally appreciated out there.","Operator","And our next question comes from Eric Frankel with Green Street. You may begin.","Eric Frankel","Just two quick questions, one is regarding the NAIF recapitalization and contribution to the U.S. logistic funds. The 5.4% cap rate I would assume that's significantly higher than our overall U.S. portfolio. Can you just provide maybe a mix of global and regional markets for that portfolio? And then second, can you explain in accounting terms the difference between your GAAP or you GAAP same-store NOI growth and recapturing high growth? Thank you.","Eugene Reilly","I can give you a sense of the cap rate. So that cap rate is at appraised value cap rate, because that was our deal for buying the last tranche of NAIF. And our deal with new investors was that they'll get the same pricing and we turn that around in like 120 days by the way. So let me just take -- I think this is what you\u2019re looking for. So this cap rate is 5.4%, the apples-to-apples cap rate at the same time of USLF is 5.1%, and the apples-to-apples cap rate for all of Prologis is 5.3%. All of those cap rates are now 20 bps, 30 bps lower something like that. As far as the -- I can't give you a market-by-market breakdown, but NAIF has much more exposure to regional market versus global markets than USLF and so that explains. Hopefully, that answers your question.","Gary Anderson","Eric, on the net effective versus cash same-store NOI, if you just think about over the last several years, we've been building occupancy and rents have been growing significantly. And concessions have been coming down. However, we have been building a significant amount of free rent up over the last several years, because we're signing much higher dollar value leases, concessions are less, longer leases as well. So they are not on the free rent that we have been building up that\u2019s been growing pretty significantly.","Now that we\u2019re in a period where occupancy is pretty consistent year-over-year for sure we\u2019ll be there in the second half, as well as the length of our leases are now pretty consistent. We start to see that build-up of free rent online so that significantly starts to add to your cash same-store NOI. So if you just think about having a three-year lease with straight line rent of one month in every year and now you sign a five-year lease and you have half of year straight line rent per year, the nominal amount of your free rent in that five year lease is going to be bigger, so you'll see a hit when that lease rolls. But once you burn through that, your cash growth comes up significantly. So that is what\u2019s happening. I think you\u2019re going to see the same dynamic happen into \u201918. So when we talk about whatever our same store growth is for \u201918, net effective, you should expect to see cash same store above that.","Hamid Moghadam","Let me just add one thing to what these guys said. When the cash was lower than GAAP, you heard from us many times that really that is what you need to pay attention to, because that\u2019s closer to effective rents. Let me say that when cash is greater than GAAP, that\u2019s still same answer still holds. We pay a lot more attention to GAAP around here. We really provide the cash number, because you guys want it but we run our business based on effective rents.","Operator","And our next question comes from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Your may begin.","Vincent Chao","I know we spent a lot of time talking about market rent growth, but just curious, I mean, it seems that your customers should be at all time high in terms of cost of occupancy. I know it\u2019s not a huge percentage of their business. But is there any benchmark that we need to be thinking about in terms of how far rent growth could go? And then maybe as a coruler to that question, last quarter, you talked about customer retention, which was a little bit lower. Just to make sure you are pushing rents as much as you can, and they were up a little bit here in the second quarter. Is it safe to assume that you haven\u2019t quite found that leading edge of rents pushing rents?","Hamid Moghadam","Let me answer your question this way. We had a leadership meeting around here, and we track the reasons why we don\u2019t retain a customer; they wanted too much space; we didn\u2019t have space to accommodate them; they wanted to shrink; they went out of business; so like four or five standard reasons why customers don\u2019t renew. One of them you would think would be because they found space cheaper down the street from somebody else. We could not find one example of that in that quarter. That tells me when we\u2019re pushing rents hard enough.","So that we started really, really pushing rents on the margin, because until you start -- by the way, if you love our customers and don\u2019t want to lose our customers. But I mean if we\u2019re retaining all the customers that can be retained, that means we\u2019re not testing the edges of rent growth. And we\u2019re beginning to do a better job of that. I wouldn\u2019t say it's perfect yet. But the pricing pay for that is that your retention rate on the margins is going to come down a little bit. That is totally a price we\u2019re willing to pay.","Gary Anderson","And Vincent to your first question on, are we at prior peak rents in some markets. Yes, we are. That was a decade ago. We are 35 % below the last market peak inflation adjusted that\u2019s a point. So in terms of -- the price of everything else has gone up, but the customers have had a tremendous bargain for the last 20 years because cap rate compression has given a bargain on rents at the cost of the capital market. So they\u2019ve got long ways to go before they reach real term rents even forget about the peak, but even going back to 1980, real rents are way, way down. So I think this could be a longer term phenomena. But I don\u2019t want to speculate about it.","Operator","And our next question comes from Richard [indiscernible] with Baird. You may begin.","Unidentified Analyst","You touched about it at the beginning of the call, but I wanted to dig in a little further on the Amazon acquisition of Whole Foods and any potential impacts on their requests for industrial space. As your largest customer, have you seen any changes in their request for the specific specifications in the industrial building? And are there any asks of them where you put your foot down and say no, we\u2019re not going to go there. And secondly, how far are you willing to move down the supply chain to the nearest mile-delivery facility in order for them to accomplish some of their same day 2-hour delivery objectives?","Mike Curless","Richard, with respect to the Whole Foods acquisition, we view that as a real positive for industry reinforces the strategy of getting close to your customers, which clearly we\u2019ve been doing for some time. So I think that\u2019s a good thing in general. And we see them getting more and more active in this business as they compete with major players in this field, namely Walmart and this activity should pick-up and resolve in more activity for logistic players like ourselves and others.","In terms of working on, here implication is every single Amazon requirement out there we\u2019re very selective on when we work with them. The buildings that end up being a little bit more specialized, we look at selling those. But by enlarge most of business we do with Amazon is in our generic buildings, it\u2019s very releasable and it\u2019s based that we feel like we can use very well. In terms of going down to the last mile, our buildings that could fit in that requirement in our infill location, certainly, are good candidates for that and we will pursue those opportunities as they come up.","Hamid Moghadam","Our strategy to go infill multi-story intensify these sites that we\u2019re executing on in Seattle, as you know, the Francisco Bay Area and New York with the former ABC Carpet business, all of those are multi-story buildings are in attempt to get closer to the customer and take advantage of intensification of urban land, which is very scares. So that\u2019s going to happen whether Amazon leases those buildings or somebody else does, we\u2019ve seen a lot of demand for those types of facilities, modern facilities.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jon Peterson with Jefferies. You may begin.","Jon Peterson","So you guys made some comments that you\u2019re pushing rents harder which is why occupancy tick down a bit this quarter. So I think I also heard Hamid note that the quarter end occupancy number was quirky, and you\u2019ve already seen 450 basis points of leasing in the third quarter. So I\u2019m trying to put those comments together and figure out whether we should expect occupancy is trending higher or lower, what the magnitude is, and what exactly the 450 basis points of leasing mean?","Hamid Moghadam","The 450 is singing one lease in one building that came online, following its stabilization period that was only 10% leased, that\u2019s now 95% leased. And it's only 4.5% increase in Asia. It's just one building in Japan.","Mike Curless","So that was the quirky comment.","Hamid Moghadam","Yes, that was quirky. Maybe I should have used better terminology. In terms of our overall strategy, particularly in the U.S. and to a lesser extent in Europe, you should expect our retention to trend down and our occupancy on the margin to trend down a little bit, maybe 100 basis points and our rental growth to be higher than it would have been, as we manage 96%, 97% occupancy and not pushing rents that hard.","Mike Curless","But it\u2019s not a perfect sign. And certainly, the numbers from quarter-to-quarter and move around, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do. What we\u2019re trying to do is be tougher on rents. By the way, no matter how tough we are on rents, we can\u2019t charge above market rents. So obviously, these are market rents that tenants are pay. It's just that they're higher than what we thought previously.","Hamid Moghadam","The only comment that I would make with respect to calendar year 2017 is that occupancy probably going to stay relatively flat, certainly going into the fourth quarter and even trend up a bit. And the reason is that we really have very little to lead -- very little role.","Mike Curless","We only have 4% of role.","Hamid Moghadam","So U.S. is more of a long term cadence about where occupancies might go over a period of time.","Operator","And our next question comes from Tom Catherwood with BTIG. You may begin.","Tom Catherwood","Circling back to USLF and the strategic capital business. When it comes to rebalancing your funds, what is the trigger? Are you able to time the rebalancing to match fund new investments, or do we see a gap between rebalancing and putting those funds to work?","Hamid Moghadam","Well, we try to match it with investment needs. I mean, certainly, in a place like USLF is today with 27% ownership and -- by the way it's 27 on a big number, I mean that's a $9 billion fund now. So 27% of that is 12 points higher than our 15% where we want to be. So as opportunities come up and we need the capital that's how we dollar cost average out of that fund. By the way, if people think we know how to top-tick that stuff and be really through to that doing that, we don't. I mean it's much more of a strategically driven decision than valuation driven on the last margin. I mean, generally in the next couple of quarters, we're going to be pulling that capital out. And by the way, there's a lot of demand for people who want to invest in that fund. So I think those two things meet well.","Mike Curless","And mechanically it's within one quarter. We can execute the redemptions on the quarter.","Hamid Moghadam","Yes, from when we want to take a quarter to do it.","Operator","And our next question comes from Craig Mailman with KeyBanc. You may begin.","Craig Mailman","Just one quick follow-up, I'm not sure I'm thinking about this right on same-store here, if only 4% rolling. I mean, can you pull forward a meaningful amount of expirations from '18 to keep the trajectory on same-store on the GAAP base? Or is that the fall off into the back half of the year? And does that just mean that the spread between GAAP and cash widens, or does cash trend down follow it as well?","Tom Olinger","From a same store perspective, as Gary said, we don't have a lot to place to same-store. The really only variable on same-store in the second half is really going to be on the margin with occupancy, that\u2019s what\u2019s still little role each time the vast majority of what's going to get -- what's going to go in service. So that's happening. I think when you think about the same-store in the second half for our midpoint is going to be 4.8%. And when you think about that number that has all rent change. The first half of this year and prior years, we've seen a boost in our same-store from occupancy gains. Occupancies are now leveling off. So it's all about rent change. So when you think about \u201918 rents, same-store should accelerate, because as Hamid said, we have built up in-place to market is -- that gap is wider, which means our rent change on role in '18 is going to be higher than our rent change in role in '17, that's gapping out. So that has to mean our same-store NOI will be higher in '18 than we're going to see in the back half of 2017. So that's really what's going on.","Hamid Moghadam","And surely we will pull some leases into the last quarter of leasing like we always do. By the way, the reason the 4% is 4% is because we've already dealt with a lot of those vacancies that by the way is rolled over, and been additive to that 4%.","Tom Olinger","And so don\u2019t be surprised if you see leasing volume be slower in the second half of the year, because we\u2019re going really from now on, we\u2019re working on 2018 lease renewals.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. You may begin.","Jamie Feldman","Two quick follow ups, one is, looks like you had a spike in turnover cost on leases signed. Can you talk about what happened there during the quarter? And then also you commented that UK market is cold slightly. Can you just talk about expectations for the UK going forward, and what's driving the pull back?","Eugene Reilly","So basically we just had a very high percentage of leases take places in the U.S., the turnover costs are higher. On this metric, I would just point out that over the years, \u201816 to \u201917, our turnover cost as a percentage of the lease value is really how we look at it, has increased. But it's down between 50 and 100 basis points in '14 and '15. So we actually feel pretty good about the trajectory there.","Gary Anderson","Hamid mentioned in his remarks that the UK was moderating a little bit, what is really referencing our market vacancy rates. So if you look at the market vacancy rate today in the UK, it's sitting at 5.9%, that\u2019s pretty good. It's actually fallen 50 basis points from a year ago. But in this specific quarter, it actually backed up by 20 basis points. So we had a light leasing quarter. So that\u2019s really the comment that we're making. What does it mean to our portfolio, literally nothing. We're sitting at about, well, we're sitting at 100% occupancy. Last quarter, we were at 99.5% occupied. We still have long-term leases there, very little role. I candidly wish we had more role because that is one of the markets in Europe where we are significantly under rented to the tune of 10% or 11%. So no bad news for us, but I guess what we\u2019re trying to say is let's watch closely what happens with respect to net absorption in the third quarter and what happens with market vacancy rates in the UK.","Operator","And our last question comes from Sumit Sharma with Morgan Stanley. You may begin.","Sumit Sharma","Hamid, you mentioned it was difficult to acquire land and you mentioned there are challenges of that land and such. So to which I would like to point you to this asset class, called malls. So did you guys -- would you guys buy them all on portfolio falls, or did you buy a mall anyway anytime?","Hamid Moghadam","I think that\u2019s a lot of question. But as you, probably when you were in high school, we actually invested in malls and in the retail sector and in '99 for that business. But all things aside, there is got to be lots of stages of grief between realizations dealing with the changing values. We can\u2019t afford to buy -- first of all, there are lots of good malls and they\u2019ll do well and I don\u2019t want to be negative one really good malls. But there are certainly some power centers and malls that should be there and they\u2019re two anchor malls and they could be great logistics land.","I think the value expectations of the owners and the realities of the economics of our business are pretty far and far. I think it will take a couple of years with those expectations and realities to match up. But I venture before too long. You\u2019ll see some still anchor Class B malls converted into logistics buildings, that is not too farfetched at all and we're definitely looking at some of them.","I think that was the last question. And again, thank you for taking the time to be at our call and we look forward to talking to you in the coming months. Take care.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Prologis' Second Quarter Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Also, please limit yourself to one question. You may rejoin the queue for any follow-up questions. Thank you.","Ms. Tracy Ward, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Tracy A. Ward - SVP-Investor Relations & Corporate Communications","Thanks, Kim, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2016 conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations.","This morning, we'll hear from Hamid Moghadam, our Chairman and CEO, who will comment on the company's strategy and the market environment; Gary Anderson, our CEO of Europe and Asia, who will provide an update on our European and UK businesses; and then from Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover results and guidance. Also joining us for today's call are Mike Curless, Ed Nekritz, Gene Reilly, and Diana Scott.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to state that this call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, and projections about the market, and the industry in which Prologis operates as well as management's beliefs and assumptions.","Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings.","Additionally, our second quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures. And in accordance to Reg G, we have provided reconciliation to those measures.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Hamid, and we'll get started.","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Tracy, and good morning, everyone. We posted another great quarter with positive rent change at almost 18% while maintaining high occupancies. Our core FFO per share grew 15%. Our capital deployment and monetization activities were above expectations as we continued to strengthen our balance sheet.","In our Strategic Capital business, we have ample fresh commitments from investors and are well-positioned to take advantage of any market opportunities that may present themselves. All in all, the last six months have been the best in our company's history.","We understand though that some of you are concerned about our exposure to Europe generally and to the UK specifically. So far, however, the impact of Brexit on our operations has been minimal. Our UK customers serve mostly domestic consumers and we believe the decision to leave the EU will not materially change the buying habits of 65 million people.","We're also confident in our overall European business. E-commerce and supply chain reconfiguration continue as big drivers of demand for our product. The Class A market is where the action is and where our portfolio is focused. Any modest decline in GDP growth would, in all likelihood, be offset by the need to carry slightly higher inventories.","In fact, our only concern in Europe is in Poland where a few merchant developers are overbuilding the market by offering rental incentives of up to 40% and convincing new investors to capitalize artificially inflated headline rents. We don't see this anywhere else in Europe.","Surely, there will be more mixed news coming out of Europe and that will lead to continued market volatility. Whether it's bank failures or constitutional reforms in Italy or elections in France and the Netherlands, we expect policymakers to keep global interest rates lower for longer. In time, this will translate into support for lower cap rates across Europe. We're confident in the resilience of the logistics real estate business, but we remain vigilant and on the lookout for any signs of trouble.","Before we turn the call to Tom, Gary Anderson, our CEO of Europe and Asia will share some on-the-ground facts from our business in Europe. You'll hear from him in a moment.","Elsewhere around the globe, market conditions remain strong and steady. Overall, the supply and demand picture is in great shape, with all time low vacancy rates. Demand is driven by steady growth in consumption, e-commerce and supply chain modernization.","In the U.S. rents are up again sharply and we expect net absorption will again exceed new supply for the year. In Japan, new supply from development is being absorbed and cap rates continue to compress, while occupancy and rents are up in China. Even in our softest market, Brazil, we're 100% leased, but rents there are down about 10% from the peak.","Looking across our markets, we only see a few locations of excess supply, specifically Houston, Columbus and as I mentioned earlier, parts of Poland. In these lower barrier markets, private developers and their institutional capital partners are delivering more product than the market can absorb. Other than these few exceptions, our markets are in very good shape.","In conclusion, we've worked hard to position our company for success and are excited about the prospects for the coming years.","Let me now turn the call over to Gary.","Gary E. Anderson - Chief Executive Officer-Europe & Asia","Thanks, Hamid, and good morning. The European market performed very well in the first half of 2016 with demand outpacing supply. Market vacancy in Europe is currently 6%, down 60 basis points year-over-year and is currently projected to end the year at 5.8%. The Prologis portfolio outperformed the market and delivered some of our strongest results on record.","Occupancy in our European portfolio is 95.6%, up 130 basis points year-over-year and 70 basis points quarter-over-quarter. The UK led all regions at 98.8% occupied and today the 22.4 million square foot operating pool in the UK is 100% leased. Rent change on roll for the quarter totaled 5.1% in Europe with all regions delivering positive results and was led by the UK at 17.6%.","I'd like to turn now to our activity post-Brexit and present simply the facts as we see them on the ground from June 23, the day of the vote, through today. Let's begin with leasing. We've completed 56 transactions in Europe totaling just under 4.9 million square feet with 8% positive rent change. The UK portion is 1.3 million square feet with 24% rent change during that same post-Brexit period.","Demand in Europe still appears to be broad-based and continues to have an emphasis on the automotive and e-commerce sectors. We've completed leases post-Brexit with many names you'll know including DHL, Schneider Electric, Jaguar Land Rover, Marks & Spencer and Alibaba.","Risk associated with our UK NOI has been minimized. Today, the UK portfolio is 100% leased, has a weighted average lease term of eight years, has only 11% of leases expiring over the next 18 months, and has in-place rents that are roughly 10% below market.","Let's now turn to Europe development activity. We've had a very prudent approach to development in Europe with a heavy emphasis on build-to-suit. Today, we have a 6.2 million square foot development portfolio in Europe, which is 60% leased and is approximately 1,000 basis points ahead of our underwriting.","The UK portion of our development portfolio totals 1.9 million square feet and is 850 basis points ahead of our underwriting. We also expect to execute two leases totaling about 570,000 square feet imminently and have good activity on the balance of our UK developments. The only exception is a 317,000 square foot building in London Gateway, where there has been little activity even before Brexit.","Turning to capital markets and building sales. We sold a three building portfolio in the UK during the second quarter and that transaction closed as planned on June 21, two days before the referendum vote. We also began negotiating the sale of \u20ac100 million-plus French portfolio pre-Brexit and concluded discussions on Friday of last week with no change to our pricing. The buyers are now under contract with a 10% non-refundable deposit.","There has also been some non-Prologis activity to report in UK that underscored solid pricing for logistics assets; 103,000 square foot building leased to DHL in Birmingham with a 10-year term closed on July 1 at a 4.8% stabilized cap rate, and another 176,000 square foot building let to Amazon for 10 years in Manchester is expected to close at about the same level in the next few days.","In addition, a UK retail fund has brought a \u00a350 million British Telecom logistics deal to market and has asked that buyers transact in just five working days. There are reportedly more than 10 bidders at about a 5% stabilized cap rate, probably 15 basis points to 20 basis points higher than we would normally expect, but a very small discount when you consider the time scale and lack of due diligence.","Beyond that we're hearing rumors that certain retail funds may bring assets to market to create liquidity and we will monitor those for opportunity. In general, values in the UK are driven by lease length and location, so you shouldn't expect to see any meaningful value change in the Prologis UK portfolio given our current lease length, location and interest rates that are widely believed to be going lower for longer.","Lastly, let's turn to our funds. Values are up 70 basis points this quarter in our European funds on incremental leasing and cap rate compression on the continent, but NAVs are flat to slightly down given the negative impact of lower interest rates on debt mark-to-market and FX.","While we don't expect to see significant investment activity during the summer months, and as a result, we don't expect to see much change in fund values, here is what we can tell you as of today.","Our open-end fund PTELF has a \u20ac400 million equity queue, its largest ever. We have closed $70 million in new equity commitments in PTELF as planned on June 30, again post-Brexit from a Swiss capital source. Our open funds in Europe are approximately 30% levered and our JVs are 0% levered. So, we have plenty of capital to take advantage of the right opportunities should they arise.","On June 30, we had one secondary trade occur in our PEPF II vehicle. It was a \u20ac60 million trade at par between a fund that was expiring and an existing PEPF II investor. The at par trade validates our current fund valuations.","To-date, we have had no formal redemption request, but have heard some noise about two sterling investors with investment totaling about \u20ac45 million that may pursue secondary trades.","So, let me quickly summarize. Leasing volume and rents appear to be holding up well. On the development front, we are significantly ahead of our underwritten lease up, new supply is generally in check, and we expect to maintain a high build-to-suit percentage this year.","While we can't speak to UK office or retail, which have their issues, high quality logistics assets appear to be trading at valuation. And with respect to Prologis funds, we are in great shape with record queues and capacity to take advantage of any opportunities that present themselves.","With that, let me turn it over to Tom to take us through the rest of the quarter.","Thomas S. Olinger - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Gary. For the second quarter, we generated core FFO of $0.60 per share, exceeding our forecast due to be better-than-expected real estate operations and higher asset management fees.","Global occupancy was 96.1% for the quarter, up 70 basis points year-over-year. We set another quarterly leasing record at 49 million square feet, including more than 9 million square feet of development leasing.","Our share of net effective rent change on rollover was 17.8%, led by the U.S. at 23.5%. Our share of same-store NOI increased 6.1% with the U.S. leading the way at 7.5%. This is the last quarter that will be impacted by the burn-off of merger lease intangible amortization. Excluding this impact, our share of same-store NOI growth for the quarter would have been 5%.","For the first half of 2016, development stabilizations were $1.1 billion with an estimated weighted average margin of over 26%. Development starts totaled $658 million with an estimated weighted average margin of over 18%. Build-to-suits comprised almost half of our year-to-date starts. Dispositions and contributions totaled $1.2 billion. In terms of total capital proceeds, we've already closed or have under hard contract about 70% of our original full-year guidance.","Turning to capital markets, our leverage at quarter-end was 37% on a book basis and 30.6% based on market capitalization. Debt-to-EBITDA including gains was 5.6 times. Our liquidity, which we define as our undrawn line capacity and available consolidated cash reached the highest level in our history this quarter.","Turning to guidance now for 2016, I'll just cover the material changes, so for complete detail refer to page five of our supplemental. Due to stronger operating fundamentals, we're increasing our share of same-store NOI range to between 4.75% and 5.25%. In light of our progress year-to-date and investor interest, we're increasing our share of disposition and contribution volume to between $2.3 billion and $2.8 billion, an increase of $300 million at the midpoint.","We will complete an additional ownership rebalancing in our USLF and PTELF ventures for a total of $200 million. This is on top of the $400 million we completed earlier this year. We're also raising the midpoint of our share development starts by $200 million for a range of $1.7 billion to $2 billion. We expect our full year build-to-suit percentage to be higher than the 44% we did last year.","The net results of our deployment changes is that we now expect to generate $1.3 billion of total proceeds in excess of our capital needs, up $300 million from prior guidance. We will use a portion of the net proceeds to retire debt with the balance further building up our cash reserves. We expect to end the year with liquidity at about $4 billion and book leverage overall 35%. Related to FX, our 2016 and 2017 estimated core earnings are fully hedged relative to the U.S. dollar and we've already hedged about half of 2018.","Putting this all together, our 2016 core FFO excluding promotes is higher by $0.03 due to better-than-forecasted operations and fees partially offset by the dilutions from an increase in acceleration of the dispositions, contributions, and fund rebalancing. In other words, core earnings are higher while at the same time significantly increasing our cash reserves.","We expect 2016 core FFO including to promotes to range between $2.52 per share and $2.58 per share maintaining our $2.55 per share midpoint. Our promote range is now $0.14 a share to $0.16 a share, down $0.03 a share at the midpoint. The decline in the promotes is primarily due to negative debt mark-to-market and FX movements from the pound weakening against the euro. The promote midpoint assumes that asset values remain unchanged with June 30 appraisals and FX rates remain at current levels.","To be clear, asset values in Europe have not declined. In fact, the appraised value of our assets in our European ventures increased 70 basis points in the second quarter lead by the UK at a 100 basis points.","To wrap up, we expect continued strong NOI growth as we harvest the gap between in place and market rents. We're maintaining strong double-digit core FFO growth in 2016 while at the same time further strengthening our balance sheet and building liquidity. Our financial position has never been stronger and it will continue to improve by year-end as we generate additional proceeds from net deployment.","With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Jamie Colin Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you. So I guess, Tom, if you could, sticking with the promote, can you maybe talk us through the math of the $0.03 and then how we should think about the risk to promotes going forward, whether it's this specific one or just in the future ones that are maybe scheduled to happen in future years?","Thomas S. Olinger - Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Jamie. So, the decline \u2013 the $0.03 decline from our midpoint again was driven by mark-to-marketed debt just given the low \u2013 very low interest rates in Europe that happened over the quarter we saw a hit to our debt mark-to-market. The other impact was FX as it relates to the sterling and the pound. Clearly, as...","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sterling and the euro.","Thomas S. Olinger - Chief Financial Officer","I'm sorry, sterling and the euro. I'm sorry. So, when you think about values in sterling as they get converted into euro, again, the weakening of the pound against the euro caused the decline. Going forward, the midpoint of the promote range is based on current June 30 valuations. As Gary said, we don't expect any material changes in valuations at all, if anything over time given lower interest rates for longer, we would expect the cap rates to go lower. And we've also \u2013 the midpoint of the promote range assumes FX rates stay at current levels.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sumit Sharma with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Sumit Sharma - Morgan Stanley","Hi, good morning. It's just a question about the development starts. We saw a change or a shift in the U.S. side of the composition of the starts Q-over-Q, and that sort of expected maybe seasonality related. But we also saw an increase in building in China as far as the rest of the world is concerned. Could you comment on whether this is a response to lower spec starts particularly in the UK and in the EU in general? And as a follow-up to China, I guess what should we expect? Should we expect continued shift towards Asia going forward given that the opportunities in this \u2013 one of your strongest UK markets are limited?","Gary E. Anderson - Chief Executive Officer-Europe & Asia","Yeah. Let me take it, it's Gary. First of all, we don't try to adjust one place to other, one geography to the other, we simply take what's given. If there is a good opportunity to develop at a reasonable margin, we'll take it.","With respect to China specifically, we're building a business there really in the four key markets. And we see acceleration in our business on the development front, there is a development business there coming in China. So we perhaps should have singled that we would have seen increasing development starts. It has been building candidly over the last several years. And I would expect to continue to build and China to a point. But again, our focus is going to be only on four key markets in China and we'll take what the market gives us.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz with UBS. Your line is open.","Robert Jeremy Metz - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, guys, maybe one for Tom. Tom, in the past, you've been pretty clear about the longer term goal here is maybe to get to an A rating. So, just wondering, prior commentary was that, you saw NAV right around plus or minus $50. So just given where the stock is today, is there any thought or did you give any thoughts in maybe issuing equity here to help accelerate getting to that A rating versus ramping up the dispositions at this point?","Thomas S. Olinger - Chief Financial Officer","Hey, Jeremy. Yeah. So we believe that our balance sheet existing in our prior plan before we update the guidance, the $1 billion of liquidity, that positioned us as an A rated company. Now we're going to further enhance liquidity, further strengthen our balance sheet this year, have more cash reserves. I am more confident than ever that we have an A rated balance sheet. So, I think we execute against this plan. We will be an A rated company.","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We're not issuing equity.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel with Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.","Eric J. Frankel - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Thank you. This is related to I guess the Brexit campaign. So global trade has significantly slowed over the last several years and there is a lot more protectionist rhetoric coming out of politics. So my question is, give me thoughts on how this global trade slowdown, whether it's through politics or naturally (22:07) warehouse demand for your portfolio over time? And have your customers discussed or made contingency plans in regard to some of these events?","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Global trade, which used to run at about 3x the sum of the domestic GDP has slowed down to about 1.2 times, 1.3 times the size \u2013 the pace of domestic GDP. It's still growing a little bit faster. But as global trade represents a larger and larger percentage of domestic GDP, the math just drives you there. Because when global trade was only 2% of the total GDP, it has a lot of opportunity to grow, but once it's reached the saturation level, it's tough to have a growth at the same level. So part of it is just math and nothing else.","Part of it has to do with definitely protectionism and also some exchange rate considerations that affect the patterns of global trade. If global trade is curtailed which we don't think is going to be the case. We think around every election, there is a lot of talk of protectionism, but people know that the people that want protectionism are the very people that actually get hurt by it in the long term. We think notwithstanding the talk around the election season, it's going to be very little. In fact, we think that TPP (23:39) is going to go forward and maybe create opportunities in the other direction. So \u2013 but let's assume for a moment that we're all wrong and global \u2013 and the politicians will get in the way of global trade. You just have to carry more inventory, because you're not sourcing (23:57) from as many places.","The big driver is \u2013 the big drivers of demand though are consumption fueled by e-commerce and reconfiguration of the supply chain. Those are the real biggies now that global trade has reached the saturation point.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Craig Mailman - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys. Just curious on your views here over the next 12 months to 24 months on the market rent growth, just given the positive supply demand dynamic. And really what you guys see as your ability to push rents before you get too much pushback from tenants. And then separately just we've talked in the past about maybe cap rate compression stabilizing in Europe, and it sounds like now post-Brexit that may not necessarily be the case, and just your views of when rent growth may start to materialize there in a significant manner?","Eugene F. Reilly - Chief Executive Officer-The Americas","Yeah. So, Craig, it's Gene. I will start with the last one, I'm sure Gary will comment on what's happening with Europe. But we basically continue to get more bullish as we get each quarter behind us and we're surprised to the upside and what the fundamentals look like in the U.S., and I would include Mexico in that at this point as well. So I think we are probably talking about a five (25:32) or something next year. And I think we're going to do better than that.","And as I said on the last call, I think equilibrium in the U.S. market is probably sometime in 2017. And again I remind you when we reach equilibrium we'll be at all-time low vacancy rates and you still have plenty of room to push rents. So, I'm probably slightly more bullish than I had been in the past in the U.S.","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, let me add something to that. I mean, we can speculate what market rental growth will be, but the mark-to-market in the leases right now as we said with no further rental growth would be 15%. And if you just assume no further growth from here and you realize that over the next four years, the 15% mark-to-market, that gets you pretty close to 4% same-store growth with zero additional rental growth. So it's not as if it takes a lot of imagination to get to strong same-store growth \u2013 growth numbers in the U.S. the mark-to-market is the driver. Gary?","Gary E. Anderson - Chief Executive Officer-Europe & Asia","Yeah. Just on cap rates, before Brexit we were projecting sort of 15 basis points to 30 basis points over the next 12 months on the continent, relatively flat in the UK. But look, I mean the ECB and the Bank of England are under a lot of pressure. It's widely believe that interest rates are going to go lower, so obviously that has downward implications potentially on cap rates.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","...here in the UK and then Europe and your outlook for cap rates, et cetera. But still maybe in an uncertain environment, I think we can elucidate that's the case. I guess at this point, would you be more inclined to increase your investments in Europe and specifically the UK or decrease at this point?","Gary E. Anderson - Chief Executive Officer-Europe & Asia","We're not looking to decrease \u2013 well, first of all, we didn't hear the first part of your question, but I think based on the last part, I can get the gist of where you're going. Look, our business is just a real estate business, and we're not a hedge fund. We don't make decisions minute-by-minute. This is a long-term business. We got a good allocation, appropriate allocation to Europe. A lot of the stuff is based on long-term prospects for economic and population growth.","If, basically, we are invested the way we are across the world for a reason over time, the only portfolio shift that we imagine has nothing to do with Brexit. We probably want to be a little heavier in Asia and a little lighter in Europe. But fundamentally, our allocations regardless of Brexit are where we want them to be. The big dial that we use in terms of managing our own allocation is our share of our private capital vehicles. That's really the way we manage the business from our capital exposure.","We like our scale in Europe because we're the dominant player there and have the best portfolio. And we really like that market position and what it means in terms of what we can do with customers. So, a long-winded answer of saying that we like our hands. We like our position in the UK. We're willing to \u2013 we think that the UK is going to continue to be the best market in Europe, actually in the next 10 years. It might take a pause in the short term, but the long-term dynamics of it are quite interesting. So, we're good where we are.","Now, if opportunities arise and people start doing stupid things, we would be delighted to take advantage of those things. I don't think it will happen. I think by and large European real estate is in strong institutional hands. There's not a lot of leverage in this system, notwithstanding the headlines that you hear about some of these (29:46) funds.","And there may be pressure by the way on financial center type office buildings in the UK. But in our product type, we think there are more buyers than sellers of the quality of product that we have. So we don't think those distressed opportunities are going to materialize, but if they do, we're prepared to take advantage of it.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel. Your line is open.","John Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","One three-part question. Someone told me a while ago that dividends now matter and we notice that you increased your net income \u2013 net earnings S (30:27) range to a $1.70 per diluted share to $1.90 per diluted share. Talk about what that does for your dividend.","Second part of the question is, are you thinking about any other markets globally given that you've got an abundance of cash?","And then third, can you talk a little bit about land prices in the tighter industrial market and how that's affecting replacement cost rents?","Thomas S. Olinger - Chief Financial Officer","John, I'll take the first one on dividends. Yeah, we did see an increase in our EPS this quarter. It was a combination of two things; one, just higher realized development gains and also just higher disposition activity, what we would call non-development gains, non-FFO gains of operating properties just increasing our disposition activity, that's what's driving that.","No, no change in our dividend, we're happy with where our payout ratio is. Our payout ratio right now based on our AFFO is about 68%. So, we're comfortable with where that is, and we've obviously had extremely good dividend growth over the last several years, but we see the dividend holding where it is this year.","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, John, the dividend has been up 50% over the last, I think two-and-change years, from $1.12 to $1.68. I would be surprised if the dividend rate doesn't grow by multiples of inflation going forward. I think \u2013 we think our FFO growth is going to be pretty strong, and we've got good leverage coming through G&A, which is not growing nearly as fast; it's actually flat compared to our operating earnings. So I think we've got good leverage to grow our dividend above industry rates, pretty clear about that.","We are not planning to go to any new markets. In fact, we're in the process of completing our strategic plan Vision 2020. And in it, it doesn't contemplate going into any new markets. It's totally based on deepening our presence in the markets we're already in.","And with respect to land and replacement costs, I think the land in the U.S. has appreciated quite a bit and I think the constraints on land and its entitlements are significant and will continue to put pressure on some of the most desirable markets in the U.S. like California and Pacific Northwest and Miami and the like, the markets that are supply constrained. I think there's a very little land and very tough to get it entitled. So I think replacement costs, rent numbers are going up and up in the U.S.","I think the land prices have recovered in Europe, but we don't see them zooming ahead, because the rents are still relatively slow growing in Europe. They're growing, but they're much slower growing than the U.S. So, land is recovered, but it's not zooming ahead, in the U.S., land is pretty expensive.","Gary E. Anderson - Chief Executive Officer-Europe & Asia","Yeah. The only other thing that I would add is Asia, it's probably one of the most interesting markets with respect to land. Somebody asked the question earlier about our development volumes in China. And obviously, they're increasing, but each single piece of land that we buy in China, even its phase 2, it's incrementally more expensive than the land that we just acquired right next door. And as a result, you're seeing market rent growth there continue in that 4% to 5% range, depending on what submarket you're talking about.","And in Japan, probably the most expensive land market in the world, and the other thing that's impacting replacement cost rents are construction cost. And our team expect that the back half of this year, we're going to start to see construction cost rise again. As we approach the 2020 Olympics and construction resources become scarce. So, I think, Asia is a pretty interesting place with respect to the land market.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick with Capital One. Your line is open.","Thomas J. Lesnick - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to take a minute to kind of focus on the smaller unit size portion of your portfolio. Roughly, a third of your portfolio is under 100,000 square feet and that also represents the lowest occupancy similar to the portfolio at around 94%. Just wonder if you could provide any update on what you're seeing in terms of tenant health in that segment and trends broadly both in the U.S. and Europe?","Eugene F. Reilly - Chief Executive Officer-The Americas","Yeah. Tom, it's Gene. I'll talk about the U.S. So, this segment as you know, if you've followed us over the last several years has really recovered. I think we are in the high 8s (35:23) for occupancy under 100,000 square feet, coming out of our merger. And now that's 94%, sort of 95% in that range, and you're probably not going to see those size increments move a heck of a lot of higher because you have many more spaces, you have naturally, shorter lease terms and more roll. And I'd say that's pretty full.","In fact, historically, and we could take a look at this. I'm not sure that segment really gets much higher than that. But having said that the demand is good, you're going to see us bouncing around quarter-to-quarter, but demand is good from those tenants. And probably the single most important customer segment is homebuilding, and that really hasn't returned. If it does perhaps it pushes a little bit more. But we're not concerned about it in terms of where we're at. We're probably sort of topped out.","And Gary?","Gary E. Anderson - Chief Executive Officer-Europe & Asia","Yeah. With respect to Europe, this is the place that we've \u2013 this unit size I think is the place, I think that we've talked about on past calls is definitely an opportunity for us to make progress in Europe. We're currently across the whole of Europe about 91% occupied in small spaces. And again when you look at that in terms of small business formation, and the place that we'd like the most is in Southern Europe, where candidly you've had the least amount of small business formation, but haven't focused on that segment, even in Southern Europe. And if you look, we've probably gained 1,200 basis points or 1,400 basis points over the last year in our Southern European portfolio. So it is a area of focus and one where we think opportunities lie certainly in Europe.","Thomas S. Olinger - Chief Financial Officer","This is Tom. I would just add that I think this segment has the most NOI upside. It's the last to recover. These spaces are generally the most infill; they have the highest rents per square foot. And I think now that you're seeing, as Gene said, the space is stabilizing, I think that's going to allow us to push rent. It's got a little more to catch up. So, I think a lot of NOI tailwind from this segment as well as just, as Gene talked about, homebuilding really not driving that. But clearly e-commerce is moving into that space and will be a big driver. And again, I think that is just more NOI upside for us.","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And a really high replacement cost, really tough to rebuild the stuff.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi. Your line is open.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, guys. Hamid, if we just go back to sort of your answer, your comment earlier on equity, what would make you be more open to issuing equity? Would it be the type of deal, would it be pricing? Let's just think out loud for a second, and if you were to do something like a KTR today versus when you got that completed, would there be an equity component now with your stock sort of where it is, or are you against equity for other reasons?","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, look, it's not a religious belief. I mean I believe in equity when there is a good use for capital deployment and all that. So it's not \u2013 a lot of people thought that we needed equity for balance sheet purposes to achieve our A rating, and unfortunately, they were wrong. And I don't know, we were very clear that we didn't, and we have liquidity from internal sources, fund rebalancing, non-strategic asset sales and the like to fund our business going forward, our development business going forward for five years, six years, seven years on a normal steady state scenario.","The only thing that's not in that plan is an opportunistic large acquisition. And if we run into those and we do \u2013 we go into hibernation for a couple of years and once in a while we come out and do something big and then go back in hibernation. We don't have a capital plan that contemplates that and those types of deals. But if they were to materialize that's when we would take a look at equity along with other sources.","But I can tell you, we've got a lot of liquidity right now between lines totaling $3.5 billion and the cash that will build up to about $1 billion in the balance sheet. I mean, we've got over $4 billion of liquidity. And we like our currency, I mean, I think yes, we are now finally trading at the NAV of our underlying real estate. But still the market has been paying us for our development platforms, which creates $400 million to $500 million NAV by clockwork every year.","So, long-winded answer but equity is not the first place we would look to fund even a strategic transaction. There are other places we can go to do that including private capital and our liquidity resources.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Brad Burke with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brad Burke - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, everyone, a question on cap rates. You're making acquisitions and dispositions with cap rates in the mid-6%s this year; that's quite a bit higher than what we're hearing from market cap rates and also above what we saw you do last year. So just want to understand what would be driving that, whether it's a mix issue or something else.","Michael S. Curless - Chief Investment Officer","This is Mike. Sorry, a little frog in my throat here. With respect to our disposition cap rates this quarter, it was up a little bit at 6.5%. Two primary reasons; we're active sellers in some regional markets like Cincinnati, Reno, parts of Spain. And the average age of the portfolios we sold in some of our global markets was twice the average age of our portfolio. So between regional mix and age, we saw a little bit of an uptick in the cap rates. We expect that to normalize on dispositions throughout the rest of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Your line is open.","Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered. I guess, Hamid, just kind of a big picture, I mean everything seems to be going very well in the business and you guys are even more optimistic today than maybe you were six months ago. I guess what are the potential storm clouds that you're watching that would cause you to either take the development starts down or to get more cautious on rent growth or NOI growth over the next say 12 months to 24 months?","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Steve, I think it's things outside the real estate markets. I mean, we are living in a pretty difficult geopolitical environment and there are some domestic issues going on that are very concerning that could have spillover to the economy. So, those kinds of things, I'll argue we're having a prudent capital structure so that you can go through any scenario and maybe even capitalize on some opportunities that come up in those kinds of scenarios, which is not a position we were in in the last cycle.","So, we have learned our lessons and I think we're adequately prepared for those types of situations, but I don't really see anything on the real estate markets that concern me. I mean, remember, demand was never and still is not spectacular. I think demand on a 10-point scale is a 6; I just think supply is kind of a 4 to a 5 and that's what's been keeping the markets healthy. So it's really the other stuff, the geopolitical and domestic political issues and all the stuff that we read about in the newspapers and watch on TV, very concerned about those.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers with Baird. Your line is open.","David B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Good morning out there. Maybe for Gene and Hamid, focusing on the U.S. specifically, can you detail some of the discussions that you are having with some of your current and potential customers around the development side of the business, kind of what that tells you about your comfort with spec and build-to-suit and sizing of the pipeline going forward. And I guess maybe a second part to that is, I think you said in your guidance and it was written down that you are going to take a bigger share of the development spend and is there anything we should kind of read into that as well? So, thanks.","Eugene F. Reilly - Chief Executive Officer-The Americas","Dave, let me start with that. One way to think about the kind of risk in your development program is if you take all your vacant developments, no matter what condition it's in, what percentage of your overall portfolio is development and operating, what does that represent? And over the last couple of years when we've really sort of ramped our development up, we've been between 4% and 5%, and as of this quarter at 3.5%.","So, we're I think fairly de-risk on that front and then if you look at starts in the U.S. for example, and this gets to the customer dialogue, we're 89% pre-leased on the starts this quarter because we had effectively six build-to-suits or pre-lease deals and that's a result of lots and lots of customer dialogue that's taken place over a couple of years at this point.","But most of our customers, today their focus is on how do they plan for the future. Most of them are in the midst of a supply chain reconfiguration of some type. And the markets are so tight. They have to plan. They have to engage with us more in long-term planning. And so I think actually that the nature of that dialogue has shifted dramatically. It hasn't shifted just in the last quarter; it's taken some period of time. But that's why you see lease terms are significantly longer than they were a couple of years ago. And we'd like to think these discussions are strategic versus transactional. So I think that actually is a pretty significant change that we've seen.","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. The only thing I would add to that is that I've been doing this for over 30 years. And I have never seen an environment where customers have been as willing to share with us their strategic plans for growth and asking us to build more product. I mean, literally, they're asking us to build more spec product. And they are coming ahead and telling us where their needs are. And they used to play their cards pretty close to their vests. Now, part of this may be just the level of strategic dialogue that we've created with them. I mean, with some of these customers we have, 30, 40, 50, 60 leases.","You can engage in meaningful dialogue when you have that kind of customer connectivity, whereas if you have a random portfolio and maybe the customer is sprinkled in three locations, they would think of you more as a vendor than a partner. So, I think the business is finally getting to the scale, not only because of its size, but also because of its focus on the key markets, that the dialog is becoming more and more strategic and that's what we worked very hard to create.","So, we're very encouraged by all that and look to take advantage of it. It manifests itself in very high volumes of build-to-suit, not because we want it to be that way, but because it turns out that way that people want to lock up spec capacity ahead of time.","So a lot of these are spec-to-suit or buildings we were going to build anyway that get leased up on a build-to-suit basis before we start with very minor modifications. It's a good place to be.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Hi, I apologize if I missed this, but what specifically is driving the 75-basis-point increase in the same-store NOI guidance? Is it something more on the rate side, the mark-to-markets are bigger, you think you're going to end up some place different on the occupancy range, or something else?","Thomas S. Olinger - Chief Financial Officer","Mike, it's Tom. It's a combination of both of those things. It's the higher rates that we're seeing just on roll as well as occupancies holding up higher than we anticipated. As you know we're pushing rents, and we were anticipating larger declines in occupancy than what we've seen it's \u2013 but I would say the primary driver though is rate.","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, Michael, you remember this because you were there and actually asked us some questions then. Back in 2012, when we laid out that crazy scenario of 25% rental growth in the U.S., we have blown through that. And remember, there was another phase after that, which is where would market rents go when replacement costs recovered, when construction costs recovered \u2013 because everybody was working for nothing then \u2013 and when land costs recovered.","That's a whole another acceleration of replacement costs, which is really pushing rent, if you go back to that time, more like 35% from that time. So we've been surprised by that last 10%. We thought we were being pretty aggressive, you guys thought, all of you, we were crazy. The market has turned out to be much more \u2013 we were all very conservative in retrospect and the market has blown past that because replacement costs have blown past that.","And we shouldn't really be surprised because nominal rents today are only a few percent higher than what they were in 2000. We had a dry period of 10 years to 15 years of very little nominal rental growth, and now we're finally getting back to nominal rents that we got in the early 2000s.","On a real basis, we're still 35% below where we should be. I'm not saying we're going to have 35% more rental growth, don't get me wrong. But I'm just saying, nominally we're where we were 15 years ago, we shouldn't be this surprised. But I guess when you were in the depth \u2013 we were all in the depths of 2012, none of us had enough vision to project 35%, 40% rental growth. But that's what's happening.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Blaine M. Heck - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Just a follow-up on development. Starts in the first half were relatively low at around $660 million at your share, which is about one-third of guidance, which leaves almost $600 million per quarter to start in the second half to hit guidance. So was the low level of starts during the first half just attributable to regular seasonality, or does that have anything to do with you guys looking for more build-to-suit projects that may be harder to kind of get the same volume as when you were doing more spec development as well?","And then just what should we look for as far as the timing of the remaining $1.2 billion of starts at your share this year?","Michael S. Curless - Chief Investment Officer","This is Mike Curless, let me address that. Relative to the 35% activity through the first half, that might seem low compared to last year, where I think we were at 54%, which was unusually high for the first half of the year. But historically since the merger, we're always between 30% and base because there is some seasonality here, and a lot of our work on the development starts activity is definitely backend-loaded. And so we have clear visibility to 100% of the items on our forecast this year, which is a very good visibility at this time of the year. And at the end of the day we'd expect about 45% of this activity to take place in the Americas, call it 30% in Asia, 25% in Europe and that's about the same in Americas as last year, and a little bit down in Europe and a little bit up in Asia. Our confidence level is high, to finish through this, particularly given the robust activity we're seeing in the build-to-suit arena, which is driving the confidence for the second half.","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think the risk to our starts number this year is to the upside, not the downside (52:00).","Blaine M. Heck - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Well, great.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel with Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.","Eric J. Frankel - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Thank you. Just a follow-up on your comments about supply. Could you provide a little bit more color as to markets where you're seeing supply (52:17) \u2013 I think you mentioned Houston and Columbus. So with Houston, does the supply actually impact your portfolio? My understanding is that there's a lot more activity surrounding the port and the downstream portion of the petrochemical business, and so that's what's driving supply there, but any additional color on those markets and others would be appreciated. Thank you.","Eugene F. Reilly - Chief Executive Officer-The Americas","Yeah, sure, Eric. It's Gene, and you're correct about Houston. That's where the supply is. Our portfolio is primarily Northwest, and it's pretty built out. There isn't a lot of supply, but if you look at the raw numbers in Houston, it is in an overbuilt condition. It still has positive absorption, which surprises a lot of people, but it is overbuilt.","Other markets that we've called out, Columbus, again not a horrendous situation, but they have excess supply and then they have a forward pipeline that concerns us. And otherwise \u2013 we look at this all the time as you know; other markets just don't scream bad at this point. Dallas has a lot of construction going on, and Dallas has a forward supply scenario that has us sort of cautious. But again, a lot of that's in South Dallas. Most of our development and most of our portfolio is around the airport in the north there. So, I could go on about other markets, but the reality is that we're in pretty good shape in these markets in the U.S.","And then there is something else I'd point out, Eric, and this is worth noting and watching going forward. We've called out a couple of markets historically over the last several quarters. Indianapolis is one of them, Central and Eastern Pennsylvania, and what's happened \u2013 and frankly, I haven't seen this happen before in my career \u2013 is markets got close to an overbuilding situation or maybe a little over the line, and they've corrected.","So, both of those markets are actually, they've taken the foot off the gas. They've lowered the supply levels, and they've made corrections. And there is a couple of other markets that New Jersey would also fall in that category by the way, that's really, really good to see. And again, we've got to watch this every day. But we continue to be very pleased with the overall discipline.","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Eric, the only thing I would add to what Gene said is that the only place I see around the world where truly stupid things are happening is Poland. I mean, it is irresponsible with a capital I and you've got literally people assigning leases on build-to-suit with face rents that then they discount with three years of free rent on a 10-year lease. And there is some investor that comes up and buys it at the cap rate, that they think is the cap rate, and they do it with sight letters and all kinds of games that are really not good for our industry's reputation.","And we are concerned about that and we will speak about that, and as I mentioned to you a couple of quarters ago, we have a real stake in making sure that the investors are making intelligent decisions. By the way Poland is \u2013 before everybody gets all excited, Poland is 2% of our portfolio and this is really only happening in a few locations in Poland. But it is concerning, it sort of reminds me of Dallas in 1997 and 1998, and some people are going to get burned doing that and then they'll stop but at the moment, that's the only place in the world that worries me.","Gary E. Anderson - Chief Executive Officer-Europe & Asia","The only comment that I would add Hamid is that the impact will not have any impact on our existing Polish portfolio because we value our assets on a net effective rent basis.","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Gary E. Anderson - Chief Executive Officer-Europe & Asia","So there should be no impact there, but I have to tell you, these investors who are buying these headline capped assets are not going to be happy when these assets or leases roll. So...","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And we're going to be calling in those tenants.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi. Your line is open.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Two quick follow-ups. On leasing, it looks like you took care of a lot of, or at least a bunch of expirations for 2017. Could you just tell us how you thought about doing sort of those renewals early, especially it sounds like things are going sort of in the upward direction?","And my second question is if we look at your development margins, which seem to be coming down at least quarter-over-quarter, I mean, is that just a mix issue and it's because you are doing build-to-suit or is there more to it than that?","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let me hit development; development margins have been crazy good and a lot of it has to do with the fact that we are monetizing low, cheap land from the downturn that was impaired and all that. I think at market with market land values, our development margins are more normal; they are still high, but they're more normal, they're not at crazy high.","Remember what we said about development margins. In a steady state market which we are not in yet, we're better than this. But when the market is totally steady, spec should be around 15% and build-to-suit should be 10% to 12%. Right now, we are probably at market by a point higher than that for both spec and build-to-suit. More for spec; I would say build-to-suits are 10% to 12% when we get to be really competitive.","So, yeah, we've just been spoiled by really good margins and we haven't built our business or our forecasts based on 30% margins like we had last year.","Eugene F. Reilly - Chief Executive Officer-The Americas","And then on the leasing question, we're always pulling the leases forward. It's just part of how we run the business. There really isn't any strategy around that. We're not specifically targeting any particular vintage of lease. It really has to do with the customers' interest and other things. So, that's not a \u2013 but you're going to be able to continue to see that in the normal course of business sort of.","Thomas S. Olinger - Chief Financial Officer","And Manny, it's Tom. I just had one more thing. When you look at the net effective rent in the remaining 2017, what's rolling our share, it actually dropped from last quarter. So our discussion about NOI growth going forward and the very positive mark-to-market, I think that's a really good sign when you think about how high our rent change on roll was this quarter and we've lowered our net effective in-place rents in 2017.","Hamid R. Moghadam - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, that was the last question and I think it's only appropriate to end this call with a cheerio from all of us here at Prologis. See you next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Prologis Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]   Thank you. Tracy Ward, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Tracy Ward","Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2012 conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. This morning, we'll hear from Hamid Moghadam, co-CEO and Chairman, who will comment on the company's strategy and the market environment; and then from Tom Olinger, CFO, who will cover results and guidance. Additionally, we are joined today by members of our executive team including Walt Rakowich, Gary Anderson, Mike Curless, Nancy Hemmenway, Guy Jaquier, Ed Nekritz, and Gene Reilly.","Before we begin prepared remarks, I'd like to quickly state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under Federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates, as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement matters in our 10-K or SEC filings.","I'd also like to state that our second quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures. And in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. [Operator Instructions] Hamid, will you please begin?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Thanks. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. When we spoke with you last quarter, we reported strong performance and positive momentum across all our business lines. While the economy has slowed since April, I'm pleased to report that we delivered solid results for the quarter. Given the doom and gloom headlines, we thought it'd be helpful to review the indicators that most effect our business and to assess their impact on our company's prospects. While revised down, global trade remains well above peak. Additionally, the IMF continues to forecast growth of 3.8% for 2012 and significantly higher next year. Global container volumes continue to grow. For the major ports who have reported, their volumes are up about 1% year-over-year and the forecasts are that they'll be up 5% by year end.","Looking to the U.S. While retail sales moderated in the second quarter, they're up almost 5% year-over-year. Despite slightly tempered expectations, real inventories continued to grow in the second quarter, following an annualized growth rate of more than 3% in the prior quarter. These factors created the backdrop for net absorption of 26 million square feet in the U.S. in the quarter, a number on par with the first quarter. We're forecasting total absorption of 150 million feet for 2012, up 25% over last year. This means absorption is expected to be 50% stronger in the second half, in line with its historic trends.","Effective rents continue to increase in our U.S. global markets and on the margin in our regional markets. Outside the U.S., we see high demand and rent growth in Japan, China, Brazil, Canada and the major consumer markets in Mexico. Even Europe is stable, with occupancy and prime brands holding steady in the vast majority of our European global markets. The broader recovery in inventories and net absorption of industrial space is clearly reflected in our second quarter operating results. Our team signed 35 million square feet of new and renewal leases in the second quarter. This comes on the heels of 31 million square feet of leasing last quarter and is close to fourth quarter levels, typically the year's most active leasing period.","We find ourselves in an excellent position for the second half, as we have minimal role of about 4% for the balance of the year. This is in sharp contrast to the 10% of lease expirations we resolved in the first half of this year.","Let me give you a little more detail on the leasing environment and its impact on our portfolio. The strongest demand continues to be for large Class A facilities. Occupancy remains the highest in our larger spaces. The real news, however, is the momentum in the leasing of our smaller spaces. At quarter end, our occupancy of units less than 100,000 feet in the U.S. was up 110 basis points from the first quarter. Demand for larger spaces continues to be driven by consolidation, supply chain reconfiguration and e-commerce. Changing tax laws as well as free and same-day delivery are driving the need for our customers to be closer to consumers. This aligns well with our global market strategy.","It's important to note that this high volume of leasing is not being done at the expense of rate. Market rents continue to improve overall but the primary movement is coming from larger, Class A spaces which generated positive rent increases of about 2%. The recovery is broadening. No market in the Americas is getting weaker and even lagging markets such as Atlanta and Chicago are showing strength for the first time in years.","Let me now give you an update on what's happening on the ground in Europe. In spite of economic headwinds, the operating environment for industrial real estate in our markets is holding up well. Importantly, there is little deterioration of rents in our European portfolio. Though the overall leasing demand is subdued, the lack of new supply and the dwindling stock of vacant buildings have allowed us to push rents and lease terms on a selective basis. As a matter of fact, Europe was our strongest continent with the smallest declines in rents and roll over. The key here is that the European demand is driven more by long-term structural drivers such as supply chain and reconfiguration than by changes in GDP. Demand still outweighs supply in most major markets in Europe. The trend is for continued positive net absorption, ad space utilization remains high and customers continue to optimize their supply chains. During this point in the cycle, top line growth is limited and therefore, customers are focused on reducing operational cost through network consolidations.","Our portfolio is clearly meeting the need. Case in point, during the second quarter, occupancy in our European portfolio held steady at 92.1%, outperforming the overall European market on average by about 350 basis points. This outperformance is because of our high-quality portfolio, as 90% of our European assets are in the strongest markets, and our team is second to none. These long-term drivers of demand globally are also apparent in the institutional investment community and are fueling demand for private capital funds.","During the second quarter, we raised $163 million of new third-party equity in our core open-end funds. This was a strong quarter of fundraising and brings our 2012 total to $288 million for these vehicles. Additionally, we remain on track for closing our new development fund in Japan before year end. As the Suzhou investment and interest continues to grow, so does our progress on the fund rationalization front. A good example of this is the progress we made in winding down PEPR. At quarter's end, we owned 99.5% of the fund and expect to have full ownership by the end of August. We've already started the recapitalization process of our European portfolio ahead of our original schedule.","Last quarter, we spoke in some detail about our financing and structuring alternatives for our portfolio in Japan. We're investing the capital to obtain the applicable licenses to form a J-REIT. We want to have the ability to select the optimal structure to realize the best value from our Japan assets. It's important to note that the J-REIT maybe an alternative or a complement to our open end fund as the future vehicle for the long-term ownership of our operating assets in Japan.","The combined effects of consumer demand, lack of new supply and growing investor interest is leading to a variety of capital deployment opportunities for us around the world. Going forward, we expect the majority of our deployment activity to come from development as opposed to straight acquisitions. On the development front, built-to-suits represent 80% of our starts year to date. All of which are being constructed on our land bank. This activity is supported by strong leasing demand paired with the dearth of supply of large spaces from global markets.","Our margins on our year-to-date starts are more than 20%. While we don't expect to sustain these margins over the cycle, these strong margins validate the value of our land bank. We'd expect margins to normalize to our historical range of 12% to 15% going forward.","Given investor appetite for high-quality industrials real estate, we're increasing the pace of our nonstrategic dispositions especially in the U.S. As we typically do this time of the year, we're working hard to bring a few packages to market and expect a busy fourth quarter of closings.","To wrap up my comments, I'd say that despite the gloomy economic headlines, we're encouraged by the realities on the ground and the evidence of what we see in the market. Trade consumption and GDP levels are growing beyond previous peak levels. This, coupled with very high utilization levels, should continue to drive net absorption throughout the year. We're making excellent progress on our priorities and are looking forward to reporting on our further progress in the coming quarters. With that, I'll turn it over to Tom for a closer look in our results and guidance","Thomas S. Olinger","Thanks, Hamid. This morning, I'll cover 3 topics. First, a summary of our Q2 results; second, an overview of our capital markets activity; and third an update on our guidance for the year.","Let's start with our results. Core FFO for the second quarter was $0.43 a share, $0.02 above our expectations. The outperformance was primarily due to stronger net operating income, driven by higher occupancy. We had expected occupancy to dip slightly in the second quarter given the amount of leasing rolling. Foreign exchange did not materially impact the core FFO for the quarter, as the average euro rate was $1.29, just under our forecasted level.","Looking over our operating portfolio performance, occupancy at the quarter end was 92.4%, up 10 basis points sequentially and 170 basis points year-over-year. All regions contributed to the strong leasing activity of over 35 million square feet, an increase of more than 4 million square feet from the prior quarter.","For the third consecutive quarter, we saw healthy demand in leasing for our smaller spaces in the U.S. The smaller spaces will be a key driver of continued occupancy growth. Our European portfolio had another solid quarter result, with occupancy holding firm at 92.1%. For the second half of the year, as Hamid mentioned, we only have 4.2% of our ABR rolling as a result of a significant number of renewals that were resolved in the second quarter. This positions us well for continued occupancy growth through the remainder of the year.","Rent change on rollover was a negative 3.9% for the second quarter. GAAP same-store NOI was at 0.4%. while stabilized cash, same-store NOI was up 2.3%. I'd like to point out the additional stabilized cash NOI disclosure for both same store and NAV included in our supplemental package in this quarter. Lastly, I want to point out that our bad debt expense for the last several quarters has been about 1\/2 our long-term average, which is obviously a very positive trend. To put this in context, our historical bad debt expenses averaged at about 50 basis points of revenue and during the last downturn, bad debt expense was over 100 basis points.","Turning now to capital markets. During the quarter, we concluded more than $1.2 billion of debt financings, refinancings and pay downs and we further improved our average debt cost. Subsequent to quarter end, we closed 2 transactions for Prologis European Property Fund II, our EUR 145 million senior unsecured term loan and a GBP 40 million secured facility.","While the financing environment in Europe is very challenging, we were able to compete these 2 transactions on very attractive terms. As we have seen in the past, the strength of our sponsorship, the quality of our assets and our global platform enables us to source capital very effectively. We continue to reposition our debt stack towards non-U.S. dollar borrowings to further naturally hedge our foreign net equity.","Turning to dispositions and contributions. During the second quarter, we completed $228 million in building and land dispositions and contributions. Our share of these proceeds was $191 million.","On the capital deployment front, we committed approximately $313 million to capital in the quarter, of which $277 million was our share. Total deployment included $229 million of development starts and $85 million of building acquisitions.","Now turning to guidance for 2012. We're increasing the bottom of our range for full year core FFO from $1.60 to $1.64 per share and maintaining the top end range at $1.70. The main driver of this guidance is our forecast of the macro economy and the drivers of demand for our business. We continue to expect slow and steady growth in the overall global economy, driven by demand from consolidation, supply reconfiguration and e-commerce fulfillment. From a foreign currency standpoint, we're assuming an average euro rate for the second half of the year of $1.2, an average yen of JPY 80. The lower euro rate assumption had about a $0.02 reduction to our second half forecast.","For operations, 2012 same-store NOI guidance is unchanged at 1% to 2%. We're forecasting yearend occupancy be between 93% and 93.5%, which reflects an increase of the low end of our prior guidance of 92.5%. We're seeing market rent growth in the majority of our markets today. However, we do expect rent change on rollovers to be negative in the second half, driven primarily by smaller spaces. 2012 will be the end of the negative lease roll downs as our larger spaces are already in positive territory, smaller spaces continue to recover and leases signed during the prior peak roll off.","On the expense side, we continue to forecast net G&A of $208 million at $213 million for the year. For capital deployment, we're maintaining our full year forecast of $1.5 billion to $2 billion, with our overall share of expected investment to be about 70%. Deployment includes $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion of development starts, primarily in the Americas and Japan and $400 million to $600 million of acquisitions, mostly in our co-investment ventures in the Americas and Europe.","The acquisition market remains challenging given the high demand for Class A product, which results in very competitive pricing. We'll continue to be disciplined and only and pursue transactions that makes sense from both a quality and valuation standpoint.","Turning to contributions and dispositions. We are widening our annual range to $3.5 billion to $7 billion, from $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion. This activity can vary significantly based on the recapitalization of PEPR and the Japan operating assets. If one of these transactions happens, we could be at the high end of our guidance. While if neither happens, we could be at the low end of our guidance. We feel very good about completing the contribution disposition activity. It's just a matter of timing as to what closes by year end. Our focus continues to be on achieving good execution over the course of our 10-quarter plan.","In closing, we are very pleased with our results this quarter and our progress to date and we remain highly focused on our strategic priorities to further position the company for continued growth. At this point, I'll turn the call back to the operator to open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brendan Maiorana with Wells Fargo.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Tom, question for you. With respect to the guidance, two things. One, was there any change due to the timing of the dispositions, which sounds like maybe it's a little bit later in the year relative to prior expectations? And then at the low end, I guess it sounds like there's an additional $2 billion of dispositions and was I correct in assuming that, that would exclude PEPR and anything on the Japan open end fund?","Thomas S. Olinger","Okay. Brandon I'll take the first -- I'll take both of those. On the disposition side and the second half, back-end nature of these, really had a minimal impact on our guidance, slightly dilutive for the back half of the year. However, when you look at our total 10-Q plan, dilution is virtually 0 and that's because of -- in the second half of the year, what's happening is we're accelerating more U.S. dispositions, which will be our higher cap rates and the only debt we really have available to pay down is our line of credit, which is very low interest rates. So when we get into 2013, you've got Japan assets that are yielding much lower than the U.S. and we can get after higher interest rate debt that's maturing. On your second point, to go to our guidance, I'll give you some of the pieces of our disposition and contribution activity. So when you look at our range for the year of $3.5 billion to $7 billion, and you back out the $1.2 billion we've done already, that leaves a range for the second half of between $2.3 billion and $5.8 billion. When you look at what we have, we have a lot of irons in the fire. We have a lot of activity going on, so this range does not include every possible transaction that could happen. So when you look at what we have, what irons we have in the fire here, it starts with the PEPR, recapitalization we have over $3 billion of assets for recapitalization. Japan operating assets are $2.9 billion. We've got Canada assets of $450 million. We've got sales of over $200 billion, the sales are primarily in the U.S. -- $2 billion, I'm sorry. And controls [ph] of the $1.5 billion. So when you look at all that activity, that aggregates to one -- over $10 billion of activity. So again, we feel good about that list. It's a matter of timing and what on that list closes by year end.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ross Nussbaum with UBS.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I'm curious what your embedded GDP forecast is for the back half of the year, both for the U.S. and the global economy. And in particular, I was thinking about it relative to some of the comments that UPS made on their conference call, insofar as they think that forecasts are too high in GDP growth is going to come in closer to 1%. And if that scenario played out, what do you think it would do to your business?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Our forecast is higher than that. It's about 2% for the U.S. and in the mid-3s for the global economy. I think on the global economy frankly, the markets that we're operating in, I'm not worried about that at all because really, if you see most of the activity on the development side is in markets where there's virtually no supply and the trends in Japan and China and all that are very, very strong, and I don't them see changing by the end of the year. In terms of the U.S., I must say that even though the economy has slowed, there has been probably a little bit of a slowdown in terms of leasing activity. But still, it's either the lag or it's the high utilization rates. We suspect it's the high utilization rate, but there is -- we're just running out of space in the U.S. The fact of the matter is that nobody has really built anything in 4 years and there's been a fair amount of obsolescence. So we're getting pricing power in a lot of markets, notwithstanding the slowdown of the economy. So at the margins, there's 1% or 2%, I'll leave that discussion for smarter people than us but I think demand for our product is going to be really, really good going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Bilerman with Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just sticking on the disposition plans and Tom, you had sort of outlined this $10 billion grouping, part of which is obviously contributions that you can make. But I think at least for PEPR, don't you have the ability just with the capacity and some of the funds that you have today, to be able to rotate some of that $3 billion pretty much almost immediately, and then I would think that on the $1.5 billion of contributions outside of PEPR, you have the ability to do a lot of that today. Japan, obviously the question mark as you evaluate and then you have all these $2 billion of outright sales, it would seem that with all this stuff happening, it probably is something that's sooner rather than later just given your ability. So maybe you can just sort of walk through a little bit, how much you can execute almost immediately versus needing the market to go your way.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Okay. Michael, I'll let Tom walk you through the details of it. But big picture, the reasons are lower end of our range is $3.5 billion on all this de-leveraging activity, is exactly because of what you said, because we have a fair amount of visibility in our contribution pipeline, which when added to the deals that we've already closed and the deals that we have in the market with good action on them, we feel pretty good about the low end of that. And the upper end of $7 billion is really not everything we were working on. That big list is over $10 billion. So by way of reminder, the 10-quarter plan is a 10-quarter plan that ends at the end of 2013. So whether it -- how much of this $10 billion is going to fall exactly into this year and how much of it is going to fall into exactly next year, that's harder to predict. But we feel we got enough irons in the fire that we can be in that range as I described. Now maybe, Tom, you can go through the pieces of that.","Thomas S. Olinger","So Michael, you're correct in that. So the PEPR number I gave you of $3.1 billion would exclude any of our planned contributions of assets out of PEPR into our other European funds this year. So the $1.5 billion of contributions I mentioned, about 2\/3 of that, so about $1 billion of that contribution now is either existing PEPR assets or existing on balance sheet, Europe assets that we can contribute into our 3 existing funds. So when you look at the Allianz fund, it's the capital to go, the fund II -- -- PEPF II, it's got capital plus we're raising more capital, PCAL, [PH] we continue to raise capital. So it's some news that we feel good about getting those contributions in this year and that's our plan.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Yes. And then just to finish up on that, in terms of how we think about our European portfolio and its recapitalization, really at this point, we think about PEPR and the balance sheet assets as being one integrated portfolio because we own 99.5% of PEPR, it's an effect [ph] balance sheet. So really going forward, think about those 2 things as really being 1. And a big chunk of them is going to go to the existing funds and then a big chunk of them is going to get recapitalized.","Operator","Your next question  comes from David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Just quickly, when you talk about your margins contracting back to the meeting, is this something you just expect over time in a normal course of business or are there indications today, perhaps, regionally that, that is underway already?","Hamid R. Moghadam","I'll start, and Mike will finish up on that. I think part of it is also land value, which is that -- remember this land has been pretty heavily impaired. So I know a lot of the discussion the last couple of years has been sort of is our land appropriately valued or not and it's tough to answer that question when there are very few land comp sales of industrial land in the market. But I think, as we put this land into production and we're getting the yield on our total development that at the impaired values that lead to a 20% margin, the kind of tells you that our land is valued well and maybe upside in the land value to start off with. The other thing that I just want to tie back to the dilution comment that Tom made a couple of questions ago, the incremental land on these developments that we're putting into service, given that we already own the land and it's not yielding anything, are really high. So the couple hundred million dollars that we're putting in, let's say, and it's yielding 8% with land, without land, it's yielding like 10%. So that means that our deployment activity really fills up any kind of dilution that we might have from paying down debt. So with that, Mike, why don't you talk about the granulated [ph] stuff.","Michael S. Curless","And in terms of margins, we certainly got off to a great start at the first half of the year with the deals in Brazil and Japan that drove some high margins and over time, over the year, we expect that normalize somewhat as we anticipate doing a larger proportion of build-to-suits in the Americas, particularly in the U.S. where we expect build-to-suits margins to be more normalized in that 10% to 15% range. So nothing unusual, it's just a matter of timing and mix and over the long haul over the year, we'd expect those to normalize somewhat.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Craig Mailman - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Maybe could you just talk a little bit about the demand you're seeing for the Japan fund maybe in a dollar amount? And then maybe discuss the triggers or the decision tree for going the open ended fund route versus J-REITs route?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Well, let me give you the big picture answer and Guy will give you more details on the Private Capital side of this. So first of all, you should not think of the J-REIT or the open end fund as either or solutions in the long-term. We may end up actually having both because we have -- the important thing is we have a very good development pipeline in Japan and we're leasing it up much faster than we thought. So the Japan business is going really well and we need capacity, if you will, to absorb these assets as they're completed. They're really good assets and we all like to talk about cap rates and all that in different parts of the world, but you got to understand, when you're talking about a 5.5% cap rate asset in Japan, you're talking a brand-new state-of-the-art 6 or 8 story building with one roof virtually no parking lot, no CapEx, very little turnover cost, which means that your 5.5% is really 5.5%, it's not like the 6% in the U.S. that you got to take out PIs and commissions and all that. So the 5.5% is a pretty good return. And once you look at financing rates that are 1.5% to 2% in Japan, your cash yields are in the high single digit range in an economy that has virtually no inflation. We love our assets in Japan and we love the return on our assets in Japan. One of these days, a lot of people are going to figure that out. In fact, it's probably the place in the world that the yield on the assets is the widest that we see over the cost of capital. So we need high-capacity vehicles, both private and public to do this. We are giving ourselves a lot of optionality by going through the licensing requirements of the J-REITs. The trigger will be the valuation. I mean, the J-REITs are trading at a slight discount to NAV today, we're watching that very carefully. But just immediate upfront valuation is not the sole criteria. We are looking at the governance issues that go along with that, having just had recent experience with another public vehicle in Europe that we've gotten pretty good at understanding those governance issues and working through those. So there are a lot of different factors and the one thing that we've done wrong is that we went out there and we said we're going to get this done this year. We'll get it done this year if it makes sense to get it done this year, and we won't get it done this year if it doesn't make sense because we love the yield on these assets. With that, let me have Guy fill in...","Guy F. Jaquier","With respect to the Japan development fund. We are seeing a lot of good interest. We're in advance discussions with a number of investors, this includes weekly due diligence sessions including like last night San Francisco time which ships ph] Asia time for their convenience. [indiscernible] discussions with existing partners we have and other funds around the world. Just picking up on what Hamid said, it is surprising to a lot of these investors when they start to peel the onion on the development opportunity in Japan. And Michael talked earlier about the 20% margins we're seeing at some of our Japan development. A big majority of these are build-to-suits [indiscernible] intuitive in a relatively slow growth environment, that one of your strongest development markets would be Japan. But as the investors start to peel the onion, we're giving a lot of [indiscernible].","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Morgan with Morgan Stanley.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","On the core portfolio, if you look at where you are in occupancy versus the high end of your guidance for the year of 93.5%, if you were to approach the high end by year end, what would it take -- what regions or markets would drive you there? And do you see it coming from the improvement that you mentioned in the smaller units or just [indiscernible] ?","Eugene F. Reilly","Paul, it's Gene. Let me at least start with that. Gary might want to pile on. But I think the first thing you're going to look to is our ROE second half of the years is just over 4%. So we've plowed through about 3 quarters of our ROE already this year. So we have a light ROE coming at us. We do need to continue to build occupancy in small tenant spaces but in the last 3 quarters, we've added almost 200 basis points. We're still in the sort mid-88s for those spaces. But as we've discussed in probably the last 3 calls, we see really good momentum there. We also now have a little bit of vacancy in large spaces. It's about 2%, 3% but I'll give you an example. We had in the U.S., we have I think, 2.2 million feet of vacant space above 500,000 feet and that's in floor spaces. So to make them today and we have deals working on all that space. So we have a pretty high confidence level that as that space ROEs, we'll lease it up. In terms of regional contributions to this, if you look at Los Angeles, it's 97% leased or thereabouts. Not much more to add. But frankly, I wouldn't be surprised if we pushed it a little bit higher. The other thing I'll just leave you with is that the regional markets are really beginning to recover. So our level of confidence in improving occupancy there has also improved. So it's basically a variety of factors.","Hamid R. Moghadam","And I'd just say the contribution is pretty broad based. I mean, we don't expect much contribution in occupancy from Asia. Asia's already trending at about 97% so there's not much wood to chop there vis-\u00e0-vis increases in occupancy, but we do expect to see occupancy to increase in Europe for the same reasons, same basic reasons that Gene outlined. We've got very little ROE, we've done a lot of work in the first half and when you look at our pipeline, the visibility that we have to the pipeline, we would expect to end the year higher than we are today.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with Macquarie.","Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie Research","Just a couple of quick questions around PEPR. At what all-in rate do you think you can contribute or dispose those assets at today? And at what yield would you not be a seller, given that it might not help you de-leverage? And second quick question is I noticed that you acquired an asset for PEP II third party. I'm just curious as to why you did that instead of waiting to contribute assets into it.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Well, the second question is very easy to answer. We see good opportunities for our funds to invest in assets from third parties. The funds are there to make good returns for our investors. The funds are not there just to take out our balance sheet asset. So let's be clear about that. So that one is an easy one. With respect to exactly where we would transact, I would rather not engage in that conversation on the call today. Obviously, that's a negotiation that we're happy to report on after we're done with it. But I think you asked a good question and the question is would we do something stupid to meet a 10-quarter plan, and the answer is rest assured we're not going to do something stupid to meet that plan. We can be patient. We have more activity going on than our plan and we left some optionality around it. So we will be patient. We have really good assets and deal them at an attractive price.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Stewart with Green Street Advisors.","John Stewart - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","A little bit of a follow-up along that line of questioning, actually. First of all, Tom, what would the weighted average cap rate be on the entire $10 billion of dispositions and contributions that you've identified? And then on -- specifically on Europe, Hamid, last quarter you'd commented on where your thought sort of spot cap rates were and I guess, with respect to assets specifically identified for contribution from PEPR, how do you reach a meeting of the mind on the evaluation of those contributions?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Okay. First of all, the appraisal progression in Europe is really good and probably better than anywhere else in the world. And there's a high level of transparency and trust in that process. And that's really the basis for transacting and there's an independent advisory board that looks over that process and we have good governance built in to ensure that the pricing is good. Tom can you...","Thomas S. Olinger","I'll take -- so looking at the $10 billion and the mix of those assets, I would expect that the blended would be in the mid-6s when you consider on the low end of cap rates, you're going to have Japan to be 5.25% to 5.5%, and on the high end, you would have disposed in our other regional markets in the U.S. that have a 7% in front of them.","Hamid R. Moghadam","It would be in the 6s clearly on an all-in cost but remember my point about monetizing the land bank. I think some portion of those will be land bank, which on the incremental capital, will get very good yield so -- and some of those will be sold. So that will pull up the average cap rate, in effect that you'll see on those.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a quick question on the balance sheet, Tom. Next year, it looks like you have about $800 million or $900 million coming to you between converts and bonds and I mean, how should we be thinking about that? Do you just see those 2 items or that those 2 buckets of items going away by asset sales or do you plan on refinancing some of the debt? And I guess to that point, where do you think you could price new debt today?","Thomas S. Olinger","So our current plan will be to clearly retire that debt with proceeds from contributions and dispositions. What we could do today, I mean, there's been some good price points out there with other REITs in the last couple of weeks. And that traded significantly through cash yields. Our bonds are very tightly held. We see very little activity on those. If you looked at where those are trading today at 10 years, probably trading 250-ish over spread, a 2.50% spread. I would expect if looking at other activity, we could do something in the low 2s today, if we would choose to go out there. I mean, clearly, being able to do 10-year money at sub 4% rates is very attractive. So not to say that we wouldn't think about doing something at some point just to have -- that's really cheap capital to have if -- to put out there. But the plan right now would be to just pay it off with disposing contrast.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Guinee with Stifel, Nicolaus.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","One last question on the whole disposition contribution. Whether it's $2.3 billion or $10 billion, I think everybody hopes you sell these at low cap rates, high proceeds, but you've also got probably a low tax basis through depreciation. How should we look at the capital gains tax? And is that already accounted for in your $560 million deferred income tax liability?","Thomas S. Olinger","John, I'll take that. It would be built into our deferred income tax liability for sure. And when you look at that liability, it's around $525 million at the end of the quarter. A big chunk of that would be a $375 million related to PEPR. Our belief of PEPR is we're going to be able to move most of those assets via entity transactions and not outright sale. So that liability would essentially move as part of the purchase price to whatever agreed on with that to the purchaser. We could be selling some assets from a sales perspective and we would settle up that deferred tax liability to that extent. I think the other issue would just be around taxable income. And looking at distribution requirements with some of the gains, for example, the Japan assets create a very significant gain. So we'll have to look at our payout ratios relative to our TI over this period.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Michael Bilerman with Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up just a little bit on the build-to-suit and sort of development starts overall. I'm just curious as you think about where that demand is coming from for the activity you're doing, how much of that is coming from your existing tenant base and perhaps, coming out of your existing buildings, how much is more market-driven? And then maybe just a comment overall on development activity. It looks at least in the U.S. from the data that we're seeing, that starts while still below historical averages or certainly, over the last couple of months has been rising and are coming back to almost 1% of stock. So I'm just curious just sort of what you're seeing in your marketplaces as other developers are stepping up and starting a new product and whether this is really incremental absorption or whether it's people just shuffling around and whether there's a negative impact on the core portfolio.","Michael S. Curless","This is Mike Curless. Why don't I take this from an overall viewpoint, and then I'll flip it to Gene for a little bit of color in terms of where some of this demand is coming from. We're real excited in terms of our activity in the first half of the year with $440 million in development activity and which you've heard some 80% of that was in the form of build-to-suits and specifically, we started 7 build-to-suit projects in the U.S., Japan in Brazil that total over $355 million volume, some 3.5 million square feet. And as we mentioned, the margins there were strong in the 20% range and based on yields that blended in the high 7s. I think a big part that had to do with driving those strong margins was the land that we monetized in the process. We think that that land provided us a real competitive advantage and once again proves out that our land bank is a real differentiator and helps us not only win business and drive margins. And I think this activity was fueled in 2 primary large buckets. We had a very robust pipeline both in the Americas and Asia in terms of build-to-suit prospects, which I think will bode very well for the rest of the year's activity. We'd expect to duplicate this type of volume as we look forward to the balance of the year but maybe, Gene, why don't you add a little color in terms of where some of that specific demand is coming from.","Eugene F. Reilly","Sure. So Michael, the demand we've been seeing building over the last couple of quarters, it really has been coming from consumer products companies outside the U.S. and inside the U.S. Our online sales are probably the biggest category. And that will be across a variety of industries. But our activity in terms of size to this quarter is heavily weighted to online sales. We think that is going to continue. I think we mentioned in the prepared remarks that as tax laws change in the United States, that is going -- really needs population centers and gateways that are winners in that equation. So we're seeing that take place. We're seeing customers frankly assume that tax laws will be rationalized across the U.S. And I think on balance, our build-to-suit activity is going to be stronger this year than expected. You've heard us talk about this for a couple of years now. Finally, we have some deals to talk about, but volume is good in the first half of the year and our pipeline for the second is equally strong at this point.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Michael, in Europe and Asia, I mean, there are basically 3 buckets of customers that are driving demand for build-to-suits. It's e-commerce, it's pharmaceutical, and it's automobile. Those are really the 3 key drivers for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Morgan with Morgan Stanley.","Chris Caton - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","It's Chris with Paul. I just wanted to follow-up with Guy on the fundraising and separate from short-term negotiations, how would you characterize the fund raising environment today? What strategies are clients interested in and what issues are they less interested in?","Guy F. Jaquier","Sure. I would say that many of the investors are cautious. They're doing a lot of due diligence, but they're still moving forward in making decisions. I think there's the larger investors, the larger global investors are actually quite aggressive in certain areas. Some of the smaller investors have moved a bit to the sidelines or at least gotten a little more conservative but there's still pretty good demand. With respect to how this is working out and those negotiations, we usually start our private capital presentation, talking about our global platform, our people, our products and all that, and the conversation quickly returns to, yes, we acknowledge that you're the global leader but we want to talk about price and terms. And with respect to that, we're not the price leader in investment management. We're not in the Private Capital business just to increase assets under management. We really just don't need to build scale. We're doing it for a profit. We're willing to accept that profit in the back end in total incentive fees but we do this as a business. With respect to the terms and how that back and forth goes, it's really creating a balance for the investor's desire to participate in fund governance. But we've got to create a structure that recognizes that most of these funds, we are the largest co-investor or at least one of the largest, and we're the GP and we have to have discretion to execute and strategy. We're not just a path wheel [ph] manager providing a service to increase assets under management. That's just not the best way to build long-term value for our network, our customers, our private capital partners and our shareholders. So it's back and forth. We could cut these and give up GP discretions and increase assets under management, but we just don't have to, and we don't think that's the best way to build this business in the long-term.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Stewart with Green Street Advisors.","John Stewart - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Could we get you to either update or reiterate your latest greatest estimate for merger costs and synergies? And then Hamid, could we get your 30,000-foot view on fundamentals, valuation and the size of your land bank in Mexico?","Thomas S. Olinger","Great. John, I'll take the first piece. On synergies, no change although we continue to find opportunities to become more efficient as we continue to move forward. On the merger expenses side, we would see $70 million to $75 million merger expenses this year. That's up from what we talked about probably back in Q3 and the biggest drivers of that, there's 2 big drivers of that. One is PEPR coming in house, recapitalization happening. Or bringing in-house I should say, in 2012 so there's expenses associated with that and there's higher severance cost primarily related to some work we're doing in Europe to reorganize in Europe. But you will also remember this ties in to the fact that we raised our synergy guidance back in Q4, which was largely around finding more headcount synergies.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Okay. And I'll address your question on valuation. I hope it's a little closer than 30,000 feet though because we're actually selling a fair amount of real estate all around the world, so we have pretty good insight into what cap rates really are and all that. I would say in the U.S., the very best market, the very best assets are midsize in place stabilized sort of, call it, 93% to 95% occupancy type numbers. And when you go to the global markets that are somewhat less supply-constraints like Atlanta and Dallas, you might get into the mid-6s for the very best assets. And then obviously you tack on some premiums on those cap rates for assets that are not state of the art, et cetera, et cetera, in these markets. In Europe, the very best assets with the longest duration of leases in, for example, the U.K. maybe as low as high-5s. I would say when you get into Central and Eastern Europe and the like, you might get into the high-7s and everything is kind of in between for good modern products. I would say solidly in the high-6s maybe low 7s, if you take the extremes out. Japan is -- the best assets in Tokyo, 5.25%, when you get to Osaka, maybe high-5s If you get into older generation assets, who knows, maybe they'll be in the low to mid-6s. China, we used to think they were in 7s. We've seen some comps now in the 6s based on what people have paid for assets. I would have to say 6s today. Brazil, it used to be 10% or 11%. Today. It's come to 8.5%, maybe. Mexico is probably mid-7s to 8%. So I don't think -- and Canada, which is really Toronto, I would say it's like the best markets in the U.S., so mid-5s. Specifically, our land bank in Mexico, let me ask Gene to answer that, but let me make a commentary about land bank generally. And I've said this before, and I think we've finally gotten to that time. That land bank is worth a lot of money. That land is good land, not all of it by the way, some of it -- some portion of it, was actually is a lot of acres but not a lot of value, maybe $150 million to $200 million of it is not that great. But the rest of it is pretty good land in really good markets and I think you guys are going to perceive that as a real competitive advantage for this company going forward. I certainly do. Gene, Mexico?","Eugene F. Reilly","Yes, sure. So we had a large land bank in Mexico, and I'd point out a couple of things here. One is that majority of this is in population centers where the markets are good, and we're actually very active with development right now. We do have some land bank exposure in the border markets, which have been weaker but are actually recovering pretty well. There's actually very strong manufacturing growth right now in Juarez and Tijuana. And while overall, these markets are nowhere near at the point where we'd spec, we think we're actually going to see some [indiscernible] activity there sooner than we expect. And then finally, we have a Private Capital vehicle in place with our AFORES fund in Mexico, which does development, and we contribute land to that vehicle and execute development. We have several projects underway right now. So you will not see us monetizing land through sales anytime soon in Mexico, but you will see us monetizing a lot of land through development.","Thomas S. Olinger","And I just want to make a general comment about valuations in Europe. When you think about our European platform again, Hamid mentioned that we've got 90% of our assets in the strongest market, that is absolutely a fact. When you think about current valuations, peach crop values in the U.S. declined 1% to 30% decline, and it recovered 90% of that decline. Europe value is still about 40%, they have not really recovered at all. So if you think about it in another way, if you take a look at our current stock price and value the U.S. and Asia at our cap rates, you'll be valuing Europe at about a 10.5% cap, which is well above sort of the doomsday predictions we saw around Lehman, the expectation that was set for the U.S. in 2009 and we sort of all saw how that worked out. So we actually believe that the markets are pricing in a multiple of a breakup scenario of the euro into our stock price already.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Spector with Bank of America.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is actually Jamie Feldman here with Jeff. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the supply side. I know you kind of touched on it in a question before but we are hearing that a lot of the private developers have partnered up with deep pockets here end even if capital markets tighten up, they'll continue to be able to build. So how concerned are you about new supply weighing on the recovery given your pretty positive outlook for the demands size?","Hamid R. Moghadam","So let's look at the numbers, Jamie. I think for a couple of years, we've been going along at 20 million to 30 million feet of development which is essentially 0. 20 million to 30 million square feet of development in the U.S. which is essentially 0, particularly when you look at the obsolescence factor. Even at 0.5% of base, you're looking at 50 million, 60 million feet a year of obsolescence. So we haven't built anywhere near to just hold it steady. So the fact that development volumes have maybe doubled from that or could have tripled from that, we'll take an extreme, still mean that you're just building to obsolescence. Secondly, you just heard from us and probably every other call you're on that large buildings are only 2%, 3% vacant. And there are -- definitely the tenants are growing. We need big buildings. So I wouldn't be surprised at all of that build-to-suit volume would match what that need is. And by the way, financing, if you have a good credit tenant in tow, financing gets a lot easier all of a sudden, so the private developers, particularly, those that are prepared to work for no margins can put of up those buildings for the bigger buildings with precommitment. So my expectation is that development bonds will go up and -- but I think demand is pretty strong too. So I don't see a situation where we get into 200 million to 250 million feet of demand and 300 million feet of supply anytime soon. I think supply will lag demand and that will chew up vacancy until we get to the 7% or 8% range. And in industrial 7% or 8% vacancy range really means 4% to 5% vacancy, because there's a couple of points that's obsolete or it's in the wrong place or it's in Detroit and so will never lease. So that's our quick take on the -- we're not that excited about the volume of development that's coming online. It's pretty predictable and it's driven by a lot of these larger tenants.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with Macquarie.","Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie Research","Just a quick follow-up. You alluded to someone that's -- opening comments about how you're not giving up rental rates for occupancy, especially in Europe. I was wondering if you could provide a little more color on that, and maybe year-to-date or second quarter, if you could differentiate your leasing spreads between the various regions?","Eugene F. Reilly","Yes, I guess, generally to respond to the question we are not giving up rate to build occupancy. And with respect to what our spreads are, where it's headed, we've talked a lot about this in the past. If you look at the trailing 4-quarter average, we get a very, very predictable glide path to positive territory, and I think we've been saying that sort of the end of this year, the beginning of next year for several quarters. There's a bid asked between Hamid and me when that takes place. But it's going to be in a [indiscernible]. So far he's winning but it's going to be in a relatively tight box. We are going to get there. If you look at fundamentals in the markets, you have positive rent growth in most of our markets at this point. Some are more positive than others. But at this point, the winds are really at our back. So we're not having to buy occupancy. If you look at this year, we've had very little ROE in the second half and hopefully we can make some more progress on rent growth.","Thomas S. Olinger","And Ki Bin, with respect to Europe, as Hamid said in his opening comments, I mean, we gave up the lowest amount of ROE per continent in Europe this year. It was less than 2% and where we are giving it up is like Gene said earlier, in the smaller spaces, the bigger spaces we're actually seeing rental growth. So I think we are on the same sort of glide path in Europe as we are in the U.S. probably 6 months delayed in Europe from the U.S. because we went into the downturn afterwards. But still exactly the same glide path.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Bilerman with Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just two quick follow-ups. Tom, just in terms of the sources and uses. If you think about the $10 billion of dispositions in the 10-quarter plan. By memory, I thought that, that was about 8.5 net base degree of what you would retain through the contribution. And then that 8.5 would then be used call about $2 billion for development funding, $1 billion for your share of acquisitions and the remaining $5.5 billion for debt repayment. And I'm wondering; a, is that still sort of good numbers to use; b, in relation to John Guinee's question, should we be thinking about a potential tax leakage in any of those numbers? And then secondly, just as a second question. In terms of the development yields that you're quoting, what would those be on historical land basis?","Thomas S. Olinger","I'll take the first part of that. So those numbers are still good estimates, Michael, for our 10-quarter plan. I do want to point out though, the $10 billion that are irons in the fire, that is not all of the 10-quarter plan. There are other disposition activity, for example, that's not in that number and there's some other contribution activity that's not in that number that we plan on working on in 2013. So those are good numbers but the $10 billion is actually higher. It's more like $12 billion so when you -- and then when you look at our share, our share should be roughly around 70% of all of that. It will vary by quarter just because of the mix of what transactions happen. So it's difficult to say what our share is going to be of the activity for the second half of the year. But for the aggregate of the plan, it should be around 70%.","Hamid R. Moghadam","The 10-quarter plan is not everything we're never going to do in terms of moving the pieces of the portfolio around. It's just that, that's what we thought we would accomplish in the first 10 quarters following the closing of the merger. Our ultimate list, as Tom mentioned, is larger. I would say our deployment in straight acquisitions is lower than planned. So our net liquidity generation will be higher than planned because of that. But most of our acquisitions were going to be in funds anyway. So on our share it's not as big an impact as it would be on the development activity, because more of the development activity is our share. So we got -- the takeaway is I think, by the way, on the tax leakage issue, I think the question -- the answer is no, there's not going to be tax leakage. And your takeaway should be that we've got a lot more activity out there that we can pull the trigger on than what we need to execute on our 10-quarter plan, and we're -- as result of that, some of the confidence that you see from us is that we do know we have all these different irons to make our plan, so.","Unknown Executive","The second question was on margins.","Hamid R. Moghadam","We see -- every Monday, we sit in investment committee and we look at the development proposals and the like coming through and the margins look great on an impaired basis and my number one question is how are we making money based on the historical land trusts? [ph] And the truth of the matter is some are breakeven, some we make money. For example, in Miami, we make money on our historical land bases. We got -- because our land unimpaired is still in pretty good value, and in some places, we were losing kind of 20% margin based on historical value because we just simply bought land at the peak of the market in 2006 and 2007. So it varies all over the place. But if I were going to pick a number, I would say the margins are in the very low single digits based on historical value and into the high teens based on impaired value today. And I think those numbers will go up based on impaired value.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Spector with Bank of America.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It's Jamie again. Hamid, I was just hoping there's a way to quantify the level of demand you're seeing. I mean, you definitely sound pretty bullish here on the prospects. I mean, can you maybe compare it to last cycles or maybe some square footage numbers around just how deep is the leasing pipeline across your regions?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Okay. So let me just level with that. We'll let you stand and bear -- if Lehman moment is 1 and the peak of 2007 of craziness is 10, In the U.S., I'm kind of feeling it's 6 to a 7, so I'm not outrageously bullish like an 8 to 10, I'm a 6 to a 7, okay? But remember where we've come from. We've come from 1 going to 2 to 3 to 4. So it feels pretty good right now okay? And I'm saying even where sort of 7-ish last quarter, we're maybe 6.5 now. I'm feeling a little less bullish than last quarter because of all the same papers that you read. But actually what I see in the portfolio is still pretty consistent with what's going on last quarter. So that's that way I would describe the business. Now let's put some context. In the '90s, the peak years had 250 million to 300 million feet of absorption and 300 million feet of development in the U.S. And by the way, the U.S. is the only place that there are decent enough statistics that make it worthwhile to talk about. The other numbers are not reliable. And here we are at, I don't know, 50 million, 75 million feet of development may be this year and 150 million feet on absorption. And I think obsolescence is 40 million, 50 million feet anyway. So I think you're going to see vacancy rates continue to march down from where they are to probably 7% to 8% within the next 2 years. And that's when you get real pricing power. We already have pricing power in some of the really good markets: Miami, LA, Houston, those are markets that we have serious pricing power. We don't yet have pricing power in Atlanta but it's getting better. So -- and by the way, we shouldn't feel really great about all this. It feels a lot better than the last couple of years. But my God, we're still 20% below peak rate to rents and they don't make any more industrial land and communities don't want more industrial land. So I don't know when it is, and I don't know when the worm is going to turn really. But if you take a 3 to 4-year outlook, and I know in these calls, we tend to focus on quarters, not years. I'm pretty bullish that the level of rents in industrial real estate is going to be significantly higher than it has been. Only just to recover back to its mid-2000 levels, no great shakes, nothing to get too excited about. But I think because of that I'm optimistic about the prospects to our portfolio. So that was the last question.","Let me thank you for participating in the call, and I just want you to take away the following couple of things that we tried to communicate in this call. The macro economy environment has weakened a little bit but our operations are exceeding our expectations. Look for a particular strengthening in the Americas and continue the outperformance in Europe. We'll continue to exercise a patient and deliberate approach to achieving our 10-quarter plan with respect to realigning the portfolio, strengthening our financial position, streamlining our Private Capital business and improving asset utilization by the end of '13. And while we're focused on these strategic priorities, which are the same ones we announced at the time of the merger, we are also well-positioned to stay opportunistic, flexible and very focused on growth initiatives. So with that, let us sign off and we look forward to seeing many of you at the investor event in September. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Prologis Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Tracy Ward, SVP Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Tracy A. Ward","Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2013 conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. This morning, we'll hear from Hamid Moghadam, Chairman and CEO, who will comment on the company's strategy and the market environment; and then from Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover results and guidance. Additionally, we are joined today by members of our executive team including Gary Anderson, Mike Curless, Gene Reilly and Diana Scott.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates, as well as management's beliefs and assumptions.","Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance, and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filing. Additionally, our fourth quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures and in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. [Operator Instructions] Hamid, will you please begin?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Thanks, Tracy, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to keep my comments brief at a high level today. We had a great quarter, capping a very strong year. We are seeing strong improving market conditions pretty much around the world. The U.S. markets in particular, have been terrific with record absorption and very low levels of new construction. And against this backdrop, our business has been firing on pretty much all cylinders. Operations were strong with good rent and occupancy growth across the globe. Our development business ended the year with solid volumes and profit margins well ahead of long-term averages. We had a record year in strategic capital with 2 major new ventures, China and the U.S. both closing around year end.","Looking forward, we have a very straightforward business plan based on rising rents, value creation through development and economies of scale from growth in AUM. In fact, if you were going to ask me about the prospects for our business compared to last September when we held our Analyst Day, I would have to say that we are well ahead of those expectations. Of course, there are always risks that we can't control such as yield politics, Capitol Hill, the Fed, undisciplined developers. But overall, we feel very good about our business going forward.","Our team has worked very hard for the last 3 years to simplify our company and to build a solid foundation for growth. I believe we're at the beginning of a multiyear cycle when our hard work will pay off in terms of great results for our shareholders.","Let me now turn it over to Tom and let him fill in some of the specifics for you.","Thomas S. Olinger","Thanks, Hamid. I'll start with our financial results. Core FFO for the fourth quarter was $0.43 per share and for 2013 was $1.65 per share. Our share of value creation from stabilizations was $125 million in the quarter and $372 million for the year were approximately $0.74 a share. Investment management income in the fourth quarter was higher sequentially due to the increase in assets under management and the recognition of a $6 million promote. Moving to operations, it was a great quarter and our results continue to do demonstrate the high quality of our portfolio. We closed the year with occupancy at 95.1%, which was above the top end of our guidance range after leasing a record 44 million square feet during the quarter. GAAP rent change on the rollover was 5.9% and positive across all geographic divisions. Cash rent change on rollover was a negative 2.3%. Same-store NOI increased 2.7% on a GAAP basis and 3% on an adjusted cash basis.","Turning to capital deployment. In the fourth quarter, we committed $1.1 billion, with $842 million, our share, in new development starts, building acquisitions and investments in funds and ventures. We reduced our land bank during the year by $300 million to $1.6 billion through development starts of $450 million and land sales of $100 million offset by acquisitions and infrastructure spend. For contributions and dispositions, we completed $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter with $1.4 billion, our share. Subsequent to quarter end, we announced the signing of USLV, our U.S. joint venture with Norges Bank and a contribution of $1 billion of properties to this vehicle.","With a large volume of disposition and contribution activity in the fourth quarter, along with the closing of USLV in early January, we generated approximately $900 million of excess cash available to fund 2014 growth.","With these contributions, our asset repositioning plan is essentially complete. As we look forward, contributions will be primarily from the stabilization of assets off of our development pipeline while dispositions will be part of a selective culling process.","Turning to capital markets. We completed $3.9 billion of activity in the fourth quarter. These transactions were effectively leveraged neutral, but reduced interest cost and extended term. For the full year, the bulk of our capital markets activity focused on the refinancing of our unsecured bonds, effectively lowering the average interest rate by 105 basis points to 4.5% and extending the maturity to over 6 years. We ended the year with leverage modestly higher than we expected, largely due to the timing of the contribution to USLV in January. Look through leverage adjusted for the USLV net proceeds is 35.8%.","Going forward, we have a clear runway with no significant debt maturities until 2016. We'll continue to look at opportunities to get after our medium term expirations if the economics make sense. Even in the phase of rising interest rates, we believe we can further extend our maturities and lower our borrowing costs in a meaningful way.","Now let's turn to guidance for 2014. We expect year end occupancy to reach between 95% and 96.5%. Consistent with our normal seasonal patterns, we expect occupancy to decline in the first quarter then trend higher over the remainder of the year. We expect further strengthening of releasing spreads in 2014, in line with our rank growth projections. We're forecasting 2014 GAAP same-store NOI to increase between 3% and 4%. We expect investment management income including promotes to range between $200 million and $210 million, while investment management expenses will range between $95 million and $100 million. For FX, we're assuming the euro at $1.35 and the yen at JPY 105 for the entire year. And U.S. dollar net equity at the end of 2014 to range between 85% and 90%.","On the expense side, we expect net G&A to range between $230 million and $240 million. This is an increase of 2.5% at the midpoint, which is about half of the expected growth of AUM for 2014.","For capital deployment, our 2014 forecast is between $2.3 billion and $3.2 billion. This includes $1.8 billion to $2.2 billion of development starts with 80% our share, and building acquisitions between $500 million and $1 billion with our share at 40%.","Turning to contributions and dispositions guidance. We expect contributions to range between $2 billion and $2.25 billion, which includes the January contribution to the USLV with our share at 50% and dispositions to range between $500 million and $750 million with 80% our share.","Putting this all together, we expect full-year core FFO to be in the range of $1.74 to $1.82 per share. Core FFO will not be evenly distributed between quarters as Q1 will be lower than the fourth quarter of 2013 given the timing of capital redeployment and seasonality of Q1 lease roll. From a big picture perspective, we're expecting 2014 core FFO growth of 8% at the midpoint of our range driven by rent growth and increased NOI from development stabilization. Netted of the friction to redeploy the $900 million of cash we have to invest. To sum up, we had a great quarter and we have excellent momentum heading into 2014.","With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brendan Maiorana of Wells Fargo.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask a little bit about how you guys are managing the occupancy relative to pushing rate. I think in 2013, you pushed rate a little bit more and that caused occupancy to lag in the earlier quarters before picking up in Q4. How do you think about the friction between rate and occupancy as you look out in 2014? And can you give us a sense of your pushing rents, what that means in terms of order of magnitude? Is that 5% higher? Is it 10%, is it 15%? Any color on that would be helpful as well.","Eugene F. Reilly","Sure Brendan, it's Gene, let me start with that, and I'll kick it over to Gary. So we're really focused on pushing both of those metrics. And obviously, you see a lot -- you saw a lot of occupancy pick up in the fourth quarter. That wasn't because we switched focus to occupancy from rent growth, really, I would tell you more primarily focus on rent growth. And let me also give you some color into what's going on in the U.S. before I kick it to Gary. So in the U.S., we had a third quarter rent change of 7.4% and that actually increased pretty materially to 8.3% in the fourth quarter. So we're having a lot of success pushing rents. We get very low vacancies in the markets and obviously, low vacancies in the portfolio. Looking into 2014, we'll have a rent change of about 10% overall for the global portfolio during the year. And you're going to see that ramp up materially over the year, particularly in the U.S. where we've got a lot of pricing power. So I'll give it to Gary for the ...","Gary E. Anderson","Yes, Brendan, I'll just say again we are hitting the sweet spot right now. We're going to be averaging 95% to 96%. That's a good place for us to be pushing rents globally. If you look at Asia, today we're sitting at almost 97% occupied and we are pushing rents there. You've seen almost 6% rent change in those markets. In Europe, it's a little bit different story. It's a mixed bag. We're pushing rents where we can, particularly in the U.K. and northern Europe. Some the markets in Central and Eastern Europe. And in other markets, we continue to solve for occupancy. And that's really how it's going to be until we get to again sort of that 95% to 96% level. But even in Europe, we had positive rent change and positive rent change for the second consecutive quarter. So all in all, we're feeling pretty good about our prospects.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Toti of Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Maybe I missed this. Did you guys comment on the expense decline in the quarter? Was it a tax adjustment or some sort of weird comp?","Thomas S. Olinger","Yes, David, this is Tom Olinger. I'm assuming you're referring to the drop in operating expenses in the quarter. That was largely driven by a decline in CAM expenses. So we saw a similar decline in revenues. So the drop in CAM expenses moved -- the drop -- overall drop is 4.5%. It moved 3.5% of that 4.5%. And that also knocked down revenues by about 1%. So it was really just an reclass of CAM expenses and revenues and had no impact on the bottom line growth. We also did see about 1% of the decrease was related to better bad debt recovery. So that was a positive that was driving the bottom line.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman of Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Question, Tom, just in terms of the balance sheet. You were very successful last year and you talked about extending your debt duration, lowering your cost. And to do that though, you went in the market and you bought back a lot of bonds. And I think over the course of the year, you had upwards of $300 million of debt prepayment make-wholes and charges, so call it about $0.60 of cash out the door and you'll accrete that balance. And I'm just curious as you think to '14, how aggressive do you want to be at continuing that strategy which is obviously having a near-term positive effect on core FFO, but is cash out the door that you have to accrete over time. And I'm just trying to think about how you're trying to make that tradeoff from an NPV perspective versus a current basis?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Michael, if you don't mind. I'll take that again and remind you of my answer from last quarter. We -- the way we price these things is that the spot time when we're making decision to redeem and reissue at a longer maturity, we try to manage the present value of that entire activity within 1% of the debt amount. So that's up where we start. But the way it actually works is that you end up issuing immediately. But you end up redeeming with a lag. And by just dumb luck, every time we did it last year, interest rates went up in the interim, so actually we ended up instead of incurring a 1% cost, present value cost, we actually ended up ahead on a present value basis. So every transaction was present value positive. Now with respect to its impact on FFO and accounting, you're absolutely correct. That happened to be the accounting limit. But as you know, we don't have a lot to say about what the accounting treatment is. I can assure you that is not a criteria that we look at in making those kinds of decisions.","Thomas S. Olinger","I guess Michael, as we look to 2014, we'll continue to look at our inner maturities and where this math make sense and the economics prove out it's a need. As we said, we'll continue to go after those bonds, because we do have a view that rates are going to go up and we want to get in front of that as best we can. And we think that the long-term benefit to that of locking in those rates is the right thing to do.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Specter of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Jamie Feldman here with Jeff. So we're -- Hamid, we noticed in your comments you were talking about some of the risks you can't control and one of them was undisciplined developers. So can you talk a little bit about -- more about what you're seeing in terms of that risk? And then your thoughts on kind of how long we are -- how long the cycle continues before we really start to see that become an issue and pressure rents?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Sure, Jamie, the reason I threw it in is that I knew somebody would bring it up in the Q&A so I just wanted to get ahead of it. So here's what I really think. Developers have not forgotten how to build buildings and there are lots of them around. I don't think banks have forgotten how to lend to developers, although they're are a little bit more cautious at the beginning of this cycle. But I'm sure in time, with a couple of good quarters and years behind us, the banks will become less disciplined. So I don't think those are the real reasons why the development loans have been so low. I think the reasons are pretty simple. Their rents have not been there given what's happening to costs of land and costs of construction to develop profitably in many other markets in the U.S. And certainly, rents haven't been there to do any development in the smaller building category, because that sector has been pretty low in occupancy and depressed. And that accounts for a big chunk of the market, normally. Where you've seen development is places like L.A. and Houston and a few other markets where rents have been at the levels that justified new development. So I think -- this is actually good news. I think we'll see muted levels of development. We think development next year could be about around 100 million feet in the U.S. 110 million maybe. And we think absorption is going to be north of $200 million. The gap will be smaller than this year. But a hundred -- I'm sorry, all those dollars are square feet. The gap will be smaller. But still, 100 million square feet of gap is unheard of other than last year or 2, we haven't seen that in our entire career. So I think development is going to ramp up, because more and more markets will reach replacement cost rents. That's good news because if the rents actually get there, while there'll be more competition on the development side, I think we'll do a lot better in terms of capturing those rents. So we fully expect development to ramp up over time. But it'll still be a very good environment if you compare it to the last 30 years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers of Robert W Baird.","David B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess maybe for Gene or for Hamid, 4Q commencements, obviously, pretty strong for the portfolio overall, but I'm a little bit more curious about the seasonality and the discussions that you're having today with tenants with housing data a little bit weaker in the fourth quarter, retail sales weaker in the fourth quarter. Now are you seeing any hesitation either on small or big box spaces related to kind of a weaker economic environment in the fourth quarter, are they having any impact on the discussions for first quarter leasing and uptake?","Eugene F. Reilly","Sure, David, it's Gene and Mike might jump in a little bit too. Well, first of all the fourth quarter activity was really, really strong in terms of the leasing. And while -- when the government shutdown took place, there was certainly some concerns a few months ago. But we've actually seen inquiries in overall tenant dialogue increasing dramatically toward the end of the year. And so far, that's continued into this year. So if you look at our starts volume in the fourth quarter I would not attribute that to anything other than it's a normal cycle and the projects we had teed up ready to go happened to start in the fourth quarter. So we remain quite bullish as we look into next year. Candidly, I think we're going to probably do better than we think on the build-to-suit front, because that has picked up. Build-to-suit inquiries tailed off a little bit towards the middle in the fall last year but again, that's all picked up as well. And Mike, I don't know if you have color as well?","Michael S. Curless","Yes I would suggest the pipeline in both the U.S. and Europe are as strong as we've seen here in the last couple of years. And I think the customers' ability is to actually make decisions seems on the increase and so we're bullish relative to just overall activity and our ability to convert that into real volume next year.","Eugene F. Reilly","Let me make one more point on housing because you brought that up. Clearly the housing data has been really spotty. It looks good in 1 month then it tails off. But if we look at where our demand is coming from, it's pretty heavy in that area. So construction materials, furniture and other housing-related activities are clearly leading other segments of our customer base. So maybe they're wishful about the future. I think although, if you look at the overall trends in housing, you're going to see a bad report 1 month. But overall, it's trending in the right direction. And at least our customers are voting with their feet in those segments.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Can we spend a couple of seconds on your same-store guidance? Could you help us break it down in terms of what part is coming from same-store revenue and what portion is coming from expenses? Especially, given that there's a couple of moving parts, this look like your first quarter 2014 number will have a unusual expense comp as well, if you could kind of tie that all together for us?","Thomas S. Olinger","Ki Bin, it's Tom. So if you look at the midpoint of our same-store GAAP NOI guidance of 3.5%, about 1.5% of that is going to come through higher occupancy. About 1.5% of that is going to come through rent growth, rent change on rollover, just high rents. And then about 50 basis points is going to come through indexations, where that don't get captured then in straight lines. So if you got a 2% contractual bump every year, now that gets straight line. But if you are going off of the CPI index, for example, that gets picked up. You don't straight line. You can't straight line that component. So those -- that piece of the rent bumps is about 50 basis points. So that's how you get to the 3.5%. Overall big picture. I don't expect to see any significant moves at all in those numbers related to any one-time sort of items or unusual periods. I think it's pretty clean number.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson of Morgan Stanley.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So just following up on the competitive supply in the build-to-suit demand. Back in the third quarter, I think about 2\/3 of the development starts were build-to-suits. And that might have been unusually high. But during the fourth quarter, that dropped to less than 30%. So I'm wondering would you chalk that up to natural volatility? Or does such a large swing suggest any increased confidence on your part that the build it and they will come approach is going to be successful, given the demand you're expecting? Or is it that you have an interest in getting ahead of the competitive supply that's inevitably going to come?","Michael S. Curless","This is Mike. I would suggest the last quarter, that's such a small sample supply and mix issue relative to the ratios. As we look forward to this year, we'd anticipate build-to-suits would be in the 25% range, which is lower than we've seen in the past, where our build-to-suits have been in the 40% to 55% range and that actually gives us some encouragement. Given our global platform, our customer reach that there's some built-in bias to the upside relative to our volume associated with build-to-suits.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum of UBS.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","You did a nice job in the fourth quarter of working down the land bank a little bit down to just under $1.6 billion. Can you talk a little bit about what your goal is for year end '14 for where the land bank's going to go given your development start guidance? And then talk to us a little bit about what you think the current market value of that land is today, Hamid, given some of your earlier comments on cost.","Michael S. Curless","This is Mike. Why don't I address the land bank. We did put up significant debt in the bank -- land bank this year about $300 million. Which gets us right in the zone as we've talked about for a couple of years in terms of the ideal size. Our work this year is to continue to improve the quality of that land bank and we're down to the last remaining 15% or so parcels that we'll continue to sell out of the system, and end up with the primary parcels to put in production. And we have sold 170 million last year, we'll do that kind of number again this year. And we will very selectively replenish our land bank with the high-quality sites for those sites we can put in production. And Hamid, do you want to address there.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Sure. I mean, if you just look at our development margins, I think we've talked about this in previous quarters. If you sort of pick a number of 10% for build-to-suit and maybe 14%, 15% for a typical spec deal, given our mix, we should be in the 12%, 13% range and we're substantially higher than that, like 10 points higher than that depending on the quarter. So 10 points of extra margin is coming not because we're great developers, but because we've got cheap land. So 10% on land, which is usually 25% of the overall mix, you could argue, could be 30%, 40% undervaluation of land. Now nobody around here is courageous enough to step up and say our land is 30% or 40% undervalued. And certainly, not all of our land is valued that attractively. But I definitely do think we're around 20% undervalued in terms of book value and there's a big arrow north on that. And while we're on land, let me tell you. Based on what we're seeing in most markets, most of this land that's in our books is probably dates back to 2005 or something like that and went through the cycle and got impaired. So the next series of lands that are going to come up are going to be almost 10 years beyond when this land in the inventory was acquired. The world's really changed in terms of entitlement costs, in terms of what concrete costs and what exactions are and all that. So I think the next series of land that is put -- new land that comes into production is going to have a much, much higher cost than the old land. And that's why I'm so confident about replacement cost continuing to go up and rents alongside with it, and why I'm so optimistic that this development engine that everybody's scared about is not going to very quickly exceed demand. It will, eventually. But I think we've got a couple of 3 years before that happens.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel of Green Street Advisors.","Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","My question is related to the last one that was just asked. But can you talk about the replacement cost and rent concept and given that your -- you've increased your spec at all to start this year. Just where you're underwriting you're current development relative to where rents are being achieved today?","Hamid R. Moghadam","I think we generally perform around the globe on spec deals. Margins today in the mid-teens and we're not projecting a whole lot of rent growth, certainly not beyond inflation. And we're ending up with results that are better than that. I mean, that's been really the summary of the experience over the last 12 to 24 months. But I mean in a normalized market, Eric, I think spec deals should be, certainly in the U.S., should have margins and we'll call it 14%, 15% range. We're definitely getting higher than that in some of the less developed markets like Brazil. So, but it should be in that range.","Michael S. Curless","Our placement costs are moving up, I mean, that's clear in basically all of our market, maybe with the exception of some of the European markets, but replacement costs are definitely heading north, as are rents.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee of Stifel, Nicolaus.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","This is, I think, for you, Tom. Kind of a three-part question. First, I think you said in your guidance assumption that net U.S. equity would be 85% to 90%. And if I get -- if I'm getting the definition right, it was 77% per page 30 of your sub. So if I'm correct in saying that, how does it grow from 77% to 85% to 90%? Second is, your GAAP rents appear to be going up around 6% over the last couple of quarters, but your cash is down a little bit, maybe 2% or 3%. Which seems like a pretty widespread for an average lease term of 3.5 to 5 years. So kind of how does that math work? And then third is, does the $6 million promote in your core FFO?","Thomas S. Olinger","Okay. John, I will take that. And we'll let you have a three-part question since we butchered your last name. So on the first on how do we get to 85% to 90% U.S. net equity from 77% today? It's largely going to be from repatriating money. We're -- when we look at funding needs, we're going to continue to push for euro and yen denominated debt and bring down our U.S. dollar denominated debt and move those funds around. And we'll continue to look at hedging opportunities where we see them to be attractive and take advantage of those. So those would be the biggest tools that we can use and obviously, as you know, we've done a lot with moving assets, overseas assets and investment of funds which certainly helps that as well. On your -- I'm going to take your third question here, is this promote income in core FFO? It is. For sure. And your second one...","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And it was in 2013 too?","Thomas S. Olinger","Yes, it was. It's been throughout 2013. And then your other question, your last question was cash versus GAAP and why that spread? We provide the cash rent change. And as you know, we don't track it. We don't use it to manage our business that way because it can obviously lead to unusual fluctuations, just based on how the lease is structured, whether you have a free rent on the front end or the back end or you -- or how the ramp escalates over time, what really matters from our perspective is what the overall economics of that cash flow stream is over the life of that contractual lease. What it is in month 1 versus what it is in month 60 really doesn't matter. At the end of the day, it's what the economics are over the whole contractual term. So yes, you can get some fluctuations between cash and GAAP between quarters just due to mix and how certain things are structured versus what's rolling off. But I would tell you, looking to '14, I would expect that number to move into positive territory just with where -- with our trajectory of GAAP rent change, I would expect this cash number although we don't forecast it, I would expect it to be positive in '14.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Yes. And I think that GAAP is going to get closer and closer and I think in about 1 year or 2, it could flip.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of ISI Group.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I guess I just wanted to circle back on the development front, Hamid. I know that you guys have really not been driven by a specific development target. But given all the comments that you had this morning about how good the business is, how much rent growth is going up, I guess I'm a bit surprised that the development volume's only up around $100 million. And I guess given some of the comments that Gene made about build-to-suits going up, I guess the question is what's that risk that 1 or 2 quarters from now the development [indiscernible] meaningfully?","Hamid R. Moghadam","So Steve, the way we forecast development volume is that we look at the visibility that we have on deals that are pretty much in the bag. And I would say last year at this time, when we're sitting around and giving you guidance, we had about 60% visibility as to the number for the year. And that number has moved to sort of like 80% visibility on what we have. So we're pretty good with the number, particularly at the lower end of the range. Not that many good things have to happen during the year for us to be able to exceed that. And some good things always happen, some bad things happen. But we're really solid on our development guidance type of numbers. I guarantee you this, if there are good development opportunities in markets that we see that we think we can capture, we're going to take advantage of those. But we're not going to drive to some artificial number to keep the perception of what makes investors happy. We -- we're going to underwrite that as we see it game time decision. And again, go back to my comment, not all markets, in fact, most markets are still not at the level where with today's rents, you can generate acceptable margins. I think that situation will change very quickly. So maybe our numbers for the back half of the year are too conservative. Time will tell. But we'll rather start off the beginning of the year at a conservative level and see how it plays out. So I -- if I were going to say -- if I were a betting person, I would say it would be at the higher end of that range or maybe even higher.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky of RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Hamid, just going back to your opening comment there in terms of, and also factoring kind of the supply. We need to talk about the -- being well ahead in the sector relative to your expectations, does that imply that you -- when you look at the cycle this time, you now expect stronger growth relative to where you had presented at your Investor Day? Or you expect the cycle to be a bit more compressed with development ramping up in the back half?","Hamid R. Moghadam","I think, Michael, that we came out with a pretty aggressive rental forecast based on the feedback we got from the investors. We actually thought we came with a very realistic rental forecast. And by the way, we got the same comments back in 2012 Analyst Day. I think on both of those, the market has played out ahead of what we told you guys. And I think at the time we talked about what our expectations were, people thought we were a little crazy and overly aggressive. I'm just telling you, it's playing out faster. I think ultimately, where these rents go, before they get to equilibrium is purely driven by replacement cost in some of these markets. And I would tell you, replacement cost is also accelerating faster than we thought. So on both those scores, I think it definitely will happen quicker whether ultimately we get more rental growth or not, I'm not ready to forecast that yet. That's still out 3 or 4 years. But so far, the signs are pretty good.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller of JPMorgan.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Going to the promotes for a second. Tom, I was just wondering if you could about what's in the 2014 numbers?","Thomas S. Olinger","Okay. For '14 we have a similar level of promote, core FFO promote, so about $0.04 in 2014. And it relates to our USLF venture.","Hamid R. Moghadam","If I can follow up on that, and I think this would be a useful guide for you, because it's very hard to -- for you to get inside our promotes fund by fund and all that kind of stuff. The way I think about it is that we have about $16 billion, $17 billion of third-party capital under management. And most of our -- I mean, we ought to able to do at least 100 basis points over our threshold in terms of preferred return. So if -- and our normal promote participations are 15% to 20%. So the easy way to think about it is that if we outperform by 100 basis points and we get somewhere between 15% or 20% of that for the company, once you net it against the comp effect of that, call it 10% of the excess growth. So call it 10 basis points, call it 10 basis points of $16 billion, $17 billion under management. So we'll be in that 3% or 4% range. It will probably be a little higher in the near term than that. Because A, we're outperforming our benchmarks by more than 100 basis points and B, we're recovering from a pretty deep hole in valuations that are driving returns. But I think over the very long term, it should be on the order of 10 to call it 15 basis points of third party AUM net to the bottom line across the cycle.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Sullivan of Cowen Group.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Hamid, given your comments about development and I guess, Tom's comments about the direction of interest rates. I just wonder if you're changing your hurdle rates for development in any of the markets in which you are active?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Jim, we do, constantly. We actually change not so much the hurdles, but the cost of capital in every market that we operate on a quarterly basis based on what's happening in the capital markets and in each of those economies, et cetera. But necessarily, that the margins that we'd like to get over and above the normal cost of capital in terms of investing in operating real estate, those are fairly stable. I mean, so think of it, if you're thinking about it in terms of bond spreads, we definitely have views -- changing views on what the base rate will be. But in terms of what the spread is, that we want to achieve over that, that's fairly constant. And it's in the range of low teens for build-to-suits. I mean, if it's a great credit, 20-year deal with fabulous credit, we might go down to a high single digit margin. But generally, in the low double-digit for build-to-suits and mid-teens for spec deals, pretty much across the board. Places like Brazil, we might tack on a little bit more in Brazil and China to the margin requirement on spec. But that's generally the guideline.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman of Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Tom, I was just wondering if you can perhaps just spend a moment just on sources in uses. It looks at least that your share, if you were to take the sales and contributions, you're raising just under $1.6 billion. And then from a use perspective, you have, obviously, the acquisitions of $300 million [ph] and then development on a start basis, $1.6 billion. Though I recognize your spend would be very different. And then you're also contributing land. Though it sounds like from Hamid's response to a prior question you made the land bank at $1.6 billion even if you put in and call it, $300 million to $400 million [ph] of land and for the current developments, you're probably reigniting that. I know you have about almost $500 million of cash and you're going to have some free cash flow next year excess of $100 million. So I'm just trying to figure out how in your mind, you're thinking about sources and uses of capital. For next year or this year.","Hamid R. Moghadam","So Michael, Tom will give you a detailed answer. But the real answer is that we have a bunch of non-strategic assets left that we can sell at any time in a very good market. And that's something that we value. If we need capital, we've got a pretty attractive place where we can go to get that. And that's what our plan will be. But if you'd like, Tom can take you through the details.","Thomas S. Olinger","Yes, Michael, if you -- your numbers are really right on. If you look at our deployment guidance, what we gave in use at the midpoint. You would see net deployment growth of call it $250 million to $300 million, not talking about the land bank. But as Hamid said, we have a lot of ways to fund it. Primarily, we're going to be running our line at virtually 0, most of 2014. So we at any one point in time will be able to tap that $2.5 billion plus of capacity. So we're not concerned about how we fund growth.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Yes, let me say one other thing about capital needs. I mean, $300 million for acquisitions. As you know, and I've stated many years in a row. Our acquisition guidance were -- is meaningless, I think. Because who knows? I mean, we only -- we might invest 0, if there are no good deals. We might invest $10 billion, if there are really good deals. In fact, the year I said it's 0 to $5 billion, we ended up doing the merger with Prologis. So it could be any wide range of numbers. So we don't really -- we can't really look at our capital planning in such a debit credit kind of way. We got to look at it more strategically and in a broader view.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Craig Mailman - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Question -- 2 quick questions. One on occupancy, you guys are obviously expecting to trend 95% to 96%. Just as we look into 2015, sort of what are the thoughts about where stabilized occupancy could go for the current portfolio that you guys have? And then the other quick question is just, are there any markets where you guys are still have in place rents that are above market? And that could drag as we head into next year?","Eugene F. Reilly","Yes, it's Gene. Let me start with that. First of all, at this point, we don't have any markets in the Americas, at least that have above market rents, I mean Gary can follow up on this. In terms of stabilized occupancy, that number is 95%. Can we run in L.A. within a 2% embedded local vacancy rate, should we run higher than that? Yes. And we will. But overall, 95% is the number you ought to be working with.","Gary E. Anderson","Yes. No, I totally agree 95% to 96% is how we think about the markets and that's again where we can push rents. In Japan and in China, no markets that are over rented today, I would say. Certainly, markets that were active in and trying to grow in. And in Europe, I'd say 3. France, Hungary and Italy, those are the 3 markets that may be over rented today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question. If you look at CDF spreads in Europe, it seems like even the past couple of quarters we're now back down to 2007 levels. Could you comment on any kind of trends you're seeing in cap rates and if those have adjusted in the past 0.5 years or so downwards?","Gary E. Anderson","Yes, if you go back to our Investor Day, we predicted over the 3-year period, we'd see, call it 75 to 80 basis points of cap rate compression. And we said at that time we thought that it might actually move more quickly. We had sort of spread that out over the 3-year period. My view is very clear. It is moving much more quickly than we had anticipated. I'd say, easily, 25 basis points today. And moving in a positive direction relative to values. I have seen more portfolio transactions over the course of the last 12 months than I have in my career in Europe, and there is capital chasing those transactions, so I expect the trend to continue through the balance of this year for sure.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Yes, I think there'll be a big lag in terms of how the appraisers work through that number and all that. But if you ignore that stuff, cap rates are really falling in Europe and on a real-time basis, much faster than will show up in the appraisals, at least for the next 12 to 24 months.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel of Green Street Advisors.","Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Just 2 quick follow-ups. Sorry, if I missed this before but Tom, did you disclose your same-store guidance on a cash basis?","Thomas S. Olinger","No. We did not. But I'll tell you. So cash same-store for next year should be a little above 4%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Specter of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Jamie Feldman with Jeff again. Tying in for the last cap rate question in Europe, can you talk also about the appetite for assets that you're seeing both in the U.S. and Asia and what you're seeing in terms of cap rates, maybe changes in underwriting assumptions and what's happening, how people are thinking about the rising interest rates any impact on valuations?","Hamid R. Moghadam","We have seen no impact -- well, we've seen actually a little bit of a positive impact on valuations in the U.S. I would say cap rates on core assets are down probably since in the last quarter by maybe 10-ish basis points. And on secondary market assets, maybe a little bit more than that, maybe 25 basis points. As I've said before, I really think other than short-term blips and like in May, I think until interest rates 10-year bond gets to the mid 4s, I think we're good on cap rates in the U.S. I don't expect further compression, but I certainly don't expect expansion. And that's 150 basis points above where we are today, and maybe a little bit more in terms of room on the treasury on the 10-year treasury before we have to worry about CapEx. In Europe, you heard the discussions. I won't go over that. I think maybe there's been a little bit of cap rate expansion maybe on the order of 10 basis points, probably in a place like Brazil or maybe even Mexico, given the EM situation. In Japan, oh my god. I mean, you look at the disconnect between public markets and private markets. I mean, cap rates are, in the public markets are, I don't know, 120 to 150 basis points below where they are in private markets. So I think that will continue to drive cap rates in Japan down. And in China, there isn't enough visibility in terms of transaction volume to be able to report on that with certainty. But I think it's down a tiny smidgen if I were going to pick a number.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky of RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Question for Tom. Just beyond the Norges U.S. joint venture formation there. Do you expect any additional funds for JV formation in 2014 as part of your 2% to 2.5% contribution of forecast?","Thomas S. Olinger","No, Michael, we do not. There would be 2 existing vehicles and as you've seen from the capital raising we've done over the year, a record capital raising. And with the very low leverage to no leverage in these vehicles, we are -- they are -- have a lot of capital and are hungry to grow.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee of Stifel, Nicolaus.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Mike, Carlos has just given all the questions about cap rates and portfolios and all that. What's the status on the IIT portfolio?","Michael S. Curless","John, they actually pronounced your name correctly, but I will not be able to respond to that as you know we can't talk about any.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","What's the IIT portfolio?","Michael S. Curless","Yes, potentially new acquisitions. Sorry.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Brendan Maiorana of Wells Fargo.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","For Tom. Tom, the capital outlook for the year, you talked a lot about that, kind of leveraged neutral throughout the year. If I think about the timing of that, I guess with the USLV venture, I would think that there is more capital coming in the door early in the year and then you put more of that out throughout the year. So if I look at the overall 8% FFO growth year-over-year compared to the kind of the 10% FFO growth that you guys had provided at your Investor Day, should we kind of think that there's an increasing ramp in the rate of growth, sort of in the back half of the year relative to the first half of the year?","Thomas S. Olinger","Absolutely, Brendan. If you look at the components of the growth. If you use Q4 '13 as a -- compared to the midpoint of our guidance. If Q4 annualizes about $1.70, so if you want to grow that $1.70 to the midpoint of our $1.78, you've got about $0.09 from same-store growth, you've got $0.08 from development NOI growth. And then you have about $0.08 of drag or friction from redeploying that cash. As I said in my prepared remarks, we have about $900 million of cash. We ended the year with about $450 million and we generated another about $450 million with the USLV transaction. So as I said, earnings in Q1 will be down for the Q4 run rate and then we're going to ramp back up. And then particularly to your point in the second half, we'll -- we should see core FFO ramp significantly.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Yes, Brendan the only thing I would add to that, I think just to tie it to our investor conference and our forecast for that. Even though we -- we're talking about sort of a 4-year timeframe, within the 4 years, it certainly is more backend oriented because it doesn't have the dilution upfront. And the interesting thing is, given the recovery in rents, and I'm not talking about projected further recovery in rents. But just the recovery that we had to date in rents. Just like on the way down, it takes a while for the numbers to get marked down, on the way up, it takes a while for the numbers to get marked up. So I think whatever momentum is going to come through in this rental growth, is going to benefit us for many, many years. So we -- if we're going to forecast that again today, we would just still say that the 4-year ramp is more backend oriented too, not just within the year, but also within the 4 years. Anyway, that was the last question. Thank you for participating in our call. I know today's a busy day. So we'll let you go.

My name is Kim and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Also note, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Tracy Ward. Tracy, you may begin.","Tracy Ward","Thanks, Kim, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2018 conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. This morning, we'll hear from Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover results and guidance. And then Hamid Moghadam, our Chairman and CEO, who will comment on the company's strategy and outlook. Also, joining us for today's call are Gary Anderson, Mike Curless, Ed Nekritz, Gene Reilly, Diana Scott and Chris Caton.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under Federal Securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates, as well as management's assumptions and beliefs. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K and SEC filings.","Additionally, our first quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures, and in accordance with Reg G we have provided a reconciliation to those measures.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom and we'll get started.","Tom Olinger","Thanks, Tracy. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. I will cover the highlights for the quarter, provide updated 2018 guidance and turn the call over to Hamid. By now you've seen our supplemental reporting package which reflects the harmonization of our operating metrics with the logistics sector we announced last quarter.","As we previously mentioned, the new definitions had an immaterial impact on our operating metrics. During this quarter, we've also taken the opportunity to report our leasing data based on commencement date versus signed date. This change better aligned our NOI metrics and is consistent with how we manage our real estate internally.","Now let's turn to our results. We had a strong first quarter and are well positioned to deliver another year of sector leading earnings growth in 2018. Core FFO reported was $0.80 per share which included $0.09 of net promotes. The net promotes we earned was from our China venture and came in higher than forecasted due to increased property values as well as favorable foreign currency.","Core operations also came in better than expected driven primarily by same store NOI and lower interest expense. Our share of net effective rate change on a roll was approximately 22% led by the US more than 32%. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of global rent change above 20%. Occupancy ticked down sequentially to 96.8% in line with normal seasonality.","Our share of cash same store NOI growth in the quarter was 7.9% led by the U.S. at more than 9%. While these results reflect the excellent market conditions around the globe they were favorably impacted by two factors. First, we had approximately 150 basis points of free rent burn up in the quarter which was primarily driven by higher lease commitment in the first quarter of 2017. Second, we had approximately 50 basis points of non-recurring adjustment that also benefitted same store.","For the full year, we expect cash same store NOI growth to be higher than our initial forecast and I'll cover this in more detail when I give guidance.","Moving to capital deployment for the quarter, I'd like to highlight development stabilization which had an estimated margin of almost 30%. Margins on starts remained very healthy as well. This is notable given that build to suit accounted for nearly two-thirds of our start volume in the quarter. We completed more than $600 million of contribution and dispositions and a weighted averaged stabilized cap rate of 5.2%. Buyer interest for assets remained strong and market cap rates continued to caress particularly in Europe.","Turning to capital markets, we continue to have significant liquidity and the internal capacity to self-fund our growth for the foreseeable future. I'd like to spend a minute on two financing transactions we completed in the quarter. In January, we issued a two-year EUR 400 million note with an all-in effective interest rate of negative 10 basis points. This transaction underscores our ability to access capital globally at very attractive rates. We also realized the gain from the settlement of a swap that reduced interest expense order.","Looking forward, we expect the quarterly interest expense run rate for the remainder of the year to be approximately $5 million higher. Now moving to guidance for the year. I'll cover the significant updates on our share basis but for complete detail refer to page five of our supplemental. Based on the strength of our first quarter results, we're increasing the range of our cash same store NOI by 50 basis points to between 5.5% and 6.5%.","Given the market rent growth in the first quarter, our in place rent continue to be below market by more than 14% globally and 18% in US. This continues to position us for strong operating performance for the next several years. For strategic capital, we now expect net promote income for 2018 the range between $0.11 and $0.13 per share, which is up $0.06 from our previous guidance. We expect to recognize the remainder of the revenue in the fourth quarter.","Given our strong leasing pipeline, we're increasing our development starts guidance by $200 million to range between $2.2 billion and $2.5 billion. Build to suit were comprised about 50% of this volume. We're also increasing our disposition guidance by $475 million to a range between $1.4 billion and $1.7 billion. With this volume, we will effectively close out our non-strategic asset sales. This initiative began in 2011 and upon completion will total $14 billion on an owned and managed basis.","As a result of our deployment guidance changes, we now expect to generate an additional $300 million of net sources for the full year. Putting this all together we're increasing our 2018 Core FFO [ph] by $0.08 they are in the range between $2.95, and $3.1 per share. Our revised guidance represents a year-over-year increase of 6% at the midpoint or 8% excluding promotes. This increase is particularly strong as we expect average leverage in 2018 to be approximately 250 basis points lower than 2017.","The capacity we have to normalize leverage will be a catalyst for future earnings growth as every 100 basis points and additional leverage translates to about 1% Core FFO growth. To sum up we had a great quarter and are excited about our prospects for the remainder of the year and beyond and with that I'll turn it over to Hamid.","Hamid Moghadam","Thanks Tom and good morning everyone. I don't have a whole lot to add to what Tom talked about because our results speak for themselves. While we remain vigilant and on the lookout for any signs of market weakness, we feel great about our business or optimistic about our company prospects.","Let me now turn it over to Kim for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Manny Korchman from Citi. Your line is open.","Manny Korchman","Hi, good morning everyone. Tom, if we think about your increase in starts guidance. How much did the percentage of built to suit in that starts guidance changed and is that what gives you confidence that the supply picture remains healthy as you and others think about starting new projects?","Mike Curless","This is Mike, I'll take that one. As Tom mentioned our build to suit had a great first quarter and almost two-thirds. That should normalize around 45% to 50% over the year which is a very solid number and so that's driven a lot of our confidence in raising our development guidance. 90% of our activities identified and I should point out the spec that we're doing in our parks and cities that are 97% waste, so those two-combined give us a lot of confidence to raise the guidance in a manner that we did.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Guinee from Stifel. Your line is open.","John Guinee","Great. Is everybody smiling out there are you guys pretty happy?","Tom Olinger","We're always happy John. Especially when we hear from you.","John Guinee","Great news on all the build to suit. Somebody told me the other day that Amazon has a new prototype out there 30 or 40 they're considering throughout the country where it's a multi-level but not multi-truck court level elevator oriented six or seven storey 100,000 to 200,000 square foot footprint on six or seven storey prototype that they're thinking about. And I'm sure you're in those discussions with them.","Can you elaborate at all?","Mike Curless","John it's Mike again. We don't give out lot of details about any particular customers plan. Safe to say, we certainly have to happen reading on few of these opportunities and its very early days on that right now more to come on that future.","Tom Olinger","Hey John, let me give you also a background without getting specific on Amazon. Generally, if you want to get closer and you got to shrink your footprint and go vertical. So, anybody who's trying to get close in to where the population is has to be thinking of that and the idea of a multi-level warehouse or Amazon specifically is not a new one. The number of stories may be at some point, but certainly you've seen new mezzanine levels in our building that we've stored with investors. So, shrinking of the footprint and going more vertical would be a logical extension of that getting.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tom Catherwood from BTIG. Your line is open.","Tom Catherwood","Thank you and good morning. Hamid can I speak on that point that you mentioned tenants trying to get closer and closer to population centers. 30% of your portfolio is buildings under 100,000 square feet. I assume this include the number of legacy assets in more densely populated areas. Given the challenge of acquiring land today, how much of an opportunity is available to redevelop some of these older well-located buildings?","Hamid Moghadam","Actually, quite a bit and we're adding to it all the time. And if you look at what we've done in San Francisco we bought a lot of parking areas, a lot of older obsolete buildings. Interestingly they all need to clear heights for rapid in and out distribution. So, some of those buildings work really well and you need to assemble a fairly good-sized site before you can put a multi-storey building on it. So, there are lots of ways you can increase the value of those older assets by just basically cleaning them up and using them for more rapid infill delivery and also eventually for the larger parcels knocking them down and building something multi-storey.","I just want to remind you that the old, this is not a new strategy the old A and B strategy was very much in fill in the larger market. So, and that's probably I don't know a third maybe 40% of our portfolio. So people, you got to offer product along the entire size of the supply chain. You have to have 500 mile product, you have to have 50 mile product, and you have to have the last 5 mile products. So, we're active in all those different segments.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman from KeyBanc Capital Market. Your line is open.","Jordan Sadler","Hi, it's Jordan Sadler here with Craig. Regarding same store, cash same store was a big driver of the gross last couple quarters unconsolidated in particular has been a bigger driver particularly on the revenue side. Can you talk about the driver of the unconsolidated same store growth versus the more flattish looking revenue growth you're seeing in the consolidated same store portfolio?","And then just maybe as a follow-up there's a big spread between cash same store and effective this quarter almost 260 basis points and wondering if there was anything in particular going on there?","Hamid Moghadam","Let me take the latter and you can answer the former. I think on the issue of cash versus GAAP I think we have unsuccessfully described our preference for GAAP for several years. But everybody asked us about cash. So, we basically said okay starting 2018 we're just going to report cash because that seems to be what everybody is asking us all the time. We do have the GAAP number in the supplemental, so it's not like we're not providing that.","But it gets really confusing if you start talking about all that, our share, cash, GAAP and all that. So, we're really going to our share and cash as the relevant number that you guys need to look at or seems to want to look at. So that was a decision that I made. Now Tom, do you want to?","Tom Olinger","Yes. So, Jordan on your first question. I think, I'm not sure if you are looking at owned and managed. But clearly when you look at it graphically the U.S. versus outside the bulk of our share is going to be driven roughly 75% by the U.S. and I don't see anything performance difference between on an our share basis by geography, very consistent.","Hamid Moghadam","Yeah, it's just mix. It's just that our fund business is a heavier percentage overseas than it is in the U.S. We own more of our U.S. portfolio. But within the U.S portfolio, consolidated - unconsolidated, we don't even manage our business that way. We don't even look at the\u2026","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeremy Metz from BMO. Your line is open.","Jeremy Metz","Hey good morning. In terms of your cap rate compression is really held back any pick up in rent growth. At the start of the year Hamid you talked about possibly nearing an inflection point on this dynamics. I'm wondering if you can just give us an update on what you are seeing on the ground over there in terms of rent growth, which markets perhaps are seeing rent growth early materialize ahead of expectation and has your outlook changed at all over there from a few months ago.","Hamid Moghadam","I think with every passing quarter, we get more optimistic about rental growth in Europe. I think I talked about the cross-over point being later in 2019 and 2020, backend of 2019 and 2020. So, we're some distance away from that. But Europe continues to accelerate in terms of rental growth. The best market - I would say the highest absolute rental growth in the past has been U.K. followed by Germany and Northern Europe and probably the laggard has been Poland and maybe France, if you want to put it in that bucket. So, but even those markets are picking up inter-activity and decreasing. So, I think we're going to get more pricing power in those markets and I think rental growth in Europe will be a couple of points this year and we're in that\u2026","Operator","Your next question comes from Jamie Feldman, Bank of America. Your line is open.","Jamie Feldman","I'd like to get your team's big picture thoughts on trade war risk, how people should be thinking about what it could mean longer term for the warehouse business. And then maybe, just as you talk to your clients or maybe your clients aren't really talking about it, but what's the sentiment among tenants about what they are seeing in the press and the tweets and what this all might mean?","Hamid Moghadam","Let me give you the bad news first and I'll tell you the good news next. I think the bad news is that any kind of trade war or which way, I don't think we're quite there yet. But any kind of trade war is bad for economic growth generally. And that will affect everything including our business. So, if the economy grows at 30 to 40 basis points slower than it would have otherwise, which is what I see most people talking about, that's not good for anybody's business including ours. ","Now, on the mitigating side of this, first of all, its' really early in those discussions. Those tenants haven't even kicked in and who knows what the latest pronouncements on TVP - I mean I don't know what to read into any of that stuff. So, and I would say most of our customers, all of our customers that I'm aware of have basically - have their head down doing their business and not paying too much attention to what comes out in the tweets in the morning until there is something specific they can react to.","The other thing that I would point out to you is that most of the tenants at least to-date have been on intermediate material or raw material that goes into production. And as you know we are not that active on the production end of the supply chain anyway. We're at the consumption end of the supply chain. So, it has less of an effect on us than our places that are focused more on production. So - and by the way a lot of these goods don't even go through a warehouse. Steel doesn't go through warehouses, aluminum doesn't go through warehouses. So, I guess the simplest way of thinking about it is that we are concerned by the talk. We are not yet concerned by the action and we'll just see what the action is going to be.","Operator","Your next question comes from Blaine Heck from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Blaine Heck","Thanks. Good morning. Hamid can you talk a little bit about what you are seeing with respect to supply in general and more specifically on construction financing, we've heard that banks and other lenders have recently become a little bit more willing to lend for industrial construction in particular. Is that consistent with what you are seeing and does that give you any concern as you look out into 2018 and 2019?","Hamid Moghadam","Yeah, I don't think the banks were hesitant to lend on industrial construction. They just wanted to lend at equity in the deal which made it more difficult for developers to finance projects. So, you can get bank finance, and you just have to have 40% equity in the deal, which means that you usually have to bring in a partner and that complicates. And the partner has to get the returns and the developer has to get his return. So, it just gets to be a tighter calculus. Having said that, I think actually the bigger constraint on industrial development is really land availability and entitlements. I mean these buildings are getting bigger. The need for flat ground is getting in large parcels is getting to be more intense and the sublicense streams are more severe than ever.","So, that's what's really constraining the supply, particularly in the markets where a lot of demand is. So, Gene, do you have anything to add to that?","Gene Reilly","I mean I think our concerns about supply have revolved around the same markets, I believe the last two years, and that's basically South Dallas, Atlanta, and Central Pennsylvania. And what we've seen is these markets will bounce from a temporary over supply being imbalanced to oversupply, currently all those three are in a supply [ph]. But otherwise supply is [ph].","Operator","Your next question comes from Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vikram Malhotra","Just maybe the last few quarters, you sort of outlined the strategy of willing to sort of push rent at the expense of occupancy to some extent. Maybe just big picture, if we look out over the next few years, certainly there is a lot of room in terms of mark-to-market. So, how much would you have to see occupancy adjust to sort of step back and say, maybe we need to tweak it a little bit?","Gene Reilly","So, Vikram, this is Gene and I'm probably a little unsure of exactly what the question is, but we don't really think of it as, you know intentionally dropping the occupancy achieve a certain result from the rent change side. We think of more so focusing more on what rent we really ought to be achieving in each case. You know, when you are in a dynamic market environment, there is a bias typically in the field managed for occupancy. If you manage to a budget every year, you are naturally going to do that. And we're trying hard to get away from that basic way of doing business. So we're really looking to push rents and we've frankly been pretty successful doing so. But it isn't based on some sort of calculation dropping occupancy. As a natural result, you will leak a little bit, but at these levels of occupancy. ","Hamid Moghadam","Let me make that a little more specific for you. If you are the person leasing space in X market, and you have a vacancy, you have a tenant lease coming over for renewal in the middle of the year. If you don't make that deal, it's likely that that space will remain vacant for the balance of the year and you'll miss your budget, because particularly you don't have benefit of diversification of a really large portfolio like we do sort of at the company level. For that person, that's a big miss on the budget. If you're not careful that sum of all those individual decisions will bias you towards more conservatism so that you want to increase the probability of renewing that lease, with a virtual certainty. And that makes you leave a lot of money on the table.","So, we got to derisk that behavior for the field, so that that individual doesn't have the incentive to just keep renewing at whatever old rent they can get. So, there is some behavioral stuff that we're working on over here that maximizes the bottom-line for the company while individual locations and individual people may underperform and some of their other colleagues will over perform. So, what maximizes the benefit for an individual - or performance for an individual is not necessarily the same thing that maximizes the performances for the company. That's what we're trying to do.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Vincent Chao","Hey good morning everyone. Just wanted to go back to the discussion of land and maybe on the covered land side if you could provide some additional details around what the size of that portfolio looks like to maybe on a square footage basis or NOI being generated today, and you know how long it might take to realize that covered land bank?","Tom Olinger","Hey Vincent, this is Tom. I just want to put our land in three buckets. You've got land we owned, we've got land under option, and then we have covered land plays. I think the covered land plays probably from a total build out and this could be over the next five plus years, but that number is probably north of $2 billion of incremental development and Hamid said, that we work really hard at continuing to increase that pool, but that's the magnitude and there is probably more upside over the long-term.","Hamid Moghadam","And remember there is no - in the short-term it shows up as operating real-estate because by and large you are getting a yield to very close to what you would have gotten, had it had a building on it. So, that that's why it's called covered. So, in the short term, it's an operating asset and in the long-term position redevelopment to the tune of the two [ph].","Operator","Your next question comes from Dick Schiller, Baird. Your line is open.","Dick Schiller","Thanks. Good morning everyone. A quick question on the loan package you guys took our $400 million at a negative interest rate. Does that give you guys comfort to be more aggrieve on acquisition front or if - looking at development starts, be putting more money capital to use into the development pipeline. How are construction cost bouncing your IRR and expected return from that development pipeline.","Hamid Moghadam","Look, we look at our overall cost of capital, weighted average cost of capital and that varies by geography and just because on a given maturity in a given day in a given currency, we can borrow money on a very attractive basis. We don't run around trying to match that with uneconomic deals. So, our thresholds for what makes sense for us to deploy capital remains pretty much unchanged other than big changes in plus capital in different locales, so no change in that. And generally, I would say in terms of the incremental yield that we're looking at for development, it's usually on the order of 100 to 150 basis points of yield above the exit cap rate and if you want to translate that to margins, it's about on the low-side 10% for a really safe and secure build-to-suit and at market land value is about a 15% on spec, but we keep exceeding that because of excess rental growth and excess cap rate impression. So the margins as you've seen have been a lot higher than that and some of our land as older basis so that further boost the margins. But at market, like I've always said spec development should about 15 and build to suit [ph] and we're getting better than that now.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rob Simone from Evercore. Your line is open.","Rob Simone","On the free rent impact on same store, I guess with the 150 basis point impact, does that kind of imply that impact should - or that benefit should trail off as the year progresses, just given that you know you guys have been saying the difference between gap and cash will be about 100 basis points, plus or minus. And then I have a really quick follow-up after that, if possible?","Tom Olinger","This is Tom. So, you are right. The free rent impact as I mentioned was about $150 basis points in the quarter and it was driven by the high amount of the above average amount of lease commencements we had in Q1 2017. If you look at the rest of 2017 by quarter, the commencements are much more in line with what we did in Q1 and if you want to just think big picture cash same store looking forward, and I do think it's going to moderate the spread between cash and GAAP to about 100 basis points.","And if you think about the components of the cash same store NOI, you are going to have rent change, we're going roll about 20% of the portfolio of cash. Rent change is going to be 10%, so call that 200 basis points. You are going to have bumps on the 80%. That's not rolling, that's about 250 basis points of same store occupancy. We talked about a year-over-year occupancy impact of about 50 basis points last quarter and then you have free rent and indexation which is another 50 basis point. So, that's a nice high level way to think about cash same store going.","Rob Simone","Great. Thanks. That's really helpful. And just really quickly on the promote, so the balance of the revenue is going to be recognized in Q4, but will you guys like in past year also had some amortization in Q2 and Q3 that could drag on those quarter slightly?","Tom Olinger","That's correct about $0.01 of capital expense related to -- because of the timing difference spin revenues all upfront and the mode expense comes in over time.","Operator","Your next question comes Eric Frankel from Green Street Advisor. Your line is open.","Eric Frankel","Thank you. Can you just identify the markets at which you plan to sell assets? What is the source of the increased disposition guidance and then second, I think there are a couple larger portfolios in the market for purchase. So, I wanted to just understand what your criteria are for [ph] and whether you're going to end with some capital partners to join in those purchases given increased investor interest. Thank you.","Mike Curless","Yes. Our disposition strategy Eric haven't really changed. The timing of it may have been accelerated because the market, we're leasing up some of our other strategic assets faster and so they're becoming positioned earlier for sale and the market is good so we're taking advantage of those opportunities. But they're generally that remaining non-strategic assets in Europe and the U.S. that we identified long time ago we're not changing that, it's just that we're getting through it faster than we would have otherwise.","With respect to capital deployment, but we look at everything and you know I mean since we are we in the really big, buy a big portfolio and before Katie are within buy a big portfolio. Just that a lot of these instances and quality of what's available and our desire for maintaining the portfolio that we have, so diligently constructed over the last five or six years I mean we've sold $14 billion real state as Tom mentioned.","I mean we really worked hard at perfecting the quality of this portfolio. When we look at a portfolio or most of these portfolios we would have to sell 60%, 70% of them to get down to the 30% or 40% we like. So, obviously we got to price them so we can sell them and still come out as a good valuation for what we want to keep and that becomes kind of difficult to do.","So, we're buying large not a big portfolio buyer because of the fifth issue but in terms of return requirements again I go back to my previous answer we have a cost of capital that is different for each jurisdiction and we need to get an appropriate spread before we deployed capital.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Ki Bin Kim","Thanks. Good morning everyone. So, I kind of imagine that one of the bigger challenges that you guys have is finding smart ways to deploy development capital in size. So, could you talk about where are the next rounds of opportunities are globally?","Tom Olinger","Sure. I mean there we have a really great way of deploying capital which is in the market that's in the high 4% we can deploy capital development which will not only service the needs of our customers but will also monetize our land bank and we control based on our current land bank and the option land and even excluding the covered lamp place we have a close to $10 billion opportunity to deploy capital. So, that's a couple of years of activity that doesn't depend on anything else or any portfolio acquisition or the like and we are - it's not a static number we're always adding to it and growing it.","So, I think primarily the global development platform very few people actually attribute any value to is a driver of our growth and it's a pretty unique and special driver of deployment and earnings growth. So that's our primary way. The acquisition stuff tends to be more value added tends to be cover land played there's got to be an angle. If we're going toe to toe on just the cost to capital race with the latest sovereign wealth fund or pension fund that wants to be out there that's generally not our ammo particularly when you are related to quality that I talked about earlier.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Miller from JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Michael Miller","Thanks. Hi and I apologize. I missed some of the intro comments if this was asked. But looking out to 19 and 20 it looks like you have about 13% to 15% of square footage expiring each year. How much pull forward should we expect on top of those levels?","Tom Olinger","Hi Michael, this is Tom. I don't think you should expect a lot of pull forward to those levels. We're obviously I think you're going to see our churn over time naturally come down slowly because of longer lease duration. So, I wouldn't expect.","Hamid Moghadam","But I think what he's asking is that in a typical year we lease about 5% more than the rollover we have. So, I think in the 15% roll here it's going to be about 20% because we're pulling basically six months of the next year-end. We're always running ahead. Although you know we're getting a little smarter about that. It took us a while to figure it out.","But by moving things forward, in the rapidly escalating market you are actually blocking and lease rates at a lower rate than you should have and that's another behavioral thing that we're working on here. So, I think the answer is, specific answer to your question is about 5% more but there's a rent aspect to that that you got to keep them.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Guinee from Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open.","Mike Curless","Hey, Mike Curless follow-up call. When you're looking at development overall lot of moving pieces, land, and entitlement costs, hard costs, required, yields by you and others as well as rental rates. What do you think are good examples of what's happening to land versus hard costs versus required yield in various markets that you're looking at new development?","Tom Olinger","We're certainly seeing. As Gene mentioned the scarcity is well at this side particularly in the markets that are closer to the customers. Scarcity there is going to be driving up and is driving up land prices, construction costs are being driven up in select markets as well because that's going on with steel. But in the places that we're doing business, we're seeing the corresponding rental rates being there and emerging.","Hamid Moghadam","I got to tell you this construction cost thing is no joke in the bay area. Construction costs are 20%, 25% percent up last year. That by the way thanks to other parts of California too. So, they have been stable for many years and now it's the time for the contractors and stuff and buyers to make some hay while the sun is shining.","So, construction costs are really tough and some of that has been mitigated by yield compression on the required return side, but it's getting tougher to pencil spec development in some of these markets and that's good news I guess for rental growth over time because that marginal product coming to market is [ph] now.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eric Frankel from Green Street Advisor. Your line is open.","Eric Frankel","Thank you. I just want to address the topic of rent paying abilities among tenants. Obviously, the rent increases you are pushing through the tenants especially in close markets. They don't think much of rent I guess is what's been phrased the last few years. Can you talk about what how higher rents fit into your tenants supply chains at this point especially population dense markets and it certainly seems for you know potential multi-storey development in the future that you need rents to be in the $15 to $30 range for the economic to work. Can you talk about which tenant can actually afford those types of prices?","Tom Olinger","Sure. First of all, keep in mind that while nominal rate rental rates have increased a lot in terms of real rants we're still way below the high water marks of the late nineties and early 10,000 substantially below. So real rent is really what matters over time. Second, a lot of these marginal player, marginal in terms of bad but marginal meaning players that need close and can fill space are really substituting retail space so the difference between retail and industrial is blending and they get a lot more throughput in last you know last touch delivery and therefore by eliminating a retail rounds and another a lot of other supply chain costs. I think they can afford to pay a lot more, those particular tenants can certainly pay a lot more for higher cost real estate.","The third consideration is that there are not a lot of these opportunities around to develop so it's not like a greenfield situation where you can go and all these new buildings and all that. But probably the most important factor is that industrial rents are a tiny tiny tiny portion of the entire supply chain cost. I mean certainly under 5% and in many many cases under 2%.","And in particular categories like parcel delivery, food, construction, municipal items and all that you got to be there to provide those services close end. So those tenants tend to be less rent sensitive. If you're distributing tires you're not going to be in those locations because you're very rent sensitive. But those are not the kind of tenants you are finding in those locations.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jon Petersen from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Jon Petersen","Great. Thank you. So, the promotes this quarter came in well ahead of your guidance. Just wondering if you can give some color on why it was so much higher than the outlook you gave a couple months ago. I think it was often the China fund. And then kind of stepping back to the bigger picture. I'm just curious when you provide guidance, how do you go about underwriting what the promote potential is?","Do you guys assume a 25 basis point increase in cap rates or slower NOI growth or something conservative like that to derive the number just trying to think about how you guys I think about that when you get guidance.","Tom Olinger","Jon, thanks for the question. So, our approach on promotes is we generally provide guidance based on smart valuation and what we saw on the first quarter was China values pretty meaningfully and we had a positive tailwind from Fx. The RMB strengthened against the dollar in the quarter and vis-\u00e0-vis from our calculations obviously be sensitive to valuation. So, we give you the sport values on promotes.","As we mentioned the fourth quarter promote is based on fund in Europe and we'll recognize all the revenue.","Hamid Moghadam","Yes. It's more like an option price, I mean it's an effective call on appreciation of the portfolio plus the preferred return. So, it's very sensitive to that exit value and cap rates have been there and rent. So, we do our best we're not trying to step on the scale or anything in. Sometimes most of the times it and the downward compressing cap rate environment it's just been price to the up side.","Operator","Your last question comes from Jamie Feldman from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Jamie Feldman","Great. Guy's sticking with your last statement just on compressing cap rates, I mean what are your thoughts and how much lower cap rates can go or maybe a better day to ask you that is just to talk about demand you are seeing out there for industrial assets and what the transaction market looks like and what underwriting assumptions look like for buyers?","Hamid Moghadam","I think that's based on what we're saying people are paying mid for cap rates for some very mediocre export polio than in the past markets. Like LA some of the cap rates are would lead to that market are in the high three. So. and that translates into maybe a 5.5 on leverage IRR are on a good day. So that's what we're seeing in the marketplace.","And what it should be I don't know, we're not buying a lot of real estate at 0.3 cap rate. So, I don't really know what was the most the first party question. Jamie could you ask the first part of your question again.","Okay, you're gone. All right you can call me privately, I forgot the first part.

Good morning and thank you for joining our fourth quarter earnings call. I will cover the highlights for the quarter, introduce 2018 guidance and then turn the call over to Hamid.","We had an excellent quarter and an outstanding 2017. Core FFO was $0.67 per share for the quarter and $2.81 per share for the year, reflecting an increase of more than 9% over 2016. We earned record net promotes of $0.16 per share for the year. Excluding promotes, core FFO was also up 9%. It's worth taking a step back to highlight that over the last four years we delivered a core FFO CAGR of 13% while also deleveraging by 1100 basis points.","We leased nearly 170 million square feet in 2017 with more than 42 million square feet in the quarter. Well located logistics product remains mission critical for our customers. Global occupancy at year-end reached an all time high of 97.2%, a sequential increase of 90 basis points. The U.S. led the way with a record occupancy of 98%. In Europe, year-end occupancy reached to 96.6%, up 120 basis points sequentially setting the stage for rental growth in 2018. Notably France was up 340 basis points sequentially.","Our share of net effective rent change on rollovers in the quarter was 19%, with the U.S. at nearly 30%. Global rent change was down sequential due to mix with higher leasing in France, Poland and the Central U.S. Our share of net effective same store NOI growth was 4.7% for the full year and 4.1% for the quarter. The quarter came in below expectations due to an expense forecast miss as well as lower than expected average same store occupancy.","On the development front we had an extremely productive year creating significant value for our shareholders. I would like to highlight development stabilizations which came in slightly ahead of expectations and had an estimated margin of 29% and value creation of $583 million. 2017 was also an excellent year for our strategic capital business. We combined several ventures reducing the number of vehicles since the merger from 21 to 8, further streamlining our business. We raised $2.9 billion in new capital from investors around the world and grew our third party AUM to $32 billion.","Our strategic capital business delivers a durable and consistent revenue stream with 90% of fees coming from long term or perpetual vehicles. Turning to capital markets. During the quarter we used a portion of our excess liquidity to redeem $788 million of near-term bonds. For the full year we lowered look through leverage by 340 basis points to 23.7% on a market capitalization basis. We continue to have significant liquidity of $3.6 billion and remain well protected from movements in foreign currency as we ended the year with more than 94% of our net equity in U.S. dollars.","Moving to guidance for 2018 which I will provide on an our share basis. We expect net effective same store NOI growth of between 4% and 5%. This is set in accordance with the new logistics sector definitions that we announced last week. I am proud of our sector for taking leadership on this important initiative. For comparison, our 2017 net effective same store results would have been 4.2% under this new definition. As I had mentioned previously, we had expected this impact to be less than 50 basis points.","Cash, same store NOI growth for 2018 should be approximately 100 basis points higher than net effective as the lag from longer lease terms and steeper rent bumps continues to close. Development starts will range between $2 billion and $2.3 billion, roughly in line with 2017. Build-to-suits will comprise about 45% of this volume. Dispositions and contributions will range between $2.3 billion and $2.9 billion. Given broad buyer interest, particularly for larger portfolios, we may elect to accelerate dispositions and effectively close out our remaining non-strategic assets in 2018.","I want to point out that the contribution volume includes the expected re-capitalization of Brazil. For strategic capital, net promote income will range between $0.05 and $0.07 for the full year, consistent with prior years there will be a difference in the timing of recognition between promote revenue and its related expenses. We expect to recognize $0.01 of promote expense in each quarter of 2018. From a timing perspective, we expect to recognize roughly two-thirds of the promote revenue in the first quarter. For net G&A, we are forecasting a range between $227 million and $237 million. For perspective, we have held G&A roughly flat over the last five years while growing AUM by more than $14 billion.","Related to FX, our 2018 estimated core FFO is fully hedged and we have already hedged most of 2019. We don\u2019t expect any material impact on our operations or earnings as a result of the new tax reform bill. Putting this all together, we expect core FFO to range between $2.85 and $2.95 a share for 2018. Core FFO growth excluding net promote income is expected to be 7%. This growth is particularly strong given further balance sheet delevering. We expect average leverage in 2018 to be approximately 200 basis points lower than last year. For reference, a 100 basis point increase in leverage translates to approximately 1% of core FFO growth.","To wrap up, we had a great quarter and year and are entering 2018 with strong momentum. The mark to market of our portfolio currently stands at 14% globally and more than 18% in the U.S. with an upward bias. This positions us for strong operating performance for the next several years. Our best in class balance sheet had significant liquidity and investment capacity to self fund our growth and to capitalize on opportunities as they arise.","With that I will turn the call over to Hamid.","Hamid Moghadam","Thanks, Tom. I will keep my remarks short as our business and our markets continue on a positive trajectory.","Market fundamentals are strong as they have been in my career. In the U.S., occupancy has continued to test new highs and rental growth accelerated in 2017, led by the large coastal markets. Net absorption was healthy last year, although it was constrained below 2016 levels as a result of limited new supply. Market dynamics today are highly favorable to [indiscernible] and should remain so for the foreseeable future. Today about 30% of our global portfolio consists of in-fill assets which are positioned for last touch delivery. In our view and notwithstanding all the market noise, it will be impossible to duplicate such holdings in any scale for late adopters of the now very popular last mile strategy.","In Europe, cap rate declines have lifted value significantly. While we expect cap rates to compress even further, we have now reached an inflexion point for rental growth in New York. Fueled by improved conditions on the continent, we expect rents to accelerate for the foreseeable future and narrow the gap with the U.S. The lag in rental recovery in Europe will carry our momentum beyond the inevitable point that the U.S. markets normalize.","Looking ahead, there is plenty of gas left in the tank. We are laser focused on capturing rental growth and deploying capital in profitable developments. The mark to market of our portfolio has increased steadily over the last 18 months, which will also extend the runway for continued rental growth. Our scale provides us with attractive capital sourcing and deployment opportunities around the world. We will continue to deliver value by putting our well located land bank to work and by leveraging our unparalleled customer relationships.","I will close by saying that our business strategy remains unchanged. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen and our portfolio is uniquely positioned to deliver strong results well into the future. We remain vigilant about unforeseen risks in this environment but are very optimistic about our prospects in 2018 and beyond. I would like to now turn it over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Manny Korchman of Citi.","Michael Bilerman","It's Michael Bilerman here with Manny. Tom, in your opening comments you talked about the 4Q same store numbers and you referenced an occupancy miss and expense growth miscalculation -- I can't recall what words you used. Can you just delve a little bit deeper into what those were, what impact they had, and how that reverts into 2018?","Tom Olinger","Thanks, Michael. So about half of the difference was due to the fact that we blew in expense forecast by about $2.5 million, which in the fourth quarter, that\u2019s about 60 basis points impact. And again, we blew the expense forecast, we got it right in 2018. So no impact on 2018. The other driver was, same store average occupancy lower than we had expected. We actually had a 10 basis point negative impact of same store occupancy in the fourth quarter. We thought we would see a positive increase. But to give you context, our share of average same store occupancy in the quarter was 96.5% but our ending same store occupancy was at 97.3%. So 80 bps higher. So as you can see, the leasing happened just later than we expected.","Operator","Our next question is from Craig Mailman of KeyBanc.","Craig Mailman","On the occupancy guide, Tom, just curious how much of that is just conservatism from where you guys ended the year versus maybe your expectations about lower retention from kind of pushing rents even harder in '18.","Tom Olinger","Yes. I think it's the latter, Craig. We are going to continue to push rents to get the right long-term economic results and higher same store growth. And we might sacrifice occupancy in the short-term just like you saw in Q4, for getting the right long-term answer.","Operator","Our next question is from John Guinee of Stifel.","John Guinee","If you look at what's happening in the office world and the retail world, base building and re-leasing CapEx are going up significant and investors awareness of these CapEx numbers are also going up significantly. When you are leasing space, are you providing turnkey TIs, as when TIs are needed. How much money are you putting into the base building, how much money is the tenant putting into the base building? Talk a little bit about your re-leasing cost.","Hamid Moghadam","Sure. John, this is Hamid. Let me start and then turn it over to Gene for some color on the specifics. I think the real estate industry generally, for the last 35 years that I have been involved, and that has always gotten CapEx strong. Because I think there is all these weird things that people count as recurring, not recurring, value-enhancing, non-value enhancing. And I think those problems are particularly acute in the sectors you mention. I think probably apartments and industrial are the most straightforward because we don\u2019t have major [indiscernible] rehabs and all those kind of other stuff that goes on.","So generally the problem that you raise is a serious problem that AFFO many years ago tried to address but in my opinion didn\u2019t do a very good job on it. So that is the general comment. I would say many of our tenants invest above and beyond our contributions significant improvements. Typically our improvements once the building is second generation, consists of paints and carpet and maybe a little bit of walls moving around in the office portion. Very little in the warehouse space. Now we have customers that may put in nothing about that and there are couple of occasions where our customers are actually using the buildings for data centers and may put at thousand or more dollars a square foot in there. But that\u2019s really not reflected in the rent that we collect. We are not in the business of over improving space at our expense in temporary and specific customized improvements for anybody just to pump up the rent. I just want to be really clear about that.","Just to make this really simple, the way I would like to look at CapEx is actually to add up all the CapEx and look at it as a percentage of NOI. And historically in our business that number has been about 12% to 15% depending on where you are in the cycle.","Operator","Our next question is from Blaine Heck of Wells Fargo.","Blaine Heck","You guys have come a long way derisking and delevering the balance sheet over the past several years and it looks like you plan to continue that process in 2018. As you touched on, that usually comes with lower growth than you could achieve at higher leverage. So how do you guys think about setting the appropriate level of leverage and finding the balance between safety and growth.","Hamid Moghadam","So, Blaine, I think when we did the merger and we laid out some balance sheet objectives, that was really where we what the long-term capital structure of the business was going to be. And I think at that time we said we want to have a top three balance sheet in the industry and got a lot of giggles at that point. And here we are now with just under 24% leverage and an A minus rating, which we are happy about. I think the recent declines in 2017 and the projected declines in 2018 in leverage are not something that we are doing consciously to further improve the balance sheet. They are just a byproduct of executing our capital recycling strategy and you can't do that perfectly. So at some point when we are done with disposing of our non-strategic assets, which we expect to have that completed in 2018, our leverage will probably drift up by a few hundred basis points and thereby propelling our growth to where we really want it to be in the long-term. But that totally depends on investment opportunities and the attractiveness of those capital deployment opportunities. Bottom line, our leverage is lower than we planned it to be but that\u2019s consistent with the other aspects of our strategy.","Operator","And our next question is from David Rodgers with Baird.","David Rodgers","Maybe Tom, I wanted to go back to one of your comments that you made in the prepared comments about accelerating dispositions in non-core assets as the year progresses. It sounds like that\u2019s not a done deal but I would like to know maybe what would get you over the hump of deciding to sell more. Is that a function of perhaps accelerating developments or finding acquisition, or just maybe new supply hitting the markets that you might be worried about. Any additional thoughts please.","Tom Olinger","Yes, Dave, there is no humps to get over. Just to put everything in context. We sold $11.6 billion of real estate since the merger. I think that represents a couple of companies added in our sector. So we have been very deliberate and active in the dispositions market, probably more than anybody in the business. We have approximately 1.6 billion of non-strategic assets left. Bottom line, we sold 88% of what we wanted to sell in the non-strategic area. And honestly, the improvement in the markets and the strength of the markets is such that we got a lot of these other non-strategic assets at least up sooner than we thought we would. So I think 2018 is the time to execute that plan. Mike, you want to add any color to that?","Mike Curless","Yes, we saw last year, both in Europe and the United States, some of our smaller portfolios were aggregated. There was a lot of buyer interest in some larger portfolios and so we expect that trend to continue this year and we are very optimistic on our ability to execute our sales plan or even slightly more than we projected.","Operator","Next question is from Nick Yulico of UBS.","Nick Yulico","Hamid, I want to get your latest thoughts on new supply in the U.S. and which markets, if any, you might be concerned about.","Hamid Moghadam","Let me do this, let me have Gene start and maybe Chris to provide some color on that.","Gene Reilly","So with respect to new supply, right now we would call out probably Dallas, Chicago and Louisville, as having supply in excess of recent demand. And to drill into this a little bit, as we look forward, Chicago kind of concerns us a little bit but construction is way down in Chicago today. So they had 22 million in the pipe a year ago, now they have 9 million square feet. So that speaks to the conservatism we have seen in the few markets since the -- during this economic recovery. Those are the markets we would call out for excess supply.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeremy Metz, BMO Capital Markets.","Jeremy Metz","Hamid, at this time last year your outlook called for supply demand equilibrium, moderation in rent growth to the mid single digit range. Rents, obviously, far outpaced expectations coming in nearly 10%. And in your portfolio occupancy reached an all time higher at the end of the year, it was above even your expectations at the end of 3Q. And this is all despite the fact you are actively really pushing hard on rents. So it maybe a very simple answer here but are you seeing anything today other than just being one year further into this cycle such that 2018 can be set up for a similar type of better than expected outcome.","Hamid Moghadam","Yes. That simple answer is, no, we are not seeing anything different. In fact, markets at this point are stronger than they were last year. Last year, you may remember, there were a couple of markets that we had seen excess supply, including by the way, Chicago, that Gene just mentioned. And we kind of talked about that and warned the market that maybe some of these markets are getting a little soggier. And then as you point out, we ended up getting between 9% rental growth in the U.S. So we clearly got that one wrong. We were too conservative in terms of what happened. But having said that, I mean nobody is going to go and forecast 10% rental growth into the future. We are in unchartered waters. So I think what we are counting on today is a growth rate much less than that and our assumptions and our guidance is based on numbers that are about half as much as big as that this year. But, who knows, it may be higher or lower and we don\u2019t have perfect insight into the future. So, I don\u2019t know, we will see. My hope is that we will even do better.","Operator","Our next question is from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust.","Ki Bin Kim","Could we just talk a little bit more about the supply questions. How much do you think new supply actually impacts your portfolio. And I will use this as an example. For example, if you have an asset in Carson and LA by the Port of Long Beach, I wouldn\u2019t think new supply [indiscernible] practically impacts your ability to raise rents in that asset. So if you take that thinking across your larger portfolio, how would you describe the real impact from new supply.","Hamid Moghadam","So in some of the markets like the [South Bay] [ph] just to pick the example that you mentioned, it's impossible to add any supply. In fact there is supply coming off and there is negative supply. San Francisco has had negative supply because people are turning [spots] [ph] to build apartments and all that. So there is very little supply there. And what happens is that there is substitution of locations, as people go further out, compromise on some other parameters just to be able to get the space that they need. So let me throw it to Gene for some more color in there.","Gene Reilly","So you bring up an interesting point because if we actually look at our strong markets, there are markets with obviously strong demand and great net absorption numbers. Some have a decent amount of supply as well. And then if you look at LA County for example, the net absorption isn't very impressive, neither is the supply because it's infill. But the rent growth is 17%, 18%. So there are couple of markets who fall in that category today. New York, New Jersey is one of them. 18% rent growth last year. Much of the Bay area falls in that category, Seattle. So your question was really about supply. In many of these infill markets, supply is really one off and as a percentage of what's going on the base, it's very small.","Hamid Moghadam","Yes. I think that is correct. Ki Bin, I think, the key differentiator in rent growth last year was barriers to supply, either by markets [indiscernible] versus other, or in terms of product size. So you saw better performance in smaller versus [big] [ph] product. But you know, let's also now let the question go in terms of the rate of supply growth. There has been a real slowdown in the rate of supply growth. Starts last year and for that matter the supply pipeline, I am sure numbers you follow, up 5% to 10%. But contrast in a market environment like we are discussing, historically it would have been double digits. So there is this discipline in the supply side that also is affecting it.","Operator","The next question is from Eric Frankel of Green Street Advisor.","Eric Frankel","Just have a two part question. One, Tom, I am not sure if you mentioned it, but were the effect of the uniform guideline on same store portfolio construction have an '18 guidance. And by the way, I obviously appreciate you guys working on that together. And then the second question maybe for Hamid or Gene, I think multistory construction has become a much more popular topic in United States. Do you see any pitfalls for any competitors or peers in that strategy going forward? I know you guys are obviously thinking pretty thoughtfully about it.","Tom Olinger","Eric, this is Tom, I will go first. So the impact on our same store operating metric is about 40 bps in 2017. So if you look at on a comparative basis, 2017 under the new methodology would have been 4.2%. The midpoint of our new guidance under the new methodology for '18 midpoint is 4.5%. So we are seeing acceleration on a comparative basis on same store year-over-year.","Hamid Moghadam","Okay. And with respect to the multistoried product, I am not sure how popular it is. There are lot of people talking about it, my knowledge is there is only one multistory building being build in the U.S., but for sure overtime there will be more. We have got couple in the pipeline. And it's all about land value and growth pressures like the one Gene talked about in some of these infill markets that you know well. So I think there is more talk than action. These are not easy things to do. I mean eventually people will get the technology right but it's tough to find a 10 to 20 acre piece of land in a major metro area to build one of these things and all the mitigation measures and traffic and height limits and all that, really make it difficult to do this. So I think it's only in those markets where rents are sort of solidly in the mid double digits, mid to high teens, low 20s, that is penciled to do this kind of construction.","Gary Anderson","Eric, the only thing I would add which Hamid really implied, is that development schedule is much much longer. So this is an investment that requires a lot of patience and you are looking way into the future. So I think it's a different type of development. I am not sure a lot of people in this sector will ultimately jump in. Very expensive and very long schedules.","Hamid Moghadam","You know some of these things can be in the U.S. which is cheaper than Japan, can be easily $150 million, $200 million, and a couple of the ones we are looking at are $0.5 billion in investment. You know they are kind of approaching good high rise office type numbers and I am not sure there are that many people around that can right those checks.","Operator","Our next question is from Tom Catherwood of BTIG.","Tom Catherwood","Following up on NREIT, if I am remembering correctly, I think the talk was that your portfolio was roughly 14% below market on a leased basis. Given the 19% leasing spreads, kind of your share of those this quarter, what's that below market leasing looking like as of right now and how do you see it trending through 2018.","Tom Olinger","Thanks. It's Tom. So as I said, our current in place to market at the end of the year, 14% globally, over 18% in the U.S. Two things you need to consider, is roll and the composition of the roll and rent growth. Those are the two drivers of what that mark to market, how that will move. Looking into 2018, I think there is an arrow up on the mark to market just as we were going to have about 20% roll, and you look at the composition of that role. And as Hamid said, thinking about 5%ish global rent growth. So I think there is an arrow up on that number.","Operator","Next question, Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao","Just curious on the demand side, if you are seeing any shifts in where the demand is coming from over the past quarter or two. And maybe if you just give us your best guess for the year and maybe for the quarter. What percentage of your leasing has been more specifically for the ecommerce channel?","Hamid Moghadam","I will take that and others may want to jump in. So the customer segments that have been active really haven't changed much over the last couple of quarters. There has been transportation, construction, food and auto have also been strong and ecommerce as a percentage of the demand has also been fairly steady. And as we look out into this year, that\u2019s a tough thing to predict because there are several participants in that sector who have big plans for new distribution rollout. How much of that ends up being absorption in this year is really tough to say. But I would guess, on balance I would see an upper arrow for ecommerce in 2018. But those other industries I mentioned also very very strong right now.","Gary Anderson","Just to add a little something on Europe, European market continues to strengthen. As Tom mentioned in his opening remarks, we saw at least significant leasing activity in southern and central Europe, which is a huge positive for us. So demand is starting to pick up in those markets. I think the important statistics in Europe is that market vacancies are down to 5.5% and we are forecasting them to go even lower in 2018. So you should see increased opportunities for rental growth going forward.","Hamid Moghadam","I think construction -- I thin resi construction, resi related absorption is going to be higher next year, or I mean 2018 in the U.S.","Operator","Next question is from Nick Stelzner of Morgan Stanley.","Nick Stelzner","So occupancy decrease in America is for think [fifth] [ph] straight quarter. Can you provide some color on what's driving that and do you expect to inflect any time soon? Thanks.","Tom Olinger","Yes. I think if you are looking at owned and managed, you are going to see Brazil drag that down a bit. If you remember, we consolidated Brazil in the third quarter, and occupancy on that owned and managed portfolio was 78%, kind of staying there. We obviously think it was a great time for us to get in there and get that portfolio. And more to come on Brazil but I think we are definitely going to see a turnaround there in 2018. But when you look at the U.S. for example, in Q4 U.S. was a record 98% occupied. All time record.","Hamid Moghadam","I mean outside of Brazil the occupancy was very high. Very high in Mexico, I might add.","Operator","Next question from Joshua Dennerlein of BoA Merrill Lynch.","Joshua Dennerlein","Question on your development pipeline. Should we expect maybe a mix, a shift between spec and build to suit development going forward. I was thinking there would be more build to suit.","Mike Curless","Josh, this is Mike. Last year we did about 47% in terms of build to suit. As we look out over the next year, we expect to range in similar zone and I think why we are seeing those high levels of build to suits driven margin because of dearth of type of space our customers want to be, particularly in global markets. And we expect that to be a number that feels pretty solid for 2018.","Hamid Moghadam","Well, 47% historically is super high. So probably the number across the cycle is more like 25%. So I don\u2019t know of anybody get used to those kinds of numbers. We were surprised by that number being that high.","Operator","Next question from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI.","Steve Sakwa","I know there has been a lot of questions on development. I guess Hamid I am just trying to think through the land bank and your desire to get the land bank down but also continue the development pipeline. How are you guys just sort of thinking about replenishing land today and what are you seeing in terms of land across and development yields on kind of new land being purchased.","Hamid Moghadam","Yes, Steve. Our goal is to get down to two years of development of land supply and our development guidance, I mean it bounces around every year but you may -- actually you will remember that back in 2010, the dark days, 2010, 2011, I think the first analyst meeting we had as a merge company, we talked about development volumes being between $2 billion and $3 billion in aggregate. Not our share but in aggregate. And that\u2019s exactly where we are. We are now sort of around $3 billion in aggregate. And roughly the land that goes with that is about $750 million type of land. So about a quarter of the total investment volume. So if you literally want to own two years of land, that\u2019s about $1.5 billion of land and that\u2019s more land than we currently have on the books. Maybe not in market value but just in terms of book value. So we are pretty close to our long term goals with respect to land. We may want to push it a little bit lower but not too much lower than where it is because we need that land to support our business.","Getting land is very very difficult today. In the markets that we care about the most. The exactions, all the fees that people pile on, the traffic mitigation measures and all that, are getting to be really hard. So some of these parcels of land, you got to work on for a number of years before you get entitlements for it. We are pretty fortunate that we have land for almost $8 billion, $9 billion of development on our books. But on the margin we have been adding land, call it at the rate of maybe $400 million a year and chewing through land at the rate of maybe $600 million to $700 million a year. So waddling down the land bank by $200 million to $300 million a year. And that\u2019s how we have gotten down to where we are.","About $150 million of our land bank is what we call C and D category land bank. Probably more details than you care about, but those are essentially parcels of land that we inherited that we wouldn\u2019t have bought. And those things are slower to absorb. So you kind of mentally have to put $150 million of land bank on this side and say, look, we are not going to monetize that. We are going to over time sell it, probably to users and alternative uses. We chewed through a lot of that lands and that number was more like $450 million when this exercise started. So we are getting near the end of that but I kind of mentally figure out the best outside of the target land bank that we would like to have.","Tom Olinger","Steve, the other thing to think about from the land that you don\u2019t see show up in our land bank is our redevelopment opportunities. So when you think about multistory, that\u2019s going to go on land that\u2019s either sitting in the operating portfolio today or sitting down in other assets. I think we have done a really good job over the last four to five years of buying what we call covered land plays, which has some sort of income stream, whether it's a truck terminal or something like that, where we are going through entitlement, we are flipping a coupon. So that\u2019s over and above the $9 billion or $10 billion of development build out potential that we have that Hamid mentioned. So there is more redevelopment opportunity there than that just sits in the land bank.","Hamid Moghadam","Plus we have an increased emphasis on option agreements which will continue to add capacity to it.","Operator","Next question is from Jon Petersen of Jefferies.","Jon Petersen","As we are thinking about tax reforms and its impact on demand for warehouses, I am just curious as you talk to your customers, and I know you guys have a committee of customers you are talking. I am not sure you have spoken with them since the tax reform bill. But I am thinking about demand for leasing warehouse space and one aspect of it is expensing equipment over the next five years and if that might cause businesses to accelerate growth plans and buy equipment that will obviously need warehouses to go in. I know if you have any bigger thoughts on the tax reform bill or may be that specifically in what it means for warehouse demand.","Hamid Moghadam","So we essentially get two questions about tax reforms. One is the one that you asked and let me just answer that one. No, we haven't had a customer advisory meeting in January yet. So other than casual kind of decisions, we haven't had a really organized high level meeting with a bunch of customers to report any trends. But I think the net of the tax program is going to be that U.S. growth by people who know a lot more about these things than I do, is projected to be faster by about 25 to 50 basis points. So that additional growth is going to translate to obviously more demand for our kind of product.","The second question, and I don\u2019t know what but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it's 30 million, 40 million feet more absorption if the product were there. I am not sure the supply is going to respond quickly enough for that product to be there. But I think it's going to be good for business. The other question we have gotten is, whether the tax act, the new tax act, is going to shift more of the demand to the middle of the country because the coasts got hammered in the tax thing because of salt and all those other stuff. On the margin, the 25% to 50% extra GDP growth is going to lift boats. I am not smart enough to know whether that\u2019s going to lift the boats in the Midwest more than the ones on the coast but I think all of those boats are going to be raised and there could be that some of the lower tax states and with lower residential cost and lower tax rates we get a disproportionate benefit. But I think pretty much everywhere will get a benefit as a result of that higher GDP growth.","Operator","Next question from Manny Korchman of Citi.","Manny Korchman","If we think about sort of shadow supply and maybe using the [same clubs] [ph] closures and conversions as an example of that. How much of that type of supply do you think about or worry about coming and disrupting maybe more sort of vanilla construction or is it down where you guys are doing.","Hamid Moghadam","Manny, that\u2019s a good question and I think that\u2019s a problem that certainly has hurt the office sector in the past at inflexion points. We got a pretty good handle on shadow space because we track utilization on a quarterly basis and we have done that pretty consistently for the last ten years. So we both have sort of period to period comparisons and actually absolute level comparisons. Right now utilization continues to be at the highest level it's been, within very few points of the highest level it's been. So there is not a lot of slack in the system and people are not hoarding space the way there were in the first dotcom in the early 2000s where a lot of people were just leasing twice as much as they needed in the hope of burying into it. I think people have been pretty disciplined after the global financial crisis and then as the vacancy rates went from 14% to 4.5%-5%, they just don\u2019t have the opportunity of doing that. So we don\u2019t think there is a lot of shadow space at all.","Operator","Next question is from Craig Mailman of KeyBanc.","Craig Mailman","Just two quick ones. I guess, first, on the 1.06 billion in non-core that you guys would still sell over time. Kind of what's the growth rate or internal growth rate on that versus the rest of the portfolio. And then second, just on the development starts, you guys are about 400 million higher on the initial guide here versus where you were last year. I guess I am just curious what the current visibility on the 2 billion to 2.3 billion at this point. And just a sense given, I guess the mix of built to suit to spec, kind of how we should think about margins.","Tom Olinger","Craig, it's Tom. On your first question regarding the relative return on what we are selling versus what our in place portfolio, I don\u2019t have those numbers readily available. But clearly the rent growth that we are seeing in our whole portfolio is substantially greater than the rent growth in what the non-core markets that we are selling.","Hamid Moghadam","Yes. Historically that number has been about a cap rate differential of about 150 basis points across the cycle and a rental growth benefit of 250 basis points. So there has been roughly 75 to 100 basis points of free lunch, if you will, by taking it slightly lower yields in the more constrained markets and making it up in growth. I am not smart enough to know exactly what it is on the mix that we are selling. Mike, what don\u2019t you talk about visibility of the development?","Mike Curless","In terms of visibility, it's well over 90%. I would say that\u2019s as good as it has been since the merger which gives our confidence in our forecast year. And then margins, your question there, you should expect us in the mid to high teens and good solid numbers based on the level of activity as well too.","Hamid Moghadam","And Craig when you look at our share of starts, they are pretty comparable year-over-year.","Tom Olinger","Yes, maybe that\u2019s the confusing number. I mean the total development volumes are more like 3 billion and our share is in the low -- 2.22.","Operator","Next question is from [David Harris of Unit Plan] [ph].","Unidentified Analyst","I have a question on protectionism. Could you give some comment as to your thoughts on the impact if the United States would walk away from NAFTA? And secondarily, could you give also some comments on your thoughts over the Brexit in Europe next year.","Hamid Moghadam","Yes, welcome back, David, haven't talked to you in a while. With respect to protectionism, obviously there is a lot of protectionism but as you know, we are not so focused on the production side of that supply chain. We are focused on the consumption side of that supply chain. So frankly as long as people in LA and New York and all that continue to have to feed and clothe themselves, I really don\u2019t care whether that inventory is coming from China or Kansas or Mexico. So we are really focused on where the consumption takes place and that\u2019s where we have chosen to concentrate our investments. I think if your concern is mostly on the production side which it would have to be because all kinds of interference whether it's trade interference or tax regimes or whatever can shift that around, I think you are probably better off talking to people focused on those strategies. I don\u2019t know much about that topic.","With respect to Brexit, look a lot of people got all excited about Brexit when it was first announced as a surprise. I think our stock in one day went down five bucks but our occupancies in the U.K. went up and we had significant rental growth. And I would say the U.K. has slowed a little bit from that torrid pace back in 2016 but together with Germany it's probably, U.K. and Germany are the two best markets we have in Europe, and I would put them up against any markets anywhere including the U.S. So we have not really seen any evidence of Brexit having an impact yet and when it happens I don\u2019t think it's going to be material either. Because what happened is that Brexit scared away a lot of capital and a lot of development that would have occurred didn\u2019t occur. So the market actually ended up being tighter in the U.K. and I think that will continue.","Operator","Next question is from John Guinee of Stifel.","John Guinee","Another thing that came up, Hamid, my understanding is that Amazon has 30, 35 build to suits out there in the market which is a new prototype, much smaller footprint, maybe 100 to 200,000 square feet, but 75 feet clear height, multiple levels. Highly automated elevator systems. Can you comment on that prototype and how you feel about it?","Hamid Moghadam","So I can comment but I am going to let Mike comment because I am not sure what part of our discussions with them are confidential, what part of them aren't confidential. So Mike, why don\u2019t you talk about that?","Mike Curless","Yes, John, there is certainly a lot of buzz about the sizable rollout they have underway. But just to put some things in perspective, in any given year there is a massive amounts of RFPs that are suggested in those would could play out over a couple of years. This years, yes, a little big different. Some more unique approaches to the buildings. It's very early days on that and we are taking a hard look at that, just like we did to other buildings we have done at Amazon and to the extent they are very unique or we have the opinion that it would be better serve to sell those, we will certainly look at doing that as well. So very early in the process but you can always look at Amazon for being an innovator and we will keep up with them as well too.","Hamid Moghadam","Yes. The only thing I would add to that, John, is that look, Amazon has pretty much got the same strategy we do. They want to be near where the consumers are. And those market are, I should say, we have the same strategy as them, Amazon. I suppose we went public earlier, so. But look it's kind of being harder and harder to find large plots of land that support single storey, 800 million square foot type buildings in these urban areas. So they need to be able to squeeze that much business into a smaller footprint by going vertical. And even in the 800 million square foot, they mezzanine them at three levels. So operating multiple levels with low clear heights are not anything unusual for them by any stretch. But I think the key point is what Mike of sort of mentioned. Any building that we do for Amazon or anybody else, we go through the analysis, do we want to own this building in a soft leasing market without Amazon renewing. And if the answer to that is that the building is fungible and divisible and we can lease it to a normal tenant, we keep it.","If the answer is, no or maybe, we will sell those and there are planning people that want to buy that credit for 15 years. So there is not a shortage of capital for that kind of thing. And we have to do that otherwise they will end up being a very big portion of our portfolio and we kind of want to manage it to a lower number than our potential business opportunity with them.","Operator","And our last question is from Manny Korchman of Citi.","Michael Bilerman","Hey, it's Michael Bilerman. Hamid, Prologis has been a leader in sustainability certainly within the real estate industry but I would say across all corporate. I guess how do you sort of react and sort of what's the impact to the new tariff and taxes on solar panels. How does that impact your desire to get up to 200 megawatts of self-sustaining power? Is it generally impacting the U.S. or the other countries that you are doing it in? Things like that.","Hamid Moghadam","So, Michael, you know there are so many different proposals coming in the early morning of everyday that we don\u2019t really have the time or the ability to react to every single one of them. We will continue to have that commitment but as I have always said to our people, we don\u2019t do this stuff to go to heaven, we do this stuff because it's good for our customers and we can make money doing it. Sustainability is a good investment because in the long-term the life cycle cost of operating the building are more favorable to our customers and eventually that translates to rent. So to the extent that tariffs or anything else might change those dynamics on the margin, the economics will change and we will do less in some areas and more in other areas. Once there are some specific proposals to react to, I can probably give you a more clearer answer. But we have never been in the business of saying, okay, we shall have x megawatts of power on our roof and therefore we are going to do that, whether or not it pencils or not. It's always been an economic calculation for us.","Michael, I think you were the last question. So thank you again for your interest in Prologis and we look towards to seeing all of you soon in the next couple of months. All the best. Take care. Happy New Year.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

My name is Chris and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Also note, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Tracy Ward. Tracy, you may begin.","Tracy Ward","Thanks, Chris, and good morning everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2018 conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations.","I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under Federal Securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings.","Additionally, our second quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures and in accordance with Reg G we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. On April 30th, we announced a merger between Prologis and DCT. Materials regarding the transaction are posted on both companies website and are also available on the SEC\u2019s website. Including the joint proxy statement that contains detailed information about the transaction. This call will focus on our second quarter 2018 results and the Company will not provide comments beyond what is included in our prepared remarks.","This morning, we'll hear from Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover results and guidance; and then Hamid Moghadam, our Chairman and CEO, who will comment on the Company's outlook. Also with us today for today's call are Gary Anderson, Chris Caton, Mike Curless, Ed Nekritz, Gene Reilly, Diana Scott and [Coleen McAllen] who is in her second week with us.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom and we'll get started.","Tom Olinger","Thanks, Tracy, and good morning and thanks for joining our second quarter call. With very few exceptions supply in our markets remain in check and net absorption continues to be strong despite being constrained by limited availability. Market rents across our portfolio are growing faster than our prior forecast. We\u2019re raising our estimates for full year global rent growth at 6.5% with the U.S. up 70 basis points to over 7% and Europe up 140 basis points to almost 5%. The spread between our in-place leases and market rents further widened in the quarter and now stands at 15% globally, and 90% in the U.S. extending the runway for strong same store NOI growth.","Looking to results, we started the year with great momentum and that carried into the second quarter with core FFO of $0.71 per share. Our share of cash same store NOI growth was 7% and led by the U.S. at 8.2%. These results were exceptional as quality well located space remains in high demand. Our share of net effective rent change on roll was 20.6% and led by the U.S. at over 30%. Occupancy was up 60 basis points sequentially to 97.4%. Leasing volume totaled nearly 39 million square feet with an average term over five years. This includes a record 9.6 million square feet of development leasing of which 3 million was in China.","Stabilizations in the quarter had an estimated margin over 40% and value creation of $240 million. So far this year, we\u2019ve earned more than $220 million in realized development gains. Our second quarter disposition and contribution activity was light, but we expect our capital recycling to accelerate in the back half of the year. You'll note a significant increase in both our wholly-owned and fund assets classified as held for sale. Given that we have several major transactions under contract and escrow funds have gone hard.","With respect to the pending transaction with DCT, their shareholder meeting has been set for August 20th, and we expect to close within a few days following the vote. The integration process is going very well and we look forward to adding their high quality assets to our portfolio and welcoming some of their employees to the Prologis team. We continue to expect $80 million in day-one synergies as well as $40 million of future annual revenue synergies and incremental development value creation.","With one of the best balance sheets of business, we have access to attractive sources of capital. As we previously announced during the quarter, we issued $700 million of bond that had a weighted average interest rate of 4.1% and term of almost 19 years. We remain very well-positioned to self-fund our deployment and capitalize on opportunities as they arise given our $4 billion of liquidity, and over $6 billion in potential fund rebalances.","Moving to guidance for the full year, I'll cover their significant updates on our share basis but for complete detail refer to Page 5 of our supplemental. Also note that our guidance does not include accretion from the pending DCT acquisition. We will be updated guidance to incorporate the impact from this transition, transaction after closing. Based on the strength of our second quarter results, we are increasing the midpoint of our cash same stores NOI range by 50 basis points to 6.5%. As a result of valuation gains in Europe, we now expect our net promote income for the full year to be higher by $0.01 per share and now range between $0.12 and $0.14 per share. Remaining net promote income can will be earned in the fourth quarter.","With an expanding built-to-suit pipeline and accelerated lease of our perspective elements, we are raising our starts guidance by $100 million to now range between $2.3 billion and $2.6 billion. We're also increasing our contribution guidance by $150 million to now range between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion. We\u2019re raising the midpoint of a realized development gains by 75 million to now range between $450 million and $500 million, driven by higher valuations across our development portfolio. At the midpoint, our share net deployment proceeds will be approximately $350 million which is $50 million higher than our prior forecast.","As you think about our earnings trajectory for the back half of the year, you need to consider the lag between when sources are generated and when they are put to work primarily through development. As a result, we expect core FFO for the third quarter to be about a $0.01 down from the second quarter. Again, this does not include the impact from DCT. Putting this all together for the full year, we're increasing our 2018 core FFO range between $2.98 and $3.02 per share up $0.02 at the midpoint.","To put this in context when we laid out our three year plan at our investor event in 2016, we called 7% to 8% annual growth, excluding promotes, at the midpoint of our 2018 guidance will average 8.7% for the first two years far surpassing our plan. Importantly, this was achieved while realigning our portfolio and reducing our leverage by over 400 basis points. As a reminder every 100 basis points of leverage translates to about 1% of core FFO growth. Looking ahead, the combination of our significant embedded rent upside, the build out of our land bank and leverage capacity will continue to fuel our sector leading performance.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Hamid.","Hamid Moghadam","Thanks, Tom. I want to touch on our long-term outlook, but first let me comments on trades and tariffs since we've been getting a lot of questions on this topic lately. My insights aren't unique, but what we hear from our customers so far is that they are moving forward with their growth plans and we have yet to see any change in sentiment or decision-making on the ground. We remain cautiously optimistic as the vast majority of our portfolio is located in large consumption markets, including a significant focus on city distribution and last touched delivery; however, escalating trade tensions are negative for the global economy and it came to attack some consumers.","If today's political rhetoric intensifies and translates into actual protectionist policies, it will be a negative for all businesses in the U.S. and abroad including ours. At the same time, our portfolio and balance sheet are in the best shape they ever been and any dislocation may actually create opportunities for us. We've built on enterprise and team that enables us to execute on sizable transactions such as DCT, while delivering best-in-class results and carrying out the platform initiatives that I discussed in our last call.","In closing, I\u2019d like to point out to the perplexing lag in our recent relative stock price appreciation, in spite of our sector leading operating performance and strong guidance. Some of this lag is surely attributable to pending DCT transaction, which has helped to smaller companies in sector. I suspect the rest of it is caused by all the rhetoric around trade and tariffs. As the industry's dull weather and the only global company, we believe this factor has had a disproportionate effect on our company, company's recent relative performance. Regardless, we remain laser-focused on executing our long-term business plan and are confident that we'll continue to generate earnings growth significantly ahead of the pack.","Chris, let's open up the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Craig Mailman of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Craig Mailman","Maybe a two-part question here. Hamid, appreciate your comments on tenant sentiments. Just curious though you guys look at the portfolio maybe where do you see the most risk? Or I guess least exposure to consumption in the portfolio? And then just as you guys are thinking about development starts and you guys are contemplating 2019. How do the tariffs and material costs kind of weigh your, at least, appetite here to be bidding out projects and other things in advance of maybe buying out the materials?","Hamid Moghadam","With respect to the market that\u2019s probably most exposed to trade and tariffs, I\u2019d say the broader markets in Mexico are part of that because they are more of the manufacturing and transshipment market than a consumption market. But you got to understand that a lot of the value added is material imported from the U.S. with some labor value added to it and then re-exported to the U.S. So, you really need to focus on just the incremental value added in Mexico, and that for a lot of commodities is not a huge number. So, the tariffs would only apply to that. For example, a lot of the steel and actually aluminum that\u2019s imported for car manufacturing comes through the border end of the bank.","There are also some manufacturing markets in the Midwest that are -- could be exposed to this because a lot of those are relying on first level order material that are imported in the U.S. And so far, I think all those effects are small. With respect to our decision making as to the start of development and all that, so far the increases in construction costs have been in line with our expectations, and really it's on the next series of projects that we are going to see any impact from material increases.","Those are all going to be under [indiscernible], and as you've seen from our strong margins, we have a lot of room to absorb those kinds of cost increases. But more importantly, those cost increases are going to translate into a higher rent because they little over time curtail supply. So, you can't just look at the cost increases, you got to also look at the impact of that on supply and rent growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi. Your line is open.","Manny Korchman","Real estate typically a lagging indicator rather than being a leading indicator and so I guess as we think about all of this trade policies and the rhetoric that\u2019s going on. What are the indicators or data points that you\u2019re seeing that give you the confidence that is not leading into effectively the demand quotient for your assets?","Hamid Moghadam","So, consumption is by far the largest driver of our demand for our business and it accounts for about 70% of GDP. So, GDP growth and consumption growth within as a subcategory, those are probably two biggest drivers of demand. The second biggest driver of demand is reconfiguration of the supply chain. I mean the long-term reconfiguration of the supply chain. But on top of that, we of course have the much more recent and stronger reconfiguration or addition, I should say because of e-commerce. So that by far overwhelms any slowdown, if you will, in the other factors that we\u2019ve seen so far. We don't really look at supply and demand as a way of projecting into the future as to what our underwriting will be. Those are the results of those other factors. We really look at much more the leading indicators that effect supply and demand as you pointed out.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Ki Bin Kim","So, 20% of DCT's portfolio was in California and given that the merger triggered by 13. Could you talk a little bit about how this increase will impact the overall costs of tenants in California? And is there some concern to your ability to raise rents after the tax increase? And on -- and when does that actually kick in?","Gene Reilly","Yes, so this is Gene. I'll take than one. So, the proposal for effectively split rolls is not going to be on the 2018 ballot, so it\u2019s not on the ballot now. It may appear next year or more likely in 2020, so the actual timing is probably a couple years out from now. Now having said that, dealing with DCT assets, I think we\u2019re better off on the average California commercial property owner given the vintage over our properties.","Over the long-term, our tax exposure is likely to increase. But if you boil this down to what -- how does it affect our customers' costs? It\u2019s less than 0.5% of our customers supply chain costs and I am talking about what we see as a likely increase in taxes which would be about 5% overall. So, I think it\u2019s going to take awhile to take hold and I think ultimately the impact isn\u2019t really that great.","Hamid Moghadam","Yes, if you look at our overall California business, for example Southern California is 72 different store leads in the deal for the licensed portfolio and then in about 20 plus million feet in the Bay Area and the likes. So, we probably have a 100 million square feet in California thereabout from numbers, and I would say and I haven\u2019t done the math with this, but I am pretty sure that our strategy of focusing in California started at least a decade sooner than everybody's. So, it\u2019s likely that our cost basis is significantly lower than other people. So until you have this split role and everything rose to markets, we will actually have an advantage and after that will be on par with whoever else is supplying space. So, I view our position is actually very favorable.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jamie Feldman of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Jamie Feldman","So, I think your percentage of built-to-suit and you development starts in the quarter was down about 25%. So, can you talk about how we should expect that to trend going forward? And going back to Craig's first question, I think the last part of this question was, how do you think about planning going forward even looking ahead to 19 for development starts given so much uncertainty out there? You maybe talk about what you think the mix could be farther out and your conviction and the pipeline?","Mike Curless","Jamie, this is Mike Curless. I think you really can't look at two quarters where built-to-suit percentages to get a trend. Currently, if you look at the trailing four quarters, you see the average of about 43% that\u2019s indicative of the range we're expecting for this year. And while we feel confident about to have about very strong pipeline growth in Europe and the U.S, the multimarket requires a way up real lack available space out there in of the key markets. So, I expect an arrow up on built-to-suit percentage in second half and then overall percentage to settle in around the 40s.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Vikram Malhotra","Wanted to get some more color and thoughts about maybe ability to push rents from here on maybe by market and product type, we obviously close to peak occupancy, took the guidance up, but it seems to me that obviously that the key driver of growth from here. So, can you just talk about any changes you are seeing in, maybe anything that surprise you in terms of rents this quarter?","Hamid Moghadam","Well, I will start and then Gene and Gary can comment on this specific, but I think based on some of the work that Chris Caton has done and shared with you, you can see that not just the cost -- real estate costs have reached small part of the supply chain costs and to the extent that approximately to customers, it's becoming more and more of the value to attribute. I think you're getting a shift to mentality from a cost focused decision criteria to much more of a service levels and experience the focused decision making process. So, bottom line, look with 10 or 15 years these customers have a pretty good run of being able to pick one landlord against the other and getting people to grind it out for the last penny of rent.","I think the smart ones have figured out that right now with the market that is so under supply and continuous to be undersupply that really to get a look at the utility of the space and its ability to affect their service levels and go for the good location and lock them up because it just take a one competition with another user and a lots of one piece of space when they get that religion very quickly. Also keep in mind that we have a 15% or thereabouts mark-to-market in our portfolio, so -- and that number keeps increasing even though we\u2019re burning off a lot of the below-market leases. So, the market continuous to be really strong and look, there is always the possibility of a recession or our great recession or something in. I\u2019m no better at predicting that and everybody else, but so far so good on our pricing power.","Gene Reilly","So, maybe just a couple of comments about Europe, we've been talking about Europe market rent growth for some time now, and we are actually starting to see it come through. Tom mentioned in his opening remarks, but I mean the sentiment in Europe is very positive demand. Its healthy vacancy rates are down. We are approaching 5% going to 4.9%. And what Hamid didn\u2019t touch on it or maybe did at a high level, its construction costs are way up, they are 16% over the last 24 months and that is underpinning this market rent growth that we have been talking about.","You have taken our market rent growth assumptions for this year up to 140 basis points almost 5%. So, we will finally start to see this come through and that\u2019s in the phase of 30 basis points of cap rate compression. So, setting the cap rate compression aside market rents would be up even higher. So, I think good things are coming from Europe finally.","Gary Anderson","Yes, and I\u2019d remind those of you have been long-term participants in these calls that back in 2016, we've talked about 2018 being a year that the rents in Europe are going to accelerate and after that there could be a possibilities of those rental growth rates actually exceeding the U.S. And I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that were to happen in 2019 certainly by 2020. So, Europe is actually going to end up being a tailwind and sort of a headwind.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Guinee of Stifel. Your line is open.","John Guinee","Noticed a number of asset sales, look like you sold 29 buildings just in the second quarter alone including, I think 8 or 10 in Chicago, handful in South Florida, 9 in Seattle. And at the same time, you've also dropped your land inventory to a stunningly low 1.1 billion. Any comments on all the disposition activity and the reduction in your land bank?","Tom Olinger","Let me comment on the land bank. The land bank, we've been trying to get it to around 1 billion since the merger and we are getting there. And what that land bank doesn\u2019t show is a whole bunch of land that we have under auction, which actually gives us the capacity for growth, but we don\u2019t have to carry them to balance sheet. So, the land bank is getting to where we want it to be. With respect dispositions, let me ask Mike to comment.","Mike Curless","John, this is Mike. Dispositions have been revving up as we suggested we have a busy second half with respect to well over 1 billion of dispositions well underway. As Tom mentioned in the opening remarks, several transactions are in the contract with our deposits, a series about one-off transactions portfolio make up that list. Pricing is very strong both in the Europe and U.S. Certainly, a good time to be the seller, expected to equal amount in Europe and the U.S., and a bright start some real good activity in the regional markets in the U.S. So after this work is done to the end of the year, we will be in very good shape of working our way through the rest of our non-strategic list, and we feel pretty darn bullish about our ability to get this all done this year.","Hamid Moghadam","It will be done with our non-strategic list, would be exception of what we will then go through as part of DCT.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Carroll of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Michael Carroll","Can you provide some additional details on the tariffs and I\u2019m particularly interested in understanding how the tariffs could impact U.S. exports in your portfolio? What type of warehouses to export typically used the things build out of country and are these facilities mainly concentrated in the port market?","Hamid Moghadam","Most of the U.S. exports are things like soybeans and things that don\u2019t go through warehouses. I mean our agriculture product is what we're really exporting. A lot of the manufactured stuff and stuff that goes into containers is, are the stuff that we are actually importing. So, I don\u2019t see a big impact on that at all.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tom Catherwood of BTIG. Your line is open.","Tom Catherwood","Switching over to development yields and you guys reported 7.1% yields on your 2Q stabilization, but if we look back between 3 and 5 quarters ago when you likely would have started these projects, the yields back then ranged from 6.3% to 6.5%. So, it looks like in that short period of time, you\u2019re picking up anywhere from 60 to 80 basis points of yields. So the question is really kind of what\u2019s driven the upward biased yields over the short time frame? And has anything changed between now and 4 quarters ago that\u2019s altered your outlook on development yields and kept them lower from here going forward?","Hamid Moghadam","Well, development yields are higher than we would have expected before because rental growth would have been higher than what we would have projected at that time, and the margins would even be larger because it\u2019s notwithstanding the rental growth we\u2019ve had cap rate compression. So, we perform a much lower margin, at least we have been in the last 4 or 5 years than we actually end up realizing. So that is the explanation for that.","As to going forward, I think every development deal that we approved is scrutinized with respect to the impact of the higher construction costs. We are using actually higher cap rates than our visible today in terms of underwriting exits for purposes of margins. But this is all the guessing game, about cap rates and rents a year-and-a-half from now. But so far we\u2019ve been fortunate on both rents and cap rates and we\u2019re building in the cushion for some slippage the other way. We\u2019re not expecting any, but it'd be imprudent not to build that in when we\u2019re dealing with big rents and big cap rates.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rob Simone of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Rob Simone","I was just wondering if maybe you could comment on the update to the same store NOI guidance and what it means for the back half of the year. It seems to imply kind of like the 5% to 6% range over the second half which is obviously down from first quarter to second quarter. I was wondering, if you could line out or describe any discreet items that might be driving that?","Hamid Moghadam","The main driver of the second half same store is going to be free rent burn off approaching more normalized levels. If you think about our midpoint of our guidance applies -- imply 5.6% same store growth in the second half and you can get there by rent change and bumps are going to get you 450ish basis points. Free rent burn off is going to be about 50 basis points, which is about half of what we saw in the first half and then a little bit of occupancy in other items gets you to that 5.6%.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Vincent Chao","Most of my questions have been answered, but just a question on the cap rate compression that\u2019s been mentioned earlier and then just some of the commentary in the development gain guidance, which was increased pretty significantly, I think obviously on valuations. So just curious, are you seeing that cap rate compression really accelerate your -- in the second quarter or is that more the catch up from maybe some conservatism earlier in the year?","Tom Olinger","I would say cap rates have continued to compress throughout the year. Even the time when there was a view that interest rates were going up, we never saw it in the private market cap rates. So, I would say it's been a continuous movement and not a step function.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eric Frankel of Green Street Advisor. Your line is now open.","Eric Frankel","Two questions, one regarding trade. Just given how integrated supply chains are throughout the world and U.S. Is there anything that could be done, if tariffs are put in place in a larger scale or we're just going to have to settle for higher prices? And then second toward The Wall Street Journal articles this morning from the comment about the New York City Economic Development Corporation putting in a $100 million -- they're planning to put a $100 million of infrastructure to allow for more transit of goods via rail and waterways rather than trucks and, I\u2019m just wondering if there is a some sort of business opportunity for your company down the road related to those type of infrastructure solutions?","Gene Reilly","Sure, with respect to your first question, you\u2019re absolutely right. I mean the world economies getting very interconnected to everyday and more so, notwithstanding the recent protection of stocks, and it is not normal, it's not a simple factor of looking at your trade balance with the given country and calling that trade because things go through 5 or 6 different countries often times and maybe back and forth through some of the same countries before they end up with the consumer. So, the world economy is a much, much more complicated picture than this sort of 1960s view somebody make something somewhere and shifts it over a year. So, it will have all kinds of unanticipated effects on the global economy, but I would tell you this there is a lot more flexibility in the global economy in terms of manufacturing and things move around very quickly.","We saw things move around very quickly from Eastern China and Western China and then to Cambodia and Thailand, and all that when labor cost move around. So, I think it's pretty difficult to take the unilateral action and affect the global economy. I think what you end up doing is putting your own economy in peril. So, the bigger risk that I see is not a risk to the global economy but a risk to the U.S economy because we are basically taxing the very same people that are looking for jobs, and why is unemployment rate in the high 3% rate? It's because finally this economy is employing some people, not a great idea to suppress that. I think that's where the big risk is.","With respect to transit dependent opportunities, sure, we're looking at all of them. I mean as you know, we got a huge presence in New Jersey specifically. So anything that happens in the New York area with respect to rail transit, we\u2019re the beneficiary that and I will give you some specific examples in places at LA, Chicago and New Jersey, we've been active acquirers of land for container storage because a lot of these rail yards don\u2019t have the capacity on-site and this has been a great way of carrying land into the next development cycle because the yields that we can by leasing land for container storage are very strong and give us a lot of flexibility with respect to the timing of our future developments.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi. Your line is open.","Manny Korchman","Tom, I just want to revisit the point you made earlier. I think using the 3Q guidance being a $0.01 below, 2Q run rate which would imply a big ramp into 4Q. Just wondering, if there is one-time items we should think about that or that\u2019s just going to be a natural take up in leasing or something else?","Tom Olinger","Yes, Manny, what we see in Q4 is the track we are seeing in Q3 reverse number one. We are seeing some higher strategic capital revenues going into the fourth quarter just with timing and transactional related. And then third is just some expense timing between the quarters and then of course NOI growth continues to takeaway. But the bottom line is that with respect to occupancy of rent growth and all the real fundamental things, the business is much better than we would have expected at the beginning of the year.","But it's so good that we've taken advantage of that to get more liquid by accelerating some of our dispositions. That creates a drag because when we are more liquid and have less deployment -- less net deployment, we actually have more growth deployment than we thought too. That\u2019s a good news story because I don\u2019t particularly care about penny or two here there on earnings any given quarter. We are setting up really nicely for a growth rate beyond that. And I think the expanding mark-to-market in the portfolio is going to assure that, not only we will have stronger same store growth, but it would be for an extended time period.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Guinee of Stifel. Your line is open.","John Guinee","Tom, if you have answered this already let me now, but I think you expected some pretty significant cost to capital saving as you paid of the DCT debt and redeploy or took advantage of the own cost to capital. I have two questions. What sort of process do you see there? How many one-time items do you think we are going to have in tendering for debt? And then can you get the achieved savings you expect given the execution you just did at 400 million 10-year bonds at 378 and 300 million a 30-year bond at 438?","Tom Olinger","John, it's Tom, so yes, to answer your second question, yes. We think we can achieve the projected savings and quite frankly then some, because as we look at the 1.8 billion and this is what we said before and it holds and if not better the $1.8 billion of debt that will assume in connection with DCT we are going to do that through accommodation of U.S. dollar, which you saw euro and yen. And we are going to get -- we are going to be doing on average easily over 10 year debt. So, we are going to get duration out of this and we are going to see rates come in. And that DCT transaction, our weighted average cost to debt was 2.9%. And we have said we thought we could reify all the debt at that rate, if not better.","I\u2019m very confident that we will do better than that regarding transactional cost with the debt. We will be looking in the incurring cost to take that debt out, but as we always look at any the economics of any debt trend or transaction while return a transaction, we always look at the underlying economics on a NPV basis and look at the match maturity to get the real economics and these things pencil, so I would expect that they will make economic sense.","Operator","Your next question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi. Your line is open.","Michael Bilerman","It\u2019s Michael Bilerman. Let me -- I just wanted to come back to sort of the trade and sort of economic impact and you've talked a little bit about that the biggest risk is clearly to the U.S. and its economic situation and therefore given your portfolio is while global has a significant exposure here would be impacted just by from an economic perspective. Would you look at your customers the 3PL transport retailers of e-commerce players and the bricks and mortar traditional players and manufacturers, which of those verticals are you paying the most attention to right now in your conversations to really understand their sort of desires right now in terms of space and utilization? And there\u2019re going to be the leading indicators here rather the economy rollovers is going to be the lagging one. So what is it about -- which ones of those are you spending the time that you think can give you the most accurate data to know what's going -- what\u2019s happening?","Tom Olinger","So, let me answer it, I think there\u2019re two embedded questions there. One is what are the two segments that we\u2019re most focused on if you will in terms of upsides and downsides in our business? In terms of upsides, we\u2019re very focused on obviously the e-commerce players in terms of upside. And by e-commerce players, I don\u2019t mean just e-commerce players but also traditional retailers that are building a parallel supply chain and you\u2019ve heard the one those announcements and obviously there\u2019s a lot of growth coming out of that. So that would be on the good news side.","Correspondingly, we\u2019re looking over the bad news side on the impact of all this on struggling retailers and we do have a retail sort of watch list and the like, and we\u2019re being very proactive on lease renewals to not renew with those retailers in this strong market then to replace some with other customers that are stronger. With respect to the impact of these tariffs, I think where you\u2019re going to see the most impact in the near term is going to be on autos, and I mean look we have heard, a lot of talk about direct German car if you will tariffs, that are very-very significant, and possibly trading that for elimination repairs on American cars in Europe. I don\u2019t know where that\u2019s going to shake up, but that\u2019s going to really affect the car business.","Similarly, the steel and aluminum a lot of that goes into cars and price of cars are going to go up. And the good news is that not a lot of cars get stored in warehouses, but a lot of car parts get stored in warehouses. So, we\u2019re looking at the autos, as probably the most nearest term impact on the things that you mentioned.","Hamid Moghadam","Okay, I think Michael\u2019s question was the last one.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Prologis' Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please limit yourself to one question. You may rejoin the queue for any follow-up questions. Thank you.","Ms. Tracy Ward, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Tracy Ward","Thanks, Kim, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our Third Quarter 2016 Conference Call. The supplemental document is available on our website at Prologis.com under Investor Relations.","This morning, we'll hear from Hamid Moghadam, our Chairman and CEO, who will comment on the company's strategy and market environment; and Tom Olinger, our CFO who will cover results and guidance. Also joining us for today's call are Gary Anderson, Mike Curless, Ed Nekritz, Gene Reilly, and Diana Scott.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, and projections about the market, and the industry in which Prologis operates as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings.","Additionally, our second quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures. And in accordance to the Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Hamid, and we'll get started.","Hamid Moghadam","Thanks, Tracy, and good morning, everyone. We had another great quarter where all aspects of our business contributed positively to results. Rent change on rollover was 15%, occupancy was up and core FFO grew 26%. Our disposition and contribution activities are tracking ahead of plan and we're developing in markets where there is scarcity of available class A product. Of our development projects this year, nearly half are build-to-suits.","Favorable trends continue to support our operations. While ecommerce is a tailwind, we see broad-based strength in other industry categories such as automotive, consumer products and residential construction. Additionally, customers continue to consolidate operations to improve supply chain efficiencies and move closer to large population centers. Even though global trade growth is converging towards global GDP growth, activity is robust in the top markets where our portfolio is focused.","Market conditions remain very strong. As we survey in our global markets, the supply demand balance is still favorable and they can see as near all-time lows. In the U.S. we now forecast 250 million square feet of new demand in 2016, versus our prior view of 225 million square feet. This new demand is driving positive rent change, up 23% last quarter and high occupancies of 97%.","While the headlines out of Europe despite summer were alarming, our experience on the ground was positive. In the region, occupancy was up and rents increase. Up to total of 46 million square feet were leased during the period, a record 35% was in Europe. In the UK alone, we leased more than two million square feet, an exceptional quarter.","Rent change in the UK was over 20% and we are 100% occupied. All in all, the UK was our second best performing market globally after the U.S. Conditions in Japan are strong, but because of temporary excess supply, we expect a short term bump in traditionally low vacancy in Tokyo and Osaka. In China, economic headlines have improved and demand is healthy especially in Tier-1 markets where our portfolio is focused.","While most of our markets are in good shape, risks of over supply remain in the same city we called out last quarter \u2013 in particular South Dallas and Houston. Separately, we continue to monitor Poland closely. Merchant builders there have used excessive concessions as a way to inflate headline grants before selling to investors. Recently however, there have been instances where investors have shown better restraint in underwriting. This is welcome news, but more buyer discipline is required before the market normalizes.","Looking ahead, we are ready for a world of rising interest rates. Eventually, this will happen and when it does, it will likely signal improving macro and consumer demand which is good for our business. Higher rates also mean higher financing cost for our new developments, which favor the larger institutional players. In our case however, we have plenty of capital to fund growth on our own.","Lastly, since spreads between the 10-year yield and cap rates are wider than normal, we don't believe modestly higher rates will affect cap rates materially in the long term. Still, we know rate hikes will hit reach stocks in the short term as a knee-jerk reaction.","We see several years of strong earnings growth ahead. With our work on the balance sheet complete and are stronger than ever liquidity, we're now entirely focused on delivering consistent earnings and dividend growth. Our leasing portfolio is 12% under rented. This will drive rental growth for several years, even under a scenario of flattening market rents going forward. Also supporting our growth story, we own land in key strategic locations. Look for us to continue developing in the world's busiest consumption markets.","In short, our team is doing a great job. We look forward to reporting to you more detail at our investor forum on November 9th in New York. Tom?","Thomas Olinger","Thanks, Amid. For the third quarter, we generated core FFO of $0.73 per share, driven by out-performance in our real estate operations and $0.14 of net promotes from two of our European ventures. Global occupancy was 96.6% at quarter end of 60 basis points year-over-year; Europe's occupancy was 96.1%, an increase of 120 basis points over the same time period.","Quarterly leasing volume remained very good at 46 million square feet with a record 41 million from our operating portfolio. Year-to-date, we've leased over 141 million square feet as our best in class portfolio is more critical than ever to our customer supply chain needs.","Our share net effective rent change on rollover was 15%, led by the U.S. at over 23% for the second consecutive quarter. However, we did see a sequential decrease in our share of rent change driven by a higher mix of leasing in Europe and Asia this quarter. Our shares of same-store NOI increased 5.6% with U.S. leading the way at 6.9%.","The pace of net deployment activity continues to be faster than our forecast. Year-to-date through the third quarter, development stabilizations totaled $1.5 billion with an estimated margin of 28%. Development starts totaled $1.1 billion with an estimated margin of over 18% and value creation of almost $200 million. Dispositions with contributions totaled $1.7 billion at a weighted average stabilized cap rate of 6.1%.","Turning to capital markets; on a look through basis, our leverage at quarter end was 28.8% on market capitalization and 37% on a book basis. Debt EBITDA including gains was 5.6 times and our liquidity was over $3.8 billion. We completed an opportunistic refinancing of three [ph] loans during the third quarter, totaling $1.2 billion. The term for the new financing is just under seven years with the current interest rate of 65 basis points.","At quarter end, our share of debt had 5.2 years of average remaining term and a weighted average interest rate of 3.1%, following a pay down over a multi-currency term loan post quarter-end, 86% of our debt is fixed with nearly all of our floating rate debt being Yen denominated.","Moving to 2016 guidance, I'll cover just the material changes on the Prologis share basis, so for complete detail, refer to Page 5 of our supplemental. Due to continued strong operating fundamentals we're increasing same store NOI growth to between 5.5% and 5.8%, up 65 basis points from our prior guidance.","Development stabilizations have come in ahead of forecast, given our strong leasing activity and as a result, we're increasing the range to between $2 billion and $2.2 billion. We're increasing the low-end at mid-point of disposition contribution volume, which we now expect to range between $2.5 billion and $2.9 billion.","We're also raising development starts to between $1.8 billion and $2 billion, with build-to-suits representing over 45% of this volume and we're also increasing our development gains range to between $275 million and $300 million. The net results for deployment changes is that we expect to generate $100 million, more net proceeds than previously expected, resulting in a cash surplus of $1.4 billion. As a reminder, this includes over $800 million of cash from fund ownership rebalancing's and the Facebook note proceeds, all of which have already been completed.","We expect to end the year with liquidity at about $4 billion, market leverage at about 27%, book leverage below 35% and debt to EBITDA with gains of about five times. Related to FX, our 2016 and 2017 estimated core FFO continues to be fully-hedged relative to the U.S. dollar and we've already hedged about half of 2019.","Net promotes for the full year are forecasted at $0.15, with the remaining one penny coming in the fourth quarter. Putting this all together, we expect 2016 core FFO including promotes to range between $2.56 and $2.57 a share. The increase of $0.015 from our prior guidance in this point is due to stronger operations offset by additional dilution from higher liquidity.","To wrap up, we're delivering 15% core FFO growth this year, in line with our three-year CAGR of 16%, while at the same time improving our portfolio, building liquidity and further strengthening our balance sheet. Our portfolio quality and financial strength have never been better. This puts us in a great position to continue to realize strong operating results, driven by the GAAP between in place and market rents and to fund or grow.","With that, I'll it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Steve Sakwa with Evercore, your line is open.","Steve Sakwa","Hamid, thanks for the comments, I guess on the market in general. I know you're not providing 2017 guidance, but as you sort of sit here today and think about the next year or so versus where you were maybe a year ago at this time, so how do you feel about the markets in general and the ability that sort of starts next year? And then if you could just also comment a little bit more about the broadening of demand, obviously I think people are excited about the ecommerce. Can you try to give us some other sectors? But do you guys track it and could you be a little bit more specific about how much of the I guess net demand is ecommerce and how much for some of these other sectors?","Hamid Moghadam","Okay. Thanks, Steve. In terms of 2017, I think you will get a pretty good deal of what we think at the investor forum. But at a very general level, I am feeling better about our business than I did a year ago because demand exceeds certainly in the U.S. of what we expected a year ago. If I were really looking for a potential negative, I would say that we are further along in capturing the spreads between in place rents and market rents from the low levels of post financial crisis. But I fully expect our same-store numbers to be very much in-line with what we are seeing this year. We have less opportunity obviously on the occupancy side, but I think the rent side of the equation will be the same or maybe a little bit better. So, generally feel very good about the business.","In terms of the sector issue, let me give you an essay answer. This is more complicated in our sector than you would think, because there are really three different things going on when you talk about customers. One is you're talking about what industry sector they're in. Let's take BMW as an example. You could have a manufacturing facility lease to BMW, you can have a parts facility or you could have sort of a wholesale operation, which is distribution of cars. Those all would show up as automotive, but they are definitely different functions. If you think that concept to a retailer, it gets even more complicated because they can be bricks and mortar retailer or they can be ecommerce retailer, but they're retailer.","So really the three things we track without over-complicating this is the industry sector of the tenant \u2013 in the case of the BMW automotive \u2013 the actual use of the space whether it's manufacturing or distribution or whatever; and then the modality. Is it a 3PL, direct user facility et cetera, et cetera. So as you can see, this is a complicated thing and because of the 3PLs, we don't always have visibility through what the underlying businesses that they do because sometimes it changes. So when we quote you for example statistics on ecommerce, that's really understating the contribution of ecommerce because we don't really know how much of that UPS building is ecommerce and we classify UPS as an integrated logistics company.","Again, it's complicated, but I will tell you, looking through all of that, the things that stand out is that housing is really picking up by a couple hundred thousand units and that's adding incremental demand which is really what took occupancies from 96% to 97% in the U.S. If ever we're going to call out one thing in addition to ecommerce, it will be that. Automotive is also very strong, but not as strong as the change on the margin of residential. Anyway, that's how we see it.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers with Baird. Your line is open.","David Rodgers","Thank you. Good morning out there. I guess I wanted to talk a little bit more about new construction and what you're seeing on the market. I think overall you said there's only a small number of metros out there where you're seeing any additional pressure maybe from construction. I'm starting to hear more that there's some mid-sized boxes in the 150,000 to 300,000 square foot range that are being delivered with maybe a lack of demand and the bifurcated demand being both small, more residential as you talked about and then maybe more large on the ecommerce side. Are you seeing more of a bifurcation today as supply is increasing and do you start to worry about that?","Eugene Reilly","Yes, David, it's Gene. Let me take that first at least. Yes, we do see a bifurcation of the type of product that's being delivered, but frankly in most cases, this is product that's needed. In the early stages of the recovery, we saw a lot of big box development and a lot of absorption by Amazon and others with very, very big floor plate. What happened during the last five or six years is that the vacancy rates in smaller size increments have really tightened up. So you see more deliveries in medium to small size ranges and frankly, we're doing the same. Are you going to see an odd deal that is misplaced? You probably will, but I think by enlarge, most of these projects are well suited and overall of course, there are still tremendous access demand in the system.","Gary Anderson","David, Europe; I would just say is a little bit different, demands still out-pacing supply generally. I would say that we're a little bit behind the U.S. and that small spaces are not being absorbed as quickly as the U.S. paces, so the concentration would have been candidly in bigger boxes and candidly in build-a-suits. So if you look at our development pipeline for example, over 60% of it this year is build-a-suit. Europe is a little bit different dynamic than you see in the U.S. today.","Hamid Moghadam","Yes. To be very specific, the beginning of the year, we call for 225 million square feet of demand and 200 million feet of supply and we've both moved demand up to 250 as you heard in my comments and supply, we think is going to come in actually as 185 or lower than we thought. So overall supply is actually more constrained than what we predicted earlier and demand is stronger.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman, KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.","Craig Mailman","Hi, I was just hoping to clarify the earlier comment and prepared remarks about the 12% under leased on the portfolio right now. Just want to see if that compares exactly to the 15% mark-to-mark that you guys have been talking about more recently and if that is the case, what's the driver there of the 300 basis point decline given the pretty tight time frame with recent remarks? Just hoping you'd give some potential trends and whether you guys are maybe just being conservative on potential market rent growth as we head into '17 as one of the factors?","Hamid Moghadam","It's apples and oranges; the 12% is global portfolio and the 15% is the U.S. portfolio.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel with Green Street Advisors. Your line is now open.","Eric Frankel","Thank you. Quick question from [indiscernible] related to free rent. I just noticed that free rent is continued to increase in your portfolio and I think it now represents roughly 8% of the year NOI, of your consolidated NOI. So I just wanted to understand that trend a little better. Thank you.","Thomas Olinger","Hi, Eric. It's Tom. The increase is all being driven by higher lease commencements in the quarter and really building occupancy plus we have longer lease terms and rents are increasing very, very much as you can see in your rent change. So a combination of all that makes the nominal amount of free rent much higher. However, when you look at free rent as a percentage of the lease value, it's actually trending down. So concessions are not going up, concession are actually going down in most markets but this is just a normal thing that happens when you are in an environment where occupancies are increasing, and rents are rising, and terms are going longer; it's all a very good thing because all of that is going to turn around and build our cash same-store NOI growth going forward.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz with UBS. Your line is open.","Robert Jeremy Metz","Hey guys, just one on acquisitions, there has obviously been a number of large portfolio transactions that have hit the market or close recently in the Halword deal, Cabot [ph]; so I'm just wondering if you can comment on your appetite for these type of deals. Did you look hard at any or all of them and if so was it just pricing that didn't make sense there? Thanks.","Thomas Olinger","We had no interest in any of the three that you mentioned but we look at everything, it's just not our kind of product. I mean I would say the LBA portfolio is a higher finished portfolio and really not distribution by and large. And let me just leave the comments with that.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick with Capital One Securities. Your line is open.","Thomas Lesnick","And historical they've invested down the supply chain to reduce cost; and today for instance, Amazon has its own trucking fleets as you know taking away business from likes of UPS and FedEx but the ability to use space in rear of these community is mini logistics centers; do you view that as a threat to demand for third-party logistics base?","Hamid Moghadam","I missed the first part of your question; I think you were on mute but I think I get the jest of it. Look I don't think Amazon -- first of all, you're going to have to ask them. I don't have any insight into their long range plans. Secondly, if you look at their multiple and the expected growth that's associated with that, if they tie up a bunch of their balance sheet in warehouses or other facilities that's not exactly what the market is giving them that capital at a very high multiple for. So I think what they've said publicly is that they are doing the investments in logistics and airplanes and all that kind of stuff, by the way which they are leasing to supplement the volume that they get out of UPS and FedEx; and particularly over very busy holiday season because couple of years ago you remember that there were some complications with some of the deliveries that they felt wreck their brand.","So that's what they are saying at least publicly but from a financing point of view, and the capital markets point of view it would be a really terrible use of capital for them I would think. So let's leave it at that.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel. Your line is open.","John Guinee","Its pretty close, John Guinee. Here is an easy one for you Hamid, I'm looking at page 26 and I'm looking at your land portfolio owned and managed and obviously the plan can be anywhere from raw land to pad-ready and I noticed widely differing investments per square foot; it looks like you're as high as $28 for buildable in the UK $32 per buildable in Northern New Jersey, seemingly low $15 per square foot in Southern California. If I've got my numbers right, a stunningly low $2.50 per buildable foot in Chicago; $4 per buildable foot in Central Valley which looks like you own of the Central Valley. But can you talk about your land bases and how soon you can deploy that and that sort of thing?","Hamid Moghadam","John, first of all you should pardon Kim, she is a Canadian, she did a pretty good job on your name. Look land varies all over the place and the reasons for it is that rents vary all over the place and essentially the way you think about it and you know this as an old real estate developer; the building costs are not that different between different regions, they are a little different because of the union and all that but maybe they vary 20% in the U.S. But rents vary by a lot more than that and all of the difference falls to the residual which is the land; so if rents are higher and building costs are -- rents are higher by 10%, 20% and building costs are the same; land could be 50%, 70% higher from one location compared to the other and then when you get into Bay Area and some of the anomalies, obviously differences get really magnified.","Secondly, as you've pointed out there is a big difference between lands that is improved versus land that is still in raw condition. We have very little unentitled land, I mean like tiny, tiny untitled land, so all of it is entitled but not all of it is actually improved because of the improvement to -- put in the improvements, it's too far ahead on larger perks [ph]. So I think at the end of the day which you need to look at and we're not providing that because that's a pro forma number that gets into a lot of assumptions. If you want to really look at finished land per FAR and that's really the true measure that we look at and I think that's really correlated with rents less development cost. As to any of those specific markets, Gene, do you want to comment?","Eugene Reilly","Yes. John, just in general and some of this will be repetitive but some of those you quote; Chicago, for example, very low number. We have tons of acreage on our 80 and frankly some of this land we are looking to sell; we've put no improvements into it.","Hamid Moghadam","And by the way the absolute number is small, it's like a $3 million piece of land but it's a lot of land.","Eugene Reilly","Yes exactly. I'm happy to have a separate conversation with you but it's -- it really ties back to what I mean -- there is a lot of variability in this basket.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Jamie Feldman","Hamid, I want to go back to your comment before about a knee-jerk REIT sell-off but on the direct market you don't think that uptake in Fed funds rate will really impact valuations or cap rates? Can you first just kind of explain your thoughts there and second maybe tell us what you are seeing in the direct market maybe in demand for your fund business. Just kind of what you are seeing in how people are underrating assets that gives you that confidence.","Hamid Moghadam","Okay, the spreads as I talked about between cap rates, probably more accurately IOR is projected, IORs and the 10-year treasury are the lightest they've ever been, and if you -- I think you've heard me talk about this before; if you really think about the market being sort of in the long-term 1.5% to 2% inflation and bonds are 200 basis point premium, that's our argues for 3.5% to 4%. Treasury in the long-term which is quite away from where we are here and that consistent with 5.5% type cap rates in our sector makes sense in a historical context; and probably 6.5% to 7% IOR. So I mean that's an appropriate spread over 10-year treasury.","So I think nobody is paying for real estate as if 10-year treasuries are going to be 1.8% or whatever they are today into the future. And I think the way to think about it is that investors in the short-term are getting a windfall because they are really pricing against much higher treasuries and collecting the bonus in the short-term. I don't know why there is so much focus on the fed fund rate, I think the world has become such a big macro things and they are like 28 zillion people watching the same screen and what -- some Fed Governor says at lunch one day; I mean I just don't know.","I don't borrow -- we don't borrow at Fed funds rate; so whether it goes up or down 25 basis points, I don't really know. All I can tell you is that the last time they increased the Fed funds rate; the 10-year treasury went down. So what we care about actually got cheaper but I'm not a market psychologist so I'll leave that to others to explain the knee-jerk reaction but that's what happened; REIT sell-off and then six months later because of the stronger economy which is the underlying cause of rates going up, it starts showing up in rents and they recover and that's what historical facts have said.","In terms of fund demand, I would tell you that we have infinite fund demand in Europe and in the U.S. fund demand is good but I would say it's a little bit less than it was a year ago or two years ago but still pretty solid I think that numbers will end up being smaller in terms of new money allocated this year than last year when it's all over. ","Operator","And your next question comes from line of Kaizen Kim [ph] with SunTrust. Your line is open. ","Unidentified Analyst","Guys, so this is a two part question, first on your stabilized portfolio, as you show year-to-date, what if the least percentage in that portfolio and if you comment on how that's trended, a second part as that, definitely stabilized portfolio goes into your operate portfolio. And I guess sometimes maybe below full occupancy, how much of that generally help to reported same-store NOI number overtime.","Hamid Moghadam","Yes, we were scratching our heads as what you're referring to, I know some companies, When they report occupancies, their report overall occupancy, including their under development stuff that is not fully leased or stabilized, we don't do that when we operate, we have a definition of stabilization and the stabilization is the earlier of the achievement of 90% occupancy for development project or a year from certificate of occupancy. So whether leases are not they go into the operating pool, after year and it goes into the operating pool sooner than that when it hits 90%.","So their occupancy were report are the occupancies for the operating portfolio, and separately we report the occupancy for the development portfolio, so our same store numbers are not boosted artificially by simply the lease of the development business. I know some other companies do it a different way, I am not going to pass judgment on that but I don't think it reflects as accurately the same store concept of stabilizing properties. ","Thomas Olinger","Thank you, I will just add on that, typically estimates that we will put these assets in the operating pool, when they're 90% lease or 12-month post completion the earlier of the two, and so generally it's not going to be a big mover of all at the nursing store. Something goes in that's you know under least 90% it is not. We're going to be a driver at all our operating portfolio is just too big. ","Operator","And your next question comes from a line of Brad Burke with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. ","Brad Burke","All right. Thanks for taking the question ,from a question FFO guidance, your full year guidance really hasn't changed all that much from what you introduced at the beginning of this year, same sort guidance that increased by over 1.5% development stabilization outlook is over higher. Are there things beyond just asset sales? Which look to be back in loaded in the year anyway that they kept FFO from increasing more dramatically?","Hamid Moghadam","That's a good question, it's all about what happened was two things; one I think about the promote range we had $0.40 to $0.60; we dialed that into $0.50 for the year. So if you're trying to go back to why did we got to $0.58, there is your $0.01. The $0.02 up from the midpoint is all about same-store guidance, you look at the 65 basis points same-store increase that gets you right on a $1.5, a little over. And then the offset to those things would be; yes we're creating more liquidity, I would tell you generally I think we are ahead of schedule on actually, on are deploying capital yes we do have a lot going on in the fourth quarter, but it's definitely out of our forecast. ","And that that is also a slight drag on earnings, so overall it was it increases all driven by improved operations. And little smaller promote and deployment timing, building more cash. ","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citi's your line is open. ","Unidentified Analyst","It's Michael Bowman [ph] and as a Canadian, I think Tim is doing an absolutely phenomenal job on this conference call. That is right and its up about a 10,000% in Google; and that one's rocking to come and stay with my parents if they need to. So you have your investor form coming up in a couple of weeks, so the first one and then in a couple years and I'm curious if you think about bringing investors and analysts and what are you looking -- would you look into accomplish, what's new that you want to be able or you think its misunderstood and with that goal that you want people to come out in a in a couple weeks, to want to see what would you going to bring that differentiator news that you don't think people understand about that the company or the business. ","Hamid Moghadam","Yes, good question actually. I wish that we would talk about more strategic thinkers like that in these calls. I would say if I were thinking about it and the three objectives that we have for the analyst meeting, is to show you how after massive work following the merger back in 2011, the business has been really simplified and there lots of big moving pieces that have now all settled down. And you can really tell what's going on with Prologis just based on good old real estate metrics of cap rates and same store growth, and so I think there's a perception out there that Prologis is overly complicated and I think we'd like people to appreciate how simplified would make the business. So that's objective number one. ","Objective number two is to show people that what the real drivers of supply and demand are, how they are different and why we have a good business with strong prospects for earnings growth in the long term. And take you a couple of layers under the surface on those concepts, and actually bring some third party resources that can speak about the market financing market, as well as real estate markets. And really how customers think and behave. So that's the second thing. and the third thing is that we get a lot of questions on why global, and why development and why all this kind of stuff, and they're all related and we want to walk away with a better appreciation, of the different components of our business and how they all fit together and how they energize one another.","So if we can get those three key concepts across I think we would call that a successful meeting. ","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Blaine Heck","I'm just going to set on this a little bit but development starts us far and relatively little around $1.1 billion in your share, a little bit above -- under 60% of guidance. We view almost $800 million start in the fourth quarter. You guys did raise guidance for start so I assume you guys have confidence in the updated number, but can you just explain a little bit some of the seasonality and starts and why there would appear to be so much more demand in the fourth quarter? And then how do we think about the mix between spec and build-to in the fourth quarter?","Michael Curless","Blaine, this is Mike Curless, and let me address that; if you look over the last three or four years our first quarters are starkly very light in our fourth quarters are very heavy. Typical years would have us doing 35% or more in the fourth quarter, this year it's called about 4%. How to pursue that activity is completely identified fact we've had a handful of starts already on their way in October, and all of this work taking place it within our existing parks on sites that we own, so we can really control the timing of those starts. So we're highly confident, and our ability to fulfill the rest of this activity yet in this quarter. And in terms of build-to-suit mix it's approaching 50% it's covered in the high thirties and forties of the last three or four years we've been very active in the build-to-suit business had a record number build the suits the last 12 months, and so build-to-suit percentages growing, also while development volume is growing and that's a fairly big statement. ","Operator","And your next question comes from a line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael Mueller","Your occupancy is obviously been going up over the course of the past year so, but can you talk a little bit about retention, because it looks like this time last year is about 87% and it's been trending down to about 80%, so what are the dynamics behind that? And where do you see it analyzing?","Eugene Reilly","Michael, this is Gene, let me take that. Yes I really wouldn't read anything into it, if anything I'd say 87% was a probably an all-time high in the industry and is not sustainable. So the levels frankly if you're above 75% I think you're doing just fine historically, so we've just seen in this recovery incredible levels of retention, and we don't see anything in our activities that -- there is nothing to read into decline.","Hamid Moghadam","Michael, yes, actually I would go further than that. I think we could have driven it lower; I don't think we pushed it enough, that's why we're 96.6% occupied. So if I had my way I would be a little bit lower. And let me also take this opportunity to point out the difference in how we calculate retention and same-store and all that. We don't make judgments about whether the tenant could have, would have, should have did stay or go or whatever. We report actual retention. So if the tenant actually leads the portfolio and goes into a bigger building, it's not retained in our -- the way we calculate it. I don't think or -- as a result I don't think our numbers are directly comparable with how other people may report it because they apply judgment to it and they filter a bunch of things out.","So the numbers that you see from us are even non-retained people for good reasons like expansions, they are reflected in those numbers.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel with Green Street Advisors. Your line is now open.","Eric Frankel","Thank you. Just two quick questions; one, have you seen any atypical holiday related leasing in the fourth quarter yet? I think we've just seen some recent articles about UPS [ph] poking up their portfolio a little bit for the holiday season. And then second, could you just provide a bit of a geographic breakdown on your cap rates and disposition? Thank you.","Eugene Reilly","Sure. I guess -- Eric, its Gene, just on the first part of your question. We're seeing nothing out of the ordinary but I would say those two customers you mentioned are particularly active right now. Some of that probably is related to the holidays but I think they also have some general incremental demand coming out into the market. Mike, you want to respond?","Michael Curless","With respect to cap rates on our dispositions, blending into low sixes, we think that's -- those are solid numbers for the -- keep in mind for the mix of product that we're selling both in regional markets and global markets and the average age of what we saw tends to be about twice as long as the -- our typical age of our typical building in our portfolio.","Hamid Moghadam","I would say if you take our cap rates for the products that we are retaining and look at the cap rates for the products that we're selling, generally we're looking at about a 100 basis points spread which is explained by the quality, that's a rough draw [ph]. So instead of dragging you around the world on what cap rates are -- I mean cap rates are cap rates that we talk about and usually the quality that we're selling is 100 basis points higher than that.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Emmanuel Korchman","So nor just recently increased their real estate target allocations; I'm curious in recent discussions with them -- between you and them has their appetite to buy more in Europe increased. And then maybe the flipside of that, do you have a desire to sell, especially as you look at your own liquidity?","Hamid Moghadam","We don't have a desire to sell above and beyond our non-core assets. I mean when we bought those two portfolios, we nor -- by the way with anybody else we have a business plan as to what are non-strategic assets that we want to dispose of over some period of time and we're executing knowing that plan. So there is no change in terms of what we want to sell or anything; what we're keeping is core and we're going to keep it for long time. As far as their specific plans, I would invite you to talk to them directly but my -- I mean, we're -- I think their largest manager -- I'm pretty clear about that, certainly their largest real estate relationship and maybe the largest relationship in any category, I'm not so sure about that.","So we're bumping up against sort of concentration type limits in terms of how much business we can do for them; for them and for us, I might add. But we have an excellent relationship; we think the world [indiscernible] has been really good in supporting partners.","Emmanuel Korchman","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.","Craig Mailman","Guys, thanks for taking the follow-up. Just on Europe and I know you guys at $16 million for the whole quarter and I guess through July and August if I remember, you guys had said you had done $14 million; so I'm just curious, it sounds like September may have fallen off a bit in terms of volume and just -- curious kind of what October has looked like so far? And if there was anything maybe things in frontload in August versus September, any kind of takeaways you guys have?","Hamid Moghadam","So I can assure you, nothing was frontloaded in August in Europe. They're not even around, that part is easy. I think the original numbers that recorded were including part of June for last quarter when we're talking about total leasing because we're quoting a number from the day that the referendum vote was taken which I believe is June 23. We haven't seen a fall-off at all quite to the contrary; leasing continues to be very strong, demand continues to outplay base supply. So we don't see any fall-off today.","Gary Anderson","I will say that we do see lower expirations in Europe in the fourth quarter, so we will see volumes come down but it's really a mixed issue. As we said, Q3 we say relatively high, very high leasing in Europe and Asia, and we're going to see that moderate. So you will see U.S. be a bigger chunk of leasing in Q4.","Hamid Moghadam","We're running out of products at least to be honest with you, that's the issue. That was the last question. So again, let me thank you for your interest in the company. Very much look forward to seeing you all in November in New York. We have great charge fees [ph], so please come and enjoy the day.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please limit yourself to one question. You may rejoin the queue for any follow-up questions.","Thank you. Ms. Tracy Ward, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Tracy Ward","Thanks, Kim, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2016 conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations.","This morning, we'll hear from Hamid Moghadam, our Chairman and CEO, who will comment on the company's strategy and the market environment; and then from Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover results and guidance. Also joining us for today's call are Gary Anderson, Mike Curless, Ed Nekritz, Gene Reilly, and Diana Scott.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, and projections about the market and the industry, in which Prologis operates, as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice on our 10-K or SEC filings.","Additionally, our first quarter press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures and, in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures.","With that, we will get started and I'll turn the call over to Hamid.","Hamid Moghadam","Thanks, Tracy, and good morning everyone. 2016 is off to a great start. The momentum we had at the end of last year has continued into the New Year. We posted record first quarter numbers on rent change, which was stronger than expected at over 20%, and core FFO which grew 24% year-over-year.","At this point in the cycle, we're pushing rent growth over occupancy. Nevertheless occupancy is still very high at over 96%. These and other metrics which Tom will discuss in a moment point to continued growth ahead for Prologis.","I'd like to take a moment to elaborate on how and where we make our money. Many of you already know this but I believe it's worth repeating. We make over 90% of our core FFO by collecting rents. The rest is generated by fees and promotes from our strategic capital business. Together rents and fees represent a stable cash flow created from our operating portfolio.","Separately, the value creation from our development business, including value added conversions, propels our future earnings growth. So our operating and development activities address how we make money.","Now as to where we make our money when collecting rents 72% is in the U.S. and 28% comes from abroad, roughly 90% of our net equities in U.S. dollars.","Many ask us why we're global. In short, we are global because our customers are global and so we've organized our business to capitalize on this unique aspect of our sector. About two-thirds of our development value creation fees and promotes are generated outside the U.S. As an aside these benefits actually cover more than a 100% of our global overhead.","I view Prologis as an owner\/operator in the U.S. and a fund manager and developer in Europe and Asia. We have minimal exposure to emerging economies.","Market conditions remain favorable under world's most vibrant centers of commerce. In these strategic locations, demand was solid with supply still very disciplined. These business conditions have persisted for several years now. While we anticipate supply\/demand reaching equilibrium this year, we see few obstacles on the road ahead that could disrupt that balance.","In the U.S. quality properties remains scare which is leading to strong rent growth and high occupancies. We will continue to signal watch list markets. In this quarter we have no new markets to call out. In Europe and Asia, rents are up modestly from last quarter, balanced by slightly lower occupancies. In Mexico, rents were up slightly, and occupancies flat, while in Brazil rents are down modestly, but occupancy is at a 100%.","The key drivers of our business consumption and e-commerce continue to grow faster than underlying economies. We have every reason to expect these trends to continue into the future.","KCR is all paid off. Our funding activities, specifically the short-term loan associated with that deal concluded less than one year after it was announced and ahead of schedule. With the transaction paid in full, and the portfolio integrated, today's call is probably the last time you will hear us talk about KCR.","We have capacity to fund more than five years of capital deployment. At our current run rate, our total annual funding requirement is $600 million. We expect to fund this through the rebalancing of our co-investment ventures, reducing our land bank, and selling our remaining non-strategic assets. These one-time sources total more than $3.5 billion and give us the ability to fund more than five years of net deployment activity.","We will further simply our business overtime. Over the last several years we made great strides in optimizing our business to put us on a path for long-term sustained earnings growth. In addition look for us to continue to streamline our business through the ongoing realignment of our portfolio, further G&A efficiencies, land bank optimization, and reduced leverage.","Now, let me turn it over to Tom, for further comments.","Tom Olinger","Thanks, Hamid. We began the year with terrific results. Core FFO was $0.61 per share for the quarter and increased to 24% year-over-year and driven by strong operating fundamentals and an increase in AUM.","Starting with operations, occupancy in the U.S. was 96.6% at quarter end and 95.4% outside the U.S. Leasing volume for the quarter was a record at 46 million square feet. Just a quick reminder that my comments as I go through the rest of the operating and capital deployment activity will focus on our share.","GAAP rent change on rollover was an all-time high of 20.1% led by the U.S. of 27.2% and 4% outside the U.S.","GAAP same-store NOI increased 7.4% positive across all major geographies and driven by the U.S. at 9.6%. There are two items I want to highlight. First, as we previously discussed, the negative impact on GAAP NOI from the amortization of lease intangibles related to the merger burned off in the second quarter of 2015. As a result, this had a positive non-cash impact of about 170 basis points on GAAP same-store growth in the quarter. Second, expense timing drove an approximate 70 basis points positive impact. After adjusting for these two items, GAAP same-store growth was 5% which is attributable to the strong rental increases and year-over-year occupancy gains.","Strategic capital fees were $50 million for the quarter, with the majority coming from our international ventures. Capital deployment activity is progressing as planned. There are two items I would like to highlight this quarter. First, that our stabilization had an estimated margin of 27%, and second, that build-to-suits comprised 42% of our development starts.","Turning to capital markets, our leverage on a book basis was 38.1% at quarter-end and 33.9% based on market capitalization. Debt-to-EBITDA, including gains, improved to 5.6 times. As Hamid mentioned, we fully repaid the $400 million term loan associated with the KTR acquisition and liquidity remained strong.","Last quarter, I'm sorry, this week we recast our global line of credit, lowering our spread by 10 basis points and increasing the capacity by 640 million. As a result, our total line capacity is now 3.4 billion further enhancing our current significant liquidity levels.","We expect to see further improvement in our debt metrics throughout the remainder of the year, as our venture rebalancings were completed this month and the pace of dispositions accelerate. The continued strengthening of our balance sheet was acknowledged this quarter by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's upgraded our credit outlook to positive. We believe we are on the doorstep of an A rating.","Before discussing guidance, I wanted to highlight enhancements to our earnings supplemental this quarter. The changes are based on the feedback we received from investors and analysts as well as to better align our disclosure with how we think about and how we run the company. As part of this, we revisited the classification of certain personnel cost in our income statement which had the effect of increasing expenses related to our strategic capital business by $17 million on an annual basis and reducing G&A by the same amount. There is no bottom-line impact on net income or core FFO.","For context we completed a significant volume of co-investment activity over the past five years and almost doubled our third-party AUM. With this increase, we now have more full-time employees dedicated to our strategic capital business.","Moving to 2016 guidance, we're maintaining guidance for most of our operating metrics, capital deployment, and strategic capital revenues, all of which you can see on Page 6 of our supplemental.","On same-store NOI, we are increasing the bottom-end and narrowing the range to between 4% and 4.5% with the bias towards the upper half of this range.","For net G&A, we are lowering the range to between $218 million and $228 million to reflect the reclassification I just mentioned. Related to FX, our 2016 earnings remain well insulated from foreign currency fluctuations, as over 95% are hedged.","We continue to expect to generate $1 billion of total proceeds in excess of our capital needs in 2016. This consist $400 million in net deployment proceeds, $198 million of cash that we already received from the completion of the Facebook installment sale, and $400 million from the ownership rebalancing in our USLF and PTELF ventures which we will receive in a few weeks.","Further we like what we are seeing in the disposition market and are likely to increase our volume. So while operating conditions are stronger than we expected, we are not increasing our core FFO given the potential dilution from increased dispositions. Therefore we are maintaining our 2016 core FFO guidance of between $2.50 and $2.60 per share. This includes $0.17 to $0.19 per share of promotes which were recognized in the second half of this year. If we assume normalized annual net promotes of $0.05 per share, our core FFO for 2016 would range between $2.38 to $2.46 per share.","Core FFO will not be evenly distributed for the balance of the year given the timing of our asset sales and venture rebalancing. As a result, we expect core FFO to be $0.03 to $0.04 lower in the second quarter followed by an acceleration in the back half of the year from promote income.","In closing, we are off to a really good start. Our focus for the rest of the 2016 is simply about capturing the significant spreads between inflates and market rents, generating profitable returns by putting our land bank to work, and continuing to strengthen our balance sheet.","With that, I will turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","Your first question comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore. Your line is open.","Steve Sakwa","Hi good morning, Steve Sakwa here. Hamid, I guess I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the development business and what you're saying obviously the fundamentals continue to be stronger than may be you've expected. I know you didn't have a huge start figure in the first quarter but I'm just wondering if you sort of look out for the balance of the year was the rest of the starts numbers to the upside or to the downside? How do you sort of assess that at this point and what are your tenants sort of looking for today?","Hamid Moghadam","Steve, I think the risk is to the upside because pretty much everything that we're likely to do we know about. So by definition if some build-to-suit left in the door or something happens is going to be on the upside because pretty much everything is baked.","The other thing I would comment on generally development start volume is that we're basically doing the same or a little bit more than last year except for Brazil. So obvious reasons, we're not developing a whole lot of new products in Brazil. So I think people have gotten too excited in terms of our guidance being a little bit down on development starts, I don't think you can read that much into that anyway.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ross Nussbaum from UBS. Your line is open.","Ross Nussbaum","Hey good morning out there. Hamid, as we think about demand for industrial space, we spend a lot of time thinking about inventory levels given the historical correlation between absorption in inventories. And then I look at what's been going on with inventory to sales ratios lately. And I say lately it's been ramping the last couple of years but over the last year or two it's been ramping quite significantly. How do you think inventory to sales ratios are going to play out here going forward? Do you think we're going to see a bit more I guess modest inventory growth given what's going on in the economy and how does that play out in terms of demand for your space?","Hamid Moghadam","Ross, that's a very good question and I think the answer is too soon to know for sure but it appears that that secular decline in inventory to sales ratio that all of you are used to seeing in our materials going back I don't know 15 years or something really has reversed in the last three years, and there are lots of explanations for it, but the most credible one I think is the one that as more sales shift to e-commerce, there are more skews, and there is the need to keep more inventory around and as a result there may be a secular shift. If that's the case, that's a unexpected windfall to demand for industrial space. We have not built our business with that expectation but that will be a nice surprise if it happens and if it has legs forever. So too soon to tell for sure but I think the early signs are really good.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Ki Bin Kim","Thank you. So going back to your opening comments Hamid, you talked about the $3.5 billion of one-time funding sources and how you're funding your, are you going to be self-funding for the next five years of activity and that\u2019s been a pretty consistent message coming from you guys lately. But I guess the equation to issue equity or not issue equity and how to fund that on activity is a different equation at $40 versus $45 stock price. Could you just talk about, how you think about that? Has your stock price has changed or is it still that $3.5 billion is that still your primary force, how you want to fund the business?","Hamid Moghadam","Look, I'm not going to sit here and say that we will never do equity if the stock price is about 60 bucks or 70 bucks, it's something like that. It would be foolish not to do that because that clearly would be higher than our NAV. But our view over NAV we've been pretty open about it, 46, 47 bucks a share that doesn't really include a value for development business and I guess there is a long debate as to whether that business is worth a one multiple or a 10 multiple. I can tell you it's not worth the 15 or 20 multiple that people were valuing it at 2007 that's for sure, but it's worth something, it's worth at least the homebuilder. I think it\u2019s worth $3 to $5 a share pretty easily if you look at it as a homebuilder.","So you add of all that stuff the number is around high 40s to low 50s kind of for the way I look at by at our NAV. So I don't even think about it. So I don't think the equation has changed between $40 and $45 because we're still way below where I think the value of the company is?","But, you got to look at equity in the context of other investment opportunities. If some portfolio comes up on the market or I don't think this is going to happen, but if something happens where we have an advantage to buy $45 of NAV at $20, we may take advantage of that. But I don\u2019t think that's going to happen and we are not an issuer of equity and I think it is a complete waste of time for people to spend energy thinking about that issue at these kinds of numbers.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Blaine Heck","Good morning out there. You guys have talked about getting your land balance down to about $1 billion or under. Some of that obviously involves monetizing land through development but it also involves disposing of land so. My question is have you seen any movement in land values over the past six months or so, especially as you and some of your public peers have become a little bit more conservative with respect to the expected starts this year?","Hamid Moghadam","I think land values in terms of good developable land that's near-term developable has gone up, as rents have gone up. And it's very hard to find good land in the right markets, entitlement costs are going up, infrastructure costs are going up, communities are getting tougher on land, so general trend in land values has been up. I would say among our many, many parcels every quarter we value our land, using a land residual analysis and I would say by and large the trend has been up there are -- I would say three or four parcels add up a very large number may be down but the general trend is up, but it's not up as much as it would have been a year ago or two years ago, the pace of land value growth has, has moderated.","The other thing I would point out is that, yes our land bank is about $1.5 billion book value, $1.4 billion book value, but the market value that in our view again based on pretty robust analysis is approaching to may be in the low $2 billion rank. So in terms of what we can work our land bank down is not $0.5 billion down to $1 billion it's like $1 billion down to $1 billion in terms of market value because the market value of land is what we -- we're targeting for. So we've got quite a bit of liquidity that could come out of the land bank to add to that $3.5 billion that we've talked about.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Juan Sanabria","Good morning. I was just hoping you could touch a little bit more deeply on the same-store NOI expense comment about some one-time items related to timing and how we should think about that kind of for the balance of the year and may be if you could touch on the differences by geography?","Tom Olinger","Juan, this is Tom, I will start. The decline -- the benefit we got from the lower occupancy expenses in Q1 this year was really a function of Q1 of '15 being higher than normal. So if you go back and look at the increase if Q1 of '15 I think it was around 7%. We had some one-time trueups going on in there some other non-recurring items and that's really what's driving the benefit, we saw this quarter or the decrease this quarter.","Going forward, the remainder of year, I wouldn't expect really any meaningful change in operating expenses from this run rate, in any meaningful way.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel with Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.","Eric Frankel","Thank you. First just a couple of portfolio specific questions. Could you comment on the occupancy declines in Houston and Pennsylvania? And then secondly perhaps you can touch, perhaps providing e-commerce update and just, if you can relay your experiences with your customers in terms of how they accommodate e-commerce growth during the holiday season whether they see any changes in their supply chain as a result. Thank you.","Hamid Moghadam","Yes, Eric, I will start with that. Well obviously Houston and Pennsylvania are two markets that we've called out as markets we're concerned about. Houston pretty obvious reasons why and Pennsylvania is sort of a combination of a spike in supply and demand tailing off. But I wouldn\u2019t draw any conclusions Eric about the specific adjustments in vacancy in those markets but I think that's going to continue for a long time. I think in both cases, we\u2019re going to end up in the sort of mid-90s.","But let me say a couple of other things about both of them. So Houston has been on our watch list, vacancy was up a little bit over the quarter and it has 8 million square feet on construction. We're defensive there and I think we've been saying that for a while. While the macro headwind obviously persist, we're almost 96% leased, the pipe is 50% pre-leased and there is still a 6% vacancy rate in Houston and Houston isn't creating a lot of jobs but it's net positive, not negative at this point in time.","And then in terms of Pennsylvania, probably we're a little more cautious in terms of Pennsylvania at this point in time.","To your point on e-commerce trends, Eric, we don't see any new trends coming out of this prior season. I think that that everybody participating in this space is still that's really trying to figure out the supply chain both the last mile which everybody is talking about these days, all the way to the origin of the product because different participants handle it differently. So, we don't really have anything new for you right now. I don't know Gary if you see anything different in your opinion.","Gary Anderson","And I just say that, there are two trends that have occurred over the last two years, two important customer segments one is automotive and the other is e-commerce. And the e-commerce side of the equation isn't a seasonal thing and you sort of pose your question in terms of seasonality, it's really a structural change I think in the way companies are doing business today. And if you look at our own portfolio as an example, two or three years ago it was about 5% of our total portfolio, today it's double that. So it's clearly an important driver and one that I wouldn't think about just in terms of a seasonal type trend.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.","Michael Mueller","I was wondering if you can comment on any trends you're seeing with respect to the time release respect developments, has it been static, has it been going up at all.","Hamid Moghadam","I would say the best way of answering that question is how we're doing compared to our underwriting and we are literally within a point or two and I think we are point or two ahead consistent with our underwriting. So no I wouldn't say our expectations have changed.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi. Your line is open.","Manny Korchman","Thank you. Hamid, if we can just turn to the comment you made in the press release and then repeated on the call about sort of trends exceeding underlying economies. Are the economies performing sort of at your expectations and trends are just that much better? Are you seeing a slowing in trends or really kind of what you'd expect with economies are not?","Hamid Moghadam","Manny, my pick on economies and now I'm really out of my depth of expertise here, but seems to me that the U.S. economy is sort of a mid-to-high 2% grower minus energy. So that means it's 1.5% to 2% grower, and so the trends that affect our business remember energy doesn't goes through pipeline, it doesn't go through warehouses. The energy pricing generally being lower has led to better consumption numbers and more of that consumption is shifting to the e-commerce channel which is more space intensive. So those two things have made demand for our product better than they would have been based on the overall economic numbers.","On top of that, well this issue that I talked about earlier which is the inventory to sales ratio is trending up, which may be a third factor or you may look at it as part of the second factor which is e-commerce I don't know, what are those two? So there are either two or three factors that are making the -- our demand drivers for our business better than the underlying economy. That's my take of it, I don't know for sure but we will see but that's what I think is going on.","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick with Capital One Securities. Your line is open.","Tom Lesnick","Great, thanks for taking my questions. My question has to do with international markets obviously you guys have visibility into international markets more so than a lot of other industrial landlords out there. Just wondered if you can comment on the trends in fundamentals in both Europe and Asia and then if you're seeing any movement in cap rates as well?","Tom Olinger","Yes, let's start in Europe; cap rates are generally flat for the last couple of quarters. Our expectation there though is you could see another 15 to 30 basis points this year, trends are good. For the first time, we are viewing Europe as a potential tailwind.","To the company, the outlook when you're looking at market vacancies as a whole is that vacancies not occupancies, is vacancies will drop 60 basis points. So we will be somewhere around market vacancies about 5.8% which is nearing sort of U.S. levels. So we expect Europe to perform well on a go-forward basis.","And in Asia, the market there I think are performing well. Japan is sitting there at about 96.3% occupied and we're seeing good net absorption. So Japan is performing well. China is a business that I think some have concern of it, it's a small business for us but one that again is performing pretty well. We're about 92% occupied in our overall portfolio, but if you look at the supplemental, you will see that there is a leased to occupied about 200 basis points. So you should expect the occupancies in China to trend up.","The other comment I make about China is that we've done about 2 million square feet of development leasing this quarter, which is about 30% of the total leasing for the quarter for the company. So it's performing pretty well. So net-net I would say that the international markets are performing to expectation and will become a tailwind.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Craig Mailman","Hey guys, may be just going back to Tom's comments about potentially ramping dispositions, what are you seeing in different markets that's given you kind of the confidence that may be you can do that? In which geographies are you seeing deeper disposition pool than others at this point?","Mike Curless","Hi, this is Mike Curless. Let me hit that. It's probably important to set the backdrop in terms of what we're selling. To put this in context 80% of what we're selling is in the U.S. and the majority of those buildings are older product in our global markets where the heavy buyer interest continues to be and with a few exceptions, the most we\u2019re selling in the $25 million range. So if you think about it in addition to our usual buyers you can add in local or regional investors and even user buyers that really expands that buyer pool. Buyer pool gives us plenty of confidence to get this work done. So we feel very good about the execution in our way.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Erin Aslakson with Stifel. Your line is open.","Erin Aslakson","Hi good morning out there. Can you hear me?","Hamid Moghadam","Yes, good morning, Erin.","Erin Aslakson","Great, good morning. I think this question for Mike Curless but just in terms of the strong same-store NOI growth you guys put up for the quarter, if you had to break that out across U.S. in terms of which submarkets are contributing or contracting that number that would be helpful. And then also are you still seeing strong institutional demand in terms of asset acquisitions for these potential sales you're discussing?","Mike Curless","Do you mind if I pick the Executive from Indiana that will answer that question?","Erin Aslakson","Not at all.","Mike Curless","I'll do the backup.","Gary Anderson","We will let Tom do that, the same-store.","Tom Olinger","So on the same-store as far as where we're seeing strength and Gene should weigh in here, it's -- I think you would clearly look at the coastal markets is where you\u2019re going to see the significant amount of rent change that drove same-store growth and I think as we look to the balance of the year, our rent change on roll looks really, really good and may be Gene can comment on that aspect.","Gene Reilly","Yes, absolutely Tom is right. So if you look at the coastal markets, where we've been at very much full occupancy there for a couple of years actually in those cases. So it\u2019s all about rent growth. And in places like LA, LA County is less than 2% vacant, actually it's in the low ones, Toronto for example is 1.8 vacant and at those types of occupancy levels lot and lot of pricing power. So it's definitely skewed to those types of markets.","Tom Olinger","And in terms of buyer interest, the institutional interest is definitely there particularly in light of where we\u2019re selling and what we\u2019re selling, so healthy activity in that segment.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Brad Burke with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brad Burke","Thank you. Just a question on leverage levels and uses of cash. There is a modest sequential decline in net debt from the fourth quarter but it looks like you've already realized over half of that $1 billion regarding to -- for proceeds with full-year. So just want to know if there is something else beyond development that we should be thinking about as a substantially use of cash in the quarter and then also whether we should continue to expect net proceeds deployed to reduce net debt over the remainder of the year?","Tom Olinger","Hi, Brad, it\u2019s Tom. So I'll take those questions. First on LTV you\u2019re right, LTV you would have appeared didn't decline enough based on our activity for the quarter and what\u2019s happening is it's really a function of the weakening of the dollar and the strengthening of the Yen and the Euro and there is a denominator effect that I'll explain. So, when you think about half of our debt in Yen and Euro but only about 25% of our assets are. So when the Yen and Euro increase against that liability, that debt that increase took our debt levels up in U.S. dollar terms by about $300 million.","But we didn't have the same $300 million increase in our denominator because only 25% of our assets are in Euro and Yen. So there is a denominator effect and that impacted leverage by about 70 basis points this quarter. So you really economically, we had about 100 basis points decline this quarter little over actually but that\u2019s FX noise.","On your point about deployment proceeds for the rest of the year and how we\u2019re going to use that $1 billion of cash, we\u2019re going to look at our debt stacks and we\u2019re going to determine if there is debt where we can economically or frictionlessly pay that off. We do have a multi-currency term loan that\u2019s out there, that matures in a couple of years that would fit that bill. We always looked at bond maturities to see if there is economically it makes sense to do that or we'll sit on cash. But I would tell you when you look at our guidance, either the debt that we have to pay off is extremely low rate debt, so it doesn\u2019t have a significant impact on our results for the rest of the year.","Gene Reilly","And to also state the obvious, the corresponding asset value increase in the same currencies obviously doesn't factor into that leverage calculations. So you need to that into account as well. So it's not as if our debt went up and the asset didn't go up, both of those are in same currency.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Sumit Sharma with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Sumit Sharma","Hi question about the G&A. I understand the reclassification and what you\u2019ve talked about. But you mentioned that there are further efficiencies in the G&A line. So wondering whether this -- whether you\u2019re seeing an sort of active decline in G&A as percent of NOI or is it just as more developments come online, the G&A load as a percentage of assets just sort of goes down naturally?","Tom Olinger","No, yes, actually it would be up because I think since the development volume is actually coming down a little bit, there will be less capitalized into development over time. The total level of G&A is flat and therefore G&A as a percentage of AUM is coming down. That reclassification doesn't have anything to do with that. We\u2019re looking at total G&A. And the capitalized portion is actually coming down too as the volumes come down.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel with Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.","Eric Frankel","Thank you. I wanted to circle back on the increased disposition guidance and make your comments on the selling older assets in global markets. I think we observed the last few years that cap rates spreads between A and B and C quality properties have widened pretty significantly over that time period and so I'm wondering if that spread has somehow decreased over the last year or so and that's why you are increasing disposition guidance.","Tom Olinger","Eric, first of all we haven\u2019t increased our disposition guidance. But relative to the spreads we certainly haven\u2019t seen an increase. And I think the pricing that we\u2019re seeing in those markets relative to what we\u2019re selling we're very comfortable with and optimistic of our ability to execute at those numbers.","Hamid Moghadam","Again maybe I can clarify on the issue here. We're not selling bad assets in bad markets or anything like that. We're just selling at this point; we're down to virtually all of our assets being in our targeted markets. We're just calling the older assets in those target markets. So we're not selling assets in tertiary markets or whatever, we really been onus in tertiary markets to start with. So the spread widening that you're talking about really doesn't sound effective Prologis portfolio and hasn't even in last couple of years.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi. Your line is open.","Manny Korchman","Hey thanks guys. Just thinking about the AFFO guidance percentage and the element of it that includes development gains, how do we think about that business or that part of AFFO going forward? Is that going to cause lumpiness in that FFO or is that sort of $150 million to $200 million a good annual run rate to think about?","Tom Olinger","I think the way to think, the way I think about it is that we think about the recurring AFFO as the driver of our dividends and we work really hard to manage the impact of the lumpy part of AFFO that comes from dispositions through a variety of mechanisms like 10\/31s and all kinds of things. So but we never think about those things in terms of the dividend structure.","Hamid Moghadam","Manny, I would just point out one more, two things. One our payout ratio this year including all the gains will be about 70% payout ratio. If you want to back out all the gains which is not the right run rate but just to stress it that would be about 85% payout ratio.","Tom Olinger","Of AFFO.","Hamid Moghadam","Of AFFO.","Tom Olinger","Our problem is the opposite to be honest with you, how to keep our dividends from getting too high.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Craig Mailman","Hey guys, just a question on the kind of rent spreads here versus what you guys did on the leasing capital in the quarter obviously rent spreads you guys came in a little bit above your expectations. Is there anything that's skewed those numbers this quarter and can you kind of just juxtapose those with the 6.7% of lease value this quarter is that kind of sustainable at those levels or is it just the higher levels of renewals?","Tom Olinger","Yes, to the second part of the question, this is really related to the lease term because the 6.7% of the aggregate value of the lease which is obviously influenced by the term to give you some perspective on that. In the Americas, our average term has grown over the last five quarters from 42 months to just under 56. So, we\u2019ve been really pushing term and I think we\u2019ve talked about this on some prior calls as a company overall it's about 10 months. It is pretty dramatic increase, so that's what drives the number.","But the same-store let me give you some color on what we see going through the year. So this is driven by the Americas in part because of the health of the market and in part because of the structure of our leases. But we're just under 24% during the quarter. We're not going to sustain that through the year. This is a volatile stat by quarter because it\u2019s just the piece of the portfolio. But we\u2019ll be close to 20% for the year by judging this. So we\u2019re going to be really, really strong on the stat, but there's a little bit of an outlier.","Hamid Moghadam","Great. Since that was the last question, let me thank all of you for your interest in the company and look forward to seeing you next quarter. Take care.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call and you may now disconnect."],"17485":["Prologis (NYSE:PLD) Q1 2013 Earnings Call April 24, 2013 12:00 PM ET","Executives","Tracy A.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Tracy Ward, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Tracy A. Ward","Thank you, Michelle, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2013 conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations.

[Operator Instructions] Hamid, will you please begin?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Thank you, Tracy. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter call. The year is off to a great start, and I'm pleased with our results. Momentum is building across all our lines of business. Performance in the first quarter was driven primarily by strong operations and the continued execution of our 10 Quarter Plan, which remains ahead of schedule.","Let me first offer some observations on the economic trends that affect our business. Global trade has risen well above its previous peak, and the IMF forecast of growth are 3.6% for this year and 5.3% for the next year. Globally, consumption is also expanding, with e-commerce an increasingly important factor, growing 15% per year in developed markets and more than 25% a year in emerging markets. This is driving new demand for large-scale distribution facilities around the world, first from pure online companies and second from traditional retailers, building out parallel supply chains for their online divisions. Most of these companies are positioning their distribution networks in global markets for expedited delivery, which plays right into our area of strategic focus.","Space utilization stands at record levels. This suggests that our customers have less shadow space than normal, which is an important leading indicator of demand. In the U.S., personal consumption and expenditures are 5% above prior peak, and the consensus forecast is for consumption to grow by 2% this year and next. Housing is clearly on an upward trajectory, which starts in sales growing in the first quarter. Real inventories troughed 3 years ago, and today they're still 3% below their precrisis level. This is the only major economic indicator that remains below peak. We expect inventories to surpass previous highs by year end.","In the U.S., net absorption in the first quarter was a positive 63 million square feet, 2.5x the comparable quarter last year and the strongest first quarter since 2000. We've not changed our forecast for net absorption of 150 million square feet for 2013, but we may prove to be conservative given the strong start to the year. In spite of surging demand, development remains in check. For the quarter, new supply was a modest 17 million square feet, well below the historic average. The majority of starts were build-to-suit projects.","For the year we expect completions in the U.S. of 60 million to 70 million square feet, roughly half the norm for a recovery and in line with our estimates for annual obsolescence.  I spent last week in Europe and came away convinced that demand for high quality facilities, combined with a dearth of modern supply, will result in near term improvements in occupancy and, in time, rental rates. Today, we see clear evidence of this occupancy in rental growth in northern Europe and the U.K. The key takeaways from my trip last week were, first, investor interest in investing in European logistics is growing substantially following the closing of our Norges venture. Second, the capital markets are improving. Investment activity has picked up and there is more financing available than the headlines suggest. We're confident this activity will put downward pressure on cap rates as it did in the U.S. 2 years ago.","In Asia demand is driven by e-commerce and 3PLs who are reconfiguring their supply chains. Vacancy rates reached new market lows in Japan. In China, net effective rents continue to rise and are expected to grow by 5% to 7% in 2013. In short, we see a new window of opportunity opening with the return of pricing power in most markets. At the same time, we have interest rates at historic lows. These 2 conditions rarely coexist. We believe we are entering the sweet spot of the industrial rent cycle with a period of significant rental growth ahead of us.","Let's switch gears now for a brief look into our results for the quarter. Our teams around the globe did a stellar job, leasing a total of 35 million square feet. This volume is 15% higher than the comparable quarter last year. We have the typical seasonal dip in occupancy in our small units. This was due to normal seasonal factors. We continue to believe this segment will experience a considerable boost from their recovering housing market. Demand for our largest properties continue to grow. We're 99% leased in spaces over 250,000 feet and completely sold out our product above 0.5 million square feet. This level of demand is significant for 2 reasons. First, following 17 quarters of rent roll downs, rent change turned positive this quarter, as we had anticipated. Recovery in rent has broadened and now includes most of the markets around the globe. Second, as we indicated at our investor forum, we expect net effective rents to grow by 20% to 25% globally through 2016. The only change from our earlier expectations is that we now believe we'll realize this growth sooner. Rental growth will be the single biggest driver of our future core earnings, and its realization is not dependent on any incremental capital investment.","The lack of supply is driving our development starts, especially for the larger buildings. During the quarter, we start more than 310 million of new development projects, with an average estimated margin of more than 21%. Over 1\/3 of our starts were build-to-suits. While we don't expect to sustain this level of development profitability forever, our margins point to the low book value of our land bank and the competitive advantage it provides us going forward. We saw the benefit of our land bank with a number of recent build-to-suits, including projects with Amazon, Quaker, BMW and Sainsbury's. In each case our fully entitled and ready-to-go sites were a major contributor to our success.","Let me conclude with a few comments on Private Capital. During the quarter, we reached 2 key milestones. We completed the IPO of our J-REIT, which was a tremendous success and continues to trade well. This vehicle will serve as a long-term operating vehicle in Japan. We also completed the recapitalization of PEPR and our European balance sheet assets by forming our joint venture with Norges Bank. This venture underscores the strength of the European investor real estate market and the appeal of our portfolio.","To sum up, Prologis had a great first quarter, and we're poised to do well going forward. With that I'll turn things over to Tom.","Thomas S. Olinger","Thanks, Hamid. This morning I'll cover 3 topics. First, our quarterly results; second, deployment and capital markets activity; and third, guidance for 2013. Starting with the results for the first quarter, core FFO was $0.40 a share, $0.01 ahead of our expectations. Net operating income was better than we forecasted driven primarily by higher occupancy. We'd expected occupancy to drop about 80 basis points sequentially in line with the higher lease roll that occurs at the beginning of each year. However, occupancy only declined 30 basis points from year end as leasing volume came in higher than forecast. Occupancy was 93.7% at quarter end. Q1 leasing volume was 35.8 million square feet, which was seasonally strong as Hamid mentioned. Rent change on rollover increased 2% for the quarter. Positive rent change was driven by space sizes 250,000 square feet and larger consistent with where we're seeing low vacancies and limited new supply.","For the quarter, GAAP same-store NOI was up 0.3% and, on an adjusted cash basis, was up 1.8%. Cash same-store NOI should continue to outperform GAAP same-store throughout 2013 as we expect further benefits from contractual rent bumps and declines in the rent concessions.","Switching gears to Private Capital. Our Private Capital revenues this quarter are up sequentially due to asset management fees from the J-REIT and Norges joint venture. Had both of these transactions occurred at the beginning of the quarter, our Private Capital revenue would have been almost 6 million higher. Following these transactions, about 80% of our Private Capital fees are now generated from perpetual or long life vehicles.","Moving to our deployment activity. We had contributions and dispositions of $5.3 billion during the first quarter, with $3.3 billion in our share. The vast majority of this related to the closings of our J-REIT and Norges joint venture. We realized or monetized $247 million of development value creation in the first quarter, driven primarily by contributions to our J-REIT. As you know, our core FFO does not include any of these development gains even though we recognize real economic value from the transactions. To put the magnitude of the development realization in context, the development gains were $0.53 per share relative to our core FFO of $0.40 per share for the first quarter.","Development starts were $313 million for the first quarter, with $218 million our share. We're continuing to see more development opportunities and, as expected, our land bank has proven to be a competitive advantage. We have very good visibility into our pipeline and are off to a great start this year for this early in the period.","On the acquisition front, it was a light quarter. However, our pipeline is building as there are more opportunities coming to market.","Now let me walk you through our uses of our net deployment proceeds. We used $2.4 billion of the proceeds to repay our senior convertible and secured debt, as well as paid down our credit facilities. We retained the remainder of the net proceeds and ended the quarter with $785 million in cash. Subsequent to quarter end, we completed the redemption of $482 million of our preferred stock. This leaves one series of preferred stock currently outstanding with a redemption value of $100 million. As a result of the significant disposition and contribution activity, we lowered our look-through leverage to 37.5%, a reduction of almost 600 basis points from year end, and we improved our net debt to EBITDA to 7.5x, down from 8.8x in the fourth quarter. And we also increased our U.S. dollar net equity to 66%, up from 58% at year end. Our long-term goal is to have this metric over 80%. It's important to point out that while we've significantly reduced our leverage, we've also been able to maintain our core FFO level of $0.40 per share on a year-over-year leases.","Now for an update for 2013 guidance. For operations, we're maintaining our GAAP same-store NOI range of 1.5% to 2.5%. We continue to expect year-end occupancy to range between 94% and 95%. On the expense side, we're maintaining our net G&A guidance range of $220 million to $230 million.","For capital deployment, our 2013 forecast continues to range from $1.9 billion to $2.4 billion. This includes $1.5 to $1.8 billion of development starts with our share at approximately 75%. Based on the pipeline we see today, we could be at the high end of this range. And $400 million to $600 million of building acquisitions with our share at about 35%.","Turning to contributions and dispositions. We're maintaining our guidance of $7.5 billion to $10 billion for the year, with our share of the proceeds to be about 60%. With the activity completed in the first quarter, we're at about 60% of the way through our disposition and contribution guidance for the entire year. The balance of the guidance totals $2.3 billion to $4.8 billion with dispositions primarily in the U.S. and contributions to our co-investment ventures in Europe, Japan, Brazil and Mexico. We've revised our FX guidance and are now assuming the euro at 1.3 and the yen at 100 to reflect the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the past quarter. This change has about a $0.03 per share negative impact on full year core FFO.","We continue to expect 2013 core FFO to range between $1.60 and $1.70 per share. As we discussed last quarter, our core FFO guidance is significantly impacted by dilution from the timing and associated friction of redeploying the proceeds from our contributions and disposition activity. Relative to this, the average annual yield on contributions and dispositions is approximately 6.8%, while the average annual yield on our use of proceeds is approximately 4.2%. These use of proceeds consist of debt repayments, preferred redemptions and capital deployment. As a result of the redeployment timing and friction, core FFO will not be evenly distributed between the quarters for the balance of 2013. We expect second quarter core FFO to be $0.02 to $0.03 lower than the first quarter. Core FFO will increase in the back half of 2013, primarily driven by higher NOI from development stabilizations, same-store NOI growth and lower interest cost.","Before I close I want to discuss 2 new disclosures in our supplemental this quarter. The first disclosure relates to our debt-to-EBITDA metric. As you know, development is a key business segment for us. However, its earnings or realized value accretion gains are not included in our core FFO or in EBITDA as I pointed out earlier. In order to correct for this misalignment, certain adjustments need to be made to our debt-to-EBITDA calculation to appropriately reflect our development business. These adjustments are detailed in our supplemental and include increasing EBITDA for stabilized NOI from the pipeline, increasing debt to fund the remaining cost to complete the pipeline and decreasing debt by the book value of the land bank. Using this methodology, our debt to EBITDA was 6.2x for the first quarter. This is the right metric to use to compare us to REITs, who do not have a meaningful development business.","The second disclosure relates to G&A as a percentage of AUM. We use this metric internally to measure and manage our overhead cost. We provided 2 ways to look at this metric based on whether you want to use our AUM owned and managed or our share basis. Using owned and managed AUM, you need to include both our G&A and Private Capital expenses in the numerator. This results in 69 basis points. Using our share of AUM, you need to include both G&A and Private Capital expenses, but you must deduct our Private Capital revenues from the numerator, which results in 61 basis points. The traditional way of measuring G&A as a percentage of FFO is not applicable for us given our substantial Private Capital business.","To wrap up, I'm very pleased with our results this quarter and the positive impact you now see in our financial position resulting from the progress we made on our strategic priorities. While we have a little further to go to reach our long-term leverage and foreign currency exposure targets, we're in a great position to take advantage of emerging opportunities and to profitably grow the company.","With that, I'll turn it back to Hamid.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Thanks, Tom. Here are the key points I hope you take away from today's call. First, the recovery in industrial real estate continues around the globe. This is evident in growing demand in the face of still very modest supply of new space. We're in an unusual phase of the cycle where we benefit from both low interest rates and accelerating growth in rents. Second, the substantial work associated with the merger is complete, and we're ahead of schedule on our 10 quarter priorities. We built a solid foundation from which to grow in the coming years. Third, we believe the scale of our operating platform, the depth of our expertise and customer relationships, and our substantial land bank provide us with some significant competitive advantages going forward. We have the financial resources, both public and private, to capitalize on a growing and exciting set of new opportunities around the world. With that we will open it up to your questions. Michelle?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jeff Spector from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Jamie Feldman here with Jeff. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the kind of leasing you did see in the quarter and what you're expecting for the year. I know there's a lot of talk about housing helping demand grow, but maybe just frame how much of your bullish comments are housing related, how much is e-commerce, how much is supply chain redesign, just to frame a little bit more of what's going on out there.","Eugene F. Reilly","Sure, Jamie, it's Gene. Let me take that. I think it's broad-based. Obviously what's really moving the needle is e-commerce because you have a lot of very, very large transactions. So they're driving the absorption in the market, and we're certainly seeing our fair share of that. But we're also beginning to see -- although in this quarter, as Hamid mentioned, we had a normal seasonal decline in occupancy of small spaces, Jamie, I'm actually more bullish this quarter about our prospects for small tenant leasing than I was last quarter. Last year, I think we dropped in the first quarter and then built about 340 basis points of occupancy in that segment. And like I said, I feel better about this year. So it's fairly broad-based. We need better information for you guys relative to housing. What we do see is that there's more floor-covering-type demand, more demand for millwork, appliances and other housing-related activity, and that's probably growing 25%, 30% sort of quarter-to-quarter. So we are seeing that, and that does show more in the small tenant spaces. One final thing on aggregate demand and sort of our general sense of bullishness, I'll speak to the U.S. and there isn't any doubt that e-commerce is driving tons of demand. We're getting our share. But it's really -- it's focused on major population centers. It's focused on gateways. So there is -- there are winners and losers in this, and we think our portfolio is well positioned.","Gary A. Anderson","So, Jamie, just a couple of things. I think on Europe and Asia, with respect to Europe, it's really about high utilization rates. The spaces that they're in are full. We don't have the same phenomenon of housing driving Europe today. In fact, the housing market -- it's really tough to get data on housing in Europe, but the data that we've been able to piece together in some of the larger markets is that from 2007, which was the peak, housing starts have dropped 55% and haven't recovered yet. That will be something that will be a driver in the future for Europe. In Japan, e-commerce is a big play. But the bigger and broader play, quite frankly, is reconfiguration, and that's going to happen for decades, so that's not a story that's going to go away. And in China, again it's about consumption: moving from an export-oriented economy to a consumption economy, and again that's going to take some time. So we're optimistic about leasing in Europe and Asia.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Toti from Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","I just have a very quick question. Can you walk us through the 9% same-store expense growth that you posted in the quarter? What were some of the primary drivers there? And is it possibly related to some of the changes that you've instituted?","Gary A. Anderson","Yes. It's Gary. Let me take a stab at that. First of all, I'd tell you that if you look at the comparable quarter Q1 2012, that was a very low expense quarter. We were actually down 6.6%, so it's tough to compare quarter to quarter, but let me try. The 9% change is really split into 2 pieces. You had the Americas and Europe, and it was basically half and half. For the Americas, we say this occasionally, but it really had to do with a light winter in '11 '12, so we didn't see much expense in the first quarter of '12. For Europe, it's a little bit more complicated story. You had the same sort of winter variants, light winter in Central and Eastern Europe. We had some repair and maintenance increases in northern and southern Europe, and there were some utility and property tax timing differences. Net-net-net, what I would tell you is that I wouldn't be concerned about operating expenses spiraling out-of-control. We've got them under control. Most of these are recoverable expenses. And in my view, again, I think we need to get a couple of quarters behind this, so we can get really good clean comparable quarter-to-quarter data.","Operator",".","Your next question comes from Michael Bilerman from Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Hamid, you talked in your comments about sort of the rental growth upside that you laid out last September, the 20% to 25% upside in rents by 2016. And I think you made the comment on the call that you believe that you're still going to get it, but you're going to get it sooner. And the other thing that you put out at that Investor Day was, call it, $400 million of potential incremental NOI over $0.80, with the majority of that coming from this rent growth. And so just given the lease rollover schedule that you have, how should we start thinking about that 365 annualized number starting to hit bottom line FFO next year, the year after? How quickly will that come?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Sure, Michael, that's a good question, and I think probably the single most important question in terms of what our earnings profile is going to look like in the next couple of years. The $400 million is a simple math of roughly 25% plus a little bit of occupancy gain, which from the point I made to comment, stabilization is about 2 to 3 points. It's a combination of 21%, 22% rental growth and a couple of points of occupancy gain, and 25% of $1.6 billion is $400 million, and that's how that math comes from. We actually did not project that in terms of what actually rolls over through the leases through 2016. I don't know. My guess would be 70% of it will rollover by 2016, and some of it will be anticipated in 2016 on our 2017 numbers. So it will be maybe 85%, 90% of it, but it's some fraction of it. It's not 100% of it. The other thing you've got going is that the leases in the interim that get marked to market are obviously going to have escalations on them. So those, while not affecting GAAP, those affect sort of our cash same-store kind of growth numbers. So that's really a ballpark estimate, but directionally, I think, if I'm going to make a guess, I would say we're probably 6 months earlier than what I told you 6 months ago. So feeling pretty good.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Mailman from KeyBanc Capital.","Craig Mailman - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Jordan Sadler is on the line with me as well. Tom, I know you touched on it in the prepared remarks, the bump in expenses or the Private Capital business. Basically I know on Page 30 you laid out the pro forma edition there. But just looking -- are a lot of the expenses kind of front-loaded in that 99 and that 5.8 million flows right to the top line, or is there a little bit of margin erosion in the Private Capital business?","Thomas S. Olinger","No, it's a great question. There is not. We're actually going to see improved margins in our Private Capital business. When you look at the Q1 number, it's seasonally a little high. That number will come down as we look forward into Q -- the rest of the year. And that -- the Private Capital expenses are going to go up a little bit as a result of NPR and that platform cost. And there are more assets under management in that business now compared to Q4. But Q1 was a little seasonally high. It will come back down, and you're going to see pretty significant margin improvement over the year in our Private Capital business.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vance Edelson.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Could you comment on property valuations in Europe? Are there any signs of improved sentiment there and higher valuations being applied? Or do you think that's going to have to wait for actual economic improvement, even though you're clearly outperforming based on the push toward upgraded logistics now?","Gary A. Anderson","Yes. It's Gary. Look, I think that this is happening. We've seen of a very slight bit of compression over the course of the last quarter. But again I think that the Norges transaction that we did recently is a watershed event. And I think that you're going to see more capital coming into Europe. And as a result, I think you're going to see more compression. Valuations are lagging today, but I would expect over the course of the next 12 months you're going to see improvement there.","Guy F. Jaquier","This is Guy. Just to add to that a little bit. In our funds in Europe, we've seen pretty much flat values for 7 quarters. We have not seen a recovery in value since the trough. If you look at last year, the entire logistics fund industry in Europe might have raised EUR 100 million of capital, virtually nothing given the scale of that market. Since the Norges transaction was announced, we have seen a significant pick up of real inquiries, real investors doing due diligence. And going back to Hamid's comments, we think the capital will flow through funds, ours and others, and will start to drive those values.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brendan Maiorana from Wells Fargo.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A question on the debt-to-EBITDA metric in the back of the supplemental, which, Tom, you mentioned in your prepared remarks. I'm wondering if you guys are now sort of looking at the balance sheet on that adjusted pro forma metric of 6.2x as opposed to the 7.5x, which is on the traditional metric and what that might mean for your target leverage and debt-to-EBITDA metrics, which I think on the traditional calculation are still 5x to 6x.","Thomas S. Olinger","Brendan, it's Tom. Thanks for your question. There is absolutely no change in our long term leverage targets. We still want to get to 30%. We wanted to share the adjusted debt-to-EBITDA metric for the development business to make sure people really understand how that business impacts those metrics. And if you want to compare us to other companies who do not have a substantial development business, you have to adjust for that business to accurately reflect our financial position. So we think it's the right way to compare us to other companies, but absolutely no change in our long-term goals of leverage.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ross Nussbaum from UBS.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about the goal you have for your U.S. dollar exposure? I think the commentary was you're up to 66% on Q1 transactions and the long-term goal was 80%. Generally speaking, can you just refresh us on what your time frame for that goal is? And at this point, are there any other, what I'll call, big moving pieces to get to that goal, or is it the basic blocking and tackling of the [indiscernible]","Thomas S. Olinger","Ross, this is Tom. We'll see that goal -- I think we'll attain that goal over the next 2 years. The biggest movers of that were clearly the J-REIT transaction and the Norges transaction. As you know, we have the ability to sell down an incremental 30% in our Norges joint venture 2 years out. That will significantly impact this number. And we'll continue to contribute assets off of our balance sheet, development assets off our balance sheet in Japan into NPR. Now when you think about the other big dials that will turn this, it's really going to be on the debt side of the equation. We really moved most of the pieces on the asset side. So now it's on the debt side. You're going to see us move more of our long-term debt out of U.S. dollars into euro and yen to further naturally hedge our exposure. I think that'll take us over the balance of the next 2 years to get those pieces together, hopefully sooner.","Operator","Your next question comes from George Auerbach from ISI Group.","George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Hey, Tom, could you help us maybe bridge the step down in revenues from the first quarter to the second quarter as you sort of fully move Norges and the J-REIT assets out of the revenue run rate?","Thomas S. Olinger","Yes, so as a reminder, NPR happened on February 14, so it's in Q1's results for half a quarter. The Norges transaction happened on March 18, so less than 15 days in the quarter. When you look at those 2 transactions alone, that is about -- when you net -- after you net out the incremental fees we get from those transactions, it's about $27 million of NOI. So that is really what's driving that decline. And then there's also the timing impact of how we're deploying the capital. If you remember, we ended the quarter with $785 million in cash, and we're putting that to work in the second quarter. As you know, we redeemed $482 million of our preferred shares, and we also have substantially all of our balance sheet debt maturing by June 1 of this year. So we'll be able to redeploy a significant amount of the excess proceeds in the back half of the second quarter, but that really explains that dip. And going into the second half of the year, you're going to see core FFO grow back because we're going to see stabilizations from our development pipeline. As you know, we've been ramping up our development pipeline. That kicks in, you're going to see same-store NOI growth kick in. And also you're going to see the full impact of our deleveraging through lower interest expense, as well as the elimination of those preferred securities.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Stewart.","John Stewart - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Tom, could you please give us the releasing spreads on a cash basis? And then, Hamid, you pointed out that the J-REIT has continued to trade well since the IPO. But, of course, the flip side is that there was some value left on the table. Could you please speak to the process, the execution and the trading since the IPO?","Eugene F. Reilly","John, it's Gene. Let me take your first question on the cash rent change. We do not track that metric. And the reason we don't is, as you know, it's extremely volatile, and we believe other measure is more informative. So if we look at our quarterly GAAP rent change, in fact, it's in concessions and rent bumps and is a better gauge for comparing real apples-to-apples net effective rents on a quarterly basis. We think that's helpful. But if we really want to understand where our cash in place rents relative to the current market, you look at it just on a quarterly basis, you get a lot of noise. But as the rents have recovered globally, we think today overall the portfolio is currently under-rented by about 5%.","Hamid R. Moghadam","So, John, this is Hamid. In Japan, the way an IPO works is that the buyer of the J-REIT, I cannot buy assets for more than appraised value, particularly when acquiring assets from a sponsor that's an affiliate. So no matter where the REIT market would have been, even if we were doing it today, it would have to transact at the same number. So really the pricing of the IPO only affects leverage and not the price of the sponsor. The more the price is, the lower the leverage is. So even if we had waited till today with the benefit of 20\/20 hindsight and executed on the peak of the market, we wouldn't have gotten a dime more in proceeds. So that's the first point. The second point is that our range of pricing was JPY 500,000 to JPY 550,000. We priced at the top of that range, which was equivalent to the low 5% cap rate on the assets that were contributed. And that was a much more attractive cap rate than any of the analysts following us have in their NAV. And finally, I would say that in terms of exchange gains, notwithstanding the yen, if you will, weakening in the last 3 months from where we invested in those assets, we have several hundred million dollars of gain that you'll never see because they're foreign exchange gains. So in short, we're very pleased about the execution of the J-REIT, and we think it'll continue to be a great vehicle for growing values in Japan for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Mueller from JPMorgan.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess on the acquisition side, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the types of products you're looking at. Is it what you see in the pipeline as a predominantly stabilized assets? Is it stuff with lot of vacancy or just something in between?","Michael S. Curless","This is Mike. We're certainly looking at a combination of acquisition opportunities, which range from primarily core. Most of our activity here has been -- 95% has been in the core markets. But a very important part of our business is the value-added acquisition. Part of our business where we have real success in identifying below or off market and very attractive returns that we can add our leasing machine to and create some real value. So I think we'll get combination of that as we look forward to the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a quick question, just going back to sort of the development pipeline and the value creation there. Yes, I know you said the margins are pretty high right now. But just looking at the weighted average cap rate at stabilization estimated at 6 4, I know that ticked down just a tiny bit quarter-on-quarter. But just thinking about that relative to some of the cap rates that were discussed at the Investor Day, it just seems like it's a little bit high given the mix of assets we're talking about here in the pipeline being almost 50\/50 Asia, U.S. And so I'm just wondering if you could provide some color on that, if that's just conservatism in there or if I'm not -- maybe I'm not interpreting that correctly.","Thomas S. Olinger","Vince, this is Tom. To go back, we'd like you to think about what we've talked about margins to be from a long-term perspective. We've talked about build-to-suit margins being in the low-double digits. We've talked about spec being mid to high teens. And what you're seeing today is really those margins are reflective of the land bank that we're seeing today.","Eugene F. Reilly","And let me just add one more thing, Vincent. You do have some mix of Brazil and Mexico probably in those numbers, which certainly in the case of Brazil dramatically affect it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Bilerman from Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, I just had a follow-up in terms of the G&A disclosure, Tom. I certainly appreciate it. I guess thinking about that you are in the development business the same way that you talk about the debt to EBITDA, you're deducting from here the $85 million of development G&A that you're capitalizing in the projects, but you're not including that as sort of this platform, but you are including the land and the development portfolio in your AUM. And actually it's a meaningful percentage. That's like 20 basis points in terms of G&A. I'm just curious why you don't think about the totality of the enterprise that you need because arguably you are in the development business. And if you are in the development business, you would have to either bring those people on or get rid of them, but then you wouldn't have the development AUM. So I'm just trying to think about how you are thinking about managing the enterprise in that way.","Hamid R. Moghadam","So, Michael, you're absolutely right. We are in the development business and those are real people with real costs associated with them. And by all means you're welcome to add that to our G&A and look at it in the totality of our business. But that would be one way of looking at it. But it seems to me that it would be pretty inconsistent with looking at it without any of the gain or value creation coming out of the real estate -- out of the development business. So I guess the most conservative way of looking at it is to add 20 basis points to our overhead and continue to not count any value creation in the development business. The more modest way would be to attribute the proper overhead which, long term by the way, is a variable cost. Short term, it may not be a variable cost. And if we decided, for some reason, which we're not going to decide, just to be clear, to get out of the development business, we wouldn't forever have all these extra developers around. We would rightsize our organization. We could theoretically put all those people in a related entity off to the side and outsource to them as well and still show the same margins because the margins that we're showing, the 21%, doesn't include the cap overhead. If we were to add that to the margin, it would probably be 25%. So look, we're going to give you all the data. You can figure it out any way you want. In the long term, those costs are variable. In the short term, they're fixed. That's a real business. It produces real profits, and we're very excited to have it going forward. And full disclosure, you figure it out.","Thomas S. Olinger","Hey, Michael, just one point of clarification. The $88 million annualizing the capitalized cost, those are not all development. About 40% of those costs relate to leasing. We'll clear that up so you can see the components of that going forward in the supplemental. And also to point out that we're not capping all of our development costs by any means. So sitting in our G&A are costs that support all of our businesses, and our back-office supports development just like it does our rent business, and those costs are not getting capitalized.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Yes, it's just the direct cost of development, not the indirect cost of development so.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Salinsky, RBC Capital.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about the transaction [ph] activity plans for the balance of the year, how we should expect timing in terms of development starts? And also at the pipeline right now is about a 7.8% yield. Where would you expect additional starts to commence at over the balance of the year?","Michael S. Curless","Well, in terms of our activity -- this is Mike. In terms of our activity in development starts, as Tom and Hamid mentioned we're certainly off to a good start this year at 300 million plus in the first quarter, which is typically a very light quarter. To give you a little contrast, this time last year we were at [indiscernible] 14% of the midpoint of our guidance range. We're already at 20% of the midpoint of the guidance range, and we have a handful of announcements, I think you've seen already, to put the balance of our development forecast in really good shape. We've got a handful -- announcements have been made and will be made soon to get the second quarter off to a real good start. And so, therefore, I think we're very bullish relative to our guidance on development activity going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brendan Maiorana from Wells Fargo.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I had just 2 follow-ups. One, Tom, I think you mentioned initially in your prepared remarks that same-store guidance of GAAP basis plus 1.5% to plus 2.5% was unchanged, but I think you also stated that cash is likely to be higher. Wondering if the spread of roughly 100, 150 basis points that we saw in Q1, higher cash versus GAAP is likely to sustain throughout the rest of the year. And then secondly, on FFO guidance. I think you said the FX changes were a negative $0.03 a share. So should we sort of look at, from an operational perspective, that you're feeling $0.03 better at sort of the midpoint of your guidance, Q1 versus what you guys reported or what you guided to in February?","Thomas S. Olinger","Okay, Brendan, on the same-store GAAP versus cash, if you look over the last really 5 quarters, the spread between GAAP and cash has ranged -- has averaged about 100 basis points. I think we'll see cash same-store outperform GAAP by about between 100, 150 basis points for the year. I think that's going to hold. Regarding the -- your FX question, and it did have a negative $0.03 impact on full year guidance. And you're right, we are seeing ops offset that, which is helping us keep our range the same.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dave Rodgers from Robert W. Baird.","David B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, Hamid, with regard to the speculative development and construction that we've seen obviously increasing in the last couple of quarters with your excitement around the business as well, maybe can you talk about governors around the overall development pipeline kind of the sizing of the pipeline relative to the size of the company that you're thinking today, and then how that sizing might depend relative to the build-to-suit and speculative mix?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Good question, Dave. So just to put the historic perspective, at the peak, I think the old Prologis was doing in the high 3s and the old AMB was doing in the low 1s of development. So combining those 2 platforms, even without considering that we have Brazil, which is an added market, it would have been 5 billion a year. We're not going to do $5 billion a year. We've been doing about $1.5 billion, inching up to $2 billion. As we laid out now 2, 3 years ago, we think it's a $2.5 billion a year type of number. To put a range on it, we only think it's $2 billion to $3 billion when it finally ramps up and it's stabilized. Not all of that will be our capital. Remember in Japan -- excuse me, in China and Brazil and Mexico, we're doing that with Private Capital. So roughly 60% of that will be our capital exposure. So our capital exposure on a run rate annual basis, call it, $2.5 billion times 60%, $1.5 billion on a bigger company compared to $5 billion before. So it's much more modest in the context of certainly history. In terms of -- and we continue to believe that the opportunity, profitable opportunity is about $2.5 billion a year. I mean, we could do $5 billion, but it wouldn't be profitable okay, and we're not going to do that. And I think it's going to be a year or 2 before we get to that level if the market continues in this direction. The build-to-suit percentage is -- has been unusually high. In the last year, it was 57%, et cetera, et cetera. Today, I think the run rate for build-to-suit is probably 25% to 30% for a company our size. But remember the spec deals that you talk about -- this is not putting up a 40 story spec office building somewhere. This is building the seventh building in a park where the other 6 buildings are full and we have visibility into what demand is. So I don't know what you call that, incremental development, whatever the name is, but purely it's not development in a spec or pioneering type of location. It's a [indiscernible] with an established base. And when you're 95% leased, which we're not there yet, but we'll get there, an incremental million square foot building on Prologis' 550 million square foot base is not really material. So I think we're very prudently managing risk in an integrated way across the company by not just the volume of development, but also by our capital exposure in development.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Guinee from Stifel.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Well, first wonderful job on the 10-quarter plan. Congratulations. Looking at Page 28, because that's an easy one to look at, Hamid, about a $30 billion total enterprise value, about $47 billion of AUM, does your 3-year plan basically have enough active asset recycling that the $30 billion and $47 billion number stay about the same? Or is this also a growth business in terms of those numbers, as well as square footage? And then the second question, which is really part of the first question is, you're creating a lot of value. It's not coming through the core FFO, but what's your thinking about the dividend and the ability to raise the dividend?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Great question. So, again, good questions there. I think we are going to grow in terms of square footage in AUM, but not because that's a metric that we plan to, but because of the opportunities I see in front of us in terms of the business. And let me elaborate on that. First of all, we are cleaning up the portfolio pretty quickly in terms of getting out of other markets and the bottom of our regional markets. And as that process continues, there's less of it to sell. And I think we'll sell a couple billion a year for a little while, but I think on the other hand, we're developing, as I mentioned earlier, $2 billion, $2.5 billion a year, and we'll certainly have some acquisition activity on top of that. So I think net-net-net, AUM will grow, not a number that we plan around, but I think that's going to be the reality of the picture. What was your second question? Oh, dividend, dividend. I love dividend. I think the key run rate of the dividend will be matched to our key core FFO rate, over time. If -- our development gains and the way we look at it are not really accounting or realized gains. I mean what we do in terms of development and creating a margin does not necessarily mean that we're going to realize it in cash. It just means that we may put it in the operating portfolio. We may sell it to a third-party, or we may contribute it to one of our related platforms. So I think if we, all of a sudden, get gobs of cash because we sell it to a third party and we book a lot or we earn a lot of cash profits, maybe we'll do a special dividend at that time for that purpose if we can't manage it another way. I'm not a big fan of special dividends, but that's conceptually how we think about it. But really the long-term rate of the dividend needs to be matched to the core FFO earning power of the company.","Thomas S. Olinger","John, I would add on the -- the other piece that the development gains really allow us to do is we're really -- we're redeploying that capital, all those profits, back into our development engine. It allows us to recycle that capital much more effectively, much more quickly. We don't have to go out in the market so those profits are really helping us fund our growing development business.","Hamid R. Moghadam","And, John, let me also mention one other thing. As I said in the investor forum last September, I think eventually people will start giving us credit. I hope, by the way, never at 10x or 12x or whatever people were counting development profits in the good old days, but at the sensible 4x, 5x kind of a number in terms of the value that we're creating in that number, I may be wrong about that, but that's what I think. So I think there's some good news there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Salinsky from RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","When you talked about the effect of single-family a couple of quarters back, you talked about the small block space in the portfolio. Can you give us an update what -- how much leasing you're -- the occupancy in that portfolio, and how that's tracked over the last couple of quarters? Have you seen a pick-up in single-family housing?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Mike, I'll tell you what, Gene already answered that question a little earlier. You may not have been on the call. So instead of repeating that, why don't you just call Gene, and he'll take you through it, if you don't mind.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Spector from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It's Jamie again. Just following up on what you're saying about build-to-suit and just new supply in general, is there something going on in this cycle that there is more of a demand for build-to-suit rather than spec? And I'm just thinking maybe it's like e-commerce related or supply chain redesign, where these companies want very specific -- have very specific requirements. Or is there something else that's driving the fact that we've seen so much more build-to-suit than usual at this point?","Hamid R. Moghadam","I think the buildings are getting bigger for e-commerce and there are fewer private developers. The private developing machine is really constrained right now because of financing. And, Jamie, you would know that obviously. So it's tough for these private guys to get a lot of financing, million-square-foot buildings even in out-of-the-way places are $50, $60 a foot, so those are big-ticket items. I don't think it's because the buildings are particularly specialized. I mean the shelves and configurations are pretty flexible. What people put inside of them in terms of conveyor systems and the like in some cases can be elaborate, but that's at the tenant's cost and it's removable. In fact, actually, if you go look inside a lot of these fulfillment centers that are these big buildings, you'd be really surprised to see how low tech some of them are with boxes sitting around on the floor and actually the building is not that crazily, heavily utilized because the whole distribution is set up around parcels as opposed to pallets and all that. So nothing special about the buildings. Buildings are getting bigger, and the private machinery for building spec is constrained because you can't get 100% financing. Mike, do you have more to say about that?","Michael S. Curless","Yes, there's more expectations I think with these customers to identify what we like to consider the safe choice, folks that don't have any financing contingencies have a long track record with building high-quality buildings, and these requirements are gravitating, as you've heard before, to larger or global markets. And those 3 facts have contributed to, we think, a very substantial and high closure rate for us. And then you mix in the dearth of supply of large spaces around the country, then they really got nowhere else to go. And it's all playing very well into our hands right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Bilerman.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just had a quick question. Tom, just on the debt to EBITDA, the 7.5 GAAP number, the debt is reflective of all the sales that you did because it's an end-of-quarter number. Have you pro forma the EBITDA down for the NOI that's effectively going out from the sales?","Thomas S. Olinger","Yes, we have. When I talked earlier about the drop in NOI over quarter 1 to quarter 2 of the run rate, we've adjusted that down. It's about $27 million, I think. It's footnoted. I think it's on Page 9 of the supplemental.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Okay, Michael, you get the last word.

My name is Chris, and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Also note, this conference is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Tracy Ward. Tracy, you may begin.","Tracy Ward","Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Prologis second quarter earnings call. If you have not yet downloaded the press release, it is available on Prologis' website at prologis.com under Investor Relations.","This morning, you'll hear from Tom Olinger, our Chief Financial Officer and Gene Reilly, Prologis's Chief Investment Officer. Also, joining us in today for the call is Hamid Moghadam, Gary Anderson, Chris Caton, Mike Curless, Ed Nekritz and Colleen McKeown.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry, in which the company operate, as well as the beliefs and assumptions of management. Some of these factors are referred to in Prologis' 10-K or SEC filings.","Additional factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, the expected timing and likelihood of the completion of the transaction with IPT, including the ability to attain the approval of their stockholders and the risk that the conditions of the closing of the transaction may not be satisfied.","Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and the actual operating results may differ. Finally, this call will contain financial measures, such as FFO, EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures and in accordance with Reg-G, the company has provided a reconciliation to those measures in our earnings package.","With that, I will turn the call over to Tom. Tom, will you please begin.","Tom Olinger","Thanks Tracy. Good morning. And thank you for joining us today. We had another excellent quarter. Our proprietary operating metrics continue to reflect strong demand. Showings, average deal gestation and conversion rates remain either in line or better than last quarter as our customers further build out their supply chain capabilities in the face of strength. Market conditions in the U.S. continue to be very healthy. Demand is diverse and overall supply is disciplined.","Starts in the U.S. are concentrated in low barrier markets, while supply in the high barrier markets is not keeping pace with GDP growth, let alone demand for logistics facilities closer to the endpoint of consumption. Continental Europe remained strong and we expect rent growth this year to be the highest in more than a decade. In Japan, despite moderating economic growth, business is quite good. Demand continues to be boosted by ecommerce, while supply is being steadily absorbed.","With the improvement we are seeing in the Osaka market, we are removing it from our market watch list. We are raising our 2019 global rent growth estimates by approximately 100 basis points to over 5.5% as low vacancies and rising replacement costs continue to push market rents higher.","Looking to the quarter. We leased 37 million square feet, including 5 million square feet in our development portfolio. Period-end occupancy was flat sequentially. Rent change on a role continues to be outstanding, but are shared over 25% and led by U.S. at 30%. We expect rent change to trend higher in the back half of the year. Our share of cash same-store NOI growth was 4.6%. Notably, Europe was 5.3%, driven by rent growth which we have anticipated. Core FFO was $0.77 per share for the second quarter.","G&A in the quarter was higher than expected, driven by stock-based compensation, resulting from the increase in our share price. This impact was mostly offset by higher than forecasted promo to them. For deployment, starts were $324 million in the quarter. The pace of starts will increase meaningfully in the second half of the year. In fact, we've already started 250 million of build-to-suits in the first two weeks of July. We completed over $600 million in dispositions and contributions, resulting in $200 million of realized gains in the quarter.","Now, for 2019 guidance highlights which are on an our-share basis. And note that our guidance does not include the impacts from the IPT acquisition. We are increasing and narrowing our cash same-store NOI guidance to a range of 4.5% to 5%. We're holding the top end of our range as we continue to prioritize the rents over occupancy. We're raising the midpoint for both development starts and contributions by $100 million, and realized development gains by $50 million.","We still expect about $400 million net usage, which we plan to fund with free cash flow and a modest increase in leverage. Net promote income for the full year is now expected to be $0.16 per share, an increase of $0.02 from our prior guidance. Effectively, all of the remaining net promote income will be earned in the third quarter.","For the full year, we are increasing our 2019 core FFO guidance midpoint by $0.05, and narrowing the range between $3.26 and $3.30 per share. And our revised midpoint growth and core FFO per share, excluding promotes, is 9.5% higher than last year. Over the past five years, our growth has clearly been exceptional with a CAGR of almost 12%, while de-levering by 800 basis points.","As I mentioned, this guidance does not include IPT. The acquisition of this high-quality portfolio, which Gene will cover in more detail, captures significant costs and revenue synergies, delivering shareholder value on day-one.","We planned a whole new portfolio through one or both of our U.S. private vehicles, and expect the transaction to close no later than the first quarter of 2020. Depending on the ultimate allocation, our investment via the ventures is likely the range between $1 billion and $1.4 billion, which we will fund with cash and debt.","The resulting annual core FFO accretion is expected to range between $0.05 and $0.06 per share on a stabilized basis. This transaction will have a minimal impact on leverage with loan to value rising about 150 basis points upon the completion of the non-strategic asset sales to approximately 21%. We do not plan to add any corporate overhead in connection with this acquisition and as a result expect G&A as a percentage of [AUM] decreased by 4%.","I feel that several questions lately about how we will continue to grow given our size, we think about growth and three components. The first is organic and based on the quality and strength of our portfolio. This is by far the most important and sustainable driver of growth that also deserves the highest multiple. The second is the value creation from development and to build out of our land bank. The third component is arbitraging the pricing between public and private markets. This is episodic, out of the hands of management and not sustainable over the long-term.","We focus on the first two components, which have been the driver of our superior performance, and will continue to be the foundation of our long term growth. To sum up, the second quarter was a continuation of what has already been a very good year. I have never felt better about our growth outlook.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Gene.","Gene Reilly","Thanks, Tom. I'm pleased to share the details about our merger agreement by IPT. Portfolio comprises 37.5 million square feet and 24 U.S. markets, 22 of which are the largest target markets. The assets are located in sub-markets we consider strategic and where we already have the benefit and scale, and a proven operating presence.","The portfolio is slightly younger than the balance of our existing U.S. assets and otherwise, very similar in terms of customer profile and physical characteristics. Over the normal course of business, we anticipated disposition program of approximately $800 million or 20% of the portfolio. The $4 billion price works out to 4.5% stabilized cap rate and a cap rate of just under 4.9% using current market rents. And then $106 a square foot, we believe we are purchasing the portfolio at a small discount to replace some costs. We are not purchasing the IPT operating platform and therefore, our incremental hiring activity will be limited to leasing and property management personnel necessary to manage the portfolio.","As IPT leases roll overtime, the Prologis teams will have the benefit of deeper market knowledge and relationships, greater flexibility, access to better information, bigger market share and ultimately, the ability to provide the best service to our customers and generate more revenue. The $0.05 to $0.06 of accretion that Tom mentioned does not include the potential benefits of procurement, ancillary revenue sources, or our other platform initiatives currently underway.","During the past eight years, we've integrated over $45 billion in very large portfolio transactions, including the AMB Prologis transaction, KTR and DCT. In each case, we outperformed our synergy forecast and we expect to do so here. So in short, we're highly confident in our ability to integrate these assets into our portfolio.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jeremy Metz with BMO. Your line is open. ","Jeremy Metz","Tom, you mentioned your allocation to IPT will be in the 25% to 35% range of your share. Even though in the past, you have a queue of investors waiting to get into the funds. You've talked about wanting to bring your stake there down to the 15% level give or take over time. So is there a thought to take even less of this deal initially and then sticking with that? Maybe you can talk about the Promote opportunity, and how much that $0.05 to $0.06 of accretion is fee driven? Thanks.","Tom Olinger","Thanks Jeremy. A couple things. So the way to think about our incremental investment. If you split the portfolio equally between the two funds, our ownership is 41%. And USLV, it does not use equity, USLF does. So we would think about 50% leverage targets to fund this deal from an USLF transaction. So think about $3 billion of equity that needed to come to the table our 40% of that is $1.2 billion.","When you think about the accretion, the accretion is, primarily the vast majority of the accretion is operating efficiencies. So the $0.05 to $0.06 is $0.035 of operating efficiencies between $0.015 to $0.02 of incremental leverage and about a penny about a half of penny or less of actually purchase get to us. And so the accretion is quite strong. Most of that is cash. The fee components would be baked in that $0.035 I talked about and that's roughly $0.02.","Jeremy Metz","Yes, at the beginning of that Tom mentioned, you won't require any equity. You meant that doesn't require any debt\u2026","Tom Olinger","That's right.","Operator","Your next question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi. Your line is open.","Michael Bilerman","It's Michael Bilermanhere with Manny. I guess if you step back from it, there's such a strong amount of NOI potential within this portfolio. Why not own the whole thing? And clearly, you have the ability to finance at lower rates, whether it's in Europe or in Asia, which would provide you even more accretion buying in U.S. portfolio and owning $4 billion of assets, and getting all of the 40 basis points of upside in the market rents would all flow to the bottom-line versus the trade-off of the incremental fees you're getting. Certainly is there to be able to do it too, at north of $80, you certainly could issue equity and\/or debt a little bit as well?","Hamid Moghadam","This is Hamid, Michael. We don't really view our strategic capital business as where we put our bad deals or the ones that are not accretive. It is an integral part of our business. And it is part of our strategy going forward. And that's the vehicle -- those are the vehicles that we've established exactly for doing this thing. So we're sticking to that business plan and it's not like the good ones go to the balance sheets and the bad ones go to the fund. We all do it the same way. Also, the return on equity in the funds is obviously greater, because of the leverage through the asset management fees and the like. So, that's the strategy. It's been the strategy and it will remain the strategy.","Tom Olinger","Michael, on your debt question about U.S. versus non-U.S. debt. We only would do that to the extent we're matching foreign assets with foreign debt. About 79% of our debt today is non-dollar. We have not assumed in our accretion that we would use any non-dollar financing peers, all U.S. dollar financing. Do we have the ability to do a little more non-dollar financing? Sure, but none of us that's baked into these numbers.","Operator","Your next question comes from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Derek Johnston","I guess, switching to Europe. Certainly, a strong contributor in 2Q and this is while EU and global consensus gross estimates were falling. Is there a lag that we should be concerned about filtering through to the back half of '19 leasing metrics? And is there any further update on the outlook for rent growth? Or the healthy absorption rates that we've seen in the EU post 2Q?","Gene Reilly","This is Gene. I'll start with the answer and I think Chris Caton will pile on as well. So, we just don't see headwinds in the operating environment. And you've got basically 3% vacancy rates across the continent. You get steady demand. You get demand in excess of very low economic growth but you have steady demand. And we just don't -- we don't see trade concerns, we don't see Brexit coming up in any customer dialog. So things look pretty good right now. And we also don't see excessive supply other than in some very isolated individual markets.","Chris Caton","Yes, Gene is spot on. The market is unfolding a lot like we anticipated at the beginning of the year. That's low 3% vacancy rates, that's rental rates on a net effective basis that are on pace to rise. More than 6% on the continent rents are call it, more than 3% in the first half of the year. So there's really good momentum and we feel confident looking forward.","Hamid Moghadam","But on the other side of that, the UK has slowed down a bit and the continent is stronger than we thought. So, I don't think Brexit not having any effect, its right. I think definitely the UK had slowed down some, particularly in the midlands.","Operator","Your next question comes from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Caitlin Burrows","Maybe back to the IPT acquisition. I was just wondering if you could comment on what the interest level was like, or the competition from other potential acquirers. And what do you think differentiated Prologis, either in your assumptions, financing, or something else allowing you to ultimately win this deal?","Hamid Moghadam","Well, ultimately, I can't tell you who bid on the portfolio. I can tell you it was a competitive process. And as I think everybody knows on this call, there is plenty of capital interested in this real estate. As for our competitive advantage, I don't think it's any of the items you've listed. But I do think certainty of close, particularly for a vehicle like this publicly held vehicle was critical. And so, I think their confidence and our ability to negotiate complete this transaction smoothly, was important.","Gene Reilly","Yes, also the proxy will have plenty of the details from what they looked at on the other side. So, we'll both find out.","Operator","Your next question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks, good morning. I just wanted to see if you could comment a little bit on the NOI guidance, Tom. You did about 5% in the first half of the year. The high end, you kept unchanged at 5%. So that assumes flattish growth in the back half at the low end assumes 4%. And I realize you're facing some tougher occupancy comps the back half of the year. But just can you help us think through the low and the high end, given where we sit here today and what drives you to both of those two points?","Tom Olinger","Yes, Steve, you nailed it. It's really occupancy impact. We are continuing to push rents. We are seeing occupancies dip a little bit. I think we certainly have room to push rents more. If you just looked at our retention, you look at our occupancy you look at our rent growth. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I think we're going to see and we will see rent change on a roll accelerate in the second half. We talked about rents growth increasing and why are we taking the top end up is because of occupancy.","We're going to push rents and we don't have a lot of role in the second half. But this is really setting up for just longer durable runway for same store growth where our mark-to-markets holding at over 15% even with rolling 25% in the quarter. And if you really look at same-store, think about -- as we said in the last couple of calls, 2019 is a transitional year for same-store in that we have lower occupancy. So that's been a headwind this year. But if you think about the real driver of your same-store rent change your roll, it's been accelerating.","Our trailing fourth quarter rent change on a roll is up over 300 basis points in the last four quarters. It is going to go higher, going forward. So the fundamental driver of same-store is intact and it is growing, and it will grow. But one thing on retention, we're seeing retention is very high on the larger spaces. And we're pushing rents across the board. I think we have an opportunity to push rents across all of our space sizes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Jamie Feldman","I know you had said that you expect your development starts to ramp up in the back half of the year. Can you just talk about what, both build-to-suit and spec pipeline looks like today? And as we think ahead to next year, do you think that -- and we're hearing across a lot of markets that there's an expectation that pipelines may actually shrink given less available land and even maybe less capital to put to work? I just want to get your thoughts on how you think things are shaping up over the next 12 months or so in terms of the supply and demand story and your ability to keep putting capital to work?","Mike Curless","Jamie, its Mike Curless. So I'll hit the build-to-suit and then I'll flip it to Gene on the spec. Certainly seen -- a lot of you've seen some public announcements from some of our larger customers with major plans for significant rollouts. So, I'd say there's definitely an up arrow on the requirements and the demands. It is more challenging to deliver build-to-suits these days, zoning and land availability and some of the more global markets. But we're certainly working through that.","Our build-to-suit percentage lows in the 27% range this quarter that's very lumpy, as you know Jamie, I think you got to look at it across four quarters. And I fully expect very robust quarter coming up as we speak right now, as Tom mentioned, with $250 million build-to-suit stars already underway. And I'd look towards our build-to-suit percentage to be in the range in the high 30s, largely driven by some significant national rollouts. Gene, on spec?","Gene Reilly","So Jamie we've, as you can see, taken out the midpoint $100 million. Some of that\u2019s captured by the increased build-to-suit activity Mike talked about. So, I'd say there's a very modest increase in spec. But I don't -- we don't -- when we see opportunities, as you know, we have a robust land bank. So we have the ability to start building, but we're not going to do it unless we see market opportunity, and we do. So, basically, the answer to your question is, we're going to have a modest increase based on our prior guidance throughout the rest of this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vikram Malhotra","So just wanted to clarify, I think you said mark-to-market across the four portfolios holding at 15%. Can you break that between the U.S. and Europe? And also, just clarify what the mark-to-market is in IPT?","Tom Olinger","I'll take the first piece. So in our portfolio today, Prologis U.S., is around 17% and Europe is around 11%. So our blended is about 15.5%.","Gene Reilly","IPT is pretty much in line with the rest of our U.S. assets.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Craig Mailman","A quick questions for you, just looking -- I know you guys didn't buy the whole IPT portfolio relative to the numbers that they had in their financials. But it looked like '17 and '18, they were trending below 2% same store growth. And I'm just curious, I know you guys have some operational efficiencies baked in. But as you guys look at your legacy PLD portfolio growth profile versus what you're ultimately going to bring into the portfolio. Will this ultimately be accretive to your growth portfolio or inline or dilutive from your perspective?","Hamid Moghadam","I think slightly accretive. And I mean to be frank we have not studied their historical operating performance. What we have study is the location and quality of the assets, which we like. We bought them onto our platform, I'd say, it's a marginal increase.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is open. ","Ki Bin Kim","I guess a couple of questions on IPT portfolio. First, can you just talk a little bit about what prompted this deal? What was the thinking behind it, I don't think its scaled. Do you have enough of it? And even the financial accretion was quite a success it seems like that by and itself wouldn't prompt the deal of this size. So, can maybe talk about the other points that we haven't covered?","Hamid Moghadam","I think that level and the availability of high quality portfolios is dwindling. And these portfolios are going into capital sources that are permanent. And I think there's a limited supply of this stuff and they're really good market. So whenever there is an opportunity to pick up some of those assets and scale, you'll see us competing for those opportunities. And because of the clustering effect around our own portfolio, which is also focused on the same markets, we can really squeeze a lot more juice out of those oranges.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Your line is open. Nick Yulico, you're unmute, so your line is open.","Nick Yulico","For IPT, I think you said 20% of the portfolio is a sale candidate non-strategic asset. Can you just talk about why they're non-strategic and how you underwrote those assets from a -- how we should think about a cap rate on sale those assets?","Hamid Moghadam","Could you repeat the first part of the question?","Nick Yulico","So, I think you said that\u2026","Hamid Moghadam","For sale portfolio, which is 20%, a small portion of it is two markets, Memphis and Salt Lake City, which we're not present in. So that's about 5% of it. And the balance of it is the pruning of the markets where we have a presence, but we don't really see a fit between that portion and our assets, that portion of the portfolio and our existing assets. So, it's a combination of market exits in those two cases and pruning in the case of the rest.","Gene Reilly","And I just want to pile on that a bit. These disposition assets are good assets. They're not assets that are consistent with our strategy. But I think these assets will be relatively easy to dispose of as compared to some of our prior activities.","Hamid Moghadam","Yes, one other data point for you. This is not the first time we've gone through cleanup of assets. We've sold about $14 billion of assets in the last five or six years. And you might be interested that on average we've exceeded our expectations by about 6% on the sales prices. So we're pretty comfortable that we can exit these assets at the premium.","Operator","Your next question is from Dave Rodgers with Baird. Your line is open.","Dave Rodgers","Yes, for Tom or Hamid, just maybe talking about the construction pipeline just nationally, or maybe even internationally. You said you took Osaka off the watch list for as a market. Have you added any and where do you see the most competition today? I think Tom you referenced the supply in your comments?","Gene Reilly","It's Gene, I'll start and I think Chris will finish the answer. But if we look at the globe as compared to last quarter, there really aren't very many differences. As you heard us say over the past four or five years, frankly, certain markets in South Dallas and certain markets in Atlanta, i.e. in Chicago, Central Pennsylvania, once in a while, Inland Empire East and the U.S. come-on and come-off the list. And what's interesting is that in prior cycles markets never came off the list, they just kept over-building them until you're in a crisis.","So that picture really hasn't changed internationally. The one note that we have is Osaka. Osaka's vacancy was very elevated. It's now, I think 9% or 10%. So it may come back on the list. But at this point, we're pretty comfortable. A lot of reduction in that vacancy rate recently. Chris, I don't know if you have\u2026","Chris Caton","Yes, Gene, You're spot on, I'd add, in fact there have been no additions this year. And that you have to look back to last year for the additions to this list. And as we mentioned in Midland is a market and then also Houston were addition late last year, so no additions this year and one subtraction. ","Operator","Your next question is from Jon Petersen with Jefferies. Your line is open.","JonPetersen","Probably a question for Gene or maybe Chris Caton. I think with the DCT transaction, you talked about how -- when you get a certain concentration in sub-markets you're able to push rent a bit harder, I forget exactly how you framed that. But I'm curious with the IPT transaction if you call out any sub-markets that you now have a dominant market position that you didn't have before? And then second one probably for Tom. Just to clarify, this transaction won't require any new common equity for Prologis, right?","Chris Caton","I'll take the second one, absolutely not, no equity.","Gene Reilly","So, the way we look at asset clusters and that's one way we describe this is if we're adding assets to the market that, let's say, we have 20 buildings, 25 buildings and call that 3 million to 4 million square feet. There is a clustering effect that we have tracked and we have tested. And there is no question you get incremental NOI. I'm not going to go into any specific details on that. But you have a situation when you're adding to a cluster, or you're adding enough to a smaller concentration that we already own. And you then created a cluster.","And in this case we have one market that, you for sure, have created a cluster that will be Portland. There's a pretty good concentration here in Portland, PA and Baltimore, also fall in that category. And otherwise, we're just adding on to very, very big, big concentrations. And Chris, I don't know if you want to add anything to that.","Chris Caton","I think that was perfect. The only thing I would add is that the benefit doesn't just accrue to the newly acquired portfolios, also, accrues to the existing portfolio, which is by far the more important of the two pieces.","Operator","Your next question is from John Guinee with Stifel. Your line is open.","John Guinee","Hamid, first congratulations. As I recall, you acquired DCT at about $118 a foot and a 4.2 in place cap rate. Talk a little bit about the quality difference between IPT and DCT, which obviously has the same initial investment and strategy in the initial roots?","Hamid Moghadam","Yes, so we bought DCT at 4.6 cap rate and it was stock for stock deal. So, it was more of a relative valuation exercise than an absolute valuation exercise. So, I don't think you can conclude much about market cap rates based on looking at that. But this one in terms of quality, I would say, if you look at the whole portion, DCT was 95% hold, this is 80% hold and 20% sell. So in that sense, I would mark the DCT portfolio as better, because it has less to dispose. But if you look at the 80% and the 95%, I would say they were comparable.","Operator","Your next question is from Eric Frankel with Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.","Eric Frankel","Just to go back to the price of the IPT deal, that's a 4.5% cap rate, you quoted that based on your definition of stabilization. So maybe the cap rate would be a little bit higher based on current input occupancy. And then second, do you guys believe that you paid some maybe aggregation premium rather than if you brought this entire portfolio on a one-off basis? And then finally, based on where interest rates have gone the last few months. Do you think cap rates, in general, have declined for good quality industrial assets? Thank you.","Tom Olinger","So couple of comments on the cap rates. I mean, cap rates are really difficult things to talk about, because all kinds of people use different approaches to them. Just to be clear, the way we call it something a cap rate is that it's the purchase price plus all the closing costs, plus the CapEx required to get it to stabilize occupancy, if necessary. And includes a vacancy allowance, which is critical because the portfolio is over leased 95% we adjust it back down to 95%. So our cap rates oftentimes we shake our heads to the reported cap rates that we see in the marketplace, because that's certainly not the cap rates that we underwrote. And you can imagine that we look at pretty much every deal.","So that's one commentary on methodology. With respect to the direction of cap rates, I will tell you that this was since DCT the third significant portfolios that we looked at and competed for and obviously, in the other two cases, we were not successful. Our pricing did not change as to the whole portion of those portfolios at all pretty consistent. I'm not smart enough to tell you whether there was a portfolio or not, but we did not attribute one to the portfolio on this one or any of the other ones. But on the other ones, we were unsuccessful and on this one, we'll be successful, so who knows.","Hamid Moghadam","Erick, just one more thing. On the cost side of that equation, we also mark any debt to market. And I think, often people leave that out of the equation and you have to, you have to factor it.","Tom Olinger","And in this one, there wasn't any of that. But on the others, there're actually been significant margins.","Operator","Your next question is from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Michael Carroll","Can you provide a quick macro update? I know you included some conservatism in your prior guidance ranges. Did you remove that conservatism in the updated range? And how's the logistic real estate market remain largely inflated from the headline trade fears that we continue to hear about?","Tom Olinger","So I'll start. No more conservatism in our guidance. And I would just tell you from what we see from our customer perspective, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we're seeing very consistent sequential quarter activity as it relates to showings, gestation, conversion rates, all that's holding or slightly better. So from what we see in our pipeline, it continues to be quite good.","Mike Curless","This is Mike. From a customer perspective, no meaningful impact other than perhaps a little blip with some increased inventories and spot examples, but nothing significant.","Hamid Moghadam","Yes, I think you maybe referring to the commentary on the fourth quarter call, where we were just coming off of a significant stock market sell-off and things were a little wobbly, generally with the overall economy in January. And we talked about having in the most recent two weeks, reduced our internal planning, that's all done. We're back on track. So, if you're referring to that, you can ignore all that.","Operator","Your next question is from Michael Mueller with JP Morgan. Your line is open. ","Michael Mueller","What's the timeframe to dispose of the remaining IPT sale assets? Will it all be done in 2020?","Gene Reilly","Michael, this is Gene. We tend not to put our deadlines on that. In the current environment, I was telling, I think we need to do it fairly quickly in that timeframe. But we do it on the normal course of business. It has to be consistent with everything else we're doing. And then we have to see where the demand patterns on it. Sometimes you can aggregate a portfolio and move quickly, other cases maximizing value means one-off. So -- but that timeframe within 2020 is probably reasonable.","Operator","And our last question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi. Your line is open.","Michael Bilerman","It's Michael Bilerman. I had a few more. I'm hope you can address one at a time. But just in terms of\u2026","Hamid Moghadam","Michael, you can go continuously, because you are the last one. So we can go on with\u2026","Michael Bilerman","How much time do you have?","Hamid Moghadam","Don't get carried away\u2026","Michael Bilerman","So, just in terms of upside potential, squeezing more juice out of these oranges in this portfolio. You talked about, I think, you mentioned the 4.5% stabilized and 4.9% cap rate assuming current market rents. But then when another analyst asked about the mark-to-market, you mentioned the Prologis portfolio was 17% but these assets were similar. But the difference in cap rate 4.5% to 4.9% is only about 8% upside on market rents. So, I didn't know what the difference was or what maybe driving down the yield, the numbers didn't match up.","Mike Curless","Its cash, cash versus effective cap base\u2026","Michael Bilerman","So, the 4.5% to 4.9% is a cash. So your mark-to-market on a cash basis in the Prologis portfolio would be 8%, 9% also. That 17% is a GAAP number?","Mike Curless","It's about 10%. So the 4.5% and 4.9% are not precise numbers either, obviously. So we were going to take out four decimals, Hamid didn\u2019t like that, so\u2026","Hamid Moghadam","Michael, the other thing is that there's a difference between the hold portfolio and the sell portfolio. So, the hold portfolio has a bigger mark-to-market, because those are stronger markets by and large and they've had more rent appreciations. But the primary difference is the cash versus GAAP number, which is about 5 points.","Michael Bilerman","And then just to go through actually on the whole portfolio. Is the plan to warehouse that $800 million of assets on Prologis' balance sheet? Or is the entirety of the $4 billion going into one or the two funds and those assets will be sold out of the funds? I'm just trying to understand the dynamics going on?","Hamid Moghadam","It's the latter, Michael. It's the latter. ","Mike Curless","The assets will be going to the funds. Any sale assets will be sold by the funds.","Michael Bilerman","By the funds, and that will just reduce your effective ownership or your contribution in those funds?","Hamid Moghadam","Not really, Michael, because we have a revolving line of credit that we pull up and down. So we're probably not going to pull capital out of the funds. We'll just leave it in there for future growth.","Michael Bilerman","And then just I wanted to come back to my original question about doing this wholly owned versus in the funds. And I recognize DCT was a stock-for-stock transaction. But that didn't alleviate you from having the ability to sell DCT assets to the funds, if you chose to. So I'm just really trying to understand these two larger scale M&A transactions. One yes, it was stock for stock. This one is a cash deal, the non-traded public REIT that you're doing for all cash. I guess, why was DCT all balance sheet and why was IPT a fund asset?","Hamid Moghadam","Good question. First of all, the choice of currency is not always ours. Sometimes the settler demands different kinds of currencies. But yes, that deals we do on balance sheet. And to them buy a deal and then sell it to the fund, there're just too much frictional cost associated with that. And oftentimes, the structuring of the transaction prevents that for some period of time. So, it gets complicated to do that.","In terms of cash transactions, or cash portion of certain transactions, we're committed to do those deals, as I mentioned to in the funds. I mean, that's our business model and we'll continue to do that. These are, by the way, now very, very significant funds. I mean, you'll look at where a USLF will be at the end of this deal, it's going to be north of $12 billion. You look at where our European fund PELF is. It's about an $11 billion vehicle.","I mean these, on a standalone basis, could be some of the largest REITs out there. So, they have ongoing needs. They're very successful vehicles. And we like the fact that we have the ability to use cash and currency to address a range of opportunities.","Michael Bilerman","Just last one just in terms of Asia and the macro environment. At least coming out of Citi's earnings yesterday, there was a slowdown in loan activity out of our Asia client base, in particular everything that's happening with China and the U.S., the Chinese corporates borrowing less money given the uncertainty going on between the two countries. Is there anything that you're finding at least locally in Asia? And I know what's happening in the U.S. But anything in Asia that you've seen would indicate any slow down on the industrial side?","Hamid Moghadam","Okay, this is going to be your last question, because somebody jumped in. But look, China is definitely slower but the overall -- slower than it has been for some time, and we see that on the ground. But the dynamics of the industrial real estate market in China are much more driven by availability of land from the one seller that has land, the government. And they've been always reluctant to supply the market with what it needs in terms of industrial land. And the reason for that is that industrial users don't generate taxes.","And there is no property tax system in China. So they get their tax revenue based on registered capital. And people don't usually register their capital where their warehouses are. So there's always a shortage of land in the key markets in China. So even with a more modest economic growth, there's just not enough supply of product in a lot of these markets. So, the strength of the industrial market is driven by domestic consumption and a shortage of industrial land.","Consumption for the first time slowed from the mid-teens to the high-single-digit. So, that's really important to keep in mind. And by the way, my commentary about the shortage of land applies to the Tier 1-1.5 type markets in which we operate. Some of the outlying areas you can get more land, but that's not relevant to our business. And remember, the tailwind of e-commerce in all of these different places where the consumption takes more space than normal consumption would have a decade ago.","Operator","The last question comes from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vikram Malhotra","Thanks for leaving the follow up. Sorry for the background noise. Just one quick question, sorry if I missed this. Did you change the disclosure of the same store NOI calculation? I believe you used to provide same store revenue and expense separately. Could you give us those two components?","Tom Olinger","Yes, we'll be giving those components. If you look at the back of our sub, you can see the detail in order for you to calculate same store own and manage. The SEC did their annual review of our K, we had one comment and that one comment was that they asked us to modify our owned advantage NOI disclosure. That actually approved our disclosure quite a few years back. But in light of their view around pro rata financial information, they asked us to modify the disclosure, because they took a view that this was pro rata and they just asked us to modify it. So, we can't show you the percentage. But if you look at our footnote and back this up, you can calculate the percentage.","Hamid Moghadam","Great. Thank you, everybody. Look forward to seeing you next quarter if not sooner. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Prologis Second Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Tracy Ward, you may begin your conference.","Tracy A. Ward","Thank you, Tiffany, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2013 conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. This morning, we'll hear from Hamid Moghadam, Chairman and CEO, who will comment on the company's strategy and the market environment; and then from Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover results and guidance. Additionally, we are joined today by members of our executive team, including Gary Anderson, Mike Curless, Nancy Hemmenway, Guy Jaquier, Edward Nekritz, Gene Reilly and Diana Scott.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to quickly state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates, as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance, and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings.","I'd also like to state that our first quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO, EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures, and in accordance with Reg G, we have provided reconciliation to those measures.","[Operator Instructions] Hamid, will you please begin?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. We are pleased to be hosting today's call from our operational headquarters in Denver. As you know, since the completion of the merger, we've been laser focused on our 10-quarter plan, which has guided our priorities as a new company. During this time, you watched us deliver on our 5 key strategic objectives. We've completed this plan 2 quarters ahead of our own ambitious schedule. Let me take a moment to review a few of the highlights.","Our most important objective was to align our portfolio with our investment strategy. We completed $10.2 billion of dispositions and contributions with an average cap rate of 6.9%. On the development front, we started more than $2.5 billion of new developments with an average yield of 7.8%. 45% of this volume was in build-to-suits. In addition, we acquired 925 million of new properties in our target markets at an average cap rate of 7.3%. The net result of this activity was an increased allocation to global markets from 79% at the merger to 85% today.","Our second objective was to improve the utilization of our assets. Occupancy post merger is up 300 basis points to 93.7%. During this period, we monetized $865 million of our land bank, mostly through development starts at an 18% value creation margin, as well as some third-party sales.","Streamlining our private capital business and positioning it for growth represented the third pillar of our plan. At the time of the merger, we had $25.7 billion of gross assets across 22 private capital entities. Our plan was to rationalize our funds into a smaller number of differentiated and profitable vehicles.","Today, we have $22.8 billion of gross assets under management across 15 ventures, and we expect our fund count to go down by a few more by the end of the year. Including the assets we brought on balance sheet, we have retained 96% of our original assets as part of our platform. We expect to grow our third-party assets under management from this point forward.","As part of our plan, we've been repositioning our business to focus on larger, long-duration ventures, open-end funds, and most recently, geographically focused public entities. These long-duration ventures now account for 84% of our investment management revenue versus 80 -- 68% at the merger.","We are also accessing alternative sources of public equity such as our newly formed J-REIT. Our strategy enables us to tap capital in both public and private formats for targeted geographies across our global platforms. In this regard, the team has raised $5.5 billion of new third-party strategic equities since the merger. This is on top of the $2.7 billion of equity we have raised at the headstock level during this period.","The strengthening of our financial position has been a core element of our plan and our fourth objective. Since the merger, we reduced our look-through leverage including preferreds from 50% to 36%, lowered debt-to-EBITDA from 10.4 to 7.4x, improved our share of equity in U.S. dollars from 45% to 75% and increased our line of credit capacity by $350 million while reducing our borrowing spreads by 40 basis points. We believe we're in the final stages of building one of the strongest balance sheets in the REIT industry and are optimistic that this strength will be reflected in our credit ratings going forward.","Our fifth objective was to build a highly effective and efficient global organization. As a combined company, we achieved over $115 million in merger synergies, well above our initial target of $80 million. In addition, we successfully implemented a major enterprise system that will provide us an information infrastructure that is unparalleled in our industry. We're also focused on building a culture of accountability and empowerment. We have equipped our leaders with a series of management tools that will help them manage their divisional profitability, overhead efficiency and business risk.","In summary, I'm incredibly proud of what the Prologis team has accomplished since the closing of the merger. These efforts have simplified our company and built a strong foundation for sustainable growth in the coming years. It's now time to focus on the future. We believe the scale and quality of our operating platform, the skill set of our team and the strength of our balance sheet provide us with unique competitive advantages going forward.","We've established a clear roadmap for growth in the coming years with a focus on 3 key priorities: first, to capitalize on rental recovery; second, to realize the potential of our land bank by putting it to work; and third, to use our scale and costumer relationships to grow earnings.","I'll take a minute to expand on each of these priorities. First, the rent recovery cycle is firmly underway and is accelerating in most markets at the pace ahead of the rental growth forecasts we laid out at our investor forum last September. This is best evidenced by the second quarter's 4% increase in rents on rollover.","Over the past 3 quarters, the U.S. industrial market has absorbed 164 million square feet of space. This is more than triple development completions during the same period, which were a mere 46 million square feet. This excess demand of 118 million square feet is the highest in the 33 years of data from CBRE. As we look forward, we're increasing our 2013 net absorption forecast for the U.S. to 180 million square feet, up from 150 million square feet. We expect to see a modest volume of completions at 65 million square feet.","Moving to Europe. Although still in recession, we believe Europe has reached an inflection point, in many ways, similar to what took place in the U.S. in mid-2010. We believe rents are off the bottom and cap rates are heading lower. In retrospect, it seems that our venture with Norges Bank was a watershed event in terms of restoring investor confidence in the European industrial market.","In Japan, the political changes are driving increased consumer confidence. Strong market conditions and healthy spreads are attracting capital from around the globe.","Turning to China. Despite the downward revisions to GDP, demand for Class A logistics space remains strong and much better than the headlines would suggest. Market rents continue to rise, and concessions have decreased across the country. Our portfolio in China is more than 96% leased, and rents have increased by more than 13% in the past year.","Globally, space utilization in our facilities is at the highest level we've seen since we've been tracking this metric. This means there is little or no shadow space in the system. Additional economic growth would translate directly into incremental demand for the logistic facilities. As this overutilization reverts to the norm, we could see an extended period of excess demand driving up rents even further.","Our second growth opportunity is to realize value from our land bank and our costumer relationships. The key to a successful development program is having strategic land control, and in this regard, we're in an excellent position. Our land bank is increasingly undervalued and will be an asset going forward. We have the potential to build an additional 200 million square feet or about $10 billion in new development at high incremental returns on land that is already paid for. We'll be prudent with our development starts, which we expect to average around $2.5 billion annually. The value creation potential on this level of starts will be approximately $300 million a year.","Our third growth opportunity is to use our scale to grow earnings. We have the ability to expand our global platform by at least $10 billion without adding much in the way of incremental overhead. We measure and disclose our overhead efficiency in terms of the ratio G&A to assets under management, which currently stands at 54 basis points. We believe we can add incremental AUM from here at a marginal overhead rate of 10 basis points or less, which will further drive efficiencies and earnings growth. We're beginning to see our acquisition pipeline grow both through proprietary opportunities such as buying up in our funds and as more third-party transactions come to market. This was the primary rationale for our equity offering in April.","Despite recent increases, interest rates are far from a level that would affect pricing in the U.S. and Europe. Cap rate spreads over 10-year treasuries remain above historical averages in our markets. In short, we're confident that these 3 strategies will enable us to generate above-average earnings growth in the coming years.","With that overview, I'll turn things over to Tom.","Thomas S. Olinger","Thanks, Hamid. This morning, I'll cover 3 areas: first, our results for the quarter; second, deployment, development value creation and capital markets activity; and third, updated guidance for 2013.","Starting with our results for the second quarter. Core FFO was $0.41 a share, $0.04 above our expectations. About $0.025 of the outperformance was from investment management income, primarily driven by a promote related to winding up Alliance Fund II. We had expected this will occur in the second half of 2013. Our share of development value creation was $79 million for the quarter, including $64 million that was monetized through sales and contributions at a 34% margin.","Turning to our operating portfolio. We had another strong quarter of leasing volume at 36.3 million square feet. Occupancy was 93.7% at quarter end, flat to the first quarter. Our teams in the ground are focused on driving rent growth versus occupancy at this point in the cycle. To that end, the GAAP rent change on rollover increased 4% for the quarter and was evident across all space sizes.","On our first quarter call, we were asked about cash rent change. This is not a measure we use internally to drive leasing decisions or evaluate our operating performance. We make our leasing decisions based on net effective rent change as this metric best reflects the underlying lease economics. To provide you with some perspective, cash rent change on rollover was down 3.4% for the quarter. Consistent with our GAAP figure, this metric includes rent change on all spaces signed during the quarter for both new and renewal leases and regardless of how long the spaces were vacant.","For the quarter, GAAP same-store NOI was up 70 basis points, and on an adjusted cash basis, was down 40 basis points. The decrease in cash same-store NOI this quarter is a result of increased free rent associated with longer lease terms and a greater volume of leasing in large spaces.","Moving to investment management. We had a very active quarter, completing an $800 million secondary offering for our J-REIT and rationalizing 2 ventures. The rationalization included Fund II that I mentioned earlier and the closeout of Japan Fund I. Retaining the high-quality assets of these 2 funds was a great outcome.","I want to point out that the $13 million promote related to Fund II was not included in investment management revenue but instead was reflected as a component of noncontrolling interest in the income statement. This accounting treatment is required since Fund II was a consolidated venture.","Now switching to our deployment activity. We took advantage of some great investing opportunities during the quarter, deploying $922 million, which included development starts, acquisitions and investment in our funds. With respect to our development business, it is strategically important to us that it provides our customers with modern, state-of-the-art logistics facilities and it generates real economic value.","We do not include development creation in our core FFO because not all value creation flows through our income statement to the extent we keep development on balance sheet. If we were under International Accounting Standards, all of the value creation would flow through earnings. Going forward, we'll provide you with development value creation on stabilization and upon monetization so you can value this business appropriately.","Our share of development value creation during the first half of the year was $393 million. This includes $311 million or $0.64 a share that was monetized through sales and contributions.","Turning to our capital markets activity. We had a very busy quarter, completing $4.3 billion of capital markets transactions. This included debt financing, refinancing, pay-downs and the redemption of preferred stock, as well as our $1.5 billion follow-on offering. As of the end of June, we invested about $600 million of the follow-on offering, in line with our forecast. And by year end, we expect to invest the majority of these proceeds with the remainder effectively left for delevering.","As of June 30, our look-through leverage was 35.8%. Net debt to EBITDA was 7.4x, and net debt to EBITDA adjusted for development was 6x.","During the quarter, we did incur $32.6 million of debt extinguishment costs primarily related to the prepayment of $350 million senior notes. These notes were due to mature in 2014 and had a coupon rate of 7.6%.","A very important part of our capital structure strategy is to minimize our foreign net equity exposure. During the quarter, we hatched EUR 800 million at an average economic exchange rate of 1.36 for a term of 4.5 years and JPY 250 million at an average economic exchange rate of 88.9 for a term of 5 years. Our U.S. dollar net equity was 75% at June 30, an increase of 600 basis points from the first quarter. We're forecasting our U.S. dollar net equity position to be approximately 80% by year end. Subsequent to quarter end, we recast our global line of credit and established an ATM program for $715 million, both of which provide us with further flexibility to fund our growth.","Let me now turn to our guidance for the remainder of 2013. For operations, we're maintaining our GAAP same-store NOI range of 1.5% to 2.5% and year-end occupancy to range between 94% and 95%. For FX, we're assuming the euro at 1.3 and the yen at 100 for the second half of the year.","On the expense side, we're forecasting net G&A to range between $225 million to $233 million. For capital deployment, we are seeing an increase in opportunities to invest and are now forecasting a range of $3.5 billion to $4.1 billion. This is an increase of $1.7 billion from our previous guidance and includes $1.8 billion to $2 billion of development starts, up $250 million from our prior guidance with our share at approximately 80%. We expect to stabilize about $1.4 billion of developments in 2013 at an estimated margin of approximately 25%, generating $350 million of value creation with $310 million our share.","Our deployment guidance also includes $800 million to $1 billion of building acquisitions, an increase of $400 million from prior guidance, with our share at about 40%, and fund investments of $900 million to $1.1 billion. We have a great opportunity to invest in our funds. The quality and location of our fund assets, along with our expectations for a significant rent recovery, make these investments very accretive.","Turning to contributions and dispositions. We're maintaining the top end of our guidance in the range to $8.5 billion to $10 billion for the year with our share proceeds at approximately 60%. We are narrowing our 2013 core FFO range to $1.63 to $1.67 per share. We expect our quarterly run rate for the second half to be at or above our Q2 run rate of $0.41 a share, driven by higher NOI from development stabilizations, deployment of the remaining equity offering proceeds, same-store NOI growth and lower interest expense.","Before I close, I want to mention 4 new disclosures in our supplemental this quarter. First, we added enhanced disclosure around development value creation. Second, we added average term for our quarterly leasing activity. Third, we added turnover cost as a percentage of leased value. And fourth, added property improvements per square foot on a trailing 12-month basis.","To sum up, we had a great quarter. Clearly, we had a number of moving parts related to the execution of our strategic priorities. However, when you take a step back and you compare our results with last year, our core FFO is essentially flat while leverage has been reduced by 10% and our U.S. net equity exposure has improved by 1,600 basis points. As we had forecasted, we were able to derisk our financial position with minimal impact on earnings.","With that, I'll turn it back to Hamid.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Thanks, Tom. There are 3 key takeaways that I'd like to leave you with. First, we expect improving economic conditions and the constrained supply picture to lead to a significant increase in demand and pricing power for our products around the globe. Second, we expect to see substantial earnings growth from 3 areas: the recovery in rents, putting our land bank to work and capitalizing on our scale and by continuing to expand in existing markets. Third, our accomplishments over the last 8 quarters are a direct result of the efforts of the dedicated and engaged team. This team has worked hard to get the company to its current position of strength, and we're all excited to take advantage of the opportunities that this platform will offer us in the coming years.","With that, we will open it up for your questions. Tiffany?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of George Auerbach with ISI Group.","George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Tom or Hamid, can you maybe talk about the opportunity set in a bit more granularity in terms of your ability to buy into existing funds or the opportunities you see in Europe today?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Sure. In terms of our funds, I think you saw 2 really good examples in the past quarter. One was an acquisition that's been actually reported. We haven't announced that, but it's been widely reported, which is a portion of our NA3 portfolio that we had, and we're buying a portion of those assets. And secondly, we were able to buy up in our Allianz Fund II portfolio from 28% to 100% of the fund. And actually, the contribution of Japan Fund I to the J-REIT and -- which was funded by the secondary offering, is actually a way of actually acquiring assets without going through the balance sheet directly into that vehicle. So this is really good for our investors, too, because they get certainty of execution. They know that we're there to be for them, and it also provides us a cost-efficient way of accessing new assets. In Europe specifically, we think the appraisal community is lagging the reality of the marketplace. And we've been pretty vocal about this. So this is not a big secret. And yields and some funds are in the mid-7% range, which we think are very attractive returns, particularly once you think about what's going to happen to the cost of financing in Europe, exactly the same thing that happens to the cost and availability of financing here in the U.S. So that's one way of increasing our exposure. And now we have a lot more capacity given the J-REIT that we did. We can take advantage of that. We're not constrained by our allocation to Europe. And then we're seeing some opportunities, specifically in Southern Europe, where you can buy assets at significant discounts through replacement costs, even ignoring the price of land. You can buy assets, in some instances, in the 9s with very significant spreads over cost of treasury. So I think at a prudent level, we'll be net investors over there, and we'll use our existing vehicle to take advantage of those emerging opportunities.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Tom, I have a question for you, and it's sort of a kind of big picture. If we look at the cap rates on the disposed assets in the second quarter, they seem to have compressed a little bit, and the same with the stabilized development yields on a sequential basis as well. And that seems to be happening around the same time that we're seeing some expansion in spreads and the cost of capital. Do you expect those trends in the yields to reverse in lockstep or in sort of correlation with the capital costs? Or do you expect more compression in those yields going into the second half of the year?","Hamid R. Moghadam","David, let me take that. I think that yield, in any given quarter, is more driven by mix than any big trend. So if you have a couple of big Japan deals or something in there, that could really move around the numbers in a big way. So I wouldn't read too much in the yields on a quarter-to-quarter basis. In terms of what our view of cap rates are around the globe, I think cap rates are going to decline in Europe or are declining in Europe. I think they are stable at the very low levels in the U.S. for really good assets and even good assets in secondary markets. I would say, sort of C assets in softer markets could see, haven't yet, could see a 25 or 50-basis-point increase in cap rates because those are usually acquired by highly leveraged buyers where they're more affected by interest rates. We, by and large, don't have any kind of that product. And the very little that we do, we never price it to the top tick of the market anyway. So I think we can absorb that kind of 25, 50-basis-point cap rate increase without missing our pricing expectations. But generally, I think the vast majority of the properties that we traffic in, I think the cap rate trend is down. And not to go too far on the limb, but cap rates are very comparable to where they were in, call it, late '07, early '08. But treasury, even with their increase, are good 200 basis points lower. So the spreads are actually pretty good.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I'm not sure who this question is for, but can you -- if you look at your 2 billion of land, I think that's the number, that 1.8 billion of land, how much of that would you expect to be able to deploy because demand is there in the next 3 years? And how much of it do you think is in inventory for longer than 3 years? And how much of it can be sold to a third party?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Thanks, John. I'll hand it over to Mike Curless.","Michael S. Curless","John, it's Mike. I would say that in the next 3 years, we would expect to deploy a good 75% of the entire land bank, if not more. And in terms of what we would attempt to sell, I think we mentioned before, about 15% of our entire land bank right now, we view as nonstrategic, and we have plans to sell those. Last year, we sold 30 parcels that fit that category. We've already sold 15 yet this year and expect to do more the balance of this year.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","That would imply being able to develop, say, 15 million square feet in the Central Valley, 12 million square feet in Southern California. Is that really able to...","Eugene F. Reilly","John, it's Gene. Let me give you some color on this. You are correct. In the Central Valley, we have a very, very big piece of land that might be a -- could be a 15-year build-out. But that is very rare. I mean, if you look at most of our land parcels, our overall build-out timeframe for them is going to be anywhere from immediate to 3 years. So -- and by the way, we love that piece of land, and I wouldn't be surprised if we absorb it in less than 10 years. But I think that's somewhat of an outlier. And I think Mike said we'll absorb 75% or so of the land bank. 15% of it is for sale. So there's sort of 10% of cushion there.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Yes. The only other thing that I would add, John, is that specifically with respect to our Central Valley land, that's the price of land for a 300,000 square foot building in Tokyo. We bought that land really, really well. And really, to make -- the real investment in that land is the infrastructure that will be phased in over time as we take it down. So think of it as an option because really, the price was just the upfront ticket price to get into the game. And we feel really good about that position.","Michael S. Curless","And the percentages I referenced, were in terms of dollars, not acres.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc.","Craig Mailman - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just curious, I know, Hamid, you've kind of given your views here on cap rates in a lot of the markets. But just curious, have you guys changed at all the way you're underwriting acquisitions or developments to account for kind of the potential for rates to rise here? Or are there -- been no changes at all?","Hamid R. Moghadam","I think the best evidence of that is the margins that we report to you on starts every quarter and what we realize. And at least for the last 2 years, the realized margins have been far in excess of the way we underwrite. So we've been trailing, if you will, the movement in cap rates, and there's always -- I wouldn't say always, I mean, I'm sure in '08, we were over our skis on a couple of underwritings. But at this point in the cycle, we've been pleasantly surprised by the cap rates on our development stabilizations. So I think there's room in our numbers going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","A question regarding your strategy on your capital stack. With your goal, with what you have been trying to develop $2.5 billion of new development and when acquisition is combined and with leverage not being the same kind of concern it was maybe 2 or 3 years ago, does 30% -- what would make you change your view on a 30% look-through leverage ratio, which seems pretty low? I mean, on a look-through basis, you'll be lower than Simon [ph], which is considered a blue-chip status. What would have to happen for you to change that view on overall leverage?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Dave [ph] is a pretty good friend, but I think we're lower leverage today, not at 30%, significantly. And I think it will be time before maybe we're recognized as having the same kind of balance sheet. But turning to the substance of your question, look, 35%, 36% that we're in today includes preferreds. So if you look at the normal capital structure that has 5% preferreds on it, we are already at a 30% leverage. Kind of the mix is a little different. But we're basically that way. So we feel good about our leverage. We work hard to get it here. We have a business model that has more development in it as you pointed out. So I think we need to be more prudent in terms of leverage on the balance sheet. Look -- and we want to leave some capacity for doing strategic stuff that come along from time to time. So you could see us fluctuate from 30 to high 30s, back down to 30s. But we want to manage it around that level. And I want to point out, the $2.5 billion development is not a goal. We do not have goals for development. Having goals for development gets you into trouble. That's our estimated volume of business that will be there to do profitably. If it's less than that, it's less than that. If it's more than that, so be it. But I think across the cycle, that's a reasonable number. But I want to emphasize, it's not a goal.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Hamid, I was hoping you can talk a little bit more about your outlook for rent growth. I think you had said that rent growth is happening faster than you expected. How should we think about prospects for continued rent growth versus new supply coming online given you guys are growing your pipeline and it looks like you've got a higher percentage of spec than in the past? And kind of what are the other competitors doing that might put a damper on rent growth?","Hamid R. Moghadam","I think that is an invitation for you to come to our investor forum in September because we're going to devote a substantial amount of time taking you through our views on rent growth. And in addition to what we provided last year, we're going to talk about the profile of that rent growth as we see it as markets near stabilization. But we're pretty optimistic about the overall magnitude of the rent growth. Probably very consistent with our views last year. We just think the profile of getting there is a little quicker. I mean, we never, in our wildest dream, dreams imagined the 118 million square feet of absorption over construction deliveries. I mean, those are big numbers, and we think that's going to continue this year. So I think we're going to get there faster. And interestingly, some of our lagging markets, like in the Ohios, have been actually -- have pretty solid rent growth, albeit from very low and depressed levels. But it's rent growth, and that's happening a lot actually than we thought. Some of the other markets, like L.A., that were earlier in the cycle and have essentially reached their precrisis levels are probably going to taper off here in terms of rent growth. But some of the lagging markets, I think, quite a bit of rent growth. And the rent growth that we've experienced today, I mean, this is obvious to you, but has not rolled through our rent growth by any stretch of the imagination. It's just the spot rents that have rolled. We've got -- even if rents stop right here, we say, we're going to have 3 or 4 years of rent growth by the time the stuff rolls through. So we're feeling pretty good about it. But it's about time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson with Morgan Stanley.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And now turning to the occupancy rate, I realized it varies by facility size. But with regard to the overall rate, it sounds like it's mainly by design that it's plateaued out a bit. You'd rather raise the rent than see occupancy significantly rise. So given that, do you think this level of occupancy is sort of the sweet spot than 94%, 95% range? Is that where you'd like to see it stay as you increase the rates?","Eugene F. Reilly","Right. This is Gene. Let me take that. Your observation is spot on. And if you want to drill onto the numbers a little bit, you saw a sequential decline, actually, in occupancy in the Americas by about 10 bps. What's important to emphasize is we are actually slightly ahead of our plan in the Americas because obviously, it depends on what's the composition of what's rolling. We expect to ramp into the mid to high 94% range. And yes, right around 95%, that is the sweet spot. And actually, above 93%, you can really push your assets. So our assets in the Americas, it's absolutely on rent growth. Those markets are leading the recovery. In Europe and Asia, they are different stages.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Yes, a little bit different. I mean, in Asia, we've been sitting around 96%, 97% occupied and obviously been pushing rents there even at a faster rate than we had anticipated last September. When we talked about China, we talked about sort of 5% to 6% compound annual rent growth that we were underwriting when historically they were about 8%. This first half of the year, we're at about 13% in China. Japan's up 6%, and we thought we'd be up, too. So again, a very, very positive trend. With respect to Europe, obviously, we're lagging, but we're holding occupancies at 93-plus percent. We've gained 20 basis points this quarter. So things are heading in the right direction. And again, if you sort of look at the trend with respect to rents, I feel pretty strongly that come the back half of this year, you're going to see positive rent change in Europe coming through as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's Michael Bilerman. Tom, I was wondering if you could just spend a couple of minutes just going through the back half deployment, as well as sale plans because a lot of the numbers are for the full year. And really, we're trying to understand, as the balance sheet as of June 30, really what the impact is in second half. And it would appear as though the predominance of the equity proceeds, $1.5 billion, are really going towards growth initiatives. If you were to take that $1.7 billion and multiply it by the percentages that you had, it totals $1.4 billion, so leaving very little for debt repayment. But I don't know from the sales perspective in the second half whether that's a source of other capital. So if you could sort of really break down that second half deployment between development and acquisitions and fund, as well as sales.","Thomas S. Olinger","Okay, thanks, Michael. So you're right in regards to the bulk of our equity-raised proceeds will be deployed in starts, acquisitions, investments and funds. We did take up our guidance on contributions and distributions, and that's about $1.5 billion. So that's incremental proceeds that you're seeing that allow us to fund that incremental $1.7 billion. But your numbers are very close. From how things will lay out in the second half, starts are back end loaded, but you'll see those fairly evenly through Q3 and Q4. Acquisitions will be more weighted to Q3 than Q4. And on contributions, you're going to see those weighted a little towards Q4 versus Q3.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Yes. And the only other thing, Michael, I would add to Tom's answer is that what we acquire may not always live on the balance sheet forever. So you should assume that we use private capital throughout -- the private or strategic capital throughout our business, and we may, at some point, recapitalize some of the stuff that we would acquire. So keep that in mind. Bottom line is with the second -- the last 30% of Norges in Europe and our convertibles being paid off, we already have 4 or 5 points of deleveraging that's kind of on the books. I mean, it's just a matter of time before that happens. So think of our 36 as sort of 32 plus 4, and we'll get there.","Thomas S. Olinger","And right now, we see leverage at year end at around 34%. So to Hamid's point with the Norges and the converts, that would put us right at the long-term target of look-through of 30%.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Yes. We're not even thinking about that issue anymore. We moved so far beyond that, that I think it's a matter of time before everybody figures it out.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Brendan Maiorana with Wells Fargo.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I think it's a question for Tom. Just that the answers that you gave to Michael's question was the deployment timing of both development and acquisitions offset by contributions. If I think about the guidance outlook and the run rate in the back half of the year, I guess it suggests that maybe there's a little bit of a ramp but probably not a dramatic ramp as we think about Q3 to Q4, is that correct? And does your guidance in the back half of the year include any type of onetime gains like the promote that you got in the second quarter?","Thomas S. Olinger","No, it doesn't. So our next schedule promote is in 2014. So we are not modeling a promote in the second half. So there's not a promote in the second half to our guidance. But that does affect our run rate when you think about Q2 and the promote was in there. But when you look at Q2 without the promote of $0.39, we are going to be ramping up our core FFO without the promote. And you're seeing that through deployment of the remaining equity proceeds. You're seeing that through same-store NOI growth. You're seeing that through stabilization of developments. And some what have been impact of lower interest costs because in Q2, you did not see the full impact of our deleveraging efforts. So I think in the back half, you're going to see us grow off that core base, and we see it at 41-plus cents a quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Sullivan with Cowen Group.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Hamid, this is really a question for you based on your commentary on rent growth and the promise of a very exciting Analyst Day at the end of the year. And this really goes to the issue of the same property NOI, that forecast you have for the full year. I'm surprised that the range hasn't narrowed a little bit from the 1.5, 2.5 that you've retained all year given the results we've seen in the first half. And I guess the flat-out question here is that do you anticipate that your rental spreads in the coming quarters are going to be higher than they've ever been? Because that's what seems to be suggested here.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Jim, first of all, the excitement around the Analyst Day is mostly because of the America's Cup. We're about to talk about that. Secondly -- I guess that's unabashed marketing. The rent ramp, it takes a while for these things to work through the leases. And remember, the leasing that we report doesn't even kick in for another couple of months. So really at this point, you're looking at the year. There's 3 months of leasing left to be done. And no matter what we do, it's very hard to effect the numbers with that middle period as these leases make their way through the systems. So we've got to be a little bit more patient about the spot rent increase coming through, and you're absolutely right. I think it's going to reflect itself into the mark-to-market of rents. And last quarter, in answer to that question, we said about 5%. Our answer this quarter would be 5% to 10%. So we are higher than where we were before for precisely the reason that you mentioned.","Thomas S. Olinger","Jim, I want to add one thing just to emphasize what Hamid said. So when we report our leasing activity, that's based on signs. And we're typically signing leases 1 to 2 quarters in advance of their effective date. So we're signing leases in Q2 that are going to kick in, in Q3 and Q4. So you're seeing a lag -- you're not seeing the full impact of the rent change that happened that's being reported on the leasing in Q2. You're going to see that in Q3 and Q4. So Q2 is more of a reflection of the leasing activity that we reported to you in Q4 and Q1. So there's a lag there that our same-store NOIs should really start to pick up, as Hamid said with rent growth but as this lag between signings and effective date kicks in.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Stewart with Green Street Advisors.","John Stewart - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Hamid, a couple of questions for you. First of all, not looking for earnings guidance for next year, but you referenced the ability to generate above-average earnings growth over the next several years. What's your bogey? What are you referencing in terms of an average? And then you also mentioned that you think you can add $10 billion to the asset base with just 10 basis points of any incremental overhead. What's the optimal size for your asset base? And likewise, what's the optimal land bank when it comes to price? Did I hear that you expect to cycle 2 or 3\/4 of it in the next 3 years? So that makes sense, but what's the optimal size when you think about replenishing the land bank?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Good questions. The optimal size of the land bank, it should be viewed in the context of the development run rate. And historically, our average value has been about 2.5 to 3 years worth of land. I think we should get more efficient and carry a little less than 2 years worth of land and just get the land -- control more land via options and other things that allow us to cycle through it a little quicker. But think for now as 2 years worth of development would be the appropriate amount of land. So if you think of this $2.5 billion, it's $5 billion of development in 2 years, and if land is 25% in Japan and places a little higher than that, I would like to see our land bank be around $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion, call it. It will take us to get there. And yes, we're chewing through land, but we are also getting new land every day. So it's not a static number. We won't see through it completely. What was your first question?","Tracy A. Ward","Rent growth.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Oh, rent growth. So I think the industrial business across the cycle has been sort of inflation, really long cycle. And I think the last 5 or 6 years, as we all know, had been an exception to that. Long term has been about inflation. I think if you're focused on supply constrained markets and the global markets that we are, I think rent growth could be 100 to 150 basis points ahead of that. So call it inflation at 2, 2.5; rent growth at 3, 3.5. That would be across the cycle. I think in the next 3 or 4 years, we could be 5% or 6% because we're closing that gap through replacement costs, by picking up an extra, call it, 2% to 3% for an incremental 4 or 5 years until we get to that level. So to answer your question about 300 basis points on top of what's normal would be my expectation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I'm here with Gabe Hilmoe. When I think about where your capital deployment is going to occur over the next year or 2 in terms of the monetization of the land bank, in terms of the investments that you're going to be making in funds, and then I look at where your current footprint is in terms of your share, it would seem to me that it's possible that your exposure to Asia could go down a little bit. How should we be thinking about the importance of Asia to the platform? And ultimately, what percentage of NOI or asset value is it going to represent?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Yes. Our growth asset allocations, you're familiar with, I think, gross meaning where our gross assets are regardless of how they're financed. And those are roughly a little under 50% in the U.S., 10% are in the other Americas and the remaining 40% roughly split between Europe and Asia, just to use some pretty rough numbers. Europe is over that today. Asia is below that today. So that's the growth asset allocation. But in terms of our net asset allocation, meaning where our equity is, we certainly have a higher percentage of funds over time in Asia than we do in Europe or the U.S. because we started out the business with that model and now we have this public entity in Japan where the expensive assets live. So a lot of that stuff is going to be living in the public entity that we own 15% of. So in terms of our net equity exposure, we'll be way lower than that to Asia and to Europe, frankly, and much more than that to the U.S. And that's been a deliberate strategy. The strategy is to take advantage of global opportunities to serve customers, but we are a U.S. dividend player -- payer. So we need to manage our exposure to foreign currencies down significantly through the use of private capital vehicles and by, in effect, setting up our debt so that we have a natural hedge on those assets. That is very deliberate. But one of its implications is that our NOI or certainly our FFO will be less dependent on some of those overseas locations.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just sticking with the FX commentary, just curious if in light of the target of 80% exposure to the U.S. dollar and if the dollar strengthens here more than you're modeling in today, how should we be thinking about the FFO impact here over the balance of 2013? If it's a maybe 5% strengthening versus what you're talking about today.","Thomas S. Olinger","Well, when you look at from an FX exposure on earnings, in the second half, a 5% move of currencies would be $0.015.","Hamid R. Moghadam","And currencies, by the way, don't move together. The yen and the euro kind of have been moving opposite to each other. So it depends on -- I mean, I think Tom is answering 5% bad on both. That kind of doesn't happen that way. So his answer is for maybe 10% bad on one and 5% good on the other one.","Thomas S. Olinger","And as I said in my remarks, we've got the euro at 1.3 and we have the yen at 100 in our model for the second half. So the impact of FX, as we've moved assets around and as our net U.S. equity exposure has grown to 75% this quarter, the impact of FX movements is diminishing in our portfolio. And we would like to take that, our long-term equity exposure, even up above 80%. We're going to do our best to mitigate that. The hedging strategies, the hedges we've put in place this quarter were part of that strategy. And we're going to continue to look for ways to further minimize that FX exposure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I was wondering, can you talk a little bit about, once you get past 2013, what you see as a normalized level of disposition activities for the model? And not trying to sneak a second question in there, but Tom, a few questions ago, you referred to a 2014 promote. Can you just say, is it expected to be similar in size to what we had this year?","Thomas S. Olinger","I'll answer the second question first. I won't get into the size of the promotes. We'll wait and see how the performance continues out. But the bottom line is we were coming into a cycle where we believe we're going to see promotes on an annual basis from a variety of our funds. And we're obviously seeing significant asset appreciation around the world, and we see a lot of rent growth. So I think that bodes well for future promote levels.","Hamid R. Moghadam","And with respect to sales, I would be very surprised if our average volume of sales in the next couple of years would be outside of $500 million to $1 billion. $500 million to $1 billion a year. So it won't be lower than that and it won't be higher than that would be my best answer to you right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Hamid, I think you mentioned in your comments about a new enterprise system. Can you talk about the benefits you see from that new rollout? And also, just I believe on the last call, you talked about an 80% equity target for the U.S. just given the increase in deployment. How quickly do you think you can get there?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Okay. Could you clarify the second question? I'm not sure I quite understood that.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Sure. You talked about U.S. equity exposure of 80%. I think Tom gave in his prepared remarks -- I think he said a 600-basis-point increase you had in the quarter. Just given the increase in deployment, how fast do you think you can get to that kind of 80% target?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Okay. 80% would be by year end. And my target is 100%. Tom's target is 90%. We're negotiating on that one.","Thomas S. Olinger","That one's true.","Hamid R. Moghadam","And that will take us probably another year or 2, but we'll get to 80% by year end, no question about it. The ERP, once fully implemented, then we are like 90-plus percent implemented, will allow us to do 2 things. One, it will allow us to do some tactical stuff much more efficiently in terms of accounting for our assets, knowing our historic operating metrics, being able to ask all your questions much more efficiently in many different ways. So it will give us a much more efficient way of looking backwards. This is a simple way of thinking about it. I think its most important benefit, however, is that it will allow us to capture information on real time tenant activity, traffic activity through a CRM system that we're doing and also forecasting, 10-year forecasting, on a dynamic basis so we know the value of our assets all the time on a real life basis as opposed to this sort of cap rate approach. Once we get there, I think we'll be, hopefully, a lot smarter about what's happening down the road as opposed to what happened in the past. So efficiency is goal #1, and better market insight is goal #2 on full implementation. With respect to the -- I want to go back and answer a question that I think John asked that my colleagues just reminded me that I didn't answer, the optimal size of the portfolio. I think the optimal size needs to be defined by a market. For us to go into a bunch of new markets and grow $10 billion by doing a couple of $100 million here and a couple of $100 million there, that would be insane. It doesn't move the needle on a company of our size, and frankly, we'll have reverse efficiencies. We want to deepen in our existing markets. And I don't think there is a top side to how much we can drive efficiencies. I think we now, particularly with the ERP system in place, can scale very, very efficiently as long as the assets are in the same markets where we already have a presence. It becomes really easy. New markets are a different story.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Petersen with MLV & Co.","Jonathan M. Petersen - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","Just I was hoping you could help us better understand the $750 million ATM program that you recently put in place. Just kind of how you expect to use the proceeds or if you expect to use the proceeds, do you expect to kind of trickle it out over time to fund developments or use it here and there for acquisitions? Or is it something you're going to have to keep your options open? And then also, just in terms of guidance, what's assumed in terms of that program?","Thomas S. Olinger","Okay. So right now, as you said, Jon, we're going to use it on an as-needed basis. Right now, given our sources and uses that we see in our model [indiscernible] to raise equity, we're always going to watch our long-term capital goals. But foremost, we're going to have to be at the stock price where we're trading at a premium to NAV, number one, where we're valued. And then number two, we'll look at our various funding sources across all of our different -- our capital stack and make a determination. But right now, there wouldn't be an equity raised embedded in our guidance in the second half.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers with Robert W. Baird.","David B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Now U.S. industrial supply this year, I think, coming in around 60 million or 65 million square feet and just kind of highlighting the domestic market. You guys are about 5 million or 6 million square feet of that or 8% or 10%. As you look forward, I think, just reading between the lines, you're talking about maybe ramping up to a 20 million square foot annual number for the U.S. I guess 2 questions. Can you, one, comment on -- if you continue to be about 10% of the overall market, that it implied about 200 million square feet starts for the U.S. over the next couple of years. One, can the market handle that? And two, can you comment on, I guess, your competitors' ability to kind of deliver the same type of supply that you're thinking about profitably?","Eugene F. Reilly","Yes, this is Gene. Let me start with that. First of all, I don't think we're going to get to 20% of the market. We also don't think that supply is going to be so anemic at 65 million feet, so that's going to grow. And we really don't think of market share as either a catalyst to build more or some type of ceiling. We just simply look at market opportunity. But in terms of our ability to deliver space, first, the first threshold is, is the market there? Right now, the market is there for sure. I mean, we've talked about the excess demand we see. And the second is the capacity of our infrastructure. And we can probably double our current volume, adding only arms and legs at the shield levels. So capacity of the organization is there. But the one thing I want to stress is that, and we've referenced it earlier on the call, we will build based on demand, not based on what our competitors are doing or some arbitrary share of the market we're trying to hit. And then finally, as I think about our competitors' ability to deliver space, well, it's been -- there's been a lot less supply than we expected. We do have competitors. They have been cautious so far. And ultimately, the landscape in the U.S. has changed quite a bit. The old local developer model really is -- doesn't exist anymore. It's really mostly institutional capital. We're watching it carefully, but I think we'll be -- we'll have a less volatile supply environment going forward because of that.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Yes. We're not going to -- just to be clear, we're not going to do 20 million square feet in the U.S. We've never done 20 million square feet in the U.S. That will be $1 billion in the U.S., not going to happen.","Guy F. Jaquier","The beautiful thing about our platform is that it's sort of diverse. We have the ability to choose where we develop. And what we're trying to prove out is that we can build $2.5 billion on a run rate basis, we deliver 15% margins year in and year out. It's a sustainable profitable business. And we're advantaged relative to our competitors because of our platform and our choice.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of quick follow-ups. That promote you booked this quarter, how much of that is influenced by you taking out -- taking full ownership of that JV? Because I think that's uncommon from what you've done in the past 2 -- if you look at promote just because of the closing of the JV itself. And second, it seems like it may be the quarter that promotes becomes a bigger picture of your company. If nothing changes in the industrial landscape from a rent growth perspective, what is the approximate level of promotes that are already embedded in your portfolio that you can probably, at the very least, expect to see in 2014 and beyond?","Guy F. Jaquier","Sure, Ki. This is Guy. I'm going to take the first one, and then I think maybe Hamid will take your second one. The promote on the Fund II was based on the price we paid for the assets, which was determined by appraisals. So there really was no impact on the amount of the promote based on pricing and how we structured the deal. The only thing it might have done is accelerated the timing of the closing. So if it's an IRR-driven fund or an IRR-driven promote, the fact that the investors got cash all at once versus a series of sales over a period of time might have an infinitesimal amount. But there's nothing in the structure that influence the promote.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Yes. And with respect to future levels of promotes, tough to speculate. It all depends on what that terminal value ends up being. But over time, I think you've heard me say before that we think promotes across the cycle should be on the order of 15 to 25 basis points of assets under management year in and year out. But there will be some years where there will be no promote and some years where there would be a promote. The good news is that we, by and large, don't put it into our guidance. And you guys don't give us credit for it anyway. So I guess it's not -- we don't worry about it a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes. It's just a quick follow-up, sort of. You mentioned leverage on an asset value basis by the end of the year. Where is that on debt to EBITDA? That's number one. Number two, if you look at CapEx on Page 16 on the trailing 4-quarter basis, that has been consistently rising. That's almost 15% this quarter relative to 12% at this point last year. Again, it's trailing 12. So it's a smooth number. Where is that -- is that going to -- are we going to go on the other side of that at some point? Because obviously, 300 basis points of NOI increases is a lot over the course of the year. And then just lastly, my prior question. You talked -- you didn't actually give me the numbers. What was going to be in the back half of the year in terms of deployment and sales? If you can actually break out the dollars, your share, so that we really understand the ins and outs of what's happening on the balance sheet, that would be helpful.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Yes. Michael, let me tell you. We're not going to predict to the nearest dollar what the deployment activity is going to be in the back end of the year because a lot of those things are up in the air and may or may not happen. And so we're not going to -- I think I'll have to review directional guidance, but we can't give you specific guidance on things that haven't happened yet. So that's the answer to that. As to the CapEx question, Gene, why don't you take that?","Eugene F. Reilly","Yes, sure. Michael, so let me -- it's going to be sort of a little bit of an essay answer. The punchline is that we think total CapEx as a percentage of NOI is going to decline in quarters ahead and be in the range of 13% to 14%. That's sort of the best estimate I can give you. But the way we look -- and we have tried to improve the disclosure in the supplemental, as Tom mentioned, and give it to you in the way we think about capital. So you got basic property improvements which are not affected by leasing volume and are constant. We think the best way to look at that is the trailing 4-quarter average, and that's pretty flat at about 600 square foot, and it's been flat for quite a long time. And then turnover costs, which represent the majority of capital, we track as a percentage of the total rental value of the leases in that period. That's very important because you've got to take into consideration rent levels and lease terms, in other words, what you're getting in return for the turnover costs. And this metric is fairly steady in the mid- to high 8% range. So the bottom line is we see capital as being fairly steady in terms of a trend line. If you look simply at CapEx as a percentage of NOI, you get a lot of noise because we think volume dramatically affects it over time. So our current curve, so to speak, has an upward trend to it. Over time, that's going to be, as I said, in the 13% or 14% range.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Well, one other thing is that leases now in the cycle are getting longer, so the commissions are getting bigger. That's why you want to look at it as a percentage of the lease consideration and not on a per square foot basis. We purposefully didn't want to sign long-term leases during the downturn. We do want to sign longer-term leases as the market approaches replacement cost trends. So that alone will drive that number up on a per foot basis but hopefully not as a percentage of the lease consideration.","Thomas S. Olinger","And Michael, on your debt-to-EBITDA question, we see debt to EBITDA about 6.75 at the end of the year. And debt to EBITDA adjusted for development would be about 5.75 at the end of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Maiorana with Wells Fargo.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I just want to follow up on the development and capital deployment outlook. The margins in the quarter came in, and I guess we're right around 14%, kind of in line with the 12% to 15% longer-term target that you have but down from 20%, which what you guys were sort of over-earning, I guess, if you will, the past several quarters. So first, do you think that those excess margins of 20% that, that is likely over with now and we're in a much more normalized environment going forward? And then second, maybe can you frame up why the development yields would come in, the margins would come in, given that it seems like rent growth is accelerating? Your land bank is worth more now. And it would seem that the fundamentals are more positive. So I would think that on a historical land cost, that doesn't change that, that margin is actually -- would have been accelerating a little bit as opposed to coming in a little bit.","Michael S. Curless","This is Mike Curless. I think it's -- I don't get too worked up about any given quarter with respect to margins. I like to look at this over the long haul, as Hamid mentioned. And if you look at the entire year, our margins are right at 17.5%, which is entirely consistent with our 10-quarter plan of about 18%. So if you look over the broad spectrum, I think it indicates a couple of things. One, our level of land control and customer control is driving strong margins. We're building spec in the right spots where the fundamentals are strong. And furthermore, I think it points to our land bank's value where at 18% margins versus in excess, 3% or 4% of expected margins can point to an uplift in our land of 20% or so in our land bank. So net-net, I think we feel really good about these margins and expect those to continue throughout the rest of the year.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Brendan, let me be even more precise. I think this would be a low mark in the near term, and there's a margin you'll see coming through. And at the answer -- when we answered the question about margins, we're talking about margins, if you were to buy a new land and build a new property. To the extent that our land bank being undervalued is adding to excess margin, that is why we're arguing or you've heard us say before that we think our land bank is undervalued. So I don't -- I think if we were to go buy a piece of land today and build it with the rent that we pro forma, the margins would be in the low to mid-teens. With our actual land bank at historical book and some of it impaired, I think the margins are going to be a lot higher than that. And I think this quarter is a bit of an aberration. But the long-term margins in this business are not 20%. They're a little bit lower than that.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Tom, just turning to the operating expenses in the same-store presentation. If you look at the last 4 quarters, they've really fluctuated. I think they were 3.5% in the second quarter. How are you thinking about that going forward? And maybe like if you compare 1Q '13 at 9% to 2Q '13 at 3.5%, what were the major differences?","Thomas S. Olinger","Jamie, this is Tom. So there is noise that goes through camp. There's some seasonality to it, some true-ups that we've had. There's always the famous no removal or lockups. No, that's right. There's variances in the first half of the year. But I do think the variances are going to settle down as we go forward. So I would expect to see same-store operating expenses to normalize, quite frankly, at inflation.","Operator","There are no further questions in queue at this time.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Prologis Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Tracy Ward, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, you may begin your conference.","Tracy Ward","Thank you, Jessica. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2011 conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. This morning, we'll hear from Hamid Moghadam, Co-CEO and Chairman, to comment on our company strategies and market environment; and then from Bill Sullivan, the CFO, who will cover results and guidance. Additionally, we are joined by Walt Rakowich, Gary Anderson, Mike Curless, Guy Jaquier, Tom Olinger and Gene Reilly.","Before we begin the prepared remarks, I'd like to quickly state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under Federal Securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates, as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance, and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or on SEC filings.","I'd also like to state that our fourth quarter results press release and supplemental, do contain financial measures, such as FFO, EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures. And in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. [Operator Instructions] Hamid, will you please begin?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our earnings call. As you know, 2011 was a year of transformation for our company. It's rare in business that 2 leading companies from the same sector are able to combine so seamlessly. Walt and I are very pleased to report that the integration has exceeded our expectations. You may recall, at the outset of the merger, we established 4 key priorities to guide our path over the next 2 years. These priorities were: First, to align our portfolio with our investment strategy; second, to strengthen our financial position; third, to streamline our Private Capital business; and fourth, to improve the utilization of our low-yielding assets. We've made excellent progress on these 4 objectives. And I'd now like to take a few moments to review their essential highlights. ","Of the 4 priorities, probably the most central to our plan is our decision to refine the combined portfolio and to align it with our investment strategy because in many ways, the other priorities flow from this one. The merger expanded our portfolio. And as you'd expect, not all of those assets were a perfect fit for the new Prologis. We performed a comprehensive review of our markets and our properties and constructed a $2.9 billion third-party disposition plan to cull the portfolio over the next 2 years. Execution of this plan is well underway. ","During the second half of the year, our share of third-party dispositions of buildings and land generated more than $530 million in total proceeds. Our sale properties were located predominantly in markets we've categorized as regional or other, and had an average age of about 25 years. The disposition momentum has carried into 2012 as we've continued to see solid demand and capital available for high-quality industrial real estate acquisitions around the globe. In fact, we've closed more than 425 million of dispositions year-to-date, of which our share is $385 million. This includes the sale of a 3.5 million square foot portfolio in the U.K. that closed just this morning. This brings our share of third-party sale proceeds from the second half of the year to $915 million. ","Our second priority is to further strengthen our financial position. Our sales proceeds enhance our stated objective to build one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry and to lower our overall financial risk and currency exposure. This means our assets outside the U.S. will be held in Private Capital ventures. New developments in these regions, particularly in emerging markets, will be done in conjunction with our Private Capital partners. Here, we are on track as well. During the second half of the year, our share of the contributions and sales to our core investment vehicles totaled more than $800 million. Combined with our share of third-party dispositions, we have generated more than $1.7 billion of capital for the company. ","Turning to our third priority. We've made great progress in rationalizing our Private Capital business. Subsequent to year end, we purchased our partner\u2019s interest in NA2 and brought the portfolio onto our balance sheet. We are engaged in similar discussions with our institutional partners regarding a couple of other funds, and we expect to report on our progress soon. We're also growing our Private Capital business with the formation of new funds and raising capital for our existing vehicles. Our top focus is on establishing new core investment vehicles in Japan. We began our marketing efforts for core and development ventures in November, and are confident of a midyear close. We're very encouraged by the high level of engagement of institutional investors. And the number of potential partners in various stages of due diligence has increased fourfold over last year. In short, the Private Capital team is firing on all cylinders and we believe we can meet or even exceed last year's record fundraising level of $1.8 billion. ","Our fourth priority is to improve the utilization of our low-yielding assets. Our leasing teams have delivered excellent results across the board in 2011. Activity was strong. And we ended the year with occupancy in our global portfolio up 120 basis points from the third quarter. And despite the problems in Europe, our team continues to produce impressive results. Fourth quarter occupancy in our European portfolio was up 160 basis points over the prior quarter. Demand for our properties remains strong in Asia, and we continue to lease new developments in both Japan and China, well ahead of schedule. ","Let me switch gears now and discuss our views on the operating environment, and what we're seeing and hearing from our customers. The primary indicators of our business tell us that the recovery is on track. Global trade has been improving at a healthy pace in the ocean and air sectors. Air cargo volumes experienced strong rebound in December and surpassed last year's record level. Retailers and manufacturers rush shipments as sales outpace their inventory holdings. We're seeing a similar trend in container volumes. For ports reporting data through December, volumes are up 6% year-over-year. ","Looking to the U.S., consumption retail sales and GDP have surpassed precrisis levels. Historical data tells us that as consumption trends up, customers will require more distribution and logistics space to accommodate their inventory restocking efforts. You may recall in October, we said that U.S. inventories were low heading into the holiday season. And as we anticipated, real inventories grew in the fourth quarter. Despite this growth, real inventories remain 5% below their precrisis peak. The continual rebuilding of our customers\u2019 inventories will be a significant theme in 2012. ","We closed out 2011 with positive net absorption of 120 million square feet in the U.S., the strongest it's been since 2007. We are forecasting an even stronger 2012 with positive net absorption in the range of 150 million to 175 million square feet. Our customers indicate that they're entering 2012 with a higher level of optimism and with many new space requirements. Following 3 years of inventory reduction and cost-saving efforts, utilization is running high in our buildings. And our customers have reached an inflection point, where they can no longer delay decisions on expansion. Of particular note, demand is picking up among our small- and medium-sized customers, as they gained an impressive 200 basis points in occupancy from the third quarter. In fact, they accounted for the vast majority of our occupancy gains during the quarter, and will continue to drive occupancy and rents in the near term. ","In short, we had a very successful year. Walt and I are extremely proud of what the team has accomplished in just a couple of quarters together. We believe the opportunities ahead for the new Prologis are tremendous. And we look forward to our continued success in 2012. With that let me turn it over to Bill.","William E. Sullivan","Thanks, Hamid. This morning, I will focus my comments on 4 key areas: First, results for the fourth quarter; second, our capital markets activity; third, an update on our merger integration; and fourth, our guidance for 2012. Let's start with fourth quarter results. ","For the fourth quarter 2011, we generated core FFO of $0.44 per share, which exceeded our original internal forecast by $0.04. The strength in our Q4 core FFO was driven principally by higher-than-expected occupancy, strong Private Capital revenues associated with our Q4 transaction activity, various year-end adjustments and reduced G&A expenses, as a result of our deferred compensation plans. From a run rate perspective, approximately $0.025 per share of the $0.44 was related to the year-end adjustments and the effect of the onetime impact from the deferred comp. ","In our operating portfolio, leasing volume was strong across all regions. And in total, we leased more than 37 million square feet, an 11% increase over the third quarter. As Hamid referenced, our operating portfolio was 92.2% occupied at year end, up 120 basis points from the third quarter. Rent changes on rollovers decreased 4.5%, an improvement over the third quarter. Which when combined with our strong occupancy, led to an increase in same-store NOI of 0.4%. ","From a contributions and dispositions perspective, we completed approximately $1.2 billion in transactions in the fourth quarter, of which approximately 83% or $1 billion was our share of the proceeds. The weighted average stabilized cap rate on our share of contributions and dispositions was 7.1%. The assets sold to third parties represented predominantly nonstrategic or non-core market assets. In the contributions in sales to our co-investment ventures, nearly 33% of the assets were in the higher cap rate markets of Mexico and Brazil. Excluding those markets, the weighted average stabilized cap rate would be 6.8%. We also disposed of $32 million of land and monetized an additional $41 million of land through our Q4 development starts. ","On the capital deployment front, we committed approximately $345 million of capital, of which $210 million was Prologis' share. Our deployment included $166 million of development starts, $146 million of building acquisitions and $32 million of land acquisitions. ","Turning to capital markets. In Q4, we completed more than $1.3 billion of debt financings and refinancings, with nearly $1.1 billion of that on behalf of our co-investment ventures and $240 million related directly to Prologis. Additionally, we bought back over $75 million of debt associated with our converts and the PEPR bonds during the quarter. These transactions, in combination with the net effect of our Q4 disposition and capital deployment activity, enabled us to lower our look through debt by over $900 million, reduce our share of 2012 maturities by $400 million and improve our leverage stats across the board. While we were pleased with our progress and exceeded our 2011 delevering objectives, we remain laser-focused on achieving our long-term leverage and credit rating targets. ","Relative to the merger integration, we continue to make excellent strides in both identifying and realizing merger synergies. We have identified a total of $115 million in merger-synergy savings, of which we have realized over 90% on a run rate basis as of year-end 2011. We will continue to incur merger integration costs throughout 2012, related primarily to costs for the remaining transitional employees as well as our continuation of our rebranding efforts. To be clear, the heavy lifting associated with the integration is effectively complete. It has gone extremely well, and we could not be happier with the synergies and the collaboration among our teams. ","Now turning to guidance for 2012. We expect full year core FFO to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.70 per share. As a reminder, our core FFO excludes any gains or losses from disposition and contribution activity, as well as merger integration costs. While we don't guide to individual quarters, it's important to note that core FFO will not be evenly distributed between quarters in 2012. We expect first quarter core FFO to be lower than the fourth quarter of 2011, principally as a result of: First, the $0.025 of Q4 adjustments in deferred comp savings I referenced earlier; second, the NOI loss associated with the substantial disposition late in Q4 2011; third, seasonally lower occupancy in Q1; and finally, expected seasonal expenses associated with wintertime property OpEx. We expect FFO to gradually increase as the year progresses, driven principally from increasing occupancies in the operating portfolio, stabilization of development assets and increased Private Capital revenues. ","On a GAAP basis, we expect to report a net loss for 2012 ranging from $0.40 to $0.50 per share, with a differential from core FFO driven predominantly by real estate depreciation and merger integration expenses. ","In our earnings press release, we outlined the business drivers that support our 2012 guidance, which I will briefly review. Same-store NOI is expected to be flat to up 1%, reflecting increased occupancy net of rent rolled outs. Given the lease roll that takes place at the beginning of each year and the seasonal nature of month-to-month leasing, we expect occupancy to drop in the first quarter, and then to trend higher and reach 92.5% to 93.5% by the end of 2012. And while we expect to see net effective rent growth in select markets, rent change on rollovers is expected to again be negative during the year, given leases rolling down from prior cycle peaks. However, we believe we are nearing the end of this roll-down cycle. On the expense side, we expect net G&A to be essentially flat to the annualized fourth quarter level and to total $200 million to $205 million for the year. ","Now turning to capital deployment. We anticipate starting $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion of new development, with the vast majority targeted for the second half of the year. Our overall share of total expected investment will be approximately 70%. We expect building acquisitions of $400 million to $600 million, of which we expect Prologis' share of the capital to be approximately 40%. We expect contributions and dispositions in 2012 to total $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion. Net of our co-investment in the fund activity, we expect Prologis' share of the proceeds to be approximately 70%. Our guidance assumes a substantial portion of the contributions are expected to come as a result of the formation of our Japan Funds but does not contemplate a recapitalization of PEPR in 2012. ","In an effort to simplify our business, which we have stated as a goal from the outset of the merger, we also intend to rationalize a number of our funds in 2012. To that end, last week, we bought out our partner's 63% interest in NA2 and now own 100% of the asset. This purchase was in our plan for 2012 and is modestly accretive to FFO, although temporarily dilutive to our debt metrics. We intend to eliminate, either through dispositions or through consolidations, at least 3 other funds in 2012 in order to simplify our fund structures and reduce competing priorities. ","In closing, we are incredibly pleased with the results in 2011 and the significant progress we made in enhancing our financial position over the last 6 months. We have delivered ahead of plan on our 2011 priorities and are solidly positioned to execute on our strategic goals for 2012. At this point, I will turn the call back to the operator to open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm here with Jamie. We had a quick question. We thought there was a timely article today in the Journal talking about the U.S. market shining brighter, manufacturers looking homeward. Can you talk to us about that? And how does this impact your business? So let's say, if manufacturers are bringing more business back to the United States, how does that impact the warehouses that -- in your portfolio?","Hamid R. Moghadam","It should help Chicago and the Midwest a little bit more. And as you know, we've had major holdings there. And you've heard me talk about how Chicago used to be one of the good markets. And was now, in the last 3 or 4 years, behaving like one of the bad markets. And I think if there is more metal-bending and manufacturing of the low-tech nature, it's probably auto-related in the Midwest, so will benefit Chicago. So I think we will be a beneficiary of it, but probably not on the coast; more in the lower cost manufacturing areas like the Midwest.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Hamid, this is Jamie. So I mean, I guess, just to follow-up, as you're talking to tenants, are they thinking more of along those lines or is this just more in the press and in Super Bowl commercials?","Hamid R. Moghadam","More of the latter than the former. But it is a trend. What's important about it is that -- let me back up. People get this manufacturing thing wrong. Manufacturing employment in the U.S. has gone down. But manufacturing actually has not gone in the U.S. U.S. is still a powerhouse manufacturer, particularly, because of the high productivity and the high-value goods that are being made. So that's -- the trend in manufacturing employment has been down. Now that decline has flattened, basically, and has tipped up a little bit. So to that extent, it's significant, and sells headlines in newspapers. But I think the long-term dynamics are such that the U.S. will continue to be a big manufacturer, but employment levels in manufacturing are not going to be substantially higher.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan with Morgan Stanley.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just going to the development guidance, you have $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion. Could you just talk a little bit about how much of that will be monetizing land currently in your inventory versus new land acquisitions? And then, also, maybe the mix of build-to-suit and spec, and where you might have the confidence to be starting spec?","Michael S. Curless","This is Mike Curless. Let me talk to you a little bit about, first, how we see the makeup of our development pipeline. The guidance that Sully referenced, we'd expect some 35% or so of that to take place in the Americas, 40% in Asia and 25% in Europe. And the makeup of that between spec and build-to-suit, we suggest that some 35% of that would be build-to-suit, with 55% spec, keeping in mind that the more expensive spec buildings in Brazil, China and Japan drive up that percentage. We would suggest it\u2019d be much more balanced from a transaction standpoint going forward. In terms of specs opportunities, we're seeing opportunities in primarily in our global markets. That includes cities like Miami, Los Angeles, Washington, DC, Paris and Tokyo among others. And we feel like we're very cautious about our spec development program. For starters, we focus our spec only in global markets, where our global customers indicate that's where they want to be. And then it's important to note, within those global markets, most of our spec developments takes place in our proven existing parks where we've got extensive track records with very high occupancies. We know the local market inside and out, have a lot of people on the ground in those markets. And those feel like very appropriate places to build specs.","William E. Sullivan","And relative to the land component of that, we're going to put a fair amount of our land to work this year inside developments. But also expect to see in line with what Mike was talking about relative to where there are good development opportunities, undoubtedly, we'll be looking to buy more land in Brazil and China, in Japan, et cetera. So there will be land acquisition throughout the year. But we certainly intend to put our land to work.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Yes. I think our net land position is probably going to decline about $200 million per year until we get to the point that we're comfortable, which is in the low billion dollar range, but it will not be a straight line as Bill mentioned.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I was hoping we could talk a little bit about the North America fund to purchase. Can you give us some idea of the overall price paid for that 63% interest and how it worked from a valuation perspective as well?","William E. Sullivan","Ross, this is Bill. Netting it out, in our NAV schedules for ad infinitum that we put in our supplemental, we've always included a pro forma in the NOI for virtually 100% ownership in NA2, as well as the corresponding debt associated with it. So when we look at NAV, and when we've guided you guys to look at NAV in the past, we've sort of asked you to look at that as if we own 100%. We had the opportunity where -- we restructured the NA2 fund about 2 years ago to the point where, effectively, we had the opportunity to buy the 63% interest for $1, which we did. And we bought it for $1. We paid off the Citi debt that was sitting on that, a little over $300 million in doing that, and we're bringing the whole portfolio onto our balance sheet. And it just simplifies our fund structures, puts a bunch of really good assets on our balance sheet. And again it\u2019s -- from an FFO standpoint, it's modestly accretive. From a debt metric standpoint, it's modestly dilutive to the debt metrics. But again, we're on a mission to pay down debt. And actually some of the interesting pieces, as we look for good accretive debt to be able to pay down as we generate proceeds, there are some secured debt inside NA2 that offers us the opportunity to pay it down this year. And so there are some benefits associated with it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I'm speaking with Sully, as you think about -- so you gave this $400 million to $600 million of sort of growth acquisitions for the year and your share is obviously lower. And you talk about some of these fund contributions or sort of the fund acquisitions of maybe 2 or 3 more where you would consolidate in. I assume those are not the same sort of opportunities like NA2 where effectively you were consolidating already. And it doesn't include, it doesn't sound like the land potentially that you'd be buying, so maybe you can talk a little bit about how you sort of see that capital being spent this year to take in those fund interests? How you intend to fund them and also sort of gross land purchases of that we should be thinking about as a use of capital in 2012?","William E. Sullivan","Well, let me talk to some of these fund consolidations and what-not that we're talking about. In essence, we're really targeting 3 funds. And I think we've chatted about this before. We began the liquidation of the OSTRS fund back in the third quarter of last year, and we'll continue that process into this year. And the likelihood is that we'll either dispose of those assets and distribute the cash, or we'll take the assets under our balance sheet in exchange in essence for our interest and maybe a little more cash but's a relatively small portfolio. Same thing is true with the AFL-CIO. So those are Funds 1 and Funds 11 in the schedule, okay. Those are relatively small funds. The other fund that we're focused on is the PCAL, the Prologis California fund, where we have a 50% interest. And in essence, we're going to just split the assets, and each of our partners take the assets on the balance sheet. So from a cash out of pocket in terms of what we're talking, it probably will be a cash generator, not a cash utilizer in 2012. And it just cleans up a host of the fund structures. And so I hope that answers...","Hamid R. Moghadam","Yes. The only other thing is that the land, as I mentioned, Michael, is probably going to be a net contributor of a couple hundred million dollars, call it, $200 million of cash. We'll buy some, we'll sell some, we'll transfer some into developments, but net-net-net based on most scenarios, we're looking at about $200 million reduction in our land bank.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Macquarrie.","Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie Research","First, as a quick follow-up, is the calculation of 9% cap rate for your purchase of NA Fund II? And the second question, turning to Europe, what are your plans for taking your ownership rate in PEPR up from 93.7% to 95% to legal control and possibly start raising a new European fund to offload those assets? And I guess, a third part that question is, what's the appetite from investors for Private Capital in Europe?","William E. Sullivan","You want me to chat about NA2 first?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Yes. NA2 and then maybe Walt can talk about...","William E. Sullivan","I'm not sure -- the cap rate you just threw out there but whatever it is, it's substantially higher than what the value of that portfolio is.","Hamid R. Moghadam","The value of that portfolio is going to be \u2013 have a probably at most a 6% on it on the U.S. portion and probably a 7% portion \u2013 7% on the Mexico portion of it, somewhere in that range. But it ain\u2019t going to \u2013 it\u2019s not 9%, so I don't know what the math is that you're doing.","William E. Sullivan","I mean, when you work through it in this lobby, in the purchase accounting it flows into Q1. But look, in the supplemental, you'll see NA2 with about a $2 billion gross book value -- that's gross book value, on that original acquisition. We bought out Citi's interests for $1. And so the overall acquisition price of NA2 is closer to $1.6 billion with the reduction being borne by Citi on that, not us. It\u2019s effectively breakeven to us from our original investment, which is a hell of a deal considering that we did the fund July of 2007. And so those values have come back pretty strongly over the last couple of years.","Walter C. Rakowich","Yes, and Ki Bin, this is Walt. As it relates to the second part of your question, our goal is not necessarily to gain 95% legal control of PEPR. I don't know if you saw it, but yesterday, PEPR put out a release and -- first of all, let me just step back. I think we've been saying for a long period of time now that PEPR is not, in our view, in the right structure as a public company with very little liquidity. And so you'll see in that release that we made a proposal, as a shareholder \u2013 as a unitholder, which would be taken for a vote in March, mid-March, to change the management regulations to allow for a winding up of PEPR with a distribution of assets. We call it a distribution in specie. And so look, at the end of this day, we think that this proposal is good for all unitholders because, number one, it provides an equal benefit to everybody across the board. And number two, it provides liquidity to everyone, all unitholders in a tax-efficient way. And number three, it provides -- and this is very important, optionality to the unitholders, who hold in excess of 1% of those shares, to in essence, take cash today or take properties in the event that they think that those properties will appreciate in the future. And so we're obviously in favor of this proposal. We tabled it, and we plan on voting on it in mid-March or voting for it in mid-March.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sloan Bohlen with Goldman Sachs.","Sloan Bohlen - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to get a little bit more color on the distributions plan for this year. If you could maybe break it out geographically, and then if we can maybe get a sense of what amount of NOI will be tied to which regions you\u2019re distributing or contributing assets to?","William E. Sullivan","Well, yes you said distributions. I assume you mean contributions or dispositions in essence. As we said, look, a sizable portion -- if you look at the $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion, okay, effectively 60% of that relates to Japan. And that's going to be an incredibly low cap rate relative to the overall average. And so think of the other 40% as fairly evenly spread between Europe and the U.S. But the vast majority of it\u2019s going to -- in our plan is targeted to the 2 Japan funds, the development fund and the core fund.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Maiorana with Wells Fargo.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just wanted to go into the same-store guidance a little bit, flat to plus 1 for the year. It would strike me that your occupancy has moved up pretty nicely throughout 2011 and you expect it to move up a bit in 2012. Why shouldn't we see same-store maybe move up a little bit more than that? Is there something that's impacting that number? And can you give us a same-store number on a cash basis and compare that to the GAAP guidance that you've given?","William E. Sullivan","Well, let me answer the cash side first. I don't have those numbers with me on the cash side. And we got asked that question about an hour ago through somebody's e-mail, and we'll have to get back to you guys on the cash side of that. We'll look at first quarter whether we can\u2019t provide some deeper input to that. And from the same-store standpoint, guys, look, there's an opportunity. The markets are recovering. We're looking at our best guess as to what's going to happen in the overall markets. We think that, overall, the portfolio is probably somewhere less than 5% over rented today. In 2012, sort of 5 years after the 2007, 2008 peak, some of what we have rolling down this year will be at the top of some of the theoretical roll-downs. But that's why we feel pretty confident going into 2013 that this thing is turned around pretty quickly. And so 2012 should be sort of the end of the process where we see some sizable roll-downs in this portfolio.","Walter C. Rakowich","And Brandon, this is Walt. Let me also say, keep in mind, that the same store results that we're talking about this year, a lot of that is somewhat driven by what happened last year in terms of rent roll-downs, right? So we've had, in 2011, a roll-down order magnitude 6%, 7%, 8%, I don't know what the average is. But that's not flowing into next year's numbers. So if you're turning 15% to 20% of your portfolio down, if you will, 7% or 8%, by definition you need to have 2% occupancy growth just to be at 0. And so looking forward into the future -- I mean, we're telling you what we think it's going to be this year, but hopefully, this year's net roll-downs will be a lot less. And that will have a measurable impact on next year's same-store NOI.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Having said all of that there is a big bet between different members of the management team as to when that will occur. And you can guess which side of it I'm on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Real quick on North American Fund II. Could you just comment before my other question on whether or not those assets you brought on balance sheet, are they expected to stay on balance sheet or are you just temporarily housing them for another fund? And then looking at occupancy trends sequentially, what you categorized as other markets had a nice increase of, call it, about 200 basis points. Could you talk about what's going on in there and what the markets are?","William E. Sullivan","Well, 2 questions there. And so let me try to address the first one relative to the NA2 assets. The NA2 assets are, again, I don't know, Walt, 60% or 75% developed by...","Walter C. Rakowich","Right. They're great assets.","William E. Sullivan","Fabulous assets. And they\u2019re great assets to bring on the balance sheet. But they also happen to represent great assets that we might seed into some of the funds, et cetera. And so they represent a pool probably not unlike the SGP assets that were brought onto the balance sheet in 2011 and then put it into the USLF later in the year. But no determination has been made in that regard, specifically to those assets. And then the second question...","Eugene F. Reilly","Well, why don\u2019t I take this? It's Gene. You're right about our regional markets are recovering. And a couple of them which are noteworthy in our portfolio would be Cincinnati, Columbus and Memphis. And frankly, those markets themselves are doing a little bit better, but the real story there is the performance of our portfolio; we're in the high-90s, mid- to high-90s in occupancy there. And we outstrip the market occupancy by over 1,000 basis points. And it's really a testament to the quality of these assets in our portfolio and the quality of the team. There's other one thing I'd like to point out relative to sort of what changed in this quarter and the operating environment in the U.S. And this is referenced in the initial remarks. We've seen a 170 basis point pickup in occupancy towards [indiscernible]. I caution you, these are volatile statistics quarter-to-quarter, but I think we highlighted this trend a couple of quarters ago, so we've seen it develop. But now it's really come into its depth in a big way. That's really important because that's where we have occupancy to pick up in our portfolio and we expect it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","This is probably a question for Mike. As you well know, when the big retailers, and looking at their distribution channels and the big logistics companies, did all their modeling 5, 6, 7, 8 years ago, and they put in the employee cost, right to work state, fuel cost, rent rates, et cetera. It was clearly a shift towards centralized big box, which is what drove a lot of build-to-suit and spec development in the primary markets. How has that -- how have those models changed and how do you see that working going forward in terms of the big users of bulk industrial space?","Eugene F. Reilly","This is Gene. Let me start and then maybe Mike can fill it in with more big picture. But I actually think what's really taking place, if you go back 5 to 10 years, a lot of the supply chain reconfiguration, conventional knowledge was big buildings. And many of these big buildings were developed in, frankly, x urban and in some, cases locations where they are really not near population centers and were cleared around that 500-mile radius, that one-day truck route. So Memphis benefited. Columbus, Ohio benefited. What we've seen recently, and I think it's driven by a couple of things, one being fuel prices, is that big buildings are still in demand and we talk a lot about that on these calls. But the location is clearly going back to population centers and depot locations. So I think the big shift has been away from tertiary locations toward major markets, and we see that continuing. And obviously, it's good for our portfolio but it's also very challenging to deliver big [indiscernible] in these big markets. But we think we're pretty well positioned there.","Michael S. Curless","Yes. And I would just add, it's very consistent with our long-term build-to-suits strategy as well, John. Being our primary focus on build-to-suits is predominantly in global markets and some select regional markets all, of course, with acceptable profit margins. And I think we'll see more of that type of activity this year as we're hearing our customers\u2019 sentiment approve more of a gravitation back to some of the larger markets as Gene mentioned. And then you heard Hamid mention earlier that space utilization is its all-time high. You combine that with better customer sentiment and the lack of big blocks of space available in existing buildings, we're pretty bullish on our build-to-suit prospects for next year.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Not to pile on but I would just say there's a little bit different thing going on in Europe right now. You're really seeing supply-chain reconfiguration completely. So you're seeing companies moving from older to newer buildings. And this has been happening for the last decade. And really, manufacturing has been shifting for the last 25 years from Western Europe to Central and Eastern Europe. So you're really seeing companies today trying to conduct Pan-European distribution as opposed to local and regional distribution. So you actually are seeing companies move to bigger boxes over time. Not nearly as big as you'd see in the U.S. A 500,000 square foot building in Europe would be a very, very large building. And there are just a handful of 1 million square foot buildings. But slightly different dynamic in Europe than in the U.S.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Stewart with Green Street Advisors.","John Stewart - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Bill, can you please identify for us where you expect to achieve -- where the additional synergies that you've identified are going to come from? And then can you also please discuss your ability to buy back unsecured. I presume that you could issue today well inside of the coupons on what's outstanding, so how are you going to go about -- what's the execution going to look like on buying those back? And then lastly, Walt, if you could please give us just a bit more color on the PEPR proposal. Specifically, do you need a majority or the minority to approve that proposal? And then if it is approved, where do you go from there? I know you said that a recap is not contemplated in this year's guidance, but what's to prevent you from distributing at that point and where do we go from there?","Thomas S. Olinger","This is Tom. I'll take the increase in merger-synergy's question. There were 5 items that drove the increase. The first was greater headcount savings. We identified lower IT costs and lower professional fees, including the benefit from entity simplification. We've identified more entities that we believe we can eliminate. And we had greater savings related to bringing property management in certain markets inhouse. And we also had some greater global line of credit amortization savings than we originally anticipated.","William E. Sullivan","Relative to the debt question, we look across our portfolio to see where we can buy the most accretive or where we can pay off the most accretive debt possible as we generate the proceeds. Hence, one of the reasons we did NA2, as an example, was because there was a fair amount of debt that effectively was 100% ours. And it gives us the opportunity. There's more of that in the secured debt side. Candidly, the most accretive \"debt\" is in our preferreds right now. And so we're going to look across the spectrum as we generate proceeds, and look to see where we can use those proceeds to delever most accretively as we get it. And we've said this a couple of times, we -- given our disposition and contribution program, we may have a high class problem that says we are sitting on some cash ahead of scheduled debt maturities. But we're hoping to plan that pretty well.","Walter C. Rakowich","And John, as it relates to color on PEPR, let me just answer your question by saying that this proposal that we've made requires a 67% vote to be approved. Obviously, we own 94% of PEPR. Once the management regulations are changed, basically any shareholder that owns in excess of 20% of the shares can table a vote to wind up the company. And that could be a logical next step for us to consider, obviously. As it relates to long term, the assets, I think we've been pretty upfront to say that one of our key objectives is to mitigate the FX exposure that we have long term. And so I'd say, consistent with that objective, I'd say longer term, we\u2019d likely seek to put our pro rata share of those assets into funds. But let me be clear and make sure that everybody understands, and Bill said this in his remarks, that this is not in our plan or in our guidance as it relates to 2012.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers with RBC Capital Markets.","David Rodgers - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Hamid, I think for a couple of years we've been talking more and more of the development running through funds. And I think for 2012, you've got about 70% of the capital in the developments will be PLD. Yet, I think, some of that is probably timing related to when you can start these funds, but a couple of questions around that. I guess, one, are there any funds contemplated this year that would be development funds as a part of that 70%? And maybe more broadly, can you give us a sense as to whether your third-party capital providers continue to be interested in development funds? And will we see that 70% PLD contribution declining in years to come?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Okay. Great. Dave, first of all, the 70% is a big improvement over 100%, so we're actually pleased with that. And we think that number is going to move right down to about just under 50% in the long term. Yes, we are doing all our developments in ventures today in Mexico, in Brazil and in China. And will be, as you know, adding a development fund in Japan, along with an open end fund. So more and more of our markets outside of the United States and Europe are moving into a development and in a venture format, bringing down that percentage. With respect to -- and investors are really interested in development. And frankly, when they look around for development partners and platforms, without being too boastful, I mean there aren't that many choices that would be more attractive to them than what we have to offer in terms of scale of platform, quality of teams, land assets, et cetera, et cetera. So I think we're well positioned to serve the needs of the investors. With respect to the U.S. and Europe, for the foreseeable future, the developments will be on balance sheet. But really think of those as replacing the significant number of assets that we're selling in terms of our exit markets and other markets and regional markets that we're selling. We got to replace those assets and the land bank and the U.S. developments on balance sheet and on Europe will serve that function. So that's the plan long term. Two, 3 years from now we'll be under 50% in terms of development on balance sheet. And by the way, you didn't ask this question, but I was going to say this in connection with the land question. Land used to be a 4-letter word, my judgment is that a year from now, land will be one of the strongest aspects of this company, particularly given the location of the land we have and the opportunities that will have to monetize it through development. And because we're going from 100% development on balance sheet model to 50%, roughly across the board, and we're reducing our land bank by a couple of hundred million dollars net-net-net, development and land actually will be sources of capital, not uses of capital. That's a pretty important switch that I'm not sure everybody's figured out yet.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of George Auerbach with ISI Group.","George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Guys, last summer you embarked on a project to build out solar panels on a number of U.S. rooftops, which at the time you estimated could add upwards of $20 million per year of NOI and $100 million of development fees over a period of 4 or 5 years. I guess 2 questions. First, are we in the buildout? i.e., how much of the NOI from the program is in the run rate today? And second how much incremental NOI and fees should we expect this year from the solar program?","Michael S. Curless","This is Mike Curless. Just to circle back on the solar frame [ph]. First, as most of you are aware, we have closed the deal, the OE loan program, a few months ago. In a short few months, we're off to a good start with respect to those in pursuit by our dedicated solar team. It is a long lead-time sales item. And we expect to see results on that in 2013. But keep in mind, it's a relatively long sales cycle. As you are aware, last summer there's $2.6 billion potential capacity. And that can create some significant value potential based on development fees, roof panel and return on equity and even replacements of some roofs. But as we look at it over the long haul, even if we're able to capture a portion of that value. This is going to be very meaningful against what we think is relatively low overhead. We already have the people in place, plenty of rooftops, and so we're optimistic that even a significant or small portion of that overall value creation will be very accretive to us over the long haul. Again, it's a long sales cycle and we look forward to see results coming our way in 2013.","Hamid R. Moghadam","But the short answer, I think, to your question is that it's pretty back-end loaded. Because it takes a while to, a, make the deals and two, to put up these rooftop units and start generating fees and revenues on it. So don't expect the number, the $20 million, to come in sort of a quarter for each year in the next 4 years. So it'll be mostly back-end loaded.","William E. Sullivan","Yes. The guidance for 2012, the add from that program is de minimis for 2012. But we're also optimistic that even with the long lead-time cycle, these guys could get a move on and get something to started in late 2012.","Hamid R. Moghadam","And I should remind you, we already generated a significant amount of revenue from rooftop solar outside of this program, because of activity earlier on. I believe that number is like $8 million per year, but don't hold me...","William E. Sullivan","I mean, we -- don't hold you to that. But we've done well over 60 megs, megawatts, of solar installations so far. And this program if it was fully built out, will be something on the order of 250 to 275 megawatts. So there's a lot to come, but we've already done some.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Be patient.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just had a follow-up, just in terms of -- just looking at the occupancy increase in Page 28 of the supplemental, you sort of break down the portfolio between the assets that are generating NOI and those that are generating a net operating loss. And it would appear sequentially that those generating a net operating loss, the square footage went down by 9 million. But the ones generating NOI also went down 2 million as you sort of sold or contributed assets out of the consolidated portfolio. Assuming you talked about the 7% cap rate, I assume you sold more fully leased assets. So is it fair to assume that most of the leased up that you got in the quarter was from taking these really low-leased assets and moving them up? And just talk about maybe what else is happening here between these 2 buckets.","William E. Sullivan","Well, let me try to touch on that in a couple of big pictures. First of all, if you take out all the noise in Q4, what we disposed of, what did we acquire, what did we take out of the operating portfolio and put into held-for-sale, et cetera. What ended the year at 92.2% occupancy would have been 92.9%. And Your occupancy actually would have improved relative to eliminating the noise. And so we had pretty robust results in Q4 from a leasing perspective. And somewhat intuitive to sort of look and say, \"Hey guys, we leased a boatload of space that was empty.\"","Hamid R. Moghadam","So Michael, the easiest trend that you can sort of grab onto is what Gene talked about. We were pretty fully leased on large buildings. We were only 88% leased on smaller buildings. And the small- and medium-sized businesses coming back are driving the occupancy in the near term. Because frankly, on the super big buildings, we don't have a lot of product to lease. I mean we're pretty full. So it's really the story this quarter is sort of the first and second inning of the small- and medium-sized businesses coming back. And I think that's a huge deal for the recovery of this business.","William E. Sullivan","And there are higher rent per square foot and a smaller spaces and the NOI drags on higher.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Quick question, is the management transition that's planned for the end of this year still happening as originally contemplated one year ago when the merger was announced?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Yes.","William E. Sullivan","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Macquarie.","Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie Research","Just a quick follow-up. How would you describe the institutional demand for European industrial properties? And if you could quantify how much money do you think you could raise from third-party investors out there?","Guy F. Jaquier","Yes. Ki Bin, this is Guy. We are seeing -- well, first of all, we had a great year last year in raising institutional capital. It was a record year. We've seen that momentum carry on to this year. Europe, I mean Europe -- the Japan raise we're doing and even our U.S. funds, we're seeing continued interest. There are a couple of trends going on. One is that a lot of these investors are still under-invested in industrial, and they're seeing the same change and improvement in the fundamentals that we're talking about here today. So that interest is increasing. Secondly, there's a trend towards having fewer relationships with managers, and so they want the larger managers who they can have multiple investments with and we can have ventures or funds offered to them in a multiple geographies. And thirdly, I think there's a move towards great appreciation of the owner-operator model, where they can invest with a manager who, especially in this part of the cycle, can add value at a real estate level rather than just financial engineering. So those 3 things are going our way. Relative to Europe, specifically, we have not seen drop-off in capital looking at Europe. Obviously, there's a lot of headlines, but we're still seeing considerable interest. And even of note, in the last quarter or so, we've seen an interest from Japanese institutional investors looking at Europe, which is something new. I don't know whether it's just yen, euro or what, but that's something I think about sitting here 6 months ago I wouldn't have said we're seeing a lot of.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Stewart with Green Street Advisors.","John Stewart - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick clarification. On, call it, $5 billion of distributions and contributions this year, I know you said that your share is expected to be 70%, but what would the net proceeds be?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Distributions? You mean contributions on sales, right?","John Stewart - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","That's what I said, yes.","William E. Sullivan","Yes, no, no, no the net proceeds stats are 70%.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Net gross proceeds but you\u2019ve got to take debt out of that.","William E. Sullivan","Yes. But I mean, it's gross proceeds we're going to use to pay off debt. Japan is an example. Just to sort of work through it, there's debt in Japan, okay.","Hamid R. Moghadam","But the best way to look at it is on gross assets are share, okay?","William E. Sullivan","Right.","Hamid R. Moghadam","And deal with the debt separately. Think of the debt, forget about secured debt, think of debt as being on the portfolio. That's the easiest way of thinking about it. Yes, 70% of $5 billion is $3.5 billion; you got the math.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I actually got a follow-up in my question that I just asked. Do you know specifically, like, out of those properties that are generating that operating loss, 9 million square feet came out. How much of that popped into those generating income versus how much of that is either been sold or targeted to be sold? And then just as a second follow-up. In terms of the leasing activity that you did in the quarter, is 80% retention so that \u2013 there was a lot of leasing of existing expirees, but the CapEx at least per foot seemed to be higher than it has been. And so I was trying to understand the dynamics, and I don't know if that's just maybe because it's more expensive space or it\u2019s smaller space. I just didn't know what was going on to sort of dive that with the high retention.","William E. Sullivan","Michael, let me take your second question first and then we'll get back to the first one. Our turnover -- the high retention ratio is not a reflection of what percentage of the leases we did in the quarter were renewals versus new leases. In fact, the ratio went the other way. So we had more new leases this quarter than we did in the last quarter. The other thing I\u2019d just point out on turnover cost is that we had an increase in the length of term of the leases we signed this quarter. And if you look at the number in terms of a cost per square foot per term of lease, the cost actually went down a little bit. But over the -- sort of if you look at the trailing-4 quarter, we're pretty flat on turnover cost. And I don't think it's adjusted relative to the retention rate as Hamid have mentioned.","Hamid R. Moghadam","So let me try to answer your other question. We don't have the exact math you want but we can get it to you, okay. But here's the conceptual top down way of getting to the answer I think you're looking for. We already told you that the assets that we sold were more leased than the assets in the balance in the portfolio. Had we not sold them, our occupancy, as Bill said, would have been at 92.9% instead of 92.2%. So by definition, there's not a lot of sale of empty assets going on in aggregate, okay. I'm sure there are a couple of individual user sales and the like that we had in our sales. But on aggregate, it's not selling vacancy is what's going on. It's really the lease-up of the smaller buildings trending up and getting into the other bucket of stabilized or operating properties. On Gene's question, even if you put the term aside, we've been -- our TIs and commissions are $1.40 -- $1.35 to $1.40-ish per foot, for as long we can track it. And given the longer-term results and bigger commissions, put the TIs aside. Just simply the fact that you're signing longer leases, you have to pay more commission to your brokers and the improvements in smaller buildings is of higher value, a couple of pennies increases in TI cost should not surprise anyone.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of with Bank of America.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It's actually Jamie Feldman again. Two questions. One, is you had commented that you're seeing more demand from small- and mid-sized businesses. Can you provide a little more color in terms of where you're seeing that, what kind of businesses and kind of what that means for the recovery or the pace of a recovery here? And then secondly, we are expecting a drop-off January 1 based on short-term leases rolling over. Can you talk a little bit about what you expect in the warehouse markets in general, kind of in your portfolio but also just across the industry?","Eugene F. Reilly","Sure. So to your second, Jamie, and this is Gene. We will see a drop-off like we always do at the beginning of the year. So that's in the course that's baked into our forecast. As we look out into the year, our strong markets that we've talked about has been places like Los Angeles, places actually like Dallas, South Florida, New Jersey. There is no sign of that changing, so we continue to see strength there. I'm hopeful for markets like Atlanta, markets like Phoenix, who were significantly impacted by the housing downturn, the turnover, we're seeing some signs of that. Obviously, they're struggling to return. And getting back to your...","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Any particular industry, business?","Eugene F. Reilly","Yes. The small tenant space. Jamie, these spaces have been under so much pressure since the downturn, meaning in some cases, for very small tenant, and frankly we do not have a lot of very small tenants, businesses were -- they went back to the garage. So we saw huge, huge fall off. So what we're seeing with small customers is, I think, it's kind of pent-up demand, because all the small business isn't dead in this country; they're just very, very careful on expansion. And we're finally -- and this is across the board. A big segment of that population tends to be housing-related. And as you can imagine, we're really not seeing that yet. But other than that, it's really across the board. And what we're seeing is simply pent-up demand finally, finally getting unleashed a little bit. And some of these companies have probably had expansion needs for a couple of years and have just held the line.","William E. Sullivan","And Jamie, we bifurcate the portfolios in Europe and Asia. It's really more important in Europe the same way that we have it in U.S. large, medium and small spaces. The smaller buildings, overall, and therefore, smaller spaces but you've got the exact same phenomenon. Higher occupancies in the highest or the largest spaces and lower occupancies in the smaller spaces. In this quarter for the first time, Q4 -- between Q3 and Q4 showed market improvement also in the small spaces in Europe. So we're seeing exactly the same phenomena that Gene was talking about in the U.S. and Europe.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Okay. Let me just transition to some concluding remarks with that commentary. It just reminded me that a couple weeks ago, I had a meeting with the CFO of a major bank, a top 4 bank in the country. And he has just come off his earnings call and he just told me that the most dramatic thing that he had seen in his portfolio was that the lines of credit for small- and medium-sized businesses that were outstanding were finally being utilized. And people were -- and were spending that capital, had the confidence to spend that capital small- and medium-sized businesses to buy inventory and invest in facilities and the like. So I think there if you guys who look for it, there are a lot of signs for that very important part of the market coming back. And I think the employment numbers and the like give you another window into that phenomena, which I think is important. ","But let me thank you for all your questions, and I'd like to reiterate that we had a terrific second half, and we expect the momentum to continue into 2012. I think the most important takeaways from today\u2019s call are the following: first, the integration has gone extremely well and our teams are hitting on all cylinders. Second, the markets, including Europe, are doing a lot better than most people think. And third, we are across-the-board ahead of plan and very focused on our strategic priorities.

My name is Chris, and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Also note, this conference is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Tracy Ward. Tracy, you may begin.","Tracy Ward","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2019 conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations.","I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under Federal Securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market, and the industry in which Prologis operates as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings.","Additionally, our first quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures, and in accordance with Reg G, we have provided reconciliation to those measures.","This morning, we'll hear from Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover results and guidance; and then Hamid Moghadam, our Chairman and CEO, who will comment on the Company's outlook. Gary Anderson, Chris Caton, Mike Curless, Ed Nekritz, Gene Reilly, and Colleen McKeown are also here with us today.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Olinger","Thanks, Tracy. Good morning and thanks for joining our call. Let me start with a few high-level observations. Supply generally remains disciplined across our markets. User demand is exceptionally strong in the small and the medium type segments as our customers are prioritizing access to the end-consumer and labor.","Our proprietary leasing data continues to reflect healthy demand showing average gestation period and conversion rates have improved from the fourth quarter. This is notable as the first quarter is typically the softest leasing period of the year. Europe remains strong despite negative economic headlines, including the UK where our Build-to-Suit pipeline remains very active.","Now for our results. We had a great first quarter with very strong operating performance and core FFO of $0.73 per share. We leased almost 43 million square feet bringing occupancy at quarter end to 96.8%. This was down 70 basis points sequentially, consistent with our strategy to push rates and term. Rent change on roll continued to be excellent with our share at over 25% led by the U.S at over 30% and Europe over 13%. Globally our spread between in-places and markets rents remains elevated at more than 15%.Our share of cash same-store NOI growth was also strong at 5.5%. This included a benefit of about 75 basis points from positive recovery and expense timing. G&A was about $5 million higher than expected due to the stock base compensation expense resulting from the increase in our share price.","For capital deployment, we completed $157 million of dispositions and contributions. This excludes $500 million from the formation of our joint venture with Ivanhoe Cambridge in Brazil that closed in January. Starts were seasonally low at $239 million. However, we expect starts to accelerate meaningfully in the second quarter. Stabilizations were a record $691 million with an estimated margin of 30%.","We continue to access capital globally in very attractive terms. In addition to our $3.5 billion global line of credit recasts announced earlier in the quarter, we've refinanced 1.1 billion of yen debt at a weighted average interest rate of 45 basis points and a term of more than eight years.","During the quarter, we reduced our ownership in our open ended European fund from 28% to 24%, generating proceeds of $313 million. This was to accommodate our partners and to bring our ownership in line with the venture's long-term target of 15%.","Investor interest in the logistics sector continues to be very high. We have significant investment capacity with over $4.1 billion of liquidity and more than $6.5 billion from potential fund sell-downs positioning us to self fund our run rate deployment needs well unto the foreseeable future.","Now for 2019 guidance highlights, which were on in our share basis. As we mentioned last quarter, we tempered our initial 2019 guidance by $0.05 per share to account for market and political turbulence at that time. We feel better today about our outlooks and our updated guidance removes $0.03 of that conservatism. As a result, we're raising and narrowing our cash same-store NOI guidance and now expect a range of 4.25% to 5%, up almost 40 basis points at the midpoint.","We're bringing up the bottom end of our year end occupancy forecast like 50 basis points to a range of 96.5% to 97.5%. We're raising our guidance for both development starts and acquisitions by $200 million to revise midpoints of $2 billion and $600 million respectively. We're increasing the midpoint for stabilization by $100 million more than $2.1 billion. We're also raising our realized development gains by $125 million to a midpoint of $350 million.","We generated net sources of $550 million on the first quarter. And as a result, there will be an earnings drag given the timing [indiscernible] this capital. For the full year, we expect $400 million of net deployment usage, which we plan to fund with modest leverage and free cash flow. As a result of valuation gains in Europe, we now expect our net promote income for the full year at $0.14 per share, up $0.04. As a reminder, the vast majority of the promote revenue will be earned in the third quarter. Taking these changes into account, we're increasing our 2019 core FFO guidance midpoint by $0.07 to $3.23 a share and nearing the range between $3.20 and $3.26 per share. This includes $0.14 of net promote income. At the midpoint, core FFO excluding promotes is now approximately $8.5 higher than last year.","I want to point out that the value we create from our development business adds to this growth. This business is often underappreciated in valuation as we did not include realized gains in our core FFO, but it obviously adds to our cash flow growth.","Our development business has a long successful track record of significant profitability. We've completed over $12 billion of development since the merger in 2011. Over this period, our development business has delivered an average margin of approximately 30% and has created more than $3.5 billion of value, roughly $450 million [ongoing] [ph].","To sum up, we had a great quarter. We feel good about our position and are excited about our prospects for the rest of the year. And with that, I will turn it over to Hamid.","Hamid Moghadam","Thanks, Tom. You covered it well, and I don\u2019t have much to add. We had another great quarter. Our portfolio is in excellent shape and our balance sheet is stronger than ever. With this foundational work behind us, we're entering the next phase in our evolution as a customer-centric organization. Our scale and global reach enable us to address the key pain points for our customers through innovation, data analytics, technology and customers service. That\u2019s why we realigned our executive team earlier in the quarter.","In closing, our plans are clear. We'll stay vigilant in looking for shifts in market conditions and customer sentiment, and remain confident in our ability to deliver sector leading operational and financial results.","With that, I will turn it over to Chris for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] Your first question is from Jeremy Metz with BMO. Your line is now open.","Jeremy Metz","When we started the year, you had talked about how Europe rent growth could possibly outpace the strength here in the U.S. as we move further into 2019? Obviously, the first quarter look quite good in the U.S. You talked about the increased optimism in the market what you're seeing in your data and your traffic there. So do you think Europe can still get there? And maybe more broadly, can you comment on your outlook for rent growth from here for both the U.S. and abroad?","Chris Caton","It\u2019s Chris Caton. That's good question. Yes, indeed we've revised our rent growth forecast. We expect mid-to-high [4s][ph] globally. That's more than 100 basis points increase. We still expect Europe to outperform later this year, but the increase was principally driven by the U.S.","Operator","Your next question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi. Your line is now open.","Michael Bilerman","This is Michael Bilerman here with Manny. Hamid, in your comment at the end of the call, you had talked about transforming through this customer centric organization. And I\u2019m curious how far down do you want to go in that outside of just leasing space to your customers? And clearly you launched the whole data analytics platform. But could we see Prologis move into other verticals in helping your customers? I think, the past quarter Simon announced that they are launching an e-com platform where people are going to be able to buy goods online. They'll get them rather than them coming to the store. And I just don't know how far and how you are thinking strategically about the other verticals that the company can go into?","Hamid Moghadam","The way we are thinking about it today is that we are going to attack all of those things that our customers need to basically operate our properties. So these are products and services that they need to basically fully utilize our services. We are going beyond the roof and four walls in that sense. Are we going to be in those businesses ourselves? The answer is clearly no. But we will partner with vendors and other players that can help us to execute that business plan. I'll say -- I will never say, never, but right now our vision is limited to the logistics sector and the supply chain.","Operator","You next question is from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Your line is open.","Nick Yulico","Tom, help me hear just a little bit more about what drove the increase in the same-store guidance, and then on occupancy as well. You boosted that and, I know you talked about the strategy of trying to push more renewals this year and you thought that that would create a little bit more frictional, I guess, vacancy on turnover. But with the occupancy guidance going up does that mean that you're just finding tenants are willing to accept your higher renewable pricing more or so?","Tom Olinger","Yes, Nick, if you look at the increase in same-store, it can be a function of continued strong leasing activity, continued strong customer interest and demand. And occupancy did outperform. Our expectations, our retention was quite good and quite high this quarter, but we are continuing to push rents, and we will go that. Don't be surprised if you see occupancy be a little lower throughout the year. But we are going to make the right long-term decision, which is going to be pushing rents and extending term. So it's really a function of better occupancy, a little bit of rent growth, and really, really good customer dialogue and activity.","Operator","Your next question is from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Jamie Feldman","Tom, you had mentioned in your remarks about the strengths of the small and midsize segments. I just want to get your thoughts on how Prologis can attack that given the size of the company. And you are traditionally kind of larger box developments. And also, does that suggest you're seeing a slowdown at all in big box, and just thoughts on supply there going forward?","Tom Olinger","Jamie, it's important to remember when you look at our space sizes, our space sizes greater than 250,000 square feet, represents about a third of our square footage by space. So spaces under 100,000 square feet, spaces between 100,000 and 250,000 represent two-thirds. So we have a lot more much space that's infilled than not. And then when you look at that, that is on square footage. So when you look at it based on NOI, certainly, more NOI, in the 100 and 150. So we are well positioned to capture that market. And when you look at occupancy potential, occupancy is actually a little lower in the smaller and medium sizes boxes and the big boxes right now. So I think we have a -- we are well positioned to capture that opportunity.","Hamid Moghadam","Yes. Just to put some specific numbers around that. Only about 25% of our portfolio is sort of the really big box super-regional type of facilities. So the vast majority of our portfolio is actually city distribution and maybe closer end stuff. And to the extent that we have multi-market super regional distribution centers those tend to be in very high barrier to entry markets. So the commentary about small and medium size businesses was really intended to point to that strength, I wouldn't read weakness in the larger spaces, but there are some markets on the periphery, for example, the outlying corridors in Chicago where there are lot of big buildings and the market rent its softer for now until those buildings get absorbed, but that\u2019s the exception not the rule.","Operator","Your next question is from Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Craig Mailman","Just two quick ones, I guess, first, Tom, you guys raised to promote $0.04, was any of that related to the sale [indiscernible] did that trigger anything? And also, separately, you guys mentioned two thirds of the portfolio is lesser lease in the big box stuff. Are you guys getting better pricing power on the smaller spaces than the big box spaces? Is there any kind of bifurcation in the market depending on space size?","Tom Olinger","Craig, so on your first question, there was no impact on the promote increase and the fund sell down. Those are totally two separate items. Second, on the smaller spaces, under 100 to 250 we're definitely saying higher rent change on roll in that category versus the bigger box that's been something that\u2019s been pretty consistent. And I would say it's probably accelerating -- that spread is accelerating a bit.","Hamid Moghadam","Yes. The big boxes got their growth early in the recovery cycle. And if you look at those rents, there are up significantly as much as 40% or 50% during the course of the last four, five years. And now they are taking a pause and somewhat of a backseat to the medium and smaller spaces. But I think by [indiscernible] all over, all segments enjoyed really good rent growth.","Tom Olinger","These rents are going to follow replacement cost, and replacement cost on smaller spaces is significantly higher, and it's growing faster as well.","Operator","Your next question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Steve Sakwa","I wanted to ask a question about development. I guess you guys took your starts up for the year. And I\u2019m just wondering if you could sort of talk about maybe the geographic kind of focus of where you seeing the best opportunities? I guess Gene made the comment about replacement cost and that going up. And just how that\u2019s maybe impacting your going in yield, given the strong rent growth we're seeing but presumably higher replacement costs.","Hamid Moghadam","Yes, Steve, I would generally say that every deal is underwritten very specifically looking at the dynamics of that market and the competitors that are on the markets today and will be coming out of the ground down the road during the development period. So there is no general answer to that question. I mean we underwrite rents that we think we\u2019re going to get. And by and large, the experience in the last three or four years has been that we have under shot rent growth. And actual rents have been higher than what we have projected, which is why the margins are better that and obviously cap rate compression. So the smaller spaces are also more difficult to replace because they are generally areas where land constraints are greater. So anyway, Gene, do you have answer for that?","Gene Reilly","Yes. Steve, may be just a little bit of color. So the starts in the quarter were in 12 different markets. And by the way, the average building size of those starts is about 200,000 feet. And every single building we build whether it's million feet or 150,000 feet, it's sub-dividable. So we can build to the smaller customers. And if you look at our overall development program, it's 160 buildings in 51 different markets. And obviously, we are going to take through all of these, but we stay away from the markets that are getting over built. And I think we are very clear to keep you all updated where those are. And so, from a market selection perspective, we're lucky that most of the markets are very healthy right now. We feel very good about that composition.","Operator","You next question is from Blaine Heck with Wells Forgo. Your line is open.","Blaine Heck","Tom, following up on from notes, when I look at the strategic capital page in your supplemental, there are six co-investment ventures that are eligible for promote this year. Obviously, some are bigger than others, but I guess I'm just wondering how many of those are assumed to be in the money at this point? And is there a change that we could see promote guidance continue to move up as we progress through 2019?","Tom Olinger","You need to look at what's driving those different promotes. Some of the funds have annual development promotes to extend the new development. But the vast majority of the promote will be earned, we're stating the obvious where the larger AUM is. So that's going to be in our open ended funds. And that's what's going to drive the bulk of our promote revenue.","Hamid Moghadam","I would say, I can't think of any venture that is not in the money. I mean, they're all pretty much at this point in the cycle have been and will continue to be in the money more or less. But the more time passes, obviously, the more will capture that and there's going to be less of it available down the road. I mean, it will normalize down to a number, which historically has been about 25, 30 basis points of AUM. And the share that goes to the bottom line is about 60% of that. So you can think about it as sort of 15-ish basis points of AUM that would be the across the cycle type of number. I mean, not only to that, but that's what it's been over the last 10 or 15 years.","Operator","You next question is from John Guinee with Stifel. Your line is open.","John Guinee","Great. Thank you. Talking about some of your multi-level development, I think, you've got one in Seattle. Can you talk about what rents you need to hit different floor levels? And how that compares to market and whether the market is accepting of that product type? And then, segue in into the most current Amazon prototype, which, I think maybe goes up 60 or 70 feet relatively small footprint. And are you involved in those build-to-suits?","Gene Reilly","Yes, John, it's Gene. Let me start with that. So we do have a project in Seattle. It's Georgetown. And to give you a sense, market rents on the ground for older -- naturally, older product in that new location sort of range from $1 a square foot to $1.40 depending on the size of the customer. And most of that is going to be sort of in the $1.10 range per month. Our product on average is probably going to be in the $1.40, but it's going to range from sort of $1.30 to maybe over $2 a square foot for certain space in our product. So there is definitely a premium. It's 20% to 25% depending on the size of denomination. And we have done 100,000 square foot lease in this asset. And we've gotten that behind us. But one lesson we've learned about this is that there is a process that we have to go through with customers. This is new product in a new location. We need to get a premium. We think we'll get that premium, but deal gestation periods are long, and they'll continue to be long until customers are basically more accustomed to this product. With respect to the question on Amazon?","Michael Curless","John, it's Mike, with Amazon. We certainly see everything in terms of RFEs given that they're our largest customer, and we pursue those opportunities that we think are the best fits within our portfolio. But broadly, we're seeing customers like Amazon and other customers focus on e-com with some network rollouts involve a combination of large buildings and a series of a higher number of smaller buildings that are located close in to larger population centers, all of which fits really well for our portfolio.","Tom Olinger","Yes, I think that John what you were probably driving at is that the old prototype was 880 and the new prototype, it\u2019s a little bit lower -- smaller, but much smaller footprint and the reason for that is that they just would like to have more options in terms of the size of -- the parcel size that they can put the building on. So that\u2019s essentially what they are doing. They are putting the same building into clear high with more mezzanine floors et cetera, et cetera, in it, so effectively increasing the utilization of the site.","Operator","Your next question is from Eric Frankel with Green Street Advisor. Your line is open.","Eric Frankel","Just a question on same-store results. Can you clarify how much of your same-store NOI growth is attributable to free rent burn-offs? And then, just on, obviously, your investment activity in the first quarter is generally fairly light, but just noticed in your acquisition this quarter, I think your 4.3% stabilized cap rate, I think, is an all-time low. So maybe you can just talk about pricing the market for assets that you'd like to buy and the competitiveness and what you think the total return profits are? Thank you.","Tom Olinger","Eric, this is Tom. I\u2019ll the first question. On free rent, what was a little more than 50 basis points of benefit in the first quarter? And that's a pretty good run rate. It will bounce around quarter-to-quarter just based on mix and the like, but that's a pretty fair run rate. And it also would explain long-term the spread between -- why the spread between cash and GAAP should be about 50 basis points on same-store.","Hamid Moghadam","Yes. And that's why we actually focus on the GAAP number more than the cash number, but we got tired of that battle. So we now feature in the cash number more prominently, but really the right way to look at it is the way you asked, which is to factor in all the concessions. With respect to the 4.3% yield on investment this quarter, look, we're not buyers of stabilized operating properties that have been maxed out, by and large we're buying value-added place. We're buying covered land place, we're buying things that have significantly below market leases. We're trying to operate in areas where other more constrained institutional capital cannot compete. And we're not afraid to take on lease single risk or redevelopment risk or rehab risk. So a lot of that 4.3% reflects those kinds of situations. If you were to, for example, look at the NOI at market, those investments would be actually in the mid-5s to high-5s, low-6s type of numbers, but it may take us a few years to get to those numbers. We're very focused on replacement costs in those kinds of investments as well because that shows us how much upside there is in those deals.","Operator","You next question is from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vikram Malhotra","Thanks for taking the questions. Just going back to Europe, just two parts to that, given sort of the broader slowdown in several markets, can you give us a little bit more color on maybe rent growth and prospects by some of the key markets? And then, second just a bigger picture question on looking at Europe as a case study for how logistics may perform in somewhat of a slowing environment as it relates to the U.S. if the U.S. were to slow down, any thought there would be great.","Gene Reilly","Yes. Let me -- it\u2019s Gene. I'll take the high level and then Chris can probably add some color on the rent growth specifics, but basically Europe is performing very well right now, more so by far than the economic headlines. And remember that higher demand in Europe continues to be supply chain reconfiguration and monetization of that supply chain. So you're going to continue to see take-up that is in excess of economic growth. And other than some limited weaker markets, Spain is pretty weak right now, for example. And some of the CEE is fairly weak, but overall, we're seeing strength. And with respect to specifics on rent growth, maybe I'll turn it to Chris.","Chris Caton","Yes. Happy to share. So key message naturally will be the rotation of our performance from the UK that the economy where the rents result rising and that effect the basis on economy. That's led by a combination of market Germany, the Netherlands and the one region, Central Europe, both in Poland and Czech Republic are also outperforming.","Operator","Your next question is from Sarah Tan with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Sarah Tan","Thanks for taking my question. On the line for Michael Muller, quick question on -- could we get some color on the low acquisition cap rate of 4.6% [indiscernible] Where did you guys buy?","Tom Olinger","Sara, we are having a really hard time hearing you. But I think your question was what explains the low cap rates on our recent acquisitions, and you may have [Multiple Speakers] that we just talked about. Yes.","Hamid Moghadam","Yes. I'm sorry. I just explained that maybe minutes ago in response to Eric's question. But basically the 4.3% reflects a lot of unstabilized deals and covered land plays and the like that are not stabilized. If you were to look at the stabilized numbers at market, there will be significantly higher cap rates.","Tom Olinger","You know I'd add on what you just said. You are going to see this quarter-to-quarter. You're going to see cap rates and acquisition are going to be all over the map because we are buying particularly in infield side. It's almost impossible to buy a site that is leased at market because rents have been growing so quickly. So this is something probably we'll get used to it.","Chris Caton","By the way, anticipating everybody's next question, that our dispositions that are high cap rate than our acquisitions and the answer is yes, because they're value maximize. We've rolled out those leases to market, and by large their sale of non-strategic assets. So, that explains the other end of that equation.","Operator","Your next question is from Dave Rodgers with Baird. Your line is open.","Dave Rodgers","Yes. Hi, everyone. I guess maybe just a follow-up on the total sale. Thoughts about selling down in Europe maybe versus selling down in the U.S., can you give us some added color on demand for assets and kind of where you still over-own in the U.S. and your funds, especially given kind of the comments about growth you just mentioned about Europe? So maybe wrap all that up would be great.","Tom Olinger","Our challenge in selling down is that we don't need the capital. And if anything, it gets us to too lower leverage and dilutes our earnings growth. So we're now underlevered. We're just over 20% of the market value in terms of leverage, and we'd like to be higher than that. So that's why we're not out there rebalancing to the target size immediately. It's in effect, its money that's invested and we're happy with where it's invested. And once we find other deployment opportunities, for example, building up our land bank or other acquisitions, then we can in effect sell down those funds and redeploy in places where we want. In terms of our ability to sell down, both of our open end funds are -- have significant use. And in fact -- and they have significant chateau use, and we've stopped trying to raise more money for them because until we can get the capital invested, there's no point doing that. So there's plenty of money and our timing decision is more driven by our alternative investment opportunities. We are not making a market call about Europe or US or any of these things. We think there's plenty of rental growth left in both markets.","Operator","Your next question is from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Derek Johnston","Thank you. With rising equity valuation, how do you think about the possible use of equity capital given the favorable cost profile?","Tom Olinger","The most profitable use of capital for us is building out our existing land banks because the marginal return on those investments is significantly higher than anything else we can do with capital. As to whether we need more capital or more equity, we don't need more equity. So, we're not going to be raising any equity anytime soon and maybe never. And we can -- the way we look at it, in terms of our run rate development needs and capital, our ability to sell down in our funds back to targeted levels is enough to take care of 10 years of that type of deployment. So, we've got lots of money. The question is, what are the best places to deploy it?","Operator","Your next question is from Manny Korchman with Citi. Your line is open.","Manny Korchman","Hey guys. Tom, earlier in the call, I think you said that $0.03 of the guidance weight was related to being less conservative than you were, call it, 90 days ago. If we go back to your comments then, it looks like about $0.02 of that was based on same-store occupancy and $0.03 was based on deployment. Is that still the same mix or are you now essentially not just less confident or buffering but you're actually beyond where you thought things would be?","Tom Olinger","Yeah. So just a reminder, so the $0.05 originally in the January call was $0.02 of NOI, including same-store; $0.02 of more and faster deployment potential and $0.01 from just fees related to higher transaction volumes, that was our original plan, that was the delta. Today, I think the mix we've got $0.02 to go there and that mix is relatively the same, that $0.02 is probably a little back half weighted from a deployment standpoint -- from a driver standpoint, but no, we've got $0.02 to go if the market conditions hold, customer segment remains strong, build-to-suit activity is good. Then I would expect that we would see this $0.02 of upside down the road if things hold. But we'll tell you how things are, where given a few straight, this is our best guess of where we're going to land today based on what we see. And we'll update you as that view changes.","Hamid Moghadam","The converse of what just Tom said is by definition, if the mix is the same with the $0.02 that remain, the $0.03 of -- if you want to call it outperformance or reversion to original performance targets is also the same mix. So, everything is the same mix that we originally laid out for the price. It's just we haven't realized the full potential yet, it doesn't mean we won't, but we'll report on that as time goes on.","Operator","Your next question is from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Jamie Feldman","Just a quick follow up on the AI initiatives or big data initiatives. Can you provide some thoughts on what you think it might mean for margins or impact on earnings or development margins? Just some ability to quantify what this whole program might mean?","Hamid Moghadam","Well, the first -- that's a big topic. The first specific project that we're tackling is revenue management. And our expectations for the impact of revenue management is between 1% and 3%. And if you are going to put a gun to my head, I would probably say 2% to 3%, but we'll see. And we're expecting to fully roll that program up in at the beginning of the third quarter. But of course it will take a number of years before the results of that are fully come about because not all the leases are rolling over at the same time. So that's just the first project we have. Once we get that one over the finish line, we have a number of other projects that are in the docket for us to roll that out. But we're going to take our time and do the each part properly and build some confidence in the organization in terms of our ability to do that work and move on to the next one.","Operator","Your next question is from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Ki Bin Kim","Thanks. I think most of the big questions have been asked already, so just a couple of follow-ups. Going back to Europe, can you talk a little bit more about your customer behavior you're noticing there as it compares to like the U.S.? And maybe it doesn't show up in a rental rate for occupancy and maybe it's more subtle in terms of like was the language in the leases or duration or TI usage, but maybe you can provide some color on how that compares to U.S.?","And the second question, this might be a little bit early, but do you have any kind of early thoughts on micro fulfillment centers and what impact that might make on business?","Hamid Moghadam","So in Europe, look, absorption in the content was in the 68 million to 70 million square foot range a couple of years ago, and now it's in excess of 90 million square feet of absorption. So, trends are reasonably healthy in Europe. And in terms of discernible trends, I would say, there is less spec development in Europe and therefore more of our business is built-to-suit and customers. We have a better -- I mean, we have plenty of built-to-suit pipeline in the States, but it's even better in Europe, and that market tends to be less spec. So, in land, land is interesting in Europe because in couple of the big markets like Germany and France, by and large, land is controlled by the government and there are strict controls as to how much of it they release for development and usually is tied to employment generation and the like. So they're metering out of land and, if you will, the risk of overbuilding of spec is less in Europe than it is in the US for that reason.","Mike, anything else you want to add?","Michael Curless","I think more pointing out, 3PLs are very active, and probably at two times the percentage we see in the US. A lot of activity in last touch activities and we're seeing familiar players like UPS and Amazon over there making some significant structural investments, so good activity and sentiment in Europe.","Hamid Moghadam","And on e-commerce, they're ahead of us by and large, because they don't have quite the same infrastructure of existing retail in 26 different formats.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Guinee with Stifel. Your line is open.","John Guinee","Yes. One follow-up question, my recollection in the -- Tom, correct me if I got this wrong, but you raise your dividend about $0.05 a share, 10.4% late in the first quarter, was that just to meet your taxable minimum or did you pay a dividend above your taxable minimum?","Hamid Moghadam","No, John, it's the former. It's to meet our minimum. We continue quite frankly to run that type. We're retaining a lot of cash flow. If you look at our earnings over the last three years, we're going to grow north based on our new midpoint north of 9%. Our cash flow and AFFO has grown in the low double digits. Our dividend has grown 8% over that same period of time. So we clearly have capacity.","Tom Olinger","By the way, while we delevered by about 10 points.","Hamid Moghadam","Yes. So we're -- the bare minimum is the short answer.","Tom Olinger","Okay. John, you get the last word. I thank you for your attendance and look forward to seeing you next quarter if not sooner. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"17641":["Prologis, Inc.

My name is Julianne, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. Also note that this conference is being recorded. ","I'd now like to turn the call over to Tracy Ward. Tracy, you may begin.","Tracy Ward","Thanks, Julianne, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2019 conference call. The supplemental document is available on our IR website on prologis.com. I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance, and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings. ","Additionally, our fourth quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures. And in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. ","On October 27, we announced the merger between Prologis and Liberty Property Trust. Materials regarding the transaction are posted on the company's website and are available on the SEC's website. This includes the joint proxy statement containing detailed information about the transaction. ","This call will focus on our fourth quarter and full year results as well as our 2020 outlook. The company will not provide comments related to this transaction beyond what is included in our prepared remarks.","This morning, we'll hear from Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover guidance, results and the company's outlook. And also with us today for today's call are Hamid Moghadam, Gary Anderson, Chris Caton, Mike Curless, Colleen McKeown, Ed Nekritz and Gene Reilly. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom and we'll get started.","Thomas Olinger","Thank you, Tracy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. The fourth quarter closed out another excellent year. Core FFO was $0.84 per share for the quarter, $3.31 per share for the year. The full year includes a record for net promotes of $0.18 per share. Core FFO, excluding promotes, grew 10% for the year and was more than 2% above our initial guidance. As we enter 2020, market conditions are very good and we've seen no meaningful impact on our business from trade or retailer bankruptcies. Supply chains are increasingly mission critical to our customers' businesses, which is generating demand as they undergo structural changes to deliver high service levels. ","We see increased requirements across markets and product categories as more customers seek to strengthen their fulfillment capabilities. Our proprietary customer metrics reflect healthy activity, showing deal gestation and conversion rates are consistent with the third quarter. U.S. market fundamentals remain excellent. I'd like to share Prologis' assessment of supply and demand as data providers use a variety of methodologies, resulting in a range of estimates. Completions in 2019 were 275 million square feet, flat compared with 2018. Higher replacement costs, land scarcity, the elongated permitting remain governors to supply. ","Net absorption was 240 million square feet, but limited by historic low market vacancy, which ended the year at 4.6%, up 10 basis points from last quarter and 20 basis points from last year. Market rents in our U.S. portfolio increased by 8% in 2019. We have no new additions to our watch list this quarter, but here is some color on two markets that remain on the list. In Houston, while demand is strong, vacancy is 6.7% and expected to remain elevated, which will constrain near-term rent growth. We have a low role in the IPT and LPT Houston portfolios in 2020. ","Our near-term outlook for Pennsylvania is more positive, specifically core Lehigh Valley, where demand has accelerated, the supply pipeline has decreased and vacancy declined 140 basis points to 3.2% at year-end. In Europe, activity remains healthy. Rent growth on the continent in 2019 was more than 6%, the highest on record. Fundamentals in Japan continue to improve, with vacancy in Tokyo and Osaka at their lowest point in 5 years and rent growth is accelerating. ","Turning to operations for the quarter. We leased nearly 38 million square feet with an average term of 73 months. Quarter-end occupancy was flat sequentially at 96.5%, while the U.S. ticked down 30 basis points as our team is focused on pushing rate and term. Rent change on rollover was just under 30% and led by the U.S. at 34%. ","Our share of cash same-store NOI growth was 4.6% and was impacted by a 60 basis point reduction in average occupancy, again, consistent with our strategy to maximize long-term lease economics. Globally, our in-place to market rent spread increased once again and is now over 15.5% or more than $450 million in annual NOI. ","Moving to Strategic Capital. 2019 was a record-breaking year. We raised $6.5 billion of equity from 75 new and existing investors and grew our third-party AUM to $38 billion.","Our Strategic Capital business delivers a durable revenue stream with 90% of fees coming from long-term or perpetual vehicles, a critical differentiator that is often overlooked and undervalued. ","For deployment, we had a record year for development starts and stabilizations. We started $2.9 billion in new projects, 43% of which were build-to-suit. Stabilizations were $2.5 billion with an estimated margin of 37% and value creation of $911 million. Additionally, we realized $468 million in development gains in 2019. ","We continue to have significant investment capacity to self-fund our run rate deployment for the foreseeable future, with over $11 billion of liquidity and potential fund sell-downs as well as an incremental $4.5 billion of third-party investment capacity in our ventures today. ","For 2020, given we just held our Investor Forum in November, our guidance remains consistent and includes the acquisitions of IPT, which closed on January 8; and Liberty, which we expect to close on February 4. Here the highlights on an our share basis, but for complete detail, refer to Page 5 of our supplemental. Our cash same-store NOI growth range is unchanged at 4.25% to 5.25%. And I'd like to highlight 2 points. First, we're increasing our 2020 global market rent forecast by 120 basis points to 4.8%. This increase will have a minimal impact on same-store this year, given our lease expirations, but importantly, will increase our mark-to-market and future NOI growth. And second, the first quarter of 2020 will be up against a tough comp from Q1 of 2019, which benefited from an 80 basis point occupancy uplift. As a result, we expect same-store NOI growth to be lower in the first quarter, but then accelerate in the back half of the year. ","For Strategic Capital, I expect revenue, excluding promotes, of $350 million to $360 million and net promote income of $115 million. The IPT integration is largely complete and the Liberty closing preparations are on track. We are confident about hitting our Liberty synergy targets on day 1. For dispositions, we now expect a range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion, which includes approximately $1 billion of sales from the IPT and Liberty portfolios. When we announced the IPT and Liberty acquisitions, we identified approximately $3.8 billion of combined nonstrategic sale on an our share basis. Of this balance, $350 million has already closed or is under contract. And with the sale of an additional $1 billion in 2020, we will have approximately $2.4 billion of nonstrategic assets remaining at the end of the year, representing just 2% of our asset base. These are good assets. We will work through these portfolios in due time, and we don't see a need to hurry. Given our low leverage at 18%, we will dispose of the nonstrategic assets at a pace that allows us to match sales proceeds with deployment opportunities. ","For SG&A, we're forecasting a range between $275 million and $285 million, which includes $6 million to $8 million of onetime transition and wind-down cost related to Liberty. Excluding these costs, annual G&A growth at the midpoint is 2.4%, while managing 15% more real estate. ","We expect 2020 core FFO to range between $3.67 and $3.75 per share, including $0.15 of net promote income. Year-over-year growth, excluding promotes, is approximately 14% at the midpoint. To wrap up, we expect 2020 to be another exceptional year of growth. We look forward to adding Liberty's high-quality assets to our portfolio and welcoming 35 of their employees to the Prologis team. ","With that, I'll turn it back to Julianne for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Jeremy Metz, BMO.","Robert Metz","Just in terms of the rent side of the house, you obviously continue to see very healthy spreads I think you had previously indicated some of the second half uplift was going to come from the higher percentage of coastal leases rolling here in the U.S. And so as you look at the U.S. here in 2020, is there anything notable in terms of geographic breakdown or just box size breakdown that's creating maybe an outsized opportunity from a rent side and from the increase to the global mark-to-market, the 120 basis points that you mentioned, Tom, how much of that is U.S. versus EU driven?","Thomas Olinger","I'll take the second part of that, Jeremy. The increase -- the majority of the increase of the 120 basis points related to the U.S., Europe -- Continental Europe was about flat. And from a mix standpoint, nothing really stands out. I mean, things can move a little quarter-to-quarter. But given the size of our portfolio, we are very well distributed across space sizes and geographies.","Christopher Caton","Yes, in terms of markets, I mean, you guys can see this reflected in brokerage stats. The vacancy rates will give you a pretty good idea where things are healthy and things aren't. I would say we saw a bit of a slowdown in big box activity during the year in '19, but that actually picked up in that segment later in the year. So if there's anything really new it's that the demand is strengthening a little bit in big box.","Operator","Your next question comes from Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank.","Derek Johnston","Just a follow-on. Do you feel this big box demand could be due to any delta that we've seen with the Phase 1 trade deal completed or Brexit visibility? And how is 2020 leasing velocity feeling to you guys and shaping up from your vantage due to these 2 events?","Christopher Caton","Yes. I don't think that the pickup in big box has anything to do with the 2 geopolitical items you mentioned. And the year is starting off pretty good. We're early in the year, but I'd say we feel a little better than we did a quarter ago. So things that are starting off well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Mailman from KeyBanc.","Craig Mailman","Just quickly on the clarification. Tom, it sounds like nothing in the underlying assumptions changed here broadly in guidance. But does the improved market rent growth assumption change at all the accretion estimates for IPT or LPT? And then just separately, I know you guys have been aggressively trying to kind of push rents over occupancy. But as you think about kind of revenue management here, is there a lower bound to how far you'd want occupancy to fall here, just given kind of the timing it takes to recoup the lost revenues from downtime?","Thomas Olinger","Craig, I'll take the first part of that. On the accretion from higher rent growth, given the relatively low remaining role for IPT and the LPT portfolios post-acquisition, similar to the [indiscernible] portfolio, you won't see much -- it's pretty minimal impact for 2020. But again, as you point out, the important thing is that it's going to build our in-place to market and drive our same-store growth even more in the out years. And then I'll let Gene respond to revenue management.","Eugene Reilly","Yes. I'd hesitate to put a lower bound on that, but I would say that in general, this is a good opportunity for us to introduce. We've been 97% range. And as you can see, particularly in the U.S., where we have the strongest market opportunities, we're ticking down and we're very comfortable with that in the sort of mid-96% range. Historically, 95% has sort of been a rule of thumb in this business. I think that may be changing. So rather than get specific, I would just say there's some room to go. We're comfortable pushing harder.","Thomas Olinger","The markets that have higher demand as a percentage of base can tolerate a lower occupancy, because it represents fewer periods of lease up in markets that have lower percentage of growth compared to base need to be more full to have the same equivalent pricing power.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nick Yulico from Scotiabank.","Nicholas Yulico","I just wanted to hear a little bit more about kind of what drove the increase in development guidance? And I know you gave the mix on some of the spec versus build-to-suit. But how are you thinking about increasing development right now? And particularly, which markets do you think it's really attractive?","Eugene Reilly","Yes. So let me start with that. So if you look at the health in the markets, as defined by vacancy rates, as I said earlier, that's a good start. We want to focus on markets that are constrained more in the U.S., that's New Jersey, that's Southern California, that's the Bay Area. But it also includes some submarkets, places like Dallas or Chicago. In Continental Europe, there are several places we'd like to be doing more development. But there, you're seeing constraints on supply more significant than really anywhere else in the world.","Thomas Olinger","The reason the number for starts went up is that we have more visibility into this year as we get closer to this year. We were a couple of months earlier. So some of the things that we weren't sure were going to happen happened in a positive way. So the numbers are up. But just like -- for many years, I've commented on acquisition volume being highly predictable. The spec portion of the development volume is -- also has some volatility associated with it. We are not compelled to start spec development, and those are really dependent on minute-by-minute market conditions and the supply-demand dynamics in those markets. The build-to-suits, we'll build, because we're pretty sure of the demand obviously there. But 60% of the spark -- starts is spec. And if the market is better, then we'll do more. And if the market is not as good, we'll do less.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jamie Feldman from Bank of America Securities.","James Feldman","I was hoping you could take kind of a big picture view or provide a big picture view. Maybe reading from the holiday season and just kind of the conversations you're having with tenants, where does it seem like people still need to get their supply chains right, where does it seem like there's still things that aren't going so well. Just as we've been at this for several years now, just how should people think about the runway ahead?","Eugene Reilly","Well, retail sales and the online category grew at 18%. And in the bricks-and-mortar category, it's shrunk in real terms. So that tells you where kind of demand is on the margin, and that demand has gone up. I mean, Amazon is a big chunk of it, and they are probably more active every year. Certainly, going forward, we see them being more active than before. But they're 40-some percent of the market. The other people are catching up, and we are seeing a broadening of demand for e-commerce facilities as we move further into this category. So e-commerce is very strong. And I would say on the margin, the autos are probably a little weaker than they've been historically, and that's sort of a global thing. And probably housing is likely to be stronger than -- on the margin than we saw last year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust.","Ki Bin Kim","So 2019 was the first year where national supply of 1.6% growth outstripped demand of about 1.1%. And there's probably a good degree of nuance in those statistics. For example, in LA, it probably doesn't contribute much to the national demand growth numbers, because you can't absorb what's not available. So when you kind of dig into the numbers, what do you think PLD's exposure is to unfavorable markets where real supply is kind of eating away at the demand?","Thomas Olinger","Well, I mean, if you take our U.S. markets that are in the soft side, I would say, Atlanta, Houston and Pennsylvania would be the 3 markets. Dallas has come off the list. Dallas has just had an incredible run in terms of demand, much better than we expected. And those markets -- those 3 markets represent -- the leasing that remains to be done in those markets this year is about 14% of our total leasing. And once you add IPT and LPT, interestingly, that number goes down to 12% of the remaining leasing that we have to do this year. And the global portfolio also is 12%. So there is no overconcentration, if you will, in the weaker markets. They're exactly in line with our overall markets and they're actually -- -- the percentage is coming down as a result of these two acquisitions. What did I -- I meant Central Valley -- Central PA, if I said something different. These guys are giving me handslick room, so. Anyway, so the weaker markets are proportional to all our other leasing, and we're basically not concerned about it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Blaine Heck from Wells Fargo.","Blaine Heck","Maybe I can go at the development starts guidance question from a different angle. 2019 starts came in at $2.9 billion at your share, which was over $1 billion more than you had guided to at the beginning of 2019. Yet for 2020 and despite the IPT and LPT acquisitions, you're looking at start guidance that's $2.2 billion at your share. So I guess, I'm just wondering how much conservatism is built into that start number? And what are the chances we could end up closer to $3 billion again this year?","Thomas Olinger","That would be a good question for you to ask us next year, just like you pointed out this year. I don't know. I mean we don't feel compelled to do any development other than places where there's customer demand. And I think to try to predict something is actually irresponsible, because it then gets the organization to drive to a number, and we don't need to drive to a number. I mean that -- nobody gets paid for driving to a number or anything like that. We'd all get paid as the company does well, and we'll do whatever we can to make sure that the markets stay in balance and that our developments lease up appropriately and that we have good margins. So it's all dependent. ","Remember, a year ago, when we were sitting right here, we had just seen the stock market decline significantly. We had ratcheted down our business plan. And the world just looked very different than the way it ended up playing out. And by the way, we weren't the only people who were conservative in our outlook. That was the responsible thing to do. But as the year unfolded and we saw demand being better, we obviously scaled up our activity. We have the land to do it. We have the talent to do it. But we don't feel compelled to do it unless there's demand.","Christopher Caton","We'll always tell you exactly what we think at that moment in time. But particularly with spec development, we will ratchet that down or up as the market tells us. And remember, our development program, it's 200 -- roughly speaking 200 bets across 65 different markets. So it's big and it's going to be dynamic over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tom Catherwood from BTIG.","William Catherwood","Following up on Blaine's question on the developments, obviously, a huge start quarter in the fourth quarter. And back at the Investor Day, Hamid, you had mentioned how the development time line has extended from 9 to 12 months to kind of 18 months plus. Just given the complexity, due to that and the starts, does that mean you need to carry more land on your books to continue to feed the development pipeline? And if that's the case, kind of where are you looking from a complexity standpoint or a risk standpoint as far as kind of how far out you're willing to go to take risk on land right now?","Hamid Moghadam","Yes. If that were -- Tom, if that were the only variable, that would be the right conclusion to draw. But remember, there are 2 other variables that are going on. One is that we're generally trying to reduced lands as a percentage of our total assets around the company. We're almost to our goal, not quite. And there are actually some markets where we're thin on land and other markets where we're balanced. So that's one headwind going the other way. And also, we're controlling a lot of land via auctions and other things that don't show up on the balance sheet. So that's how we're kind of dealing with the need for more land without taking on more balance sheet exposure. Mike, do you want to say anything about that -- any more about that?","Michael Curless","Yes. In terms of our land exposure, I think we're in pretty good shape. We managed that very effectively last year. And I think we'll be picking land in our strategic spots going forward in the major markets where our customers are migrating to. And I think we're in good shape there.","Hamid Moghadam","And by the way, the extension in the development -- I'm sorry, the expansion in the development cycle is mostly on the front end and on the entitlement side. I mean it's not taking us any longer to physically build buildings. And certainly, our lease-up assumptions to get them stabilized has not been extended. So really it's on the front end on the entitlement.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Rodgers from Baird.","David Rodgers","Tom, you did a good job at the beginning of the call, I think, laying out some of the supply-demand fundamentals that you guys track, and we all use different numbers. But I think one of the things that had been a little concerning was just kind of no matter what source you use, kind of net absorption before the impact of construction has been kind of trailing a little bit lower. I guess maybe throw a couple of questions at that one. Are you guys seeing that as well? And can you kind of denote where that's coming from, maybe outside of a global auto? And then, two, maybe, Hamid, on your comment about Amazon being 40% of the market, can you just clarify, was that 40% of e-commerce or the embedded base and just kind of what you're getting out of that comment?","Eugene Reilly","Yes, they're actually 45% of e-commerce sales, I think, is the latest number. I might be a point or 2 off, but it's as a percentage of e-commerce. And I think e-commerce is like 12% of the overall market. So they're like 4.5% of overall retail sales. I think this came up earlier, but maybe I can emphasize it. The demand is not uniform around the country. And some of the markets where there is exceptional demand, the supply is just so tight that a lot of that demand just doesn't show up. I don't know what that number is, but I can tell you it's a positive number. And God, after 10 years of supply falling short of demand, we've all been predicting this year where supply exceeds demand for the last 5 years, and we've got it now. So -- but -- I mean, it's a big market, it's 15 billion square feet of base, and we've got 30 million feet of difference between supply and demand. And that doesn't even take into account all the real estate -- all the industrial real estate that's being scraped for higher and better uses and is becoming obsolete. So I'm not losing any sleep over that. Chris, do you have...","Christopher Caton","Just on the specific numbers, we have net absorption of 240 million in 2019. The 4-year average is 250 million square feet. So pretty consistent with the 4-year average, and really at work there is the 4.6% vacancy rate that just made it more difficult to absorb stock. And you saw some of that growth more in price than in net absorption, so rents were up 7%, 8% in the U.S. last year. When we look at the demand trends late in the year, as Gene discussed, whether it's really good momentum in the fourth quarter or whether it's our proprietary indicators, like the IBI, which is at 61, makes us feel like growth will improve in 2020.","Eugene Reilly","Yes, the picture going into 2019 was much more negative than -- I mean -- or less positive. I mean it was positive, but it was less positive than it is today. Market feels a lot better right now than it did on the call a year ago.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Green from Evercore.","Jason Green","Just a question on development yields. In total, you're developing assets now to 120 basis point spread per this supplemental. I guess at what point do spreads become too narrow to continue developing assets?","Hamid Moghadam","When we stop developing. Chicken or the egg? No, I'm not -- I mean 120 basis points is a pretty healthy margin when cap rates are as low as they are. But we're really margin focused. And if we can't really get going in a pretty, say, 15% on spec and maybe low teens on build-to-suit, we just won't do it. I guess, we'll do a build-to-suit at around a 10% margin for a great tenant with a great credit that we can easily do and sell or something like that. But I mean, that's the range of it. The only problem is, in the last however many years, 10 years, we've had double or triple those margins. So someday, we'll have lower than those margins, for sure. The market goes through cycles. But there's definitely an arrow up on margins from where we pro forma these deals. And I would say, 9 out of 10 deals at least, maybe even more, maybe 19 out of 20 of them that we do a recap on, we do a recap on every deal that we do when it's stabilized and we look at what it costs, what the yields were and sort of grade our performance on that. I would say there are very few of them that have any reds on them. I mean all of them have big green numbers on them. So, so far so good, and I expect that to continue for at least the foreseeable future.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eric Frankel from Green Street Advisors.","Eric Frankel","I sincerely apologize for asking another development question. But can you -- this is based on your 4Q starts and a little bit higher development volume in '20. Can you talk about whether you think that overall supply is bound to increase more than it has in the last couple of years? And how does that reflect on market rent growth generally? And then second -- and it certainly seems like you guys are a lot more active in buying assets of different types in the New York City boroughs. But we also noted that Walmart.com -- Walmart is not going to be using that Bronx facility you guys acquired a couple of years ago and leased to them. So maybe you could just talk about your experiences there?","Christopher Caton","Yes. I think the experience in the Bronx has nothing to do with the real estate, it has to do with, well, Walmart's decision not to pursue a strategy that they were going to pursue. We actually think the re-leasing market for that building is an upside from where that building is leased. So -- and obviously, we have Walmart credit on it. So we're not -- I don't think it means anything other than a change in strategy of the company. And with respect to the supply picture, I think we're feeling better about supply right now than we did a quarter or 2 ago. Gene, what do you think?","Eugene Reilly","Yes. I think in -- for sure, a quarter ago, we felt a little bit worse about supply. And Eric, if you look at the last couple of years, what's happened is that the development engine in the U.S., the industry wasn't able to hit Chris' estimate for supply. So I expect that next year, it's the same thing. And it's -- the explanation is pretty simple. It is very difficult and more difficult every day to develop the space. So I would probably say there is a down arrow.","Christopher Caton","Look, If you -- we're all looking for things to worry about. I would be more worried about a recession because of something like totally out of left field like this virus thing or something globally that can affect something more on the demand side than on the supply side. Supply may be 10 million, 20 million, 30 million feet one way or another. But that, at the end of the day, doesn't move the vacancy rate or the pricing power. But if demand falls off the clip because of some unknown thing or war or some bad thing like that, that is the thing that I worry more about. Supply, one way or another, it's going to be pretty close to what we think. Certainly, a year out, you have pretty good visibility into what supply is, because 2\/3, maybe 3\/4 of stuff that's going to be supply should be under construction right now. So we know kind of what that number is. So really the wiggle room is on the last 25%, 30% of supply.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Guinee from Stifel.","John Guinee","Great. Very, very impressive 14% year-over-year growth, but probably even more impressive is issuing 110 million shares that looks like about 25x forward multiple and a 3.6 implied cap. If you're at liberty to talk about it, can you talk about -- because of FAS 141 accounting, you're probably bringing both the IPT and the Liberty portfolio and at a much higher GAAP cap rate than a cash cap rate. Are you at liberty to talk about the GAAP cap rate that these assets are coming in and also your thoughts on FAD growth and dividend growth for 2020?","Eugene Reilly","Yes. Can't talk about the first component, but you can guestimate it pretty well. I mean average lease is 6 years and an average built-in rent growth in these leases is, call it, 3%. So you can kind of do the math, 3 years of 3%, that's how much the gap is higher than the -- by the way, the reason I'm not going to get in trouble, because I don't actually know what the number is. But the math on it should be pretty damn close to my guestimate.","Thomas Olinger","And John, I'll point you back to the presentation we gave when we announced the transaction. We had $25 million in fair value lease adjustments, but that also includes straight-line rent adjustments. And that's a net number, because you back out the straight-line rent that's embedded in the IPT and Liberty portfolios, but more to come on that. ","To your point about FAD ultimately getting to the dividend, as we've said in the past, we -- our dividend levels are going to need to increase pretty consistently with what you see our FAD and AFFO growth, because we're -- we'll pay out as close as we can to the minimum threshold at which -- where we're staying. So that's a consistent theme you're seeing here.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Mueller from JP Morgan.","Michael Mueller","You talked about, I think, a pickup in demand that you were seeing in Lehigh Valley. I was just wondering if you can give us a little more color on what you see driving that?","Eugene Reilly","Yes. Your question was a little bit low, but I think your question is about recent activity in Lehigh Valley. And Lehigh Valley has, over the past year, experienced a little bit overbuilding, but news in the last 6 months is pretty good. So demand there is strong. I would say that is contrasted with Central Pennsylvania, where demand is still a little bit weak right now.","Christopher Caton","Yes, Gene, I think driving that is a combination of both general supply chain modernization. So we see some customers who are feeding their store network and also a fair amount of e-commerce also wanting to serve the greater region and in particular New York.","Hamid Moghadam","And probably record low vacancy in New Jersey.","Eugene Reilly","Yes. Southern New Jersey, there's virtually no product. ","Christopher Caton","So a key message there would be the prioritization of proximity and the proximity of core Lehigh Valley to New Jersey and in particular New York. That's driving that demand.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Frankel from Green Street Advisors.","Eric Frankel","I guess, I'd -- I guess I also have a few more thoughts from earnings this quarter. But one quick question, housekeeping item. Of the $1 billion of sales from IPT and Liberty, how much of that is office? And then second, I think Walmart, just speaking to them, they debut an automation product they're going to be using in their stores to distribute product just directly to consumers via pickup. Can you talk about automation and how that's impacting supply chains? Obviously, Amazon is always trying to reinvent how they're utilizing the fulfillment centers. And maybe you could touch upon how your other customers are thinking about it.","Eugene Reilly","Well, I'm going to pitch this to Chris, because he spent a lot of time together with Will O'Donnell on the topic of automation and its impact generally on logistics demand. And one of these days, you may see a paper coming out on that, that's pretty extensive and detailed. But we don't think that it is a -- we think automation is a way of making employees more productive, because it's so hard to get employees to do this kind of work.","I mean that's really the impetus for automation. And the downside of automation is that unless you have very standardized products, the state of the industry is not such that you can have special purpose automation or general purpose automation installed that can handle a lot of different goods, sizes, shapes, et cetera, et cetera. We're marching in that direction, but we're quite some time away. ","And also what we're hearing from our customers -- the majority of our customers, particularly the three PLs is that the capital needs of automation are just way beyond their ability to be able to do that. So -- and in order to implement automation, they need to have longer-term contracts with their customers and be able to amortize those investments over a longer period of time. Chris?","Christopher Caton","Yes, spot on. Underlying the variety of operations that are going in our customer space, and that translates to two things. One is an adoption rate of automation within logistics facility that is low and rising at a moderate pace; and two, the ROIs on some of these investments are still pretty low, given the complexity and the complex nature. Another point I'd make relates to productivity-enhancing equipment. That's what this really is. That's been around for a long time, whether you look back 40 years at forklifts. And so we've seen a constant effort to improve employee productivity within our facilities, and this is no different. As it relates to specific reference you make, kind of in-store automation as well, something we have seen in the marketplace are more requirements not just to serve e-com, but also to serve store fleets that are needing to handle this \"buy online and pick up in store\". There's more activity to also think about the existing supply chains to support that activity in store.","Thomas Olinger","Eric, I'll respond to your first question relative to the split out of the $1 billion in sales for IPT and LPT. I would say this, it's going to be fluid, but the office component that remains is quite small. But as we said, we're going to match fund disposition proceeds with opportunities to redeploy them. And so I would say it would be fluid, but again, the office is a small piece that's left out of that.","Eugene Reilly","Yes, the non-Comcast office, I would expect to -- we're through that. So really office comes down to Comcast. And that is, as you know, pretty liquid, pretty straightforward type of position. And it's only a matter of what's the ideal time to do that and the dynamics with the customer, which is a very important customer anyway, over time what happens. But that's kind of -- there's not a lot of wiggle room on the economics of that deal. We know it's 100% leased, and we know what the economics are. So office is gone. We're not in a big hurry on the industrial. We've just kind of match funded. As -- I mean we're 18% leased -- 18% levered. So why would we want to do more than match funds? We're not in a hurry. It's a good market.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley.","Vikram Malhotra","Two quick ones. On Slide 15 of the slide deck, you gave the occupancy broken out by its size. Could you give us the rent spreads using that same breakout?","Thomas Olinger","Yes, Vikram, this is Tom. The rent spreads were pretty consistent this quarter across all the different size categories. I think the small space under 100 probably picked up a little bit, a little higher than normal, but this quarter, very consistent across all 3 sizes.","Eugene Reilly","I would say small space is recovered a bit -- small space was way ahead of big space, maybe a year, 1.5 years ago. Then it went the other way and softened, and now it's coming back a little bit. Most recently, the big space is recovering more in the last couple of quarters. So they're all even, but they're coming to even from different directions.","Operator","Your next question comes from Manny Korchman from Citi.","Michael Bilerman","It's Michael Bilerman here with Manny. Hamid, I had a question for you just sort of about the sort of acquisition market overall. And we clearly know there's an insatiable desire by private capital to put capital to work really on a global basis in industrial, right? It's a favorite asset class, has been that way for the last few years. And I wanted to get your sort of thoughts on Sleath's from SEGRO's comment that he made earlier this year that the market is paying full price even for assets with works on them and that their focus is on development and granted it was self-serving. But you made a comment about the acquisition market. And I sort of wanted to get your feel about what you see on a global basis about how investors are pricing assets and differentiating assets and how that may play into your disposition plans as well?","Hamid Moghadam","Yes. I mean we've basically been saying the same thing, more or less, with a slightly different accent. I mean the acquisition market in Europe, which is, remember, that's what they're talking about, is pretty expensive. And if you have a good land bank and you are an active developer, like they are and we are, obviously the best use of capital is to put your land bank to work and the incremental returns on those investments are quite high. But there are still opportunities here and there that are priced below replacement cost. For example, short-term income in Europe is discounted. So if you have a building that has a two year lease on it or something, maybe a perfectly good building, but you could buy that below replacement cost, that kind of thing we'd be interested in. But you can buy $1 billion of it. I mean, I don't know where you would go to buy $1 billion of that kind of stuff in Europe. The rest of the world is a different story. I mean there are places where -- I mean like in Mexico, if an acquisition opportunity were to come up, cap rates, for the very best product, are around 7, but you can buy some things that are 8 or 9. And if you look at their treasuries, the goal on their treasuries, there's a big spread there in that market. So the global picture is a little different, but I would generally agree with their commentary for Europe. Gene?","Eugene Reilly","Yes, I wouldn't add much to that. And Europe, while expensive on a relative basis, look at risk-free yields in Europe. I mean, you get negative rates and the best economies, there's got to be four countries in negative rates. So I'm not frankly sure that cap rate environment today in Europe is all that expensive.","Hamid Moghadam","The other thing I would say about Europe, Europe has -- it will be interesting to do the math on this. We haven't, but this is a guess. There are a lot of institutional investors in Europe that are focused in Europe, and the size of the industrial asset class in Europe, it's still a relatively new industry and institutional quality products proportionately is a lot smaller than it is in the U.S. So you've got a lot of institutional private capital focused on a market with fewer opportunities. And I think that's pushing on yields in Europe pretty hard. So development is preferred to acquisitions in all these markets anyway. ","I think that was the last question.

We operate only in the best markets serving global trade and regional distribution.","The benefits of the strategy were evident in the following operating metrics. Our same-store NOI growth reached its highest level since the downturn. We have had six consecutive quarters of positive rent growth on rollover. Small unit leasing is up in the U.S. and we are seeing a surge in our value-added conversion business. On the capital deployment front, we started new developments with higher than average margins. We have a growing pipeline of opportunities and a land bank well positioned to serve the needs of our customers.","Turning to capital flows, we continue to see strong institutional interest for industrial real estate. As a result, cap rates continued to compress as evidenced in recent portfolio transactions. The impact of declining cap rates on our NAV is significant. In fact, we have seen cap rates compress about 25 basis points since our investor forum last September. This translates to more than $2 per share of NAV. The improving markets are also having a positive impact on our value-added conversion activity. This business is unique to several of our key markets that are subject to strong urbanization pressure. We believe our value-added conversion business is poised to produce meaningful gains and NAV appreciation as we convert some of our industrial properties to higher and better uses, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, which is benefiting from rapid growth of the technology sector.","Now, let\u2019s turn to our co-investment activity, which is hitting on all cylinders. During the quarter, we recognized a significant promote for USLF. And we completed our IPO in Mexico. The FIBRA simplifies our structure and positions us for long-term growth in this important region. With this offering, perpetual life vehicles now account for about 95% of our third-party assets under management. We also expanded our relationship with our partner in China and raised new capital for open-ended funds in the U.S. and Europe. As our capital activity now includes both public and private sources, on a go forward basis, we will refer to this business as strategic capital to better describe the focus of these investment vehicles on specific segments of our business.","Let me conclude my comments with a few observations on the current market conditions. In the U.S. we see our customers being more decisive and proactive to commit to space in anticipation of growth, really for the first time since the global financial crisis. This demand stems from growing inventories, up 5% from last year in real terms and 3% higher than the prior peak. We are in the 17th consecutive quarter of absorption in excess of supply for industrial space. As a result this excess demand of vacancy continues to trend lower and at 6.8% is now the lowest level in 15 years.","In Europe leasing remains very strong in the UK, Germany, Netherlands and the Nordic region, while Southern Europe and a few markets in Central and Eastern Europe continued to lag, all our European markets have now turned the corner. In Japan, China, Brazil and Mexico we continued to see excellent leasing momentum. This backdrop supports our plans for growth as our development markets by and large have remained disciplined around margins and risk levels.","To sum it all up, the second quarter was one of our best ever. As we look forward, we believe the combination of rental growth, the profitable development of our land bank and the scaling of our platform set us well \u2013 it set us up well for an extended period of above average earnings growth.","With that I will turn it over to Tom.","Tom Olinger - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks Hamid. I will start with our results for the second quarter. Core FFO was $0.48 per share. Quarter end occupancy was 94.6%, up 90 basis points year-over-year. GAAP rent change on rollover was 6.6% led by the U.S. at 12.1%. Cash rent change on rollover was a positive 0.6%. GAAP same store NOI increased (3 points) in the quarter the majority of the increase was driven by occupancy and rent growth. Looking further into this metric, average occupancy was up 110 basis points versus the prior period, while 23% of our leases in the same store pool rolled over last four quarters at an average increase of 6%. We did benefit from some non-recurring items, mainly lower expenses which had a positive impact of about 70 basis points on our same store results for the quarter. On an adjusted cash basis same store NOI grew 5.3%.","Turning to capital deployment during the quarter, we continued to see development margins well above our historical average. Development stabilizations were $371 million with an estimated margin of 23%. We generated $82 million of our share value creation or about $0.16 a share. Development starts were $439 million with an estimated margin of 19%. We invested $412 million in building acquisitions and in our co-investment ventures. Contributions were $26 million and non-strategic building dispositions were $520 million totaling $546 million or $443 million our share at a weighted average stabilized cap rate of 6.6%.","As Hamid mentioned we closed our IPO in Mexico this quarter. The formation of FIBRA Prologis was not reflected as the contribution given our underlying ownership interest in those assets remained unchanged. We received equity certificates in exchange for our portion of the Mexican operating assets and hold a 45% ownership stake in FIBRA. This new structure allowed us to reduce the number ventures in Mexico with a permanent vehicle resulting in a simplified structure and lower G&A.","Moving to strategic capital, operating income was $48 million in the quarter, which includes $25 million of promote income from our targeted U.S. Logistics Fund. Switching gears to capital markets, we are taking every opportunity to secure long-term capital at today\u2019s costs to enhance both composition of our debt portfolio and liquidity. In the second quarter we completed $3.6 billion of financings. We used the majority of the debt proceeds to retire over $1 billion of secured and unsecured debt in the second quarter and an additional $466 million in this month. The debt retirement was at near zero economic cost on an MPV basis. We now have no meaningful debt maturities until 2017.","The cumulative effect of our debt activity over the past 12 months has had a very meaningful impact on our balance sheet. We lowered the interest rate on our bonds by 160 basis points to 4%. We added 3.1 years to the average term of our bonds and 2.3 years to the overall debt stack and shifted U.S. dollar denominated unsecured debt to euro and yen increasing our U.S. dollar net equity to 85%. We accomplished of all this while building over $3 billion of liquidity.","Let\u2019s turn to guidance for 2014. We are nearing the range for year end occupancy to between 95.2% and 95.8% and GAAP same-store NOI growth to between 3.25% and 3.75%. On net G&A, we narrowed the range to between $238 million to $243 million. Looking forward, we believe we can grow AUM with little if any incremental G&A. For capital deployment, we are taking our guidance up to reflect the current pipeline of opportunities we are seeing across our geographies. We are increasing development starts to between $2 billion and $2.3 billion, with 85% of our share and increasing building acquisitions to $1.3 billion to $1.6 billion with 45% of our share. We are lowering contribution guidance to between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, with 55% our share primarily due to timing. For dispositions, we are increasing guidance to $1.3 billion to $1.6 billion with 90% our share.","From a funding perspective, we have ample liquidity to fund our incremental net deployment. For strategic capital guidance, we are increasing the revenue range to $220 million to $225 million and expenses to $100 million and $105 million generating an operating margin of over 50%. These increases are results of the higher promote income and fees from the FIBRA.","I want to point out that strategic capital revenue in the third quarter will decrease due to the impact of the USLF promote in the second quarter. We expect our next promote to be in 2015. For FX, we are maintaining our assumptions for the euro at 1.35 and the yen at 105 for the second half of the year. We expect our U.S. dollar net equity to further improve and reach almost 90% by year end. Putting this all together, we are exceeding our forecast on all fronts. And as a result, we are raising our full year core FFO to range between a $$1.82 and $1.86 per share. This represents an increase of $0.05 at the midpoint and year-over-year growth in core FFO of 11.5% and translates to full core AFFO growth in the high-teens. The recent credit rating upgrades from Moody\u2019s and S&P are further affirmation of our earnings trajectory and operational outlook. Importantly, we are well on our way to building one of the strongest balance sheets in the REIT sector.","In closing, we had great results for the second quarter with each of our business lines outperforming. Looking forward, we expect core earnings growth to accelerate as both rents and occupancies continue to increase and to properly capitalize on deployment opportunities across the globe.","With that, I will turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with ISI Group. Your line is open.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group","Thanks. Good morning out there. I guess kind of a two-parter, but could you maybe just expand a little bit more on the development starts, it seems like the business is very back-end loaded. It sounds like you are pretty confident about that. How should we sort of think about the starts by quarter? And then I guess I was just wondering if you could get a little more color on the decline in the contributions and you say it\u2019s timing related Tom, but what sort of can you tell us what\u2019s going on there?","Tom Olinger","Yes. I will take the second part of the question first. So, it\u2019s just due to timing of contributions, primarily in Europe that are going to move into the first quarter for a variety of reasons. It has nothing to do with the underlying performance of those assets. It\u2019s just the timing of when those assets will move off our balance sheet.","Mike Curless","And Steve, it\u2019s Mike Curless. Relative to the development volume, we had a late first quarter, but as expected and that was due to seasonality and mix primarily, but in the second quarter we had a substantial ramp up and we expect that for the balance of the year. We have increased our guidance range to over $2 billion. And we are highly confident in that when you consider 95% of the remaining work to do is identified and I contrast that with this time last year, we were 80% on that number. We think there is some bias to the upside on U.S. build-to-suit some activity in China. And in terms of the complexity or complexion of that work we will see over the year, 50% should take place in the Americas, 30% in Asia, and call it 20% in Europe and at the end of the day about 25% in build-to-suit. So, we are very comfortable with not only the length of our prospect list, but more importantly the strength of that prospect list.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Dave Rodgers - Robert W. Baird","Yes. Good morning out there. I did want to follow up on two things. I guess first talk a little bit about the investment in the NAIF fund in the U.S. Was that I guess in taking out an existing shareholder, was that just net growth capital, talk about your feeling about putting more money into the U.S.?","Hamid Moghadam","We like the values. It\u2019s real estate we obviously know really well. And I think the ability to deploy capital in proprietary ways in portfolios that we know really well is exactly what we should be doing. We have done it over the years and there was an opportunity to do some more of it this quarter, yes. And by definition since the fund has not been raising new capital for growth, the only way that can take place in the particular fund is to buy out other investors. That may want to re-deploy their capital.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Brendan Maiorana from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities","Thanks. Good morning. I am wondered if you guys could comment on the outlook for occupancy and compare that to what you are trying to do with rent spreads, it looks like on the occupancy increase at the midpoint of your guidance by year end is up about 100 basis points. But I think the expectation was that rent growth would start to materialize more meaningfully as we move throughout the year. So, do you still expect that rent spreads should move higher even though occupancy, it sounds like you expect to be significantly higher by year end as well?","Gene Reilly","Yes, Brendan, it\u2019s Gene. I will start with that and Gary can comment the rest with geographies, but we do absolutely expect that rent spreads will continue to grow in the America. So, we are at 11.3%. And if you look over the past five quarters, we have grown that from 2% or 3% and at a pretty straight line up to that level. So, we think that will continue. We think in the U.S. we will have a chance for somewhat higher occupancies, but frankly, we have the teams now really focus on rent growth. So, those are the dynamics that play really throughout the Americas, including Brazil and Mexico. And I will turn it to Gary.","Gary Anderson","Yes. So, Brendan, in Asia as you know we have been bouncing around between 95% and 96%. And that\u2019s right where we want to be. We are pushing rents in both Japan and China. And we expect that to continue through the balance of the year. If you look at Europe, we grew occupancies 30 basis points and we would expect to grow occupancies over the course of the year. Europe is a little bit of a mixed back as we have talked about before as Hamid said on the opener. UK is strong. Northern Europe is strong. Central and Eastern Europe and Southern Europe are lagging. So, in terms of rents spreads, we are able to push rents in those two key geographies and in the others we are not. If you look at this quarter in particular, about 75% of our leasing in Europe was in Central and Eastern Europe and Southern Europe. So, not an opportunity to push rents there. And as you go forward at least for the next two quarters, you see sort of about the same trend. So, we are not expecting any real rent growth out of Europe, but we will be getting it out of the Americas as Gene mentioned out of Asia.","Tom Olinger","Yes. The only thing I would add to what Gary said in Europe is that cap rates in Europe have compressed a lot faster than we thought when we put together our long-term rent forecast and obviously, declining cap rates are a headwind for rent growth. So, I would say rent growth in Europe is probably delayed by some period, maybe six months, maybe a year, but boy, cap rates have come in over 100 basis points in most of the continental market. So, I think it\u2019s impact on NAV would be very positive.","Gary Anderson","Yes. And Brendan, just one other thing as Hamid pointed out at the beginning of the call. We think that all of the markets in Europe have bottomed and have turned in the right direction. And I think that Europe will actually be a tailwind for us going into and through 2015.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citi. Your line is open.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","Yes. Good morning out there. So, I had a question in terms of the North American fund buy-in. If you take your $275 million of equity growth setup for the 19% stake and adding the debts, you get to a gross book value just under $2.6 billion, which would be about 6.5% effective cap rate on that capital that you put in. So, one I just wanted to understand, how does that 6.5% compared to what the NAV of the fund is in terms of this proprietary book that you talked about. My sense is it would be lower, but I wanted to sort to get, sort of your view, number one? And number two, how does that $275 million of equity, $480 gross in terms of the assumption of debt factor into the capital deployment on Slide 8. Is that in there or not? Thank you.","Hamid Moghadam","I will let Tom answer the latter part of your question, but 6.5%, your math is pretty close. It\u2019s in that range, plus or minus some basis points. We acquired it at stated NAV, which is determined by third-party appraisers on a regular basis. But we see value in that NAV, as you know appraisals can lag, they can lead, but we know the portfolio well, you got to know what the mix of the assets is, which you don\u2019t as well as we do. And we think that represents really good value and very inexpensive for business for us to pickup, because we are managing it anyway. So, we like those kinds of deals and we look forward to doing more of those kinds of deals at the right points in the cycle. Tom, do you?","Tom Olinger","So, Michael that investment was not reflected in our acquisition guidance. So, it\u2019s not reflected as part of the number shown on Page 8 incremental to that.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley","Hi guys. Good morning. It looks like you expect stabilized development deals to even out globally by 2015 and beyond settling in around 7% versus the range by region we see today. That could suggest either you are not sure, so you just estimate everything will come out around the same or in your case I am guessing there is some good analysis behind it. So, how confident are you that the development yields will increase slightly in the Americas and Asia while coming down by a 1% or so in Europe.","Hamid Moghadam","I am not sure that\u2019s the math, we don\u2019t do it that way, put it this way. The way we do our development forecasting is that we have some bottom line numbers, bottoms up numbers from each region in terms of their pipeline, which is pretty visible at this point, certainly for the balance of this year and into next year. And we kind of know the economics of those deals plus or minus a little bit than we crank them in. So, it really varies depending on what the land is on the books for and whether that land was impaired, whether that land was acquired recently or a long time ago. So, it\u2019s not as simple as just taking a region of the world and applying a yield to it and mixing it up. And really you need to get more granular than that and it\u2019s pretty impossible for you guys to do that based on the information that there is out there.","Tom Olinger","And what\u2019s more important, as Hamid was referring to is the margin, right. So, when you look at the margins that we are expecting on starts for this year, it\u2019s going to be in the high-teens. And we have been stabilizing in the low 20s and we are going to continue to see the benefit of a land bank that\u2019s under fair value \u2013 undervalued from a fair value perspective benefit our starts and our stabilizations with probably into 2016.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Specter with Bank of America. Your line is opened.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America","Great, thank you. This is Jamie Feldman here with Jeff. So, can you guys talk a little bit about the supply story and what you are seeing across the markets versus where you were last quarter or even at NAREIT, just in terms of supply risk? And then how you think that plays out to your expectation for rent growth, I guess even on a multi-year view, which you guys gave at the Investor Day for both rent growth and even the same-store outlook.","Gene Reilly","So, Jamie, it\u2019s Gene. I will start with that. So, our view in the supply picture in the Americas really hasn\u2019t changed over the last quarter. I mean there are three distinct markets that are sort of close to equilibrium, Houston, Dallas and Southern California. Some other markets, Baltimore, for example, has got a lot of supply coming on in line, but essentially it\u2019s those three and not much has changed. And quarter-to-quarter, some have actually dropped in terms of quarterly starts, some have increased, but it\u2019s \u2013 more importantly, I think you need to look at what\u2019s happening in the big picture, what\u2019s in that pipeline and how is that compared to absorption. We are pretty comfortable frankly that overall Dallas and Southern California still have excess demand. Now, there are certain submarkets of Dallas, South Dallas in particular that we think are oversupplied. And I think we talked about that last quarter. Houston has a little bit of excess supply, but frankly, we stabilized two buildings in Houston this quarter, almost 300,000 feet, it\u2019s 100% leased and we will continue to build product that\u2019s core for us in Houston. And that\u2019s going to be catered to 30,000 to 100,000 square foot tenants. Demand there is still pretty robust. So, again, that\u2019s a long way of saying not much has changed.","Relative to the second part of your question, I think it\u2019s the replacement cost rents. How is this really going to affect the rent picture? And let me give you sort of big picture what we say happening in the U.S. Over the last year, let\u2019s say, we think that the cost of construction, essentially the hired cost have grown around 6%. We think land values are up around 12%. And you have had some cap rate compression. And if you mix that all together, replacement cost rents are growing at sort of 2% to 2.5% over that period of time. Over the next year, we think replacement cost rents are going to grow more like 5%, because we don\u2019t frankly, you don\u2019t have the cap rate compression in the equation as of right now. So, there are certain submarkets I mentioned South Dallas, where we are going to have headwinds on the rent growth. But overall, we remain pretty bullish about it throughout the Americas.","Tom Olinger","So, Jamie really quick on Asia and Europe, if you look at China, again, tremendously undersupplied today. I think our rent change on roll this quarter came in the low-teens. We have projected call it 6% market rent growth over the next four years or so and we are exceeding that. Japan again still undersupplied. We are seeing pretty greater rent growth than we had originally anticipated. It\u2019s coming faster in Japan. You will see a little tick up in vacancy rates in the Tokyo market this coming quarter, maybe up to 5% or 6%, but again not a concern. Moving to Europe, we are still undersupplied in Europe. You don\u2019t really see new starts, but for build-to-suit starts, there maybe a handful of spec buildings than just a handful of sub-markets. And I think in Europe, we have seen again 11 consecutive quarters of positive net absorption. So, we are really in pretty good shape there as well from a supply standpoint.","Hamid Moghadam","Jamie, to tie back to the last Investor Day, I think we are right on track. If anything we are a tad ahead in terms of timing, particularly in the U.S., we are a tad behind in Europe, because of that cap rate compression that we talked about, but generally, if you mix \u2013 and we are ahead in Japan for sure. So, China is about on target. So, if you mix it all up together, I would say we are on or slightly above plan given the size of the U.S. and on the same trajectory as we had nine months in a row whenever we did that.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel. Your line is open.","John Guinee - Stifel","Great, thank you. Nice quarter guys. Quick question, if I look at your development spreads, is that before or after taxes and how are you guys handling just very complicated corporate tax differences between countries?","Tom Olinger","It is an after tax margin. So, we reflect all taxes in there. And in the vast majority of the cases, the actual tax that\u2019s embedded in those margins is fairly modest, because we have the ability to \u2013 if we are contributing an asset into a fund to do it on a highly effective tax manner to minimize taxes. And then upon sale, any taxes are typically transferred or shared, because they are typically entity sales, so the tax on that is pretty modest.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is open.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thank you. Can you just talk a little bit more about your lease spread commentary, I think you said 35% of the leases that were signed in Europe are Central Europe, is that the case next year and what does that mean or imply about the lease spreads overall that you might be seeing when you look out further than just the next couple of quarters?","Hamid Moghadam","Okay, so in Europe it\u2019s hard to say what the future is going to be exactly because we don\u2019t know what will be leased, but this specific quarter 73% were in Central and Eastern Europe and Southern Europe. As you look forward for the next two quarters the lease expirations that we see, so that obviously doesn\u2019t complete new leases, but the lease expirations are in that same sort of range. So I would expect that you won\u2019t see again a substantial contribution from Europe at least for the next two quarters in terms of rental growth. But I do expect as we push occupancies up into 2015, that Europe will begin to contribute more so than it has in this quarter.","Tom Olinger","Ki Bin this is Tom, from an overall trending perspective looking into next year, when you look at our lease expirations and we show that on Page 22 of our supplemental. You can see on an our share basis, rents rolling next year at 529 a foot. Overall portfolio is at 550 a foot. We think today in place to market is about 90%. So we are under \u2013 our portfolio is under leased by about 10%, but when you look specifically 2015, it is more than 10% under market. And that\u2019s just the composition of the roll. The vast majority of the leases that are rolling in the next few years are post prior peak periods, a lot of them during the crisis. So you are going to see more than that a 10% mark to market on leases that are rolling into next year.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Craig Mailman \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Just two quick ones, on same store NOI, you guys had a nice accelerating trend last couple of quarters, but you have also been helped out a little bit on the expense side, does that become a headwind at all in the current kind of the trend in the second half of the year. And then this is second question, can you guys just talk a little about the turnover costs this quarter and whether that\u2019s just skewed by a couple of leases or a more of a kind you guys are seeing?","Tom Olinger","Craig this is Tom. It\u2019s not going to be a headwind for us as we look at same store in 2014 or 2015, a lot of the expense benefits that\u2019s going on are just where we are in the cycle, lower bad debt expense, other lower slippage just via higher occupancy. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a trend that impacts us going forward.","Hamid Moghadam","And related to the turnover costs, we are doing more small-unit leasing right now, that\u2019s what\u2019s vacant in the portfolio, and that has higher turnover costs associated with it. We also had a higher ratio of new leases to renewals, and new leases have a significantly higher turnover costs. So those two things sort of gave us a little bit of a spike this quarter. I think the best that for you look at is the turnover costs for the value of the lease, so that\u2019s 9% this quarter. I don\u2019t think it will stay at that level. I think it will come down. But we will continue to have higher volumes in the small unit leasing going forward.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS Securities. Your line is open.","Ross Nussbaum - UBS Securities","Alright. Thanks. Good morning guys. Can you talk about the $1.8 billion of land on the book, so I am a little curious if I divide it up between the U.S. and Europe, how much of the U.S. land is what I would call legacy from the last cycle and how much of it\u2019s been bought in the past couple of years. And maybe the same question on Europe, although I am assuming most of the land in Europe is legacy, where I am going with this is I am trying to sort of figure out if you look at the value per acre, which say in the U.S. is like 140 grand an acre, how that book value compares to where you have been buying land lately? Thanks.","Hamid Moghadam","So the vast majority of it is old land because first of all you say in the last couple of years, the land market didn\u2019t really start moving until about 6 to 12 months ago. So there was very little liquidity in the land market, not a lot of trades in the land market. So I think you really by couple of years ago, you mean last year and by definition that\u2019s couple of hundred million dollars of land acquisition that has not been put in production and has gone into the land bank. So I would say 80-20, so 80% of it is old land, 20% of it is new land. That\u2019s not a scientific number, but it should be directionally correct. Mike any additional color on that?","Mike Curless","Yes. Another thing, I think it\u2019s important to point out is the land that we have purchased here in the last couple of years worldwide, some 90% of that is at a building put into production right off the bat within \u2013 I am sorry within the first 18 months. And you see in Japan that line gets put into production, sometimes a week after we buy it. So, I think we are doing a really good job there of managing our land bank going forward.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Hey, guys. My question has been answered. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brad Burke with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brad Burke - Goldman Sachs","Hey, good morning guys. I wanted to talk about development more, it just looks like this quarter saw a slight decline in your expected margins on new starts versus where you have been at for the past year or so. And I realized they have been telling us that we can\u2019t continue to expect 20% plus development work. I was hoping you could elaborate on whether there is anything specific that would push these margins to a more normalized rate, because it sounds like rental rates continue to surprise you to the upside or is one quarter just future operating make any conclusions about the trend in development margin?","Hamid Moghadam","The latter.","Brad Burke - Goldman Sachs","Okay.","Hamid Moghadam","I mean, I can give you a longer answer, but it\u2019s the latter. And that number will come down to about 15%, but it will take a few years, because we got to work through this old land before it does come down.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel with Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.","Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors","Thank you. You are talking little bit earlier about the release of spreads in the rent growth trajectory, can you just maybe touch upon the vintage of leases that are rolling over now maybe the percentages that were signed post 2009 and pre-2009? Thank you.","Hamid Moghadam","Yes. So, Eric, let me start with Q2, the leases that we signed in Q2 this quarter 5% of them were signed before June of 2008, 95% of them were signed after June 2008. And of those after 2008, 35% were in the trough. Okay. If you look at our overall portfolio as of June 30, 15% were signed before June 2008, therefore 85% signed after, 30% during the trough. So, net-net, we think we have got a pretty good runway of below market leases rolling for the next couple of years. So, one other factor that I want to bring in, this would be a good time as follow up to Eric\u2019s question to make you all aware of. I think it scratched my head quite a bit as to why consistently the same-store NOI forecasted that you guys put out are low in this improving part of the cycle. And I think we have not done a good job of communicating something that happens to our business, which I want to just outline for you.","Basically, if you take our rollover schedule on an annual basis and just let\u2019s make it simple, let\u2019s say, we are signing 5-year leases and on average 20% of the portfolio rolls over. That understates the real rollover and the ability to move up rents at the good point of the cycle by about 30%, maybe a little more than 30% at times. So, the theoretical number of rollover is 20%. The actual number in a given year maybe 25%, 26% of the overall portfolio and that number is about 30% in the good part of the cycle, because the lot of tenants that need more space, less space, different kind of space and they have old leases, they come to us and they say we\u2019d like to turn up that lease, we\u2019d like to take the expansion space. We would like to do something different than when their lease technically expires. And of course so far in an up-market we like doing that, because we can get their space back and lease it up at the higher rent and lease some new space at the higher rent. So, in a rising market, the turnover statistic understates our opportunity to capture upside in rents.","Now, you might ask what happens in the downturn. In the downturn, does it go the other way? It doesn\u2019t really, because unless there is a default, we are not going to write down the rent to market in case of a voluntary early termination of the lease. So, there is \u2013 the portfolio has a quicker ability to adjust to the upside when rents are escalating as much as they are now. And once you include that in your analysis, I think you will get a lot closer to the kind of same-store numbers that we have been talking about and finally getting close to achieve it. So going forward, don\u2019t be surprised if your turnover ratios going back into the same-store NOI that you will see coming through in our portfolio.","Tom Olinger","So, an example of that would be the same-store pool for the last four quarters, we turned 23% of our same-store leases.","Hamid Moghadam","Anyway, I hope that helps.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is opened.","Michael Mueller - JPMorgan","Thanks, hi. It seems like you are seeing more acquisition opportunities. I was wondering what you think is driving that and is there a regional bias to it?","Hamid Moghadam","We are seeing more acquisition opportunities in two places. One, what we talked about some proprietary deal flow through our funds. And by the way, we don\u2019t do every deal that becomes available in our funds either. We only do it when we see value. I mean, there are cases where there has been opportunity to deploy more capital in our funds and we have just not availed ourselves of that opportunity. The second place is Europe, while cap rates in Europe have compressed rapidly faster that our expectations. We still think there is another 6 to 12 months of cap rate compression left in Continental Europe. So, don\u2019t be surprised to see us be a pretty active acquirer of assets in Europe at below replacement cost. So, those are the two places I would guide your attention.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is opened.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Good afternoon. Hamid or Gene, could you talk a bit about the strengths you referenced in the small bulk space, you got to put a little bit of numbers, what kind of spreads are you seeing on small bulk renewal right now versus some of the bigger bulk space?","Gene Reilly","Yes. It\u2019s Gene. That\u2019s a good question. So, in small unit leasing, we\u2019ve increased occupancy pretty substantially all over the last couple of years. But we\u2019ve got to ways to go so we\u2019re in the Americas 92 and changed. But the real story is the rent spreads. We are over 12% rent spreads on small unit leasing this quarter. And that\u2019s had a nice run like the rest of portfolio over the last four quarters and we think that will continue. So, you think about replacement cost analysis for these small units. We are way below placement cost rents right now. So there is actually more upside in that segment so, we believe that\u2019s going to continue.","Hamid Moghadam","I would say just we have got the similar focus in small spaces in Europe, but we just don\u2019t have the pricing power at this point in time. So, we need to get to a place where the Americas is, we are plus 90%, 92% in that segment, start pushing rents in that segment, but we are not there yet.","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi. Your line is opened.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","Thank you. So, I just wanted to follow back up just in terms of the ample liquidity. Tom, you talked about, where you talked about, there was obviously an increase in the net deployment, I think net deployment today is $200 million I take it that the contributions following into the first quarter of next year which is about $400 million or 50% share would effectively take care of that. But then I guess how should we think about the increase in the fund which is gross capital equity plus your share debt about $480 million, how should we think about your desire to deploy and it\u2019s actually increased funding where you\u2019re going to get that liquidity from with the goal of continuing to improve the balance sheet?","Tom Olinger","Going forward as you said when you look at the match funding for 2014, it\u2019s really in line because when you look at starts down translate into cash flow. So, from a cash flow perspective, you talked about the net $200 million is actually much smaller, it\u2019s actually about the same from the net cash flow perspective. And then we have contributions coming in the first quarter as well as an expected \u2013 expectation that we would see continued contributions stabilized \u2013 development stabilize and roll off. So, I think we can mostly self fund, going forward at this stage and any incremental capital of longer term we\u2019re going to finance in line or capitalized in line with our long-term goals, which are mid to low 30%.","Hamid Moghadam","Yes. The only thing I would add to what Tom just said is that we are going to obviously as we mentioned earlier in the year and we continued to want to take advantage of a good disposition environment for selling a little bit of remaining non-strategic assets that we have. So we are stepping on the gas in the back half of this year and early next year to do that, so.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel. Your line is open.","John Guinee - Stifel","Great. Going out \u2013 looking at your Japanese REIT and your public vehicle in Mexico, is it possible to understand how those entities are trading on an implied cap rate basis right now?","Hamid Moghadam","I think that Japan number I haven\u2019t looked at it in a while, it\u2019s in the high-3s and the Mexican REIT is in the mid to high-7s. What I mean is that I have to listen to their calls too to figure that out\u2026","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America","Thanks guys. It\u2019s Jamie Feldman again. So Tom I am wondering if you can just walk us through the changes \u2013 the change to guidance at the midpoint in terms of what were the main moving pieces. And then as we think about FFO for next year, how much of that is recurring and how much of that is more one-time in 2014?","Tom Olinger","Okay. The $0.05 bump was primarily deployment, net deployment, some outperformance from the first half as well as stronger our share of operations and interest savings that would make up the S$0.05. What I see from a year-over-year run rate basis, I don\u2019t see any of those being non-recurring. We obviously had a large promote in the second quarter. And we believe that we are going to see promote levels pretty consistent if not better than we have seen in the last two years going forward. At this point in cycle we feel very good about our promotes that we are going to be earning over the next three to five years. So I don\u2019t see anything that\u2019s in our results either year-to-date or in our forecast that are meaningful at all from a non-recurring standpoint.","Hamid Moghadam","Yes. And the only thing I would add to that is that if you go back and look at our investor presentation from last September, we had laid out some numbers for you that took into account sort of the rental picture and its growth. And as I mentioned earlier, in response to your question, we are on track or maybe a little bit better than that. So basically if you look at that forecast and say if you are going to redo that forecast how would you change it, I would say on the rental side we are pretty even. We have done a better job on managing our interest expense than before. And I think we have done a better job on G&A. And I think on both of those we are way ahead of the plan. So I would say, those numbers are pretty good with an arrow up on them directionally.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi. Your line is open.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","Just last question, just on the promotes and Tom you just touched on this, next year you have the opportunity to earn for the funds to promote, it\u2019s about 35% of the assets in funds or in listed companies almost about 55% of your equity committed to those, can you give us at least based on where the NAVs are today, what that gross number promote potentially could be for \u201815 as we think about the FFO impact?","Tom Olinger","That would not be a good idea. First of all we don\u2019t really know with any precision and secondly values can change around and it depends not only on the value that we think but the value that the appraisers thing etcetera, etcetera. But let me go back to something that I have mentioned to you over the years. I think our gross promotes is on the order of 25 basis points of third-party assets under management across the cycle. It will be lumpy, but that\u2019s about what it works out to be across a normal cycle in terms of magnitude. Now from that you need to net out some things and get to a net number that hits the books. But so if you are going to use a number I would use maybe 15 basis points to get to the net number.","Hamid Moghadam","Michael when you look across the last two years we have put up $0.04 in \u201913. We just put up $0.15 promote in \u201914, I don\u2019t think those numbers are out of line when you look at the next 3 to 5 years. I am sorry $0.04 in \u201813, $0.05 in \u201814.","Tom Olinger","Yes, which by the way $0.05 is $25 million, and if you look at our third-party assets under management at about $20 billion it gets to that mid-teen \u201815 net number that I mentioned to you. It is a little bit lower than that. But that\u2019s not a bad number for sort of a recurring kind of flow, adjusting the lumpiness.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel with Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.","Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors","Thanks. Tom can you just go through the debt repurchases and just explain what exactly you mean by purchasing everything on a MPV basis that\u2019s meaningless or not meaningless, or have no economic cost? Thanks.","Tom Olinger","Yes. So when you look at, so what we analyzed the economics of retiring debt early, we MPV that interest expense the reaming interest expense on that debt and we discounted back at our cost of capital, our cost of debt for that remaining term. And if that MPV is within 1% of the balance of that debt, we believe that\u2019s a good economic deal because less than 1% is a pretty de minimus amount to pay for the viability to lock in long-term rates. So another way to look at it is if we could take that 1% delta and just amortize that over the remaining life of the debt, we think that would be maybe 10 bps a year. So it\u2019s a very de minimus and we think that\u2019s a very inexpensive price to pay to lock in today\u2019s long-term rates. I mean in the last 12 months we have locked in 10-12 year debt, albeit euro but we had the ability to issue it at sub-3%. We will do that all day long. And we will continue to look at ways to do that, although that pool is diminishing rapidly, but we think it makes a lot of sense to do that.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is open.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thanks. Just a couple of quick follow-ups here. What is the average contractual rent step up in your entire portfolio. And second part, your cash same store NOI growth has been outpacing your GAAP, is that just truly because more than normal burn off of rent and should that be closer going forward?","Tom Olinger","Yes. Ki Bin this is Tom. So from a contractual bumps globally about 80% of our leases have contractual bumps on revenue of I would say approximately 2.5%. So again that\u2019s on revenue not on NOI. And the rest of our leases that don\u2019t have contractual bumps typically have some sort of an indexation. So it\u2019s like a CPI inflator. So you can\u2019t straight line it but it does give you a bump every year. Your other question really is when will, yes cash NOI is outstripping GAAP today because of largely because of concession burn off and other, basically concession burn off. Those two are going to converge over time, over long period of time. They should be identical. I would expect they would converge and get very close to each other sometime in the back half of \u201815, early \u201816.","Hamid Moghadam - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Okay.

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Prologis First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions). Thank you. Ms. Tracy Ward, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Tracy A. Ward","","Thanks Shirley, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2014 conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. This morning we'll hear from Hamid Moghadam, our Chairman and CEO, who will comment on the company's strategy and the market environment; and then from Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover results and guidance. Also joining us for today's call are Gary Anderson, Mike Curless, Ed Nekritz, Gene Reilly and Diana Scott.","Before we begin our prepared remarks I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and in the industry in which Prologis operates, as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filing. ","Additionally our first quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures and in accordance with Reg G we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. ","With that I will turn the call over to Hamid and we'll get started. Hamid? ","Hamid R. Moghadam","Thanks, Tracy and good morning everyone. We had a strong first quarter and 2014 is shaping up to be a good year for us. We see excellent momentum across all our business lines and geographies. Markets continue to improve pretty much everywhere around the world. Rents and occupancies are recovering at a pace ahead of the forecast we gave you at our investor forum last fall.","In the U.S. absorption is running more than double the pace of new completions, pushing occupancies above pre-crisis levels. We expect this trend to continue throughout 2014 albeit at a more modest pace. We see no general signs of overbuilding although speculative starts in Dallas are getting ahead of demand. There is also a fair amount of new construction in the Inland Empire and Houston but we are not concerned about those markets as absorption is more than keeping pace with new supply. ","Turning to capital flows we see significant investor demand for quality industrial real estate. Appraisals lag real time transactions and our view of the market by 25 to 50 basis points. At the same time the market chatter about portfolio pricing is a further 25 to 50 basis points inside where we think the real market is today. ","Moving to Europe the leasing markets are also improving but at an uneven pace. UK and Northern Europe are strong and Southern Europe is slowly getting better. While strengthening Italy and Romania are the two softest markets in Europe. Across the Continent cap rates are compressing rapidly and appraisals are 50 to 100 basis points behind real time transactions. ","In Brazil, Mexico and China the markets are much stronger than the economic headlines would suggest, consumer interest -- the customer interest in our product remains solid. In Japan markets continue to tighten and rents are increasing faster than our previous expectations. Japan is a market with the biggest upward pressure on construction cost. ","Switching to our three lines of business, ops led the way in the first quarter. Overall occupancies held up better than our expectations and rental growth was above plan. In our development business margins on starts and stabilizations were well above average. Our pipeline for the rest of the year continues to look strong in terms of volume and projected profit margins. We had a good quarter of acquisitions in Europe ahead of compressing cap rates. ","As we look forward given the strength of pricing in the U.S. we're putting more of our non-strategic assets on the market for sale in 2014. With respect to acquisitions here in the U.S., we are only spending time on transactions where we can have a competitive advantage in terms of our scale and our expertise or see value at discounts to replacement costs. ","In investment management business we experienced another quarter of strong fund raising across all our vehicles. Our ongoing dialogue with perspective investors is as strong as I remember in our entire history. We are turning away more business than we choose to take on.","We are now rated BBB Plus by S&P in the top quintile of REITs. This represents the second full upgrade over the last 12 months and is a long way away from where we started at the close of the merger. We still plan to have one of the top balance sheets in the business and to attain an A rating in the near future. ","To sum it all up we're feeling pretty good about our business, where it is today and where it's going. We expect strong rental growth through the balance of the year and beyond, development and investment management businesses are two powerful engines for profitable growth going forward. And finally we are at the point in our evolution where we can grow significantly in scale with very little incremental investment in corporate overhead. With that let me turn it over to Tom who will take you through the numbers. ","Thomas S. Olinger","Thanks, Hamid. I'll start with our results for the first quarter. Core FFO was $0.43 per share, about $0.01 ahead of our expectations. The outperformance was driven by higher NOI. Additionally interest income was higher than expected due to the recovery of a notes receivable that was fully reserved. Leasing volume totaled 32 million square feet consistent with the first quarter of 2013. ","Our quarter-end occupancy was 94.5%, down 60 basis points from year-end and in-line with our historical first quarter seasonality. Americas and Asia occupancy outperformed expectations with the drop from year end at 30 and 40 basis points respectively. Europe occupancy was modestly lower than forecast, dropping a 130 basis points. GAAP rent change on rollover was 7% and positive across all geographic divisions led by the Americas at 10.4%. Notably Europe's rent change on rollover was 3%. Cash rent change on rollover was positive 1.1% for the quarter. ","Same-store NOI for the quarter increased 3% on a GAAP basis and 4.1% on an adjusted cash basis. G&A was $63 million in the first quarter which is typically our highest quarter due to the seasonal nature of incentive compensation. ","Turning to capital deployment, in the first quarter development stabilizations were $264 million, with an estimated margin of 22% generating our share of value creation of $51 million or about $0.10 a share. Building acquisitions were $371 million with the weighted average stabilized cap rate of 7% and were primarily in Europe. We also started a $172 million of new development projects at an estimated margin of 22%. ","For dispositions and contributions in the quarter we completed $1.2 billion generating $568 million, our share at a weighted average stabilized cap rate of 6.2% with most of this activity related to the U.S. logistics venture contributions. ","Moving to investment management; operating income was $21 million in the quarter in-line with our expectations. Following a record year in 2013 institutional investor demand remained strong. Year-to-date we've raised $582 million of third-party equity, primarily for our European ventures. Our capital raising and deployment drove investment management AUM higher to more than $27 billion at the end of the quarter. ","Switching gears to capital markets, we completed $1.2 billion of financings in the first quarter. We continue to capitalize on low interest rates particularly with euro-denominated debt to extend term, lower interest cost and align the currency of our debt and assets. Our LTV and debt-to-EBITDA credit metrics increased slightly this quarter due to deployment timings. However we expect our credit metrics will continue to improve with NOI growth from high occupancy and rising rents.","We repatriated the majority of the $700 million euro bonds proceeds back to U.S. dollars, which increased our U.S dollar held equity to 82% from 77% at year-end. Subsequent to quarter-end we redeemed a $175 million of bonds maturing in 2015 and repaid $239 million of secured debt. Additionally Prologis European Properties Fund 2 issued a $300 million Euro bond. ","The recent credit rating upgrade from Standard & Poor's to BBB plus is affirmation of our earnings trajectory, liquidity, access to multiple sources of public and private capital and our commitment to build one of the strongest balance sheets in the REIT sector. For 2014 we continue to expect year-end occupancy to reach between 95% and 96% and GAAP same-store NOI to range between 3% and 4%. ","On expenses; net G&A is forecasted to range between $233 million and $243 million. For capital deployment we continue to expect $1.8 billion to $2.2 billion of development starts with 80% our share and building acquisitions between $500 million and $1 billion with our share at 40%. For contributions our forecast is unchanged at $2 billion to $2.25 billion with 50% our share. ","For dispositions; given the increase in divestiture demand as Hamid mentioned we're raising our guidance by $250 million to range between $750 million and $1.25 billion with 80% our share. The increased dispositions will be primarily in the U.S. We can self-fund our growth this year as proceeds from contributions and dispositions approximately equal our forecasted deployment. Our investment management guidance remains unchanged with revenue ranging between $200 million and $210 million and expenses between $95 million and $100 million representing an operating margin of about 50%. This guidance includes the promote we expect to recognize in the second quarter net of expenses of approximately $20 million from our open-ended target U.S. Logistic Fund. ","We have added promote eligibility date disclosure in the supplemental and you should note that we have an opportunity to earn a promote in each year of the foreseeable future. For FX we are continuing to assume the euro with 1.35 and the Yen at 105 for the year and our U.S. dollar net equity to range between 85% and 90% at year-end. ","Putting this all together given the strong start to the year we are raising the low end of our prior guidance and now expect full year core FFO to range between a $1.76 and a $1.82 per share. At the midpoint of our guidance range 2014 core FFO is expected to grow more than 8% year-over-year ","We expect second quarter core FFO to be higher than the first quarter principally as a result of the USLF promote. As we are moving to the second half of the year we expect rent growth and increased NOI from development stabilizations to steadily increase core FFO. To sum it up we had a good quarter and we are excited about our prospects for the remainder of the year. ","With that I\u2019ll turn it to the operator to open it up for questions.","Tracy A. Ward","Shirley?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","I apologize ma\u2019am I was on mute. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Brendan Maiorana from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Thanks, good morning. Tom I wanted to ask about guidance and you went through the details. It seemed like the main change from the parameters that you give us was the increased dispositions to take advantage of strong pricing that was out there. But you did raise the low end by a couple of pennies. So I am just wondering what the offset is given that it seems like the deployment expectations are about the same. Is it better on the operation side, is it better on the financing side or is there something else that\u2019s driving the move up when dispositions would be -- could be a little bit of a headwind?","Thomas S. Olinger","","Brendan, this is Tom, thanks for your question. It is driven by better NOI in the first quarter and our confidence with the operating fundamentals going forward. It's also the result of deploying our excess -- significant liquidity we had at the end of the year and in early January, a little faster than we thought. And we also have a little more visibility now on the size of the promote from USLF in the second quarter. ","Looking forward we\u2019ll be as efficient as we can on redeploying any excess disposition proceeds and as we mentioned we took our guidance up there. We\u2019ll continue to look on how to do that efficiently on deployment, including redeeming bonds where we think the economics make sense.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Specter from Bank of America. Your line is open.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch","Thank you. This is Jamie Feldman here. Can you talk a little bit more about the occupancy dip in the first quarter? I think you had said it was pretty sizable in Europe and then taking it forward kind of what gives you conviction that you\u2019ll get to your occupancy guidance by the end of the year?","Hamid R. Moghadam ","Let me take that second part of that first. Jamie, it\u2019s kind of happened every year in the last, I don\u2019t know 25 years. So it's a good expectation. Our expectation is that it always dips in the first quarter and it always comes back and we have pretty good visibility in the leases we are working on for the second quarter and beyond. So that one is pretty much a given. I will let Gary talk about Europe.","Gary E. Anderson","","Yeah so Jamie in Europe we are still bullish there. The macroeconomic recovery is accelerating, it's broadening. The recovery -- actually over the course of the past 90 days GDP forecast has increased by 30 basis points. We are sitting at about 1.5% GDP growth for the entire year. So the recovery as Hamid said is uneven and our operating results are sort of reflective of that. Things played out pretty much as we expected in Northern Europe and the UK, occupancies dropped while we started to push rents, makes perfect sense; we\u2019re right in the sweet spot in those two geographies sitting at 96%, 97% occupancy and the ability to push rents. ","We had hoped that we would be able to hold occupancies in Southern Europe and Central and Eastern Europe and we didn\u2019t. There is not a concern there. There is no systemic issue at all and I expect occupancies to increase certainly about the third quarter of this year. So net-net we feel good about the operating results there and again this is the third consecutive quarter that we had positive rental growth in Europe, so 3% so all-in-all a pretty good result I think in Europe. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citi. Your line is open.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc.","Yeah, good morning up there, Kevin Varin's on the phone with me as well. Tom or Hamid I just wanted to talk sort of about free cash flow, equity, sort of dividend raise and when you look at the results in the first quarter, your core AFFO was effectively on top of the dividend which you lifted 18% to $0.33. When you think about the back half of the year if you put aside the $0.04 promote that you in the second quarter your core FFO was about $0.43 to $0.45. Let's assume the $0.10 drop from FFO to AFFO is similar, you got pretty tight coverage and so I guess from your perspective why raise the dividend and give away that free-cash flow ability and then also put an ATM in place of $750 million, potentially putting pressure even though the decisions are good and you can match fund this year, putting pressure on the need to raise equity where you got free cash, if you were to maintain the dividend where it was? ","Hamid R. Moghadam","Wow, that was a pretty long winded question. I think you are assuming two businesses away which are pretty important as part of our overall lines of business. I mean you just put investment management away by assuming away promotes. That's a pretty important part of our business. And you also put away the development business that makes us $300 million to $400 million a year really, really. ","So yes, if you just consider our operating business the dividend and our earnings power from just the rent business, assuming no growth in rents and occupancies which is again a draconian assumption, is right on top of the dividend but of course our view is that there will be growth in our rents and our occupancies and that the development in investment management business will be strong contributors to our overall financial picture. Tom, do you have anything to add? ","Thomas S. Olinger","I will just add on the development side you have to remember that realized development gains or taxable income and that has to be distributed to shareholders, so you need to look at as Hamid said the totality of that business not just with the operating business. And when you look at on that basis our AFFO payout ratio would be in the mid to low 80% range. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. ","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley","Thank you for taking the questions. So you touched on construction cost in Japan and you also discussed where you are seeing some construction activity domestically. Could you update us on the replacement cost in relation to rents in the U.S., the relative growth in both and how your own construction costs are trending domestically?","Eugene F. Reilly","Yeah, sure Vance it's Gene, I'll hit that one. So as we look at actual construction cost in the United States we saw sort of a 3% to 4% increase year-over-year. And we expect that to increase not significantly at this point but probably that goes to sort of a four to five range. And that's one component of replacement cost obviously. Land it's moving, I mean that's really all across the board but in a healthy market it is moving really quickly. So you are seeing sort of 10%, 15% increase. ","When you boil all that together and you are probably looking on a go-forward basis something in the 7% plus range all-in. So we've got a keen eye on replacement cost and as you know we do a lot of development so it is something on one hand we are worried about, but on the other hand it sort of underpins where rent levels are and also underpins the growth in those rents. ","Hamid R. Moghadam","Our rental forecast on our Investor Day was predicated on a 10% real growth in construction cost above and beyond inflation in the period between 2013 and 2016, that's kind of was the basis for that analysis which we shared with you in September of '13. I would say and that was a global forecast. I would say if you look at where we are and we were going to do that analysis over again I would say construction cost would be higher than those projections primarily because Japan is much, much higher and I would say the U.S. is higher and the growth is coming a little earlier than we thought in that analysis. ","So I think there is -- that's why we think that forecast that we put out there is actually looking pretty conservative right now and we're ahead of it both in terms of occupancy, we're ahead of it in terms of rent. The only headwind to that forecast is that I would say cap rates have come in a little bit lower. So development can occur a little sooner with the same level of profitability than before. ","So compared to September I would say global cap rates are down maybe 25 basis points. Where we really think they are now where the price stock is, the price stock is all kinds of -- if you really believed the price stock cap rates are down 50 maybe even more than that. I don't believe the price stock. But really, really cap rates are down 25 basis points, so that's a bit more of a headwind that will negate the construction cost increase. So roughly I think replacement cost rents are about where they were when we forecasted them in September. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Guinee from Stifel. Your line is open.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus ","Great. Thank you. Hey Tom can you -- I think it was Mr. Bilerman asked about dividend increase et cetera. Can you expand a little bit more for educational purposes on the -- basically in developing, merchant building investment sales business in the U.S. versus Europe. Because in the U.S., for the most part your normal real estate annual corporate taxes are sheltered via the REIT rules and you can usually -- if you want to do a 10-31 exchange and do other assets, how much leakage do you have in Europe because the U.S. REIT don't apply and you may or may not be able to use 10-31 exchanges. And how does that all translate into a percentage of your dividend that is almost guaranteed to go up as your merchant building business expands?","Thomas S. Olinger","Thanks for the question, John. So when you look at outside the U.S. the friction you get, well number one is those gains do come back and it is taxable income. You cannot shelter those gains through a 10-31 mechanism like you can in the U.S. So those earnings when they are repatriated come back and that's taxable income. The leakage on that is actually very minimal. We're very efficiently structured, both out of Europe and Asia and that leakage is generally in the low to mid-single digits, from a leakage perspective. ","Hamid R. Moghadam","But here is the important point, John, they only are taxed when they come back here. So in terms of present value they are very low in terms of their net economic impact because they often times unless you're doing a lot of balance sheet gymnastics in terms of expanding or shrinking your balance sheet in these regions, which by the way we've being doing a lot of, but now we're in the stable mode given that we have all these fund structures in place and all that, we shouldn't be doing a whole bunch of repatriating. ","We've moved up the share of our U.S. dollar equity to 82% already. So there isn't that much more of money coming back and forth. So I think you can think of effectively the present value of that leakage overseas if the absolute number is in the low single-digits the present value impact is going to be virtually zero. ","Thomas S. Olinger","And then from a sizing perspective when you think about the size of our development pipeline and this is on a long-term run-rate basis if you just assume for even that $2 billion of development that stabilizes a year and a long-term margin of 15% that's $300 million. Probably two-thirds of that is happening outside the U.S. and will ultimately affect your taxable income. So a rough way to look at it would be about $200 million of potential taxable income as Hamid mentioned when it's repatriated could come back to your USTIs. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Auerbach from ISI Group. Your line is open. ","George Auerbach \u2013 ISI Group","Great, thanks. Hamid you mentioned the investment opportunity in Europe a few times now. Can you give us a sense for any portfolio sized deals in the market today? And how long of a horizon you see to put capital to work in Europe at above average returns. ","Hamid R. Moghadam ","Well. Cap rates in Europe have compressed a lot faster than I ever thought. You really have this unusual situation where the appraisal community in Europe I would say is 50 to 100 but probably really more like 75 to 100 basis points behind real deals and we were very successful in the middle, actually all in 2013 and early part of this year. But now we are finding that we are actually losing deals, portfolio deals by maybe 25 basis points on the cap rate. ","So markets in Europe have adjusted very, very quickly. You still have a good discount to replacement costs because rents are pretty low and you can still buy properties at the replacement cost. But the big surprise for me has been -- well UK really normalized in 2012, 2013 but the continent was right after it. ","And if I were going to guess, probably since our Norges transaction there has been, which I think was basically the coasts are clear and the water is safe sign I have mentioned those cap rates were down 75 basis points, may be a 100 basis points and heading lower. So the investment opportunities in Europe are quickly, quickly dissipating. They are still attractive because you still have rent growth but you don\u2019t have the combination of really high cap rate compression or rent growth like you had before. So still good but not great.","Gary E. Anderson","George, I would just add that our pipeline is still pretty strong and we were looking at over \u20ac1.8 billion worth of acquisition opportunities. And it\u2019s a mix of one-off deals smaller portfolios call it in a $100 million range and then some larger portfolios. But there is pretty good activity there and better product again then I have seen in the last decade that\u2019s come in to market. So there is still opportunity, I think.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Craig Mailman - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.","Thanks, good afternoon guys. Maybe could we just hit on U.S. development a little bit, you mentioned Dallas, looks like it may be getting a little bit ahead of itself but -- and then Inland Empire and Houston they are still on demand there to absorb the supply but on the other side you said cap rates in the U.S. are coming in a little bit more than you thought and may be that makes development easier. I guess as you guys look out on the horizon are there more markets sort of on the bubble of getting to Dallas or even Houston, Inland Empire type developments starts there that get you guys worried, or at this point is the runway still pretty good here in the U.S. for development?","Eugene F. Reilly ","","Craig, it is Gene I\u2019ll take that one. Generally the answer to your question is yes, it does look pretty good. If you look across U.S. markets three of them stand out in particular, Dallas recently we mentioned, the Inland Empire and Houston. But in all of those cases if you study the metrics you look at where their actual vacancy rates are today, you look at historical absorption and supply as a percentage of stock, it\u2019s kind of in balance but it's ramping up quickly as Hamid mentioned in Dallas it's ramping up really quickly.","So those are three markets we have our eyes on. We are very active in development in all three of them. There is no doubt as this recovery takes shape that more markets will fall into that category, but none of them are flashing red lights yet at this point.","Hamid R. Moghadam","So the only thing I would add is that keep the overall numbers in mind. The overall numbers are last year 65 million feet of new supply, 225 million feet of absorption. We under-built the market by about a 160 million square feet. That directly translated into vacancy rates dropping by more than any other year ever. And by the way that doesn\u2019t account for obsolescence, putting that aside. This year we think absorption is going to be around 200 million with construction increasing to about a 100 million square feet. So the deficit that we had at the 160 million feet last year is going to be more like a 100 million feet this year which will mean that this will be the second best year for vacancy drop.","So now of that 100 million feet of supply my guess is 50% of it is in that three markets we\u2019ve just talked about. And the reason that development is occurring in those markets, guess what rents have recovered, to replacement type rents. It\u2019s not because people had more development talent or less disciplined or any -- or banks are more exuberant there. It\u2019s just that the rents have recovered earliest in those markets and those rents are [through peaks] [ph]. ","So I think this volume of construction is directly related to rents. If rents pop 20% sooner than we thought you will get more development coming in these markets but until the other markets recover to the same extent I don't think you will see development. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust. Your line is open. Again Ki Bin Kim, your line is open.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Ki Bin, there is something wrong with your mike. Why don't we skip over and come back to him. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel from Green Street Advisors. Your line is open. ","Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors, Inc.","Thank you. I was wondering if you could just talk about your development pipeline a little bit. It seems like the number of starts is a little bit lower than I had probably anticipated given the amount of development you're expecting to be this year, may be you can just comment on that? Thank you.","Michael S. Curless ","Sure, Eric this is Mike Curless. We are not particularly concerned about the first quarter. Historically our first quarter is always by far our lightest quarter. This year we started 13 projects they happen to be some smaller projects just due to mix and certainly weather was an impact on a couple of projects that we moved into the second quarter.","But relative to the overall volume for the year we certainly think there is bias to the upside, 80% of all of our activity is already identified. That's a very high number for this time of the year. And 80% was going to take place on land that we already own. The ramp up is already underway in Q2. And we expect that to increase steadily all the way through to the end of Q4 which is pretty typical for our pattern of development for the year. ","We continue to have bias to the upside in Europe. And in Asia and don't rule out our [WC] business given our customer reach and our land control. So we feel pretty good about some upside opportunities in those three important categories. If history any indication we expect good margins again for the third year in a row. So I feel real good about not just the quantity of the activity but more importantly the quality of that activity. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. ","David B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated","Yeah, maybe for Gene and\/or Hamid, I want to talk about capital raising in the U.S. obviously fairly quiet in the first quarter and tying that into your disposition acceleration the election to pursue disposition as opposed to contribution. So I guess one can you tie together the concept of capital raising in the U.S., the appetite here both for you as well as the partners out there. ","And then the second is if it's more of a property quality issue that you are trying to clean-up, can you may be give a little color around cap rates and timing? ","Hamid R. Moghadam","Sure, I think disposition is what we are buying and what we are selling are very different things. We have some residual cleanup of the portfolio left in our non-strategic markets and also the less strategic assets in core markets. And we're just getting along with that quicker than we would have otherwise because we see an opportunity to get good valuation. So but what we are buying on for USLF primarily, which is our active vehicle in the U.S. we're being very selective and we're buying for not just quality core products, that's a mandate of that fund. And we are very mindful of replacement cost and like I said in my prepared comments we're looking at situations that either our scale or expertise can add value. ","But it's getting tougher and tougher and one of the things that we don't want to do is sign up for a huge pipeline of capital. There is plenty of interest for people who want to give us money. We are being selective in managing our pipeline so that we not only can raise money but can invest that money intelligently without any undue pressure for people who want to get their capital to work. So that's the balance. It's not lack of interest from investors. Quite to the contrary there is a lot of interest on the part of the investors and we're just trying to balance that with the opportunities that we see in the market.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. ","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC","Good morning. Tom just given your comments about the increase in dispositions, can you just give us an update where you expect in the year in terms of U.S. equity exposures also overall leverage? And then also just so we have greater clarity in the promote, I think you had said $0.04 last quarter, is that still a good number to use? ","Thomas S. Olinger","Sure Michael I'll take those up. First the equity we expect to end the year, our U.S. equity balance between, somewhere 85% and 90%. So right on top of what our long-term goal is there. From a leverage perspective if you look at the mid points of our sources and usage in our deployment and guidance that would put us right around 35% LTV at the end of the year. If you remember when you look out to the first quarter 2015 two things are happening, first we've got the convertible debt that we would expect to convert into equity. That is roughly about 200 basis points of LTV. ","And then we also have optionality around the sell down of our interest in the Health venture that would get us to the low, very low near 30% LTV. And your last question was on the promote. Yes, I said we expect that to be around $20 million net of expenses or roughly $0.04 recognized in the second quarter. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum from UBS Securities. Your line is open. ","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Securities","Thanks. Tom just on the same-store guidance, how much of a tailwind should we expect on the expense side going forward for the remainder of the year?","Thomas S. Olinger","I think what you saw -- I don't think there will be much of a tailwind for the rest of the year. What you saw in the first quarter was really the result of Q1 '13 expenses being higher than normal. So you shouldn't see much of any tailwind at all from expenses. We talked about this last quarter but when you look at same-store increase year-over-year you've got about 1.5% driven by just rent change. So I think about 15% portfolio of your portfolio turning over, 10% rent change, about a 150 basis points of occupancy improvement. So that's another 1.5% and then there is about 50 basis points of indexation that's not reflected in straight line rent. ","So it's in this indexation, primarily in Europe where it's not a fixed income but it's based on an index that floats therefore you can't straight line it. So that indexation also comes through and that's about 50 basis points. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller from JPMorgan. Your line is open. ","Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan ","Hi. I joined a little late, I apologize if I missed this. But I think you talked about longer-term development margins. If you're looking at the next round of developments starts and where do you see the stabilized yields coming in and the margins on this next batch?","Hamid R. Moghadam","I think for our starts this year the margins are going to be above 20% and I think, I said this now I think three years in a row and I've been wrong I think they are going to gravitate down to 15 but I may be wrong. I think our land is on the books at a pretty attractive price. So while we're monetizing that land I think our margins will be over stated until we work our way through that land and have to buy new land at market. ","Thomas S. Olinger","And it's about a 2.5 year to 3 year supply, the land on our books today. ","Hamid R. Moghadam","I think if we're going to pick a number for our land today on the books of the 1.6 billion I would say that land is easily 20% or 25% undervalued with the big area up. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust. Your line is open. ","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. Just have one follow-up on promote. In 2015 it looks like a larger portion of it does come from some of your newer -- newly established joint -- JVs in Europe and given your commentary about cap rate compression there and if your promotes are structured the way they are historically as such are based on IRR than sort of the laddered promote structures. ","I think it will be a pretty sizable promote just even if a 100 basis points of cap rate compression would drive a big part of the IR calculation. As of today could you talk a little bit about what that size of promote would like potentially in 2015?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Ki Bin it's dangerous to do that because a million things have to happen before that promote is realized, including appraisers actually closing the gap between reality and what they are appraising. That's been very sticky in Europe and they are really lagging as I've now said three times I think by 75 or 100 basis points. I have no idea when they are going to start recognizing the evidence in the market, very, very sticky. But the best way I think to think about our promotes is that if you think that we're going to outperform our indices by call it 200 basis points of performance and historically that\u2019s been about the order of magnitude or the outperformance that the company's experienced with that big range but kind of averaging around 200 basis points above the indices. The promotes are 15% to 20%. ","So that translates into $0.30 to $0.40 of gross promotes, and the net promote is about 60% of the gross promote. So I think of it as a 25%, 25 basis point of AUM, third party AUM of-course we are not charging ourselves promotes, right. So take the third party AUM and if you want to model something that's relatively regular that\u2019s the number I would use, particularly now that we are getting into the period that there is almost a promote coming in every period. ","You are going to get some volatility around that but that\u2019s of a kind not a bad bullet point. And I would say they would be biased towards the upside of that in the next three or four years given that we are recovering from a really horrible three or four year period where there were no promotes and most values are reverting to the norm. So I think we are entering a good period of promotes for the company and it\u2019s a real part of our business I wish people would go spread it forth. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Brendan Maiorana from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Thanks, I had a couple of follow-ups. Just first on the new supply versus the net absorption calculation or projection, I know for 2014 it\u2019s been consisting a 100 million of its new expectations versus 200 million. I wonder, based on where the development starts are shaping up how you think that outlook may trend in 2015? And then second question the improvement in the secondary market location, which is causing you had sell some of your none-core assets. Is that driven by improvement in fundamentals in those markets, is it accelerating more in the secondary markets? Or is it just capital slowing into those markets because cap rates in primary markets are low?","Hamid R. Moghadam","I think fundamentals are getting better in all markets, so including the secondary market. So the way the capital means that you can achieve better pricing in those markets in terms of timing then we thought otherwise. So the transactions that were slated for late there is no sense waiting for later because you can achieve the same thing earlier and the decision, the same those have been determined to be non-strategic and so we are going to sell it. And what was the first part of question?","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","The ag -- what happened in 2015?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Supply will be up only because rents will be up and it will make more sense to build in more market. So again we shouldn\u2019t think about these issues in compartments. Supply relates to where rents are and where profitable development can take place. And if you buy the thesis of recovery in a broader range of markets you would see development in a broader range of market. But again let me put this in perspective I\u2019ve been in this business since 1983. That\u2019s I hate to say it but that\u2019s 31 years. ","There have never been periods where we have under-built the demand in the U.S. anywhere near these levels that we experienced last year and this coming year and next year. It\u2019s just unprecedented so vacancies are compressing rapidly. And I think together with that rents are increasing rapidly and it\u2019s not because this all of a sudden became the best business in the worlds. It\u2019s because we are climbing out of the basement, the basement that we all fell into in '08 and '09. So afterwards -- climbing out of the basement let\u2019s see how disappointed people are just to point that we will have a good long term sustainable period of rent growth once we\u2019ve reached a equilibrium. But between now and equilibrium expect a rapid rent growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Specter of Bank of America. You line is open.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks it's Jimmy Feldman again. I was hoping you guys could talk a little bit more about the types of tenant demand you are seeing?

In fact in terms of sectors then and what people are doing with this base?","Michael S. Curless","Jimmy this is Mike Curless certainly seeing a lot of movement in a variety of sectors and our customer demands e-commerce, packaging, housing related auto related. E-commerce is a real large driver there, probably see them doing about 15% of the activity in our existing portfolio in our new space in the development pipeline those numbers are more like 30% of that activity, the space sizes tend to much larger than traditional brick and mortar uses. So plenty of activity in e-commerce. The customers are gravitating towards large population centers, the Amazon affect is well underway in terms of people wanting to be closer to the customers for the possibility of same day delivery. So we're seeing a lot of activity in our global markets and that plays very well with our platform given our high percentage of land and buildings in those particular markets.","Hamid R. Moghadam","The only thing that I would add is that the three PLs are back. There are big customer segment for us. And if you would ask me a year ago how the three PLs were reacting, they were securing a contract, logistics contract before the secured real-estate and today it's exactly the opposite. They realized that because of the dwindling supply they have to secure the real-estate in order secured logistics contract.

Your line is open. ","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC","May be just going back to the compression you talked about in cap rates in Europe over the last six months relative to what you are seeing in terms of rent growth are return thresholds coming in or is your expectation in '14, '15, '16 that the growth is going to accelerate to justify that compression at this point? ","Thomas S. Olinger","I think it's anticipation of rent growth and availability of financing in Europe that are the two things that changed and also I think Financing in Europe that are the two things that are changed. And also I think it is the fact that the ice was broken, I really think our Norges transaction without dwelling on that too much was really a sign that the waters are safe. And almost immediately after that people start piling into Europe in a big way. So I think primarily the cap rents that were high, higher than elsewhere in the globe because the financing markets were more frozen then the rest of the globe, attracted people in. ","Now that cap rates have compressed I think people are attracted to Europe not because there is a little bit more cap rates compression that\u2019s going to happen but also rent growth is kicking in and you can still buy product that\u2019s below. So I think that\u2019s the attraction and it can be all finance now which it couldn\u2019t be two years ago so those are the dynamics. ","The way I would think about it Michael was that is just like the U.S. may be two and half year lag with may be the UK being only a year and half behind the U.S. and some of the parts of Eastern and Southern Europe been three years behind the U.S. and sort of the average of Europe being two and half years failing the U.S. same pattern.

And when you look at how the U.S. is leading the charge on all the operating metrics whether it\u2019s rent change on rolling in the quarter was 10.4%. So our bottom line our look through would be better than owned to manage. ","And then on the expense recovery side as I mentioned earlier there is nothing going on unusual other than Q1 of \u201913 expenses were higher than normal and that's the trail off that you see this year and going forward for the rest of this year, we don\u2019t expect any unusual expense changes and that\u2019s going to be the real occupancy and rents driving same store. ","Hamid R. Moghadam","Hey Michael by the way one thing I would add just to philosophically so you understand why we don\u2019t crack that number separately is that we\u2019ve really always operated under this philosophy of one portfolio policy and there -- our people on the field don\u2019t really differentiate whether we own 20% or something 50% or something or a 100%or something we run it on ownership blind basis. And the stats are reported on an ownership blind basis for that reason. That\u2019s the only way we can do a good job for our institutional investors. So really the only thing that Mike -- that Tom is talking about is the mix. We have more fund mix in our non U.S. business then our U.S. business. So -- and given that the U.S. is early that the mix would drive you to that conclusion. But we actually don\u2019t track those kinds of numbers by ownership type at all.","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from the line of David Harris from Imperial Capital. Your line is open.","David Harris - Imperial Capital","Yeah hello, thanks for taking my question. I apologies if you covered this, I was a little late on the call but if I look at your development cost capitalization you are running it fairly close to a $150 million on an annualized basis. Is that cost fully reflected in the development margins that you are quoting on page 23 and 24 of the current development program?","Thomas S. Olinger","Yes it is David and it\u2019s a good question. I'm actually glad somebody asked it because I get that question at NAREIT all the time. The development margins that we report not only includes capitalized overhead that matches the number that you mention but it also includes a full carry on the entire capital not just on the debt portion that's assigned to that project. So we capitalize carry throughout the development process until it reaches stabilization. So I know some people don't do it quite that way and therefore our margins if they were done in the alternative way would even appear higher than they are today. ","Hamid R. Moghadam","Okay, last opportunity for Michael to ask a question. The line is clear. Hearing none I want to thank you for your time on this call and look forward to talking to you at NAREIT, bye-bye.

My name is Tiffany, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Prologis Third Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Tracy Ward, Senior Vice President Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Tracy A. Ward","Thank you, Tiffany, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2013 conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. This morning we'll hear from Hamid Moghadam, Chairman and CEO, who will comment on the company's strategy and market condition; and then from Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover results and guidance. Additionally, we are joined today by our executive team including Gary Anderson, Mike Curless, Nancy Hemmenway, Guy Jaquier, Ed Nekritz, Gene Reilly and Diana Scott.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to quickly state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates, as well as management's beliefs and assumptions.","Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance, and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to our forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings.","I'd also like to state that our third quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO, EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures, and in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures.","[Operator Instructions] Hamid, will you please begin?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Thank you, Tracy, and good morning, everyone. It's only been a month since our Investor Forum, so we'll keep today's remarks brief and focus on the company's growth objectives, real-time market conditions and results.","As you know, our strategy going forward is simple. Our focus is on 3 growth drivers, which are: number one, capitalizing on rental recovery; number two, putting our land bank development expertise and customer relationships to work within value; and number three, leveraging our global scale.","Let's take these one at a time starting with rent. We expect significant organic rent growth to come from the U.S. and Europe over the next 4 years. In fact, this is already materializing, as we realized the 6.1% increase in net effective rents on rollovers this quarter. The supply\/demand indicators that we've been discussing for some time are coming in even stronger than we expected. U.S. net absorption for the quarter was 55 million square feet, running almost 3x the volume of completions.","We're further increasing our 2013 net absorption forecast for the U.S. to 200 million square feet, up from 180 million square feet. This will be the highest level in absorption since 2006, and still significantly below the norm for expansion. This means there may still be some upside to this forecast based on what we're hearing from our customers.","Space utilization in our facilities continues to trend higher, setting another record in the quarter. This means that our larger customers are short on space and unable to handle their current needs, much less their future growth.","Now let's look at supply. While there's no question that supply is increasing, it's important to remember that we're starting from the basement. The financial crisis drove construction to its lowest level since World War II. We are expecting 65 million square feet of completion this year, the majority of which are build-to-suits or are pre-released. To put this in perspective, these completion rates are very low in relation to the projected net absorption for the year. This record deficit of 135 million square feet doesn't even take into account product obsolescence.","As a result of this excess demand, we're forecasting the U.S. market vacancy rate to drop to 7.3% by year end, matching its prior cycle low in 2007.","Pulling this all together, our sector has substantial room for growth. You may recall from our previous commentary that the recovery of investor of fundamentals has lagged the recovery of the macro economy. Occupied space rents only 1% above its 2007 level while imports are 9% higher and GDP consumption and population are all 5% to 6% higher.","Turning elsewhere in the Americas. Despite a slowing overall economy in Brazil, demand for modern logistics base remain strong as the company need to serve the growing consumer market. In Mexico, the logistics market is a strengthening with growth from domestic consumption and exports to the U.S.","Moving to Europe. Operating fundamentals continue to improve, and for the first time in 4 years, sentiment among our customers is trending positive. Net effective rents are growing and recovery is broadening to more markets. Rent growth combined with declining cap rates will lead to a strong recovery in European values.","Demand in China is accelerating. We see new requirements from domestic retailers and e-commerce customers. Vacancy rates are extremely tight and growth rate -- and the growth in rents are quite strong with some submarkets well above 10% year-over-year.","In Japan, demand has kept pace with supply but leasing velocity is beginning to exceed our expectations. With the 2020 Olympics and improving economic environment and tightening market conditions, we expect to see increases on rents in excess of forecast.","As we look forward, we see several years of favorable market conditions across all our markets, pushing occupancy to levels last seen in the 90s, supporting our seasons of an extended period of rental growth.","I'd now like to return to our value creation activities. The lack of supply and increasing rents continue to drive our development starts. During the quarter, we started 17 new projects, totaling $494 million globally with an estimated development margin of 19%, 2\/3 of these were build-to-suit. We stabilized $500 million of development projects with an estimated margin of 38%, creating $190 million of value. We will surely grow through our value creation objectives for the year.","The high-profit spread is driven by the surge in rents and low-land basis. While we don't expect to sustain this level of margins indefinitely, they will remain elevated for some time to come. The current level clearly supports the fact that the book value for our land is significantly below its fair market value.","By a way of reminder, only 1 analyst is currently ascribing any value to our development platform in this any recalculation, in spite of consistent profitability of these businesses and some relevant recent comps in the marketplace.","Turning to the third area of growth, we'll use our scale to expand in our existing markets and increase our profitability. We have the capacity to take on $10 billion in overall assets in our existing markets without a substantial increase in G&A.","In the third quarter, we grew the platform by more than $1 billion and reduced the ratio of G&A to AUM from 70 to 68 basis points. Although this metric will bounce around between quarters, we expect to improve on with this ratio as we continue to grow our role assets.","Looking to strategic capital, the third quarter marks our largest single quarter in the history of capital raising for our open and fund business. We see an important dynamic on probing. Small to mid-size investors are committing new capital and considering allocations at levels not seen since the global financial crisis. What we hear from them is that they're underallocated to investor real estate and seeking general partner will keep operating in sector experience.","Looking ahead, we have a healthy investment key with strong interest evidenced by a number of investors in various stages of due diligence.","To sum up, we are very optimistic about the recovery in the global investor and real estate market. We are well positioned to take advantage of the unique opportunity that legally will arise through this -- through the strength of our platform.","With that, I'll turn it over to Tom.","Thomas S. Olinger","Thanks, Hamid. This morning, I'll focus my comments on 3 areas: first, results for the quarter; second, a review of deployment and capital markets activity; and third, an update on guidance for the remainder of the year.","Starting with our financial results for the third quarter, core FFO was $0.41 a share, in line with our expectations. From a core FFO run rate perspective, Q3 was up about $0.02 from Q2, excluding the promote we recognized last quarter. This higher sequential run rate was driven by the deployment of proceeds from our first half contributions and equity offering.","During the quarter, we stabilized $500 million in developments with $165 million, our share value creation representing a 38% margin.","We continue to see improvement in our operating portfolio metrics this quarter. Occupancy was 93.9%, up 20 basis points from the second quarter. Spaces over 250,000 square feet remain effectively sold out with occupancy at 98.2%. For spaces less than 100,000 square feet, occupancy was 90%, up 60 basis points sequentially. We saw a significant increase in average lease term for the quarter at 59 months, which was driven by leases signed for build-to-suit projects.","Rent growth continues to accelerate broadly. GAAP rent changes on rollover was 6.1%, up 210 basis points sequentially, and evident across all geographic divisions and space sizes, as well as new and renewal leases. It's important to point out that our rent change calculation includes all leases signed during the quarter greater than 30 days for both new and renewal leases and regardless of how long the spaces were vacant. As we stated before, we think the most meaningful metric is net effective rent change. However, to provide you with perspective, cash rent change on rollover was a positive 0.4%, up 380 basis points sequentially.","For the quarter, same-store NOI increased 1.4% on a GAAP basis and 1.8% on an adjusted cash basis. Same-store NOI will lag releasing spreads given that the NOI results we report in the third quarter primarily relate to leases signed in the first half the year.","Moving to Investment Management, income was higher this quarter by almost $5 million due to growth in assets under management, primarily related to contributions to our J-REIT. On a go forward run rate basis, Investment Management income will grow in line with assets and fluctuate with these associated with fund deployment and promotes.","Turning to our deployment activity in the third quarter. We had contributions and dispositions of $792 million with $361 million, our share. We invested $1.9 billion in building and land acquisitions, development starts and equity investments in our ventures with $1.5 billion, our share. Subsequent to quarter end, we acquired our venture partners of approximate 80% interest in the SGP Mexico fund. We had an opportunity to acquire these high-quality assets before the end of the investment period and are pleased to rationalize another fund.","Moving onto capital markets' activity in the quarter. We continue to make significant progress in lowering our borrowing costs and extending our debt maturities, providing us with further flexibility to fund growth. In the third quarter we completed approximately $6.3 billion of capital markets transactions including debt financings, refinancings and pay downs. This included the upsizing of our 2 global lines of credit, the issuance of new senior notes and attentive. As a result of this activity, we lowered our weighted-average GAAP interest rate by about 30 bps and increased the weighted average term by nearly 6 months.","Our next significant debt maturity is not occurring until October 2014, and after that, we have no material maturities until 2016.","As a reminder, the weighted average GAAP interest rates shown in our supplemental for unsecured bonds and secured mortgage debt is approximately 5.1%, which compares to a coupon rate for this debt over the next 5 years of 6%.","As we discussed at our investor forum, even in a rising interest rate environment, we have an opportunity to refinance or debt, extend term and continue to reduce borrowing costs in a very meaningful way. We did see a temporary increase in leverage this quarter given timing around deployment. At quarter end, our look through leverage was 37.9%, net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 7.7x and fixed charge coverage increased to 2.6x.","We continue to expect to end the year with look through leverage below 35% and debt to adjusted EBITDA under 7x.","Now let me turn to guidance for the remainder of 2013. For operations, our previous GAAP same-store NOI range was between 1.5% and 2.5%. As we've discussed on prior calls, we've been focusing on driving rent growth over occupancy, which temporarily impacts same-store NOI in the short term but propels it in the long-term. We expect to be at the low end of this range for the full year. We expect year-end occupancy will range between 94% and 95%. For FX, we're assuming the euro at 1.35 and the yen at 98 [ph] for the fourth quarter. On expense side, we're forecasting our net G&A to range between $228 million to $232 million.","For capital deployment, we're narrowing our 2013 forecast to range between $3.8 billion to $4.1 billion. This includes development starts of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion for the year, which implies $600 million to $700 million in the fourth quarter, with our share of approximately 75%. This range is lower at the top and versus our previous guidance as a result of timing.","Building acquisitions of $800 million to $1 billion for the year with $120 million to $320 million occurring in the fourth quarter with our share of about 45% and $1.2 billion of equity investments in our funds, which we completed as of the end of the third quarter. We're not expecting to make any further significant fund investments for the rest of the year.","Switching to development stabilizations. We expect to stabilize about $1.4 billion in 2013 and an estimated margin of approximately 28%, generating our share value creation of $350 million.","For contributions and dispositions, we're maintaining our guidance of $8.5 billion to $10 billion. Year-to-date, we've completed $6.6 billion. This leaves $1.9 billion to $3.4 billion for the fourth quarter with our share of the proceeds at about 80%. The remaining activity relates to contributions in Europe and Japan and dispositions in the U.S. and Japan. In addition, this range also includes a couple of potential transactions that could materialize by year end.","Now putting all of this together, using the midpoints of our deployment, contributions and disposition guidance, we will generate approximately $1.6 billion, our share of net proceeds in the fourth quarter.","We are narrowing our full year core FFO guidance to $1.64 to $1.66 per share, which implies Q4 core FFO range between $0.41 and $0.43 a share.","Before I turn it back to Hamid, I want to highlight 2 new enhancements in our supplemental this quarter. The first relates to disclosure on stabilized value creation. As we shared at the Investor Forum, transparency into our ability to create value through development is a key to understanding this important business. This disclosure will allow you to gauge our ability to consistently create value from development over the long term. The second disclosure highlights our net equity exposure by currency. Our U.S. dollar and equity at quarter end was 73% and we've continued to expect to be at approximately 82% by year end.","With that, I'll turn it back to Hamid.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Thanks, Tom. Let me close by summarizing the key takeaways from our call. Absorption in the U.S. is outpacing supply and vacancy is dropping faster than we expected, supporting the case for an extended period of significant rental growth.","For Europe, the rental recovery combined with what we believe to be a significant cap rate compression over the next 12 months, is expected to lead with strong recovery in values. And the combination of rental growth to profitable buildout of our land bank and improvements in efficiencies resulting from scale, set us up nicely for an extended period of robust earnings growth.","Let's open up the call to your questions. Tiffany?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brendan Maiorana with Wells Fargo Securities.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I want to ask a question about the same-store, appreciate the update on the guidance, Tom. If I'm thinking about it correctly in what you guys have done year-to-date, it still implies a pretty big ramp in Q4 and given that you're focused a little more on rent growth than occupancy growth, just wondering, how you get there and can you also provide a little bit of commentary on why the operating expenses seem to be higher in '13 versus '12 and what that may do as we go into next year.","Thomas S. Olinger","Okay, Brendan, thanks. On same-store, you're right, we think we're going to end at the low end of our range and we've been focusing on rent change, for sure, on our rents and not so much on occupancy. And we've seen occupancy be a little below where we thought it would be, hence, the low end of the guidance. But we feel very good about the trend. If you look at our GAAP same-store throughout the year, 0.3% in Q1 to 0.7% in Q2, then now 1.4%, we're on a very positive trajectory. The other thing to note, if you look at rent change, the rent change figure we report reflects signings in the quarter, and the signings are typically 3 to 6 months in advance of the effective date, so there's a natural lag between the rent change we're reporting today in Q3. And when that will actually come through our NOI is a couple of quarter lag. So you put those together, we feel good about the trajectory of our same-store growth. On the expense side, I think there's nothing systemic going on at all. On expenses, it's just timing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson with Morgan Stanley.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A lot of skeptics out there are surprised at the continued strong absorption, just given a fairly tepid U.S. economic recovery and disappointing job growth, which ultimately should weigh on the shipment of goods. How are you feeling about the continued strength of the economic recovery based on your conversations with tenants? And also, how do you feel about your own ability to outperform?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Vance, I don't think we're outperforming, nor is the industrial market outperforming. I think there's a false impression out there that I'd like to correct, and I tried to do it in the prepared remarks. In occupied industrial space is only 1% prior to where it was in 2007. Yet imports are 9% higher, GDP consumption, every other measure, people, just population, every other measure drive industrial demand, it's 5% to 6% higher. So we still got another 4% to grow before we catch up with the other economic parameters. So we're not ahead of any economy. We're behind and hopefully, quickly catching up, but still pretty significantly behind. So I think it will last longer. Whenever the U.S. economy normalizes, I think industrial demand is going to exceed that for some period of time until it gets back into North. It's very simple.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Jaime Feldman with Jeff. So I guess with fundamentals a little bit ahead of what you guys originally thought, what does this mean for your prospects for development starts and timing to reach kind of your peak outlook for development starts?","Hamid R. Moghadam","We don't have a peak outlook for development starts. What we've said for about 3.5 years is that we expect in a normalized year, development to be about $2.5 billion. That's really a buildup of individual market opportunities as our people see them. That is not a target. We're not shooting to any given target. That's what we think it will be across the cycle. And frankly, we'll get there whenever we get there. I mean -- and we may exceed it for a period of time, we may fall short over a period of time. It's not the target. The good news is that we're making $300 million to $400 million in that business and none of that is reflected in any kind of valuation. So I guess it's not a very sensitive number.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gabe Hilmoe with UBS.","Gabriel Hilmoe - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Tom, on the disposition and contribution guidance, how should we think about Mexico and the Mexican REIT for that equation? I'm just trying to get a sense of the pieces to get your guidance.","Thomas S. Olinger","Well the -- Mexico is not in our guidance at all.","Hamid R. Moghadam","I think another way of saying that is that there isn't any change in Mexico anticipated in our guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Auerbach with ISI group.","George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","The cash spread will spread -- clearly improved this quarter. As we look out to 2014, how do you see cash rent spreads can trend? I'm sure the spreads will improve, but any color as to how positive you think they can be?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Yes, George, as we've talked about before, we actually don't think that's an important number. And here's why. Because I think this is a really important question and we're not apartments, we have leases that are usually 5 years in duration. So take a normal situation where you have a 5-year lease with 2% escalations every year, okay? The ending rent on that lease from a cash point of view will be 10% higher than the beginning rent on that lease, just very simply. And if the market keeps going at 2%, that starting number for the new lease will be identical to the ending number for the old lease. So if we're doing our job and getting escalations in all the leases that we signed, that metric will always be 0, which is pretty disappointing. However, if we did something less optimal, we signed flat leases for 5 years and never got any rental escalations, that statistic would look great because it would say 10% change on lease expirations. So I don't understand for the life of me why that metric is important. And we don't spend any time projecting it. So I really, in all honesty can't answer your question because it doesn't really drive any value in our business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital.","Craig Mailman - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Hamid, just one -- curious about your comment in the release about tenants kind of just taking space where they need now or not expansion space. Just with rents going higher and absorption continuing and good space is being taken up here, kind of what's going to drive beneath them to take a little bit of perspective space for growth in their business, just curious what tenants are saying.","Hamid R. Moghadam","So Craig, that's a really good question. A day or 2 after we had -- or actually a day or 2 before we had our Investor Forum with you guys, we actually had the top customers from around the world here in San Francisco and we were trying to get their perspective and share with them ours. I think what's going on is that companies are laser focused on margins and costs because their revenue growth has been anemic, so they try to basically produce the bottom line by being really vigilant on cost. They've been doing that for 4 or 5 years and frankly, they're out of opportunities to do that. They would like to do more of it but they can't. So anytime somebody has to make a decision, okay, do I build 1 million square foot warehouse, which is probably going to be a $70 million investment with another $100 million of inventory and improvements in it, ultimately to run my business. That's a pretty big capital investment that the CEO has to make. And if the CEO is reading the same newspapers as we are, he's going to say, \"Okay, let's just try to lease a little bit more, extend our lease, can we get the adjacent space in the same building or something.\" But they're trying to avoid making that big CapEx decision. And by and large, I would say they were successful until about a year or 2 ago. They can't anymore. They're just drifting at the same. So the opportunity becomes losing business. I think 1.5% vacancy in buildings larger than 250,000 feet really tells you something about how tight this space is and how high the utilization rate is. I think if we get a bit of small business formation going that affects the smaller buildings, 100,000 feet and lower, I think you could see these occupancy rates go up in excess of 95%, 96% pretty quickly, because the supply side is not going to be able to catch up with us that quickly. So we think it's a pretty interesting dynamic. People are trying to defer major capital investments as much as they can, but they can't anymore. They've got to take space. And you're seeing it for some of the large players. Gene, do you have any perspective you want to add to that?","Eugene F. Reilly","Yes, I think the only area we're seeing some kind of forward thinking is really in online retailers. So a lot of build-to-suit demand, as all of you know, is coming from that segment where it's, basically, a new business line and in some cases, it's very defensive, a lot of the bricks and mortar retailers, you're going to see a lot of build-to-suit demand from traditional bricks and mortar retailers trying to compete with Amazon and that's defensive. So in those cases, you're going to see them wanting to take more space and making capital investment. But otherwise, I mean, it's right. They've been reluctant to do so. But when your utilization rate is peaked out and the market vacancies are low, you don't really have any choices.","Michael S. Curless","I'd just add that, I think a customer said that it's a little bit different geography to geography. If you think about Europe, for example, there has certainly been a return of confidence in Europe but it's still a mixed picture. But generally speaking, I think things are improving. You look at Japan, I mean, customer sentiment is very high in Japan today first because of the Abe economic policies and now because of the 2020 Olympics, so very, very positive sentiment there. And in China, sentiment hasn't changed in a while, it's just very, very strong. And in fact, again, a day or 2 ago, GDP came out, it was 7.8% [ph] as opposed to 7.7%. So again, pretty strong sentiment in Asia in general.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. Tom, I just had a question, just sort of putting all the pieces together in your guidance but also thinking about the run rate. So you had about $0.41 of core FFO in the quarter, your guidance for the year implies, let's call $0.42, $0.43, I recognized the year share count was a little bit higher than the first few quarters, but somewhere in that range of $0.42, $0.43, yet you have $1.6 billion of dispositions in terms of proceeds and I don't know what you're doing with that money, not only thinking about what's happening in the fourth quarter, but as you move forward into 2014, The Street currently is at $1.78, almost $0.45 a quarter. How do you sort of make the leap from where you are today to that point, but also even into the fourth quarter with the deleveraging that's occurring?","Thomas S. Olinger","Well as you look forward, we will be redeploying that capital that we're generating in the fourth quarter but there will be a time lag, but you have to remember, when you look at our earnings from a run rate perspective, we're stabilizing $1.4 billion of real estate in 2013. That comes into producing NOI. We continue to have rent growth. We've seen it. The same-store is following that but it's coming. And we also have the effect of discontinued deleveraging. The impact of what we've done in the last, really, 3 quarters from an interest rate perspective now is coming through full force. So there will be a lag in redeploying that capital, probably in the first quarter of next year as we look out. But I think we'll get right back on track and we've got other drivers i.e. development stabilizations and rent growth that help offset that.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of John Guinee with Stifel.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just to focus a little bit on net asset value. It looks to me as if your FFO and AFFO numbers are based on about 504.5 million share denominator. But then when I look at Page 32, you list your common stock as 498.6 million shares, and then when I go back into the supplemental, you have the effect of some exchangeable debt. So your total share count is about 517 million shares. Can you help us sort of walk through the differences here, specifically on the correct denominator for an NAV analysis?","Thomas S. Olinger","The correct denominator would be the smaller of the 2 numbers because what you're seeing is that the impact of, effectively, converting our convertible debt. That convertible debt that sits out there, the denominator and the larger when it's 500 million plus, assumes that, that those shares are exercised to convert that debt. So it's clearly the -- that is the main driver of the difference. And when you look at our NAV page, you should be using the 498 million, that is the right number to use for NAV.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Petersen with MLV Company.","Jonathan M. Petersen - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","I appreciate in your disclosure around the development value creation page and supplemental. Can you help us quantify, I'm kind of curious, how much of the 38% margin this quarter is directly related to the lower land bank value? And then also, can you just kind of walk us through how you underwrite developments to get to the 19% forecast on margins for start this quarter? I'm trying to get a sense of like, how you guys think about cap rates going forward, rents, do you use today's rents or projected rents, just trying to get a sense of how conservative that is given how large margins are today.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Generally the way we underwrite development deals is that we use our market forecast for rents, the same market forecast that drive our operating assumptions and all that. So they could be flat, they could be up. In majority of cases, today they're up, and actually we've been exceeding those expectations and pretty much most of the development that we've been stabilizing. So in other words, we've been underestimating rental growth. Cap rates, by and large, we don't underwrite cap rate compression in our developments at all. In fact, I would say that in a few of them right now we have baked in some cap rate -- slight cap rate expansion. So I think the normal margins, as you've heard me say many times, I think in a normalized market when you're buying land at markets, for spec should be around 15 and for a very high credit build-to-suit should be as low as 10, so the average should be 12, 13, 14, depending on the mix. So you can think of -- forget about the 38. The 38 is just a goofy number in some unusual cases. It's real money but it's not a sustainable number. I think, yes, we've been averaging in the high teens, call it 19, and if the average is 14, should be, that means there's 5 points of excess margin and if land is 25% of the total investment, 5 points on 25% means that your land is undervalued by 20%. That's the quick math. It depends on parcel by parcel, but that would be the quick math. So I don't know, our land bank is $1.8 billion, and if you apply the 20% to it, you could argue that it's worth $350 million, more than that.","Thomas S. Olinger","The only other comment we might want to make is that we've taken our weighted average cost of capital for every geography.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Right. So the margin is after an overhead allocation and it's also after full carry at the cost of capital of a given market, which would be, for example, higher in China and Brazil than it would be in the U.S. and Japan..","Thomas S. Olinger","Which differs from the GAAP carrier rate that gets reported.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Yes, and it's higher.","Thomas S. Olinger","Yes and just to finish the last part of his question, relative to the pool of the stabilizations, those 2 facilities that were driving the numbers higher by over 2\/3 of the tank well [ph] was well over 20% and I'd suggest that those all had implied increase land value as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Eric Frankel with Green Street Advisors.","Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","I was just wondering, one, if you can just go over why CapEx seems to be a little bit elevated relative to historical figures? And 2, just noted that there weren't any starts from Japan this quarter, just wondering if there is any supply concerns there?","Eugene F. Reilly","Eric, it's Gene. I'll take the capital. In a couple of calls ago, we talked about this. If we look at a CapEx overall, that trailing fourth quarter number is ticking up a little bit. But remember, that takes into consideration lease expenses and turnover costs, which tend to be volatile, and those are going to be going up on a dollar basis because we're signing longer leases and higher rents, and that's going to trigger higher commissions, and probably slightly higher TI. But the best way to take a look at that is on Page 15 of the supplemental, where we talked about turnover costs as a percentage of the value of the lease because that's the right metric to think about. We're investing this capital to get in return, a lease, and that's actually declining quarter-over-quarter. I think that's probably going to stay at the sort of low 7s. But in terms of overall capital, as I said, we were ticking along at 12% through the last year or so, that's up to 14%, 15%, close to 15% right now. That will settle out 13% to 14% in the long-term. And it may take a quarter or 2 to get there, the reason for that is, we're -- through our dispositions and repositioning program, we're reducing the age of this portfolio, increasing the quality. And that has a significant effect on our normal capital that we spend, roofs and parking lots. So it's elevated this quarter but over the long-term, you're going to see that come down to 13%, 14%.","Thomas S. Olinger","And Eric, with respect to Japan, we started 2 buildings in Japan, couple $100 million. We said, generally speaking, that we would expect to start somewhere in the range of $400 million to $500 million per year and that's still our general view. I am not at all concerned about demand and supply in Japan. They're still well-balanced. The new deliveries that are coming to market are basically ending up being pre-leased as they come to market. And you will see a slight uptick in 2014 in terms of vacancy rates, they're going to move from call it 1% to 2%, to call it 4% or 5%, but that's still very, very low. So we're pretty comfortable with Japan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Sullivan with Cowen.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Can you share with us the cap rate on the buyout of your partner in Mexican fund?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Jim, we can't for confidentiality reasons. But you're a smart enough guy, you can figure it out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Can you discuss -- give a little bit of color on leasing trends in Europe for the quarter there? And then also just give any amount of influence you've seen into the investment management business there? Rich, specifically, for European funds, can you just give us a sense of what kind of the return expectations are, for the [indiscernible] coming in?","Thomas S. Olinger","Well in terms of leasing activity, I think leasing has been pretty consistent in Europe. I actually feel good about where our occupancy levels are today. We've maintained 93% occupancy levels throughout the year and that percentage is actually going to increase, I think by year end. If you really dig into it though to see what's happening in Europe, you really have to take a deeper look at each one of the countries. We're operating in 14 different countries there. Only 3 of those countries are below 90% occupancy levels today. So in those markets we're solving for occupancy, and those markets are the markets that we've talked about before: Spain, Italy and Hungary. Spain, for example, has increased in occupancy, 700 basis points over the course of the last year. And in the other markets like the U.K., Germany, Sweden, Slovakia, some of the stronger markets where you see occupancies at 97%, 98% 99%, we're pushing rents. So again, I think that the leasing trend is positive and the rent growth trends, generally speaking in Europe, is positive as well. In terms of new investor activity, there's been a ton of investor interest in our funds. We've seen that manifest itself over the course of the quarter in terms of new investment. Return expectations, I think, would probably be in the -- for core, in the 8% to 9% range.","Unknown Executive","On leverage.","Thomas S. Olinger","On leverage, sorry.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It looks like the Japan sequential occupancy dipped from Q2. Was that a mix issue or is that something else in there driving it down?","Thomas S. Olinger","A single building issue. We had a 620,000 square foot building come vacant in Sentrar [ph]. It was a consolidation play, nothing to be concerned about. I'm happy with that building coming back. We'll get it leased up and that will look great again shortly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers with Baird.","David B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Follow-up on some of the smallest space leasing trends maybe since May or April of earlier this year, I guess one would be a clarification question, do you include your development leases in the average length and the TIs that you quote? Maybe Tony can give us some color on that, and then I think the second part of that is really, you got a higher margin length of deals you're signing, you're singing larger deals as you said, does that imply that you're seeing more challenges on leasing up the smaller space? And can you give us some more color about the small space leasing, particularly in the last 6 months?","Thomas S. Olinger","Dave, our leasing activity and the average trend does also include our development leasing.","Eugene F. Reilly","And David, it's Gene, I'll take the second part of the question, and I think Gary will provide some color, too. What we've really banked on in the small space leasing, in the U.S., we had a 90 basis points over the quarter, by the way, in sub 100,000 square foot units. We've been banking on the housing recovery, that's been a pretty good recovery, until the last couple of months where, if you look at the headline numbers, the broad macroeconomic numbers, that's flat total a little bit, but I think that's a normal reaction to interest rates frankly spiking during the spring and early summer. And we think this is going to resume and our customer activity tells us that, that you'll see a continual increase in home building activity. So we are, I'm going to be really clear on this one, we're really bullish about small space leasing, and it's really broad based. All of our markets in the Americas right now are active in terms of small spaces. So we don't have any laggers anymore. Places like Chicago and Atlanta, which have been really slow to recover and particularly in that segment are active. And we push rents 6% over the quarter in that segment. And finally, we'll see, obviously small business job formation is going to be the future for that segment of our portfolio. We'll see how that plays out over the next couple of years. And one thing to remember, the discount to replacement cost rents in that segment is more significant than any other. There's 0 construction virtually in that segment and as it does recover, that's our best chance to push rents in the portfolio. So we're bullish at this point and the activity right now is pretty good, despite what you see in the headlines.","Hamid R. Moghadam","And just, with respect to the average lease term, it did go from 49 to 59 this quarter, it is driven really by the build-to-suit leasing. If you look at the operating portfolio leases, they were about 45 months, the development leases were really 140 months, skewed somewhat by a large deal that we did in the U.K. with Sainsbury a build-to-suit that was a million square feet and 25-year lease. So I think again it's underscoring that there's really limited opportunities in the greater than 250,000 square foot category and customers are having to go to build-to-suits, big buildings, long-term leases and they happen to pay replacement cost rents, which again, I think, sort of underscores our rental growth projections.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just to follow-up, it's Jamie again. Can you talk about cap rates and just what's happened maybe over the quarter across your markets, whether they're up or down or flat?","Michael S. Curless","Yes. This is Mike Curless. Frankly, we thought we'd see broad stabilization of cap rates and we saw yet again a little bit of compression, particularly in the coastal markets, LA, you're seeing 5 and tick below, similar numbers in Bay Area and the East Coast, middle of the country, squarely in the 5s and 6s and where we saw the most compression continues to be in the B product in the global market, as well as some select regional markets, that markets like Las Vegas, Indianapolis, seeing some pretty impressive numbers in terms of their cap rate compression. We do expect over time this to level out and that sees much compression going forward. But in general positive news in the quarter. In Europe, we're seeing U.K. breaking the 6 barrier into the 5s, Central and Eastern Europe in the 7s and everywhere else somewhere in between. I think as Gary mentioned before, we got a good 100 points of room if not more in that part of the world and seeing good results in Asia and Brazil as well.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Jim, just to add, in China and Japan over the quarter, we saw, call it 10 basis points, something like that. But I was in Europe for Expo Real, which is the big trade fair there. And we met with vendors, investors, bankers, competitors, and I can only tell you that my prior view was reinforced. We are absolutely at their inflection point, I'm certain of that, and values which really haven't moved in 4.5 years and they dropped, call it 25%, 26% from peak, are about to move up. And it's going to be a combination of 2 things: rental growth and cap rate compression. And I think it's going to move faster than people realize.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Maiorana with Wells Fargo Securities.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I just want to follow-up on land. I think there were $25 million or $27 million of land sales in the quarter. I know we've spoken a lot about what the value, the current market value of the land bank, maybe relative to the development margins that you're getting. Just wondering if there were gains on those sales and what the magnitude of the gains may have been? If any.","Thomas S. Olinger","Brendan, this is Tom. The gains on land, that we did have gains, it was pretty, it was nominal.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Yes. Remember what we're selling, we're selling the stuff that we don't want to develop. As you know, we've categorized our land into a number of different buckets depending on the timeframe for monetization and also strategic fit. And by and large, we're still -- not by and large, we're exclusively selling things that are not a strategic fit for our business. So those would be the ones that you would expect the lowest spreads of fund. And frankly, as we're getting ready to sell them, they've been scrapped on mark-to-markets so by definition, they're held for sale and there should be nothing on those anyway.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of follow-up questions regarding your -- the fund-raising activities. First, you raised your equity stake in a couple of your European funds. So my first question is, what is the appraised cap rate you're buying these funds at? Or buying these fund at versus an improving market in Europe and where you think spot rates could go, maybe 6 months forward, with maybe half a year, better data points in Europe? And second, with equity, third party equity rates, your rates, are just a substantial amount of dry powder. For your capital deployment activity, how should we think about this going forward? And how much of this will you use to sell on balance sheet assets to your funds versus third party acquisitions?","Hamid R. Moghadam","So generally in Europe, the cap rates in our funds are in the mid-7s and that's where we've been deploying capital. And as you heard a few minutes ago, our view -- we don't have a 6 months view. We're not that smart, but we think in a couple of years, cap rates in Europe can be, for this still same asset, can be in the mid-6s anyway. So 100 points to 125 basis points of decline. That would put them in their traditional historical relationship to U.S. cap rates and global cap rates. So we do think the opportunity in Europe is pretty unique that way. I would say we are pretty much done with buying up in our funds. I'm not going to say that we won't ever do any more of it, in the near-term we might, but I think we're substantially done with that program of investing in our funds. And I don't remember the back half of your question.","Unknown Executive","[indiscernible] acquisitions.","Thomas S. Olinger","What are you going to do with the dry powder.","Unknown Executive","We're going to buy on balance sheet...","Hamid R. Moghadam","Oh, yes. So we have -- remember, the contributions from the balance sheet assets were essentially deferred for 3 or 4 years. So there were a bunch of parks that had buildings built on them that were sitting on the balance sheet that normally belong to the funds because the funds we are dealing is the balance of those assets. So many of the acquisitions that will take place in the funds for which we raise capital will come from the balance sheet as part of our contribution program or sale program to those funds because those will have to go there to complete the parks and create integrated ownership of parks. On a steady-state basis, we will not have these assets pile up on the balance sheet by and large, because you will have a normal recycling of assets into the fund. Our strategy overseas is to own everything within funds. So by definition, the balance sheet assets that are development will end up in funds on probably a more continuous regular basis.","Thomas S. Olinger","Kim, just to reiterate, so by the end of Q4, we think most of those balance sheet assets, as Hamid said, will be contributed. The funds have all the equity raised and it's a matter of just assets coming off the pipeline as they stabilize.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Yes and we continue to buy third party assets too, and at a significant clip. But I think the numbers for the balance of this year will be overwhelmingly balance sheet contributions and beyond this year, I think it will be a more balanced mix.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just following up on one of the prior questions, Hamid. You were quoting 7.5 cap rates in Europe dropping down to 6.5. How does that correspond on a per pound basis, is the 7.5 cap 80% of replacement costs or 120% of replacement costs, typically?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Well it's 80% of replacement costs. I mean that's why you're not getting any construction, certainly you're not getting any spec construction in Europe and few build-to-suits because you can go lease existing space for a big discount. So I think rents have to move quite a bit before you'll see them exceed replacement costs and therefore be a catalyst for development.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi.","Hamid R. Moghadam","We should probably move on. Probably Michael dropped off.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from line of Jim Sullivan with Cowen.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just a follow-up question on some of these leasing metrics, and I don't want to make too much of these numbers. But looking at them, the retention ratio has declined here in the third quarter versus what it was over the prior several quarters although admittedly, it is just a little bit higher than it was in Q1. And at the same time, of course, spreads have been widening. And I guess, the general question is, are you getting push back from customers as you try and push rents? Understood there's not a lot of spec construction or spec development available, but to what extent, given uncertainties, given concerns about growth on the part of tenants, are you just seeing a real reluctance to accept any sort of increases?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Jim, we get push back from tenants even when we try to drop rent. But 80% retention is pretty good. If anything, I'd give the guys a little bit of grief over that. I think that's almost too high. If we are in the business of pushing rents, I think that number should be more like low 70s. So I'm not at all concerned by that number. But Gene, do you want to add any color?","Eugene F. Reilly","No. It's kind of interesting. And the same is true for -- we had some markets, Jim, that are, some submarkets that are 99% leased.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Right.","Eugene F. Reilly","And I think, maybe you and I have actually talked about this, that's a bit too high. Frankly, you're not pushing rents high enough if that's the case. I mean, getting to your fundamental question on resistance. Of course, our customers see these spaces as a cost set [ph] , that's always been a focus with markets and that. But I'll tell you, it's also a part of their supply chain and they're trying to ring on efficiencies in the supply chain and save dollars overall. So ultimately, they need spaces there in good locations that affect their transportation costs and modern spaces that they can utilize with high levels of efficiency. So with respect to modern space, sure, there's pushback. But as you can see in the numbers, we've been pretty successful in pushing rents. For Class-B and Class-C space, you have to ask other guys for that. But so far, so good.","Operator","I will now turn the conference back over to our presenters.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Can we have a couple more questions? Is Michael Bilerman on the queue still?","Operator","Michael Bilerman with Citi, your line is open.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So just 2 quick follow-ups. One was just on the sales in the fourth quarter, so the $1.9 billion to $3.4 billion, it's a pretty wide range, we're a month into the quarter. So maybe you can sort of just breakdown, you talked about European contributions, Japan contributions, U.S. sales and Japan sales, and then some other things that could materialize, sort of what are the buckets? What is sort of in place? And what would happen? And the second question was just in terms of rent. And I guess we've gone back and forth about what to look at. What we do know is on Page 17, your rents that are expiring at about 515 a foot, globally your share. What is the current rent per foot that you're signing today and where do you think that could go next year so we can think about the marketplace of rents, both in place and then some market growth, to know where that spread goes?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Michael, our range is by the way, a lot smaller than it was last year before we did the Norges transaction and the J-REIT as you guys kept asking us about on this call last year. So we're improving, huh? Tightening our range?","Eugene F. Reilly","Michael, so color on, so if you look at the midpoint for dispositions and contributions, it\u2019s about $2.2 billion. And that would, the mix of that would be contributions primarily in Europe and Brazil and Japan. We already completed some, in Japan already in October, that's about $1.5 billion. And then you have sales predominantly in the U.S. and a little bit in Japan, that is about $700 million, that's $2.2 billion gets you right to the midpoint. Like I said in my prepared remarks, there's a couple of other things that could transpire we're working on. But that's a matter, I believe of timing, in whether -- but at the midpoint, things are, I feel very, very confident about our midpoint. Your second question on rents.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Second question was asking for guidance for Europe, which we're not providing at the moment.","Thomas S. Olinger","But we did say in the last quarter's call, the mark-to-market rents were basically 5 to 10 and I think that's probably pretty consistent today.","Hamid R. Moghadam","If anything, it's a little wider, I would say.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","A quick one. You guys quote stabilized yield or margins on development starts and a stabilization is now. I remember, several years ago, you guys used to quoted add contribution when you actually sold the assets to the funds. So my question is, how do those projected margins and cap rates compare to when you actually sell in to the fund?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Well, first of all, our strategy's changed dramatically from a few years ago. I think a few years ago, there was so much focus on contributions to the funds and quarterly earnings and that was in the FFO number and it created a lot of, I think, unnatural behavior. I think our business strategy right now, is that development is a source of creating value and whether we realize that value through contributions or third party sales, or frankly, keep the assets in our portfolio and enjoy a higher return over time. Those are all equivalents. So what we'd rather talk about is value creation as opposed to value realization. But your question is a good one, how does value realization compared with value creation? And I would say, so far in the cycle, it's exceeded it pretty substantially. And that's why we are now showing you both what the realizations are and what the actual creations are. But our own focus is on value creation, not realization. The act of actually selling it, it's kind of like looking at a portfolio manager who has a bunch of stocks and saying, \"Well, did you sell IBM at the end of the quarter?\" That's the only way you get to account for your results. No, there's a market value for it and it's very important part of our business and frankly, we're disappointed that we're not getting valuation for that over $300 million a year kind of engine that we showed the track record to everyone about a month ago. So hopefully, over the cycle, that will become more of a real value in the eyes of most people.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just one of the focuses of the investor day was working down the land banks there. Just giving the budgeting process right now, as we look ahead to '14, what's kind of -- what do you think that realistically can be monetized there? And as you're putting it in the budget, how much land you think you're going to need to, for '14 at this point to start adding to restart the pipeline?","Michael S. Curless","This is Mike, and we've said on a couple of calls, our IDSI is a land bank would support a run rate of $2 billion to $2.5 billion worth of development and lands 25%, that would translate to roughly $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion in total land size. We're working our way towards that in the last year, we put off almost a couple $100 million. And not only have we gotten total size now, but we also reconstituted the quality of the land bank and I think that will pay off significantly as we continue to monetize those sites. So I think we're headed in the right direction and at the end of the day, $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion remains our ideal target.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. You'd mentioned, I think there's a $400 million number of non-core of land. Is there any chance of expediting that or is that just kind of going to be work through the process at this point?","Michael S. Curless","We'll continue to work through that. Our nonstrategic land this year, we've already sold $100 million of that, and we have an activity to continue to reduce that. So over time, that would be a smaller, much smaller part of our land bank.","Hamid R.

We see historically low vacancy in the mid 4s, with supply and demand balanced at 75 million square feet each. Rents have outperformed and as a result, we are raising our 2019 U.S. rent growth forecast from 6% to 7%, leading to an 80 basis point increase in our global rent forecast to 6.5%.","Activity across Europe remains healthy. In the UK, while overall demand is solid and our build-to-suit pipeline is very active, we are highlighting the Midlands as a supplier risk. We continue to forecast 2019 rent growth on the continent to be the highest in more than a decade. Fundamentals in Japan are improving with vacancy in Tokyo had less than 3% and Osaka at less than 6%, the lowest points in five years.","From an operating standpoint, you will see that our quarterly results reflect our strategy of prioritizing rents over occupancy to maximize long-term lease economics. We leased 38 million square feet, including nearly 6 million square feet in our development portfolio. Quarter end occupancy was 96.5%, down 30 basis points sequentially and remains above our five-year average. Rent change on roll for the quarter hit an all-time high of 37%, led by the U.S. at 41.7%.","Our share of cash same-store NOI growth was 4.3% for the quarter, which was impacted by a 60-basis point reduction in average occupancy, again consistent with our strategy to push rents. Globally our in-place to market rent spread widened by 40 basis points in the quarter and is now almost 15.5% or over $400 million in nominal terms. Core FFO was $0.97 per share for the third quarter, which included $0.18 of net promote income from our Co-In venture. The promote came in above our forecast as Europe valuations increased more than 2% in the third quarter.","For deployment, starts in the quarter were $577 million with an estimated margin of 22% and included about two-thirds build-to-suits. The pace of starts will increase significantly in the fourth quarter. Stabilizations were $658 million with an estimated margin of 37% and value creation of over $242 million. We continue to access capital globally at very attractive terms. During the quarter we issued $2.8 billion of debt primarily in euro at a weighted average fixed interest rate of under 1% and a weighted average term of more than 14 years.","It's worth pointing out that we have an annual need for an incremental $600 million of non-dollar debt to naturally hedge our growing international assets. These issuances lowered our total weighted average interest rate by 10 basis points to 2.4% and lengthened our weighted average maturity by about two years to just under eight years. We continue to maintain significant investment capacity on the balance sheet with the $11.7 billion of liquidity and potential fund sell downs. In addition, there is an incremental $5.4 billion of existing third-party investment capacity in our ventures today.","Guidance for 2020, which I know many of you are looking for will be provided at our upcoming Investor Forum on November 5th.","For 2019 guidance, I'll cover the highlights and then I'll share basis and note this guidance does not include the positive impact of the IPT acquisition. We are increasing the bottom end of our cash same-store NOI guidance by 25 basis points and now expect a range of 4.75% to 5%. We are raising the midpoint for development starts by $250 million and now expect starts to range between $2.2 billion and $2.5 billion.","Build-to-suits will comprise more than 40% of total starts which is above our initial expectations. We are projecting $650 million of net deployment uses which we plan to fund with free cash flow and debt. Net promote income for the full year is now expected to be $0.18 per share, an increase of $0.02 from our prior guidance. For the full year, we are increasing our 2019 core FFO guidance midpoint by $0.03 and narrowing the range to between $3.30 and $3.32 per share.","And our revised midpoint growth in core FFO per share excluding promotes is 10% higher than last year. Over the past five years, our growth has clearly been exceptional with a CAGR of almost 12%, while de-levering from 27% to 18%. As I mentioned, this guidance excludes the acquisition of IPT, which we expect to close in January of 2020. We plan to split the $4 billion portfolio equally between our two U.S. vehicles. Private capital investor interest continues to be robust as evidenced by the record fundraising in our ventures in the third quarter.","Our pro rata investment will be approximately $1.3 billion, which we will fund with cash and debt. We continue to expect the annual core FFO accretion from IPT to range between $0.05 and $0.06 per share or roughly 2% on a stabilized basis. The acquisition of this high quality portfolio will capture significant revenue and cost synergies and deliver shareholder value on day one.","To sum up the third quarter was a continuation of what has already been an excellent year. I feel great about our outlook for the rest of the year and beyond.","And with that, I'll turn it to Michelle for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Craig Mailman from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Craig Mailman","Hey, guys. Maybe just wanted to hit here on demand and kind of where you guys have the availability in the portfolio. Could you guys just kind of talk through what you're seeing in the demand profiles between kind of larger and smaller tenants, and your ability to push rents there and maybe improve credit quality. And then kind of talk a little bit about what you guys see as your ability to push the occupancy in under 100,000 or under 250,000 square foot space where you have more opportunity? And maybe talk is there any more frictional vacancy in those type of spaces than in your bigger box? Or could we see those kind of spaces kind of narrow to where your average occupancy could be?","Hamid Moghadam","Now, that's some question\u2026","Gene Reilly","Did everybody write down? Well, let me take a stab at this, first maybe talking about the smaller spaces. So these are spaces where we can push rents and we're seeing pretty broad-based demand frankly across all sectors. But I think those with the smaller segment is where we can reach rent growth and I think if you look inside rent change numbers which are obviously at all-time highs that would be the highest.","In terms of the composition of the demand from an industry perspective, again, that's pretty broad based. Obviously auto is weak, almost no matter where you are in the globe. But otherwise, we're still seeing pretty broad-based growth. We're seeing continued growth from the e-commerce sector and that's probably a combination of reconfiguration of the supply chain as well as net demand. So that's a start on it.","Tom Olinger","Craig, this is Tom. So two of your questions, one on credit quality, our credit quality continues to be exceptional. Our bad debt experience has been below 20% or 20 basis points of rent -- below 20 basis points of rent for the last six years continues this quarter. So I feel great about our credit quality and then just regarding your question on small spaces and frictional vacancy.","We do have many more units in our smaller spaces. So naturally there is going to be more churn in that particularly as Gene pointed out, we are pushing rents. So you could see a higher -- a little higher frictional vacancy, but the pay-off is much higher rents. So the economics are clear to keep pushing rents.","Operator","Your next question will come from Jeremy Metz from BMO. Your line is open.","Jeremy Metz","Hey, good morning. Hamid, FedEx on its earnings call last month, they added they were citing more challenges ahead in 2020. They talked about the typical the global trade disputes and concerns over economic slowing having created significant uncertainties. In your opening remarks, Tom did mention that you hadn't started that that you hadn't started to see that in your customer behavior yet, but clearly those risks are out there. So just wondering, has that surprised you at all that you really haven't seen it in the customer behavior yet? And then maybe just any broader thoughts on how this all impacts your outlook for development starts beyond call it $2.3 billion you have under way in terms of cadence or desire to take on spec et cetera? Thanks.","Hamid Moghadam","Sure. I think both statements can be true at the same time. FedEx cares more about flows and obviously those become very volatile when its trade wars one day and no trade wars the next day. And they have a very fixed cost basis infrastructure planes and trucks and all that. So erratic volume cannot be good for them because they either miss the peaks or can handle -- either, they can't handle the peaks or have too much capacity for the troughs.","We are in the stock business. So actually uncertainty in the short-term is extra demand for our space, because when you don't know when that mix good is going to get to you, because the tariffs are at what cost, you're going to carry more inventory and more stock closer to the customers. So I think FedEx is right as far as the metrics for their business are concerned, and I think the metrics for our business are just different.","Operator","Your next question will come from Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Derek Johnston","Can you discuss the leasing process for the multistory facility in Seattle where Amazon and Target ultimately signed, and how competitive was this bidding process? How many interested parties did you have? And where did rents shake out versus underwriting? And what type of future demand do you anticipate? Thank you.","Hamid Moghadam","I would say the rents and the economics turned out better than our expectations. It took a little bit longer to lease up, but it leased up at higher rents and the reason it took a bit longer to lease up is that nobody ever seen a multistory building before, so they wanted to look at it, lay out a lot of different configurations and make sure they could get the efficiencies out of it. So we couldn't be more pleased with the quality of the tenants or the financial performance of the asset.","With respect to its implications, look I -- for some reason this building has gotten a lot of attention and people think that there is a multistory strategy. There is no multistory strategy. The strategy is to provide space at places where our customers want to, which is increasingly close to their ultimate customers. The solution in some places, it's multistory and in other places is single story. So we're not in the business of building so many multistory buildings, we are in the business of growing our infill position.","Operator","Your next question will come from Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vikram Malhotra","Thanks for taking the question. So Blackstone just sold part of their original GLP acquisition. Wondering if you looked at that portfolio and if you can just more broadly, give us any sense of any portfolios across regions and sort of how pricing or cap rates are shaking out?","Hamid Moghadam","Vikram, you can assume that we look at everything. People know our phone number and they know we are -- what business we're in. So we absolutely, positively have never thought of a material transaction that we haven't seen. So you can assume we look at everything. I think the implications are you're going to have to ask Blackstone, but obviously they bought that portfolio and presumably, they paid the pretty good price to get it and presumably, they sold it to these guys two months that presumably paid a really good price to get it. That was attractive enough for Blackstone to sell it. So I can't be any more specific than that, because I'm not in Blackstone's decision making rooms, but those would be -- those assumptions would be probably pretty fair.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jamie Feldman, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Jamie Feldman","Thank you. I want to get your -- more of your thoughts on just the supply outlook. I mean we do have historically high supply coming online. But you just said your development starts were 63% pre-leased in the quarter, and you want to start more. You expect to pick up in the fourth quarter. So can you kind of paint the big picture of how we should be thinking about the supply risk heading into '20? And as you think about your development opportunities, the pre-leased percentage and what gives you comfort at these -- this level of volume?","Hamid Moghadam","Hey, Jamie, Hamid here, I think there is a lot of confusion about supply numbers. People mix supply which is annual concept with what's under construction, which is a snapshot that they've given point in time. So let me have Chris take you through those numbers because they are materially different as construction duration has lengthened.","Chris Caton","Yes, absolutely. Jamie, let's talk about three concepts. First, completion. Completion is actually are on pace to be down this year by about 8%. When we look at a more real-time indicator like starts, starts are flat this year. Now as Hamid mentioned, duration to build projects has gone up and so we've seen under construction rise, that time to deliver product has gone up by about a third in this cycle for all the challenges around supply that we've previously discussed. And so deliveries out of that pipeline now are much less than kind of 100% in a given following four quarters. So you got to look at the time to deliver product to understand what deliveries will be in the following four quarters.","Hamid Moghadam","So basically if you had the same level of supply, the same level of property under construction, you would have two-thirds the annual supply if the trends of the recent past continue. So those two concepts need to be really kept apart.","Operator","Your next question comes from Blaine Heck from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Blaine Heck","Thanks. Hamid in the press release you pointed out the exceptional interest that you're seeing for your strategic capital ventures and you guys have obviously done a great job raising money on that side of the business. Can you just talk about whether there are any specific groups that you're seeing incremental interest from? And then on the flip side, what do you think could cause that investor interest to decrease I guess is there anything that kind of sticks out to you as a threat to that capital source in particular?","Hamid Moghadam","Yes. The sources are pretty much from everywhere. I would say the U.S. pension funds are probably a flat to down compared to their call it 10-year type numbers, but Japan is up significantly. Generally Asia is up significantly as these large institutions, sort of the pension system gets active on alternative investments. So it's everywhere. On the margin, I would say U.S. is a little less and Asia a little bit more.","With respect to the threats to that, it's the same old threat that we've seen in every cycle. It's the denominator effect. If these guys are generally at today's investment levels under allocated to real estate and alternatives generally, and really under allocated to industrial because it's a tough property type to access. But if the stock market goes down and the bond market goes down and the rest of the portfolio goes down, the same percentage allocation to real estate will have to go down and that's usually been the cause of reductions in the capital flows.","Operator","Your next question is from Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Ki Bin Kim","Just two questions, Hamid. What's your view on the potential impact from growth for e-commerce on the warehouse business and how PLD would potentially a play a part? And second, just on lease spreads, obviously it's some really good numbers and interesting about the mix of what roll this quarter that might be different going forward?","Hamid Moghadam","Yes. I'll let Tom answer the second part. I think there are three things that drive the share of the economics to drive the share of the e-commerce in our portfolio and for the space devoted to it. Number one is, penetration increasing, penetration of e-commerce as a percentage of total sales, retail sales. That number is going up every year. And I think it will go up for the foreseeable future as more categories become e-commerce friendly.","And as you know the millennials, I guess they are non-millennials, the generation, the years, could grow up with an iPhone start entering their prime shopping years. So the iPhone, I think is 11 years old and 12 year olds who are now graduating from college or 11 year olds who are graduating from college basically have never known the world without an iPhone in e-commerce. So I think as those guys enter the population to spending part of the population, I think the percentage will go up.","And then there is the old 3X factor of space that e-commerce takes which are well on top of the gaining share of e-commerce and underlying retail growth which is probably the slowest of the three factors, maybe 2% type of thing. All those three factors combined should make for a really good environment for e-commerce demand over time. Now I don't -- the real strategic question is, how does automation affect the 3X factor? It -- does it reduce it, does it expand it?","The answer on that is unclear at the moment and in certain instances, the increase, the need for real estate and in certain cases it reduces the need for real estate, but one area that for sure over time, we'll get more efficient is the returns business. And returns are really caused by free shipping and free returns and all that sort of thing. And over time I think fit and issues like that will get better, so I would guess that part of the demand in warehouse space will go down.","Anyway the biggest, biggest strategic driver of all this, long-term secular driver of all this, is the need for speed and choice. Because the more choices you want and the quicker you want them the more inventory, you need to position near the customers. So, that's all really good for our business.","Tom Olinger","Ki Bin, this is Tom. On your question about rent change for the quarter. We did see higher mix this quarter in the West and East region, so the coastal markets the U.S., that being said almost every region had its all-time high or near its all-time high in rent change. So we're seeing very positive rent change across the board, almost without exception. You ask about a trend, our four quarter trailing average rent change is right at 28%.","This quarter, I think that's a pretty good outlook in the near term for where rent change should be. But remember, when we talk about in-place to market at being 15.5% below market, that means rents need to grow 18.3% to get to market. Right. So if you're 15% -- 15.5% under rented, you need to grow by 18.3% that's just math to get to market rents. So think about are in-place, built-in rent change of being 18.3% and think about what's rolling, near term is obviously signed further ago, so naturally our rent change would be higher in the near term.","And then the last thing I'd point out is rent change. The rent change on roll of that four quarter average, we're now at 28%, that's up 600 basis points in the last year. So we've seen that number move up meaningfully and I think we can hang around there based on our in-place to market.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eric Frankel from Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.","Eric Frankel","Thank you. Just two quick questions. One is related to portfolio sales is based on the Black -- information Blackstone activity, do you see any meaningful differences between portfolio sale prices versus smaller transactions you guys might pursue. And then second, just on the demand front, you know, obviously there's a lot of press kind of given to smaller buildings in multi-tenant leasing, my conclusion is that that kind of leasing and the rent -- the rent growth you can get is really more dependent on location than property size, can you affirm whether that's true or not, or is a smaller building in some Midwest market getting record rent growth as well. Thank you.","Hamid Moghadam","Eric, let me jump in the middle of that before Gene starts on the first part. The most important thing with respect to rent growth is location in terms of macro market and the micro sub-market. By far, more important than tenant size and all the stuff we talked about before, so you're spot on that one. And those were the scarcest properties. Gene, do you want to answer it.","Gene Reilly","Yes, Eric. With respect to the portfolios, I mean as, Hamid mentioned, of course, we look at all these things we price them and for sure lately portfolios are selling at a -- what we consider a premium to the sum of the parts. So I think that that is true. Having said that, there is also plenty of one-off transactions and very, very good market pretty stunning metrics associated with it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Caitlin Burrows","I was just wondering maybe on the development side, the total development portfolio declined slightly since last quarter, but the 2019 starts were actually up. So is -- this just a function of pulling forward previously expected activity and what's your confidence in being able to sustain that level of starts going forward as Prologis grows? And then just on the yield side. Those have come in a little I think from about 6.5% to 6.1%. So what's driving this and could that increase back up?","Tom Olinger","Yes. The second point, that's really basically mix. But having said that, you have generally seen cap rates declining frankly over the last -- well for 20 years, but over the last couple of years, cap rates have been declining and you will see some change in the returns on costs as well. In terms of the development volumes, what we are implying is a big fourth quarter about $1.2 billion, but I think that's about right on top of what we did in the fourth quarter of last year. We're highly confident that and in terms of the future beyond that we'll talk about that when we give guidance in the future.","Hamid Moghadam","Yes and this reminds me of a previous question that something I answered which is what's our attitude toward spec development, and I would say the bar on spec development has been high and continues to be pretty high, and you can see the results of that in the build-to-suit percentage being a lot higher.","Operator","Your next question comes from Manny Korchman from Citi. Your line is open.","Manny Korchman","Tom, just thinking about your year-end occupancy guidance, your retention in the quarter was actually higher than the trailing Q and yet you commented in the press release that you're focusing on rent growth versus occupancy. So does that mean that new leases aren't happening as fast as you thought? And is that because the rent levels or is there something else that does not connecting between retention rates and occupancy?","Hamid Moghadam","So, this is not Tom, but I'll answer your question. The retention ratio you're dealing with tenants that are already in this space. And today, labor, is a huge issue for people. And every time they move, they have to go higher bunch of people, because now the workers have choice and they're not going to change their commuting patterns, etc, etc.","So customers that are in existing space have a much higher propensity to stay regardless of almost rent, which is an afterthought for a lot of them. So where you see the effect, the primary effect of pushing rents is on capture of new leasing in the developments, that's where you're likely to see at the most. And that of course doesn't affect the retention numbers that we report.","Operator","Your next question will come from Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Your line is open.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. I just had a question on the leasing spreads. I know you -- Tom you gave some infill on what drove it higher this quarter. I just want to make sure as well though that the switch to the clear leases in the past year, has that had any impact on the way you guys measure the releasing spread?","Tom Olinger","No impact at all.","Operator","Your next question will come from Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Michael Carroll","Yes. I just wanted to follow up on the, I guess PLD stands on pushing rents over occupancy. Haven't -- hasn't that's been your stands over the past two years or are you just being more aggressive today and is that a good fair way to say is what's being reflected in lease spreads and how they're pretty much doubled than what they were for the trailing four quarters?","Hamid Moghadam","It's been our stated objective to do this for previous quarters, but they are these messy things called human beings and people feel that there have been need to change their mindset, and that took a couple of years to really get that going. We track why we lose tenants, when we don't renew somebody and we track them for a long, long time. And I'm not kidding you. But there were years that we had literally zero tenants leaving because of rent on renewals, literally. So that number is no longer zero, but it's a lot lower than I think it should be or I would have expected it to be.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore. Your line is open.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks. Hamid, I just wanted to clarify, when you talked about the -- you and Chris talked about sort of the construction pipeline or time to build getting longer, is that 9 months to 12 months or is that more of a 12 month to now 16 months. Just trying to understand that. And then are there any markets in the U.S., you didn't really call anything out, but just trying to get a sense of the markets in the U.S. that you're a bit more worried about or really just seeing much less rent growth today?","Hamid Moghadam","Yes. By the way the on the duration of construction it depends on where. In Japan, they will be, they were 16 months. And I don't know what they are today, but it takes longer to build the multi-story building. But let's focus just on a single story U.S. style warehouse and Chris as the numbers for you.","Chris Caton","Yes. Hey, Steve its going from eight to nine months to something more than a year, call it, call it 13-14 months. What I think we will see is that deliveries over the next four quarters, can be roughly 75% of the under construction pipeline, that's how we see the numbers coming together. As it relates to market, we talked about how we -- on the last call how we haven't added any markets to our supply risk list, that's remains the case today and in fact markets like Chicago comes off that list this quarter. So...","Steve Sakwa","I know. Osaka came off a little bit earlier. So...","Chris Caton","Yes. Osaka is a market that came off. And then on that list included Atlanta, Pennsylvania, Houston, Spain and the Midlands was covered in Tom's script.","Hamid Moghadam","I would say the one that I would point out as being more at risk today than last quarter, even though it was on the list is Houston. There is a lot of space under construction in Houston. And I think some people are going to get surprised. Now and some of it is not in the best sub-markets. So some of the outlying sub-markets in Houston you need to watch. Fortunately, we are not exposed to the sub-markets.","Operator","Your next question will come from John Guinee from Stifel. Your line is open.","John Guinee","Great. I think Mike Curless is in the room. I was just looking at Page 24, and I noticed an uptick in a pretty sizable land acquisition year-to-date and also acquisitions and other investments in real estate. Can you walk through -- Mike, where you're buying the dirt? And also what the other investments in real estate might be?","Hamid Moghadam","Probably, Gene should answer that question since Mike has a new job, but Gene, go ahead.","Gene Reilly","Yes, and Mike can maybe offer customer color where they want the dirt. But John, where we generally need to replace dirt is in the coastal markets where we've got a lot of development absorbed a lot of land bank. So there is a piece in LA included in that, but as we look out going forward, replacing land is very, very expensive these days. As you know, we've done a lot of work to work this land back down to what we considered a manageable level. As we replace land going forward, we're trying to do it creatively, we're trying to tie up land through options, but it's going to be more expensive. And we will see the land bank pick up a little bit, but we're going to remain very disciplined on that front as we have been.","Hamid Moghadam","Our biggest needs for land, I would say are Southern California -- we're good in Seattle, good in the Bay Area. Southern California, we need more land. Chicago, we need more land, and I would say in New Jersey we need more land for sure. Those are the top three that I would call out.","Gene Reilly","And with respect to the customers and where they want to be two, three years ago, 80% of our land that we're doing build-to-suits and we're in -- were global markets, those numbers are closer to 95% these days.","Tom Olinger","And John, your question about the other investments, just think about those being covered land place, not land but will become land soon.","Hamid Moghadam","Yes. Those are actually yielding, probably pretty close to the local market cap rate maybe a tad below maybe 20-25 basis points below, but they're basically current land place.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Mueller from JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Michael Mueller","Yes. Hi. I was wondering, do you expect the elevated mix of build-to-suits to be a little bit more of the norm over the next year or so?","Mike Curless","This is Mike Curless. We did have a robust quarter at almost two-thirds build-to-suits. If you look across the year that's blending in the high '30s and I would expect in our numbers to be in the low '40s as we look forward. I think this was an unusually high quarter but directionally indicative of how important the build-to-suit part of the business is to us these days.","Hamid Moghadam","You know, I'll compare to five or 10 years ago or 15 years ago, I mean, that number would have been 20%-25%. So I think the tightness of the markets is forcing the build-to-suit percentage up.","Operator","And your next question will come from Craig Mailman from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Craig Mailman","Hey guys. Just wanted to kind of hit on some of your liquidity here in the funds and on balance sheet, your cost of capital is clearly advantageous. But you have a lot of kind of well-heeled competitors as well. I'm just kind of curious you guys look at the acquisition landscape, you've been successful in some, missed some others, but just kind of how you look at return requirements for on-balance sheet acquisitions here versus the in-funds. And just talk a little about what you're seeing on the quality spectrum of portfolios that you have traded or may be out there and kind of interest level?","Hamid Moghadam","Let me start that and Gene jump in if you'd like. I think the quality, the pricing for quality differences is getting compressed, in other words, cap rates for a lower quality, lower growth assets are compressing high quality assets and location. And that always happens in this part of the cycle. People are really anxious to get into this asset class. And if it's industrial, it's industrial and they become less discriminating over time. Also if you're a leveraged buyer to the end you're really looking at locking in the cost of capital, debt capital today and you employ a lot of it. Obviously this is a really good environment for you're buying things and financing them.","With respect to the way we look at our unleveraged [WACC] our cost of capital, I would say, we look at that every quarter or so, and we occasionally and only in a very limited way have dropped our requirements. I would say for a U.S. high-quality portfolio probably a 6 IRR would be the right number today, very high quality portfolio for us. And, you know, take it up from there but unfortunately some stuff in the marketplace even for low quality assets is getting priced to tighter than that.","Now a 6 IRR in a 1.6% or 1.7% 10-year environment is pretty attractive. I mean those are some of the wider spreads, I've seen in my career. And so, yes, then our absolute numbers sound low but would in relation to cost of capital or debt capital they are actually pretty attractive.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vikram Malhotra","Thanks. Just wanted to follow up on two things. One for Chris, you mentioned sort of some of the rent growth and obviously it's different by sub-markets. I'm wondering if you're starting to see any divergence from recent trends within sub-markets within MSAs meaning more divergence and what you've seen recently. And then just one for Tom on the clear leases, wondering how that's -- if any impact on the expense side and if it may be positively or negatively impacting NOI growth?","Mike Curless","Yes. Hey, as it relates to rent growth. A couple of ways to look at that, one is we continue to see that divergence between in-fill and non-infill as Hamid was discussing earlier in terms of sub-market strategy. As it relates to markets, we've seen better outperformance in the East in New York and in Toronto for example, and we continue to see really good growth in Europe, much like we telegraphed last year and the year before. And what you see there is some of the early recovery markets continuing to outperform whether that's Germany or the Netherlands or Czech Republic, and some late recovery markets really starting to pop rents comes to mind. So that's how the rents are trending.","Tom Olinger","Great. Vikram on your question around the clear lease and expenses, those leases are set up where we fix all the cost for real estate taxes, the tenant bears that. And we are collecting slightly more on the expense reimbursements right now. But essentially, call it even. So we set it up that way to be expense neutral. So no impact on NOI, and to go back to next question, just on the clear lease and did that have any impact on how we're calculating rent change? It does not. That clearly, just think about it simply having a rent component and an expense reimbursement component and the rent change is calculated on the revenue, the rent component, not the expense component. So no impact.","Hamid Moghadam","Yes. I just want to clarify something Tom said. We actually don't collect reimbursements, That's why it's a clear lease. But we do track what it would have been under a triple net lease. And actually for the last 1.5 year or two years that we've been implementing this, the numbers have been remarkably on top of one another and that's the advantage of having an 800-million square foot portfolio to spread this stuff around.","Operator","And your next question will come from Manny Korchman from Citi. Your line is open.","Manny Korchman","Yes. So Hamid, I had a follow-up from my -- on my previous question that I have a new one for you guys. But so you mentioned leasing as developments, I guess that wouldn't impact your occupancy guidance. But just going back to that in isolation of retention is where you expect, it's at 81%, and you've lowered your occupancy guidance. That means that your pace of lease-up in already vacated space or space to be vacated is going to be slower. Is that the wrong read through?","Hamid Moghadam","We are pushing -- remember the part that I said that we -- in the year as we had zero people that we were losing as part of the renewal discussion that number is not zero, but it's not as high as I would like it to be. You're also talking about occupancy declines from 98%, and I've been doing this for 37 years, there was only one year where we were in the 98% range. And I said guys don't get used to this. We're going to push this number down. So I think we were very clear on what our strategy was. And I would say it was executed as exactly the way we described it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jamie Feldman from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Jamie Feldman","Thanks. I was just hoping you could explain more why developments are taking so much longer to deliver. And then also just thinking about the TI number in the quarter and what we've seen this year, I mean are you spending more on leases -- on TIs on leases, and if so, can you explain what those -- why that's happening or what that's going to and is that impacting your ability to push rents as well?","Gene Reilly","Jamie, I'll take the first one. It's Gene. It's basically a combination of construction time frame and there is some entitlement timeframe in that as well, and which by the way can affect the projects through its construction. And as you pull secondary permits as you go forward. So it's really those two items. And of course depending on where you are geographically, there is pretty wide range of outcomes.","Hamid Moghadam","We've also had kind of weird weather patterns that I think most of you have noticed that definitely methods quick construction schedules.","Tom Olinger","Jamie, on your second question on the turnover costs. I -- it's a little higher this quarter. I think it's due to two things, its mix and timing. But I go back and look at what our -- what we've been on a trailing four quarters, I think that's a better representation. We have been coming down pretty clearly over the last, on a trailing four-quarter basis over the last, really three years and that makes sense. Just given concessions are falling across the board. The other thing I'd point to is look at free rent as a percent of lease value that is consistently declining again. So I think overall this quarter's mix and a little bit of timing, it's not impacting our -- we're not trying to buy rent change if that's the question.","Operator","And your next question comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore. Your line is open.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks. Hamid, I was just wondering if you could provide an update on sort of the big data initiatives and the procurement and sort of where you stand? And is that something we're likely to get a lot more detail on for 2020?","Hamid Moghadam","On the big data we are, as I mentioned to tackling one very specific project which is yield management. And I would say that's going really well. We're piloting in four markets, and we'll be expanding that to the portfolio, and we are encouraged by the early results. I don't know, Chris may have more to say about that. Gary, you want to talk about the other initiatives.","Gary Anderson","Yes. On the procurement initiatives, we stood at procurement organizations, we talked about in the past and things are going well there I'd say both in terms of procuring construction related items and CapEx and G&A. So that is often running. And with respect to the revenue side of the equation, I'd say that we're off to a good start. We're starting to build that business. We're probably getting into the tens of millions of dollars in terms of revenue. So it is becoming more meaningful and we're seeing roughly double-digit growth.","Mike Curless","Yes. I would say that that business today if you isolate it would be pennies a share of incremental earnings. I think in two to three years, it will be dimes, and we're hoping that it's potential is more than $1. So, but that is going to take us a while to get to. So don't put in the dollar, don't put in the [indiscernible]. Put in a couple of pennies that we're talking about right now, we're doing better than that actually. But it's a slow ramp, nobody has done this before. So, we need to educate ourselves and our customers and a lot of other people to get this done.","Hamid Moghadam","I think Steve you were the last person. So thank you all for your interest in the Company and I want to put in a big plug for our Analyst Day, which is coming up and that's why we saved all the good guidance for that date and encourage you to come. Take care.","Operator","Thank you everyone. This will conclude today's conference call.

My name is Sarah, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome you all to the Prologis Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I'd now like to the call over to our host, Ms. Tracy Ward. You may begin your conference.","Tracy Ward","Thank you, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2012 conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations.","This morning, we will hear from Hamid Moghadam, Chairman and Co-CEO, who will comment on the macroeconomy and market condition; and then from Tom Olinger, CFO, who will cover results and guidance. Additionally, we are joined today by members of our executive team including Walt Rakowich; Gary Anderson; Mike Curless; Nancy Hemmenway; Guy Jaquier; Ed Nekritz; and Gene Reilly.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to quickly state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under Federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates, as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance, and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings. I'd like also to state that our third quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures. And in accordance with Reg G, we have provided reconciliation to those measures.","[Operator Instructions] Hamid, will you please begin?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Thank you, Tracy. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter call. Let me start by saying how pleased I am with our results, which are the strongest for our company since the start of the global financials crisis. We'll keep our prepared remarks brief, as you just heard from us last month at our investor forum. Our focus today will be on the macroeconomy, realtime market conditions and our operating results.","First, let me offer some observations at the economic indicators that most affect our business. Global trade volumes remain well above peak and the IMF forecast growth of over 3% for this year and 4.5% for 2013. Consumption is strong, with retail sales coming in at over 5.5% year-over-year and online sales growing 3x faster. Real inventories have increased with an annual rate of 3% this year.","Interestingly, inventories are the only major economic indicator that remains low peak by about 3%. We think there is ample room for growth in inventories as consumer confidence improves. The increase in consumption and the rebuilding of inventories is translating into further improvement in the operating environment. Net absorption in the U.S. was positive for the quarter at 20 million square feet. While this is slightly below our forecast, it's worth noting that new supply also came in below our forecast.  Deliveries in the quarter represented a fraction of the obsolescence rate. For the fourth quarter, we expect a healthy level of absorption around 50 million square feet, which is in line with normal seasonal patterns.","Looking to 2013, we expect 160 million square feet of total absorption. Next year's forecast may prove to be conservative as it doesn't account for a housing recovery, which appears to be in its early stages.","In terms of what we're hearing from our customers, the majority of our global markets, customers are confident about their prospects for the fourth quarter. We think this bodes well for the holiday season. As they look to 2013, our customers continue to focus on operating efficiencies and growth from e-commerce. Same-day delivery may be coming sooner than we all thought. Space utilization is very high, and the simple fact is that the number of our customers are no longer able to delay the business around space procurement. They're at the point of needing to press forward with new facilities, and we're seeing this in our high-level build-to-suit activity.","Turning now to our third quarter results, our teams around the globe did an outstanding job leasing a record 39 million square feet in our operating and development portfolios. A real bright spot has been leasing in units less than 100,000 feet. Occupancy in these smaller spaces was up 80 basis points in the quarter and 270 basis points year-over-year. This segment is closely tied to the housing market.","Growing demand and increases in occupancy are also having a positive impact on rent. In fact, we expect rents on rollover to turn positive in the next quarter and remain positive throughout most, if not all, of 2013. The lack of supply and increasing rents are driving our development starts, especially for larger buildings.  During the quarter, we started 10 new projects globally, 2\/3 of which were build-to-suits. Our margins on year-to-date starts are roughly 19%. While we don't expect to sustain this level of profitability over the cycle, these trends clearly support the value of our land make. Of course as conditions improve, new competitors will enter the markets we already serve. This will be challenging for them because the global markets have high barriers to entry. Lending policy changes such as Dodd-Frank and the new Basel III will require incremental capital charges that are up to 50% higher for real estate construction loans relative to traditional corporate lending. In fact, we are already seeing lenders adopt these new risk-based capital rules with more conservative lending standards. Changes in lending policies will impact new deliveries. We believe this cycle will be different as these new lending requirements will place a governor on overbuilding by merchant developers, who simply won't be able to secure funding for new construction.","Turning to dispositions and contributions. As we mentioned on our last call, the fourth quarter will be a busy time for us as we have a number of packages on the market. We're making good progress, and Tom will elaborate on that in a minute.","Looking at Private Capital, during the quarter we completed an important milestone with PEPR by taking 100% ownership of the fund. Our team is making progress recapitalizing our European portfolio. We also concluded Prologis North America Fund 11 by disposing of the remaining asset in the fund. This brings our total of funds rationalized to 7 since the close of the merger.","To sum up, we had an outstanding third quarter, and we have an excellent momentum heading into the end of the year.","With that, I'll turn it over to Tom.","Timothy Brosnan","Thanks, Hamid. This morning I'll cover 3 topics. First, a recap of our third quarter results; second, a review of our disposition and contribution activity; and third, an update on our guidance for the remainder of the year.","Before I begin, I'd like to point out new disclosure in our supplemental related to pro rata or look-through balance sheet NOI and EBITDA data. While we've always disclosed debt on a look-through basis, as I mentioned at our investment forum, we think this enhanced disclosure will help you further understand our capital structure and earnings drivers.","Now let's look at our results. Core FFO for the third quarter was $0.49 a share and included a tax benefit of approximately $0.06 a share. We have forecasted the tax benefit to only be $0.03 a share, in line with what we reported last year, the tax benefit related to certain contributions from previous years, and we do not expect to recognize any similar significant benefits going forward.  Excluding the tax benefit, core FFO was $0.43 a share, about $0.01 ahead of our expectations due primarily to higher NOI driven by better-than-expected occupancy, rents and favorable FX. I'd like to point out that this quarter represented the first period of year-over-year results for the combined company, so going forward, we'll have comparable results.","Moving to our operating portfolio metrics, occupancy at the end of the quarter was 93.1%, up 70 basis points sequentially and 210 basis points year-over-year. Occupancy in the Americas was up 110 basis points, with strong leasing activity across a majority of our markets, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, Eastern Pennsylvania, Dallas and Mexico City. Notably, we have seen a pickup in demand in the border markets of Mexico for the first time in a few years.  In Europe, occupancy was essentially flat. Given our visibility into leased but not yet occupied spaces, we expect our occupancy in Europe to increase in the fourth quarter.","Leasing activity was a record for the quarter at 39 million square feet, which is about 5 million square feet higher than our quarterly average. Same-store rents change on rollover decreased 1.8% for the third quarter. The significant year-over-year occupancy gains, combined with low rent roll downs led to an increase in both GAAP and capped same-store NOI in the quarter of 2.7% and 3%, respectively.","On the capital deployment front, we committed $620 million of capital in the quarter, of which $483 million was our share. Total deployment included $386 million of development starts, $112 million of building acquisitions and $122 million of land and infrastructure.","Moving to capital sources. In the third quarter, we completed $174 million of disposition and contributions of which $141 million was our share. On the balance sheet front, the third quarter was a push relative to sources and users. The increase in our debt metrics this quarter relates to movements in foreign currency. Absent the FX movement, our LTV and debt to EBITDA metrics were essentially flat.","As we discussed previously, we have several initiatives underway in the capital sources front. I'd like to spend a minute and provide an update on the different components of dispositions and contributions currently in process. First, dispositions. Our 10 quarter plan, which we updated at the investor's forum, contemplates our share of total dispositions of $3.4 billion. Today, we've completed about $1.6 billion, our share. As we mentioned last quarter, we brought a number of packages to market setting up for a busy fourth quarter. We're currently working on about $1 billion of gross dispositions. We expect to sell, place under contract or receive offers on over 90% of these transactions by the end of this month. This is part of our global and regional market investment strategy and relates principally to non-strategic assets in the U.S., but also in Europe and Japan.","Next, contributions. Our 10 quarter plan includes our share of contributions to existing funds of $2.2 billion. To date, we've completed more than $800 million on an our-share basis. The remaining contributions relates to funds in Europe and Latin America, where the vast majority of the investment capacity for the contributions is in place.","The final component of our 10 quarter plan is contributions to new funds or ventures. Our share of contributions to planned new ventures or funds is $6.1 billion, which is primarily made up of the recapitalization efforts underway in Europe and Japan. The activities in our 10 quarter plan thus far have basically allowed us to sell fund development and other investments, as well as consolidate NA2 earlier in the year on a leveraged neutral basis. The balance of our fourth quarter and 2013 10 quarter plan activity is what will drive deleveraging.","Let's now move to guidance for the remainder of 2012. Based on our performance year-to-date and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we're increasing our full year core FFO to $1.72 to $1.74 per share, up from $1.64 to $1.70 per share. From a foreign currency standpoint, we're assuming an average euro rate of 1.3 and an average yen rate of 80 for the fourth quarter. For operations, we're forecasting to be at the high end of both our 2012 same-store NOI guidance of 1% to 2%, as well as the high end of our year-end occupancy range of 93% to 93.5%. As Hamid mentioned, we believe we've reached the end of lease roll downs and expect rent change on rollover to turn a positive within the next quarter. On the expense side, we will likely come in at the top end of our annual net G&A guidance of $213 million. However, we could be slightly above this level, depending on the timing and nature of the disposition and contribution activity in the fourth quarter.","For capital deployment, we're increasing full year forecast to $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion with our overall share of total expected investment to be about 70%. Deployment includes $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion of development starts, primarily in the Americas and Japan, up from $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion. And we're narrowing our acquisitions guidance to $450 million to $550 million, with majority of the activity related to our current investment ventures in the Americas.","Turning to contributions and dispositions, we're maintaining our annual range of $3.5 billion to $7 billion. As I mentioned earlier, we have a lot of activity on this front. Excluding the dispositions and contributions activity already completed through the third quarter, we're left with a range of $2.2 billion to $5.7 billion for the fourth quarter. As we previously stated, this activity can vary significantly based on the recapitalization of the Europe and Japan operating assets. If one of these transactions happens in the fourth quarter we could be at the high end of our guidance, while if neither happens, we could be slightly below the low end of our guidance. That being said, we continue to feel good about completing the 10 quarter plan by the end of 2013.","Our share of the contribution and disposition proceeds will range from 60% to 75%, depending on the mix of transactions. We continue to remain disciplined and patient and will only complete transactions that makes sense in terms of valuation and structure, and that is what ultimately drives timing.","In closing, we feel great about the quarter. Operating fundamentals continue to improve, and we remain focused on our strategic priorities to further strengthen our balance sheet and position our platform for continued growth.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Hamid.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Thanks, Tom. Before we open the call to your questions, I'd like to say a few words about my partner and Co-CEO's, Walt Rakowich, immeasurable contributions to Prologis over the last 18 years. As you know, Walt is retiring at the end of December. What you may not know is that this is his 56th earnings call and his last one as a participant. The REIT industry has evolved in the 18 years since Walt joined the company, and Walt's steady hand and unwavering commitment have helped pave the road to success for our organization.","His sense of commitment was evident in 2008 when he came back from retirement to lead the company through its darkest days. He did a heck of a job turning things around, made a lot of tough decisions in the face of adversity. Walt is a standup guy and a class act, and I can't think of anyone else who I'd like to have been paired up with to lead this company over the last few years. He let the integration of the company following the merger, and he did an outstanding job leading the charge to regain full control of PEPR's assets allowing us to recapitalize our Europe platform ahead of schedule.","It's a little early because he's going to be around for a couple more months, but I know that I speak on behalf of the entire Prologis family when I wish him the very best. We're pleased to know that he will now be able to spend more time on his philanthropic endeavors and of course with his family.","Walt, you want to say a few words?","Walter C. Rakowich","Thanks, Hamid. Well, I know we are all here to talk about earnings, so I will be brief. But I just want to thank all the investors and the analysts that have supported the company and supported what we've done over the years, and I'm looking forward to seeing you all at NAREIT one last time. And I'd also like to thank our people from legacy Prologis people to the new Prologis people that have really made our success a reality. But, Hamid, I got to tell you, it has been great working with you over the last 2 years in this journey. And you have done an incredible job, and I'm going to just say very brief, I'm very, very proud to have been your partner. Very, very proud.","So thank you, and let's turn it over to get some questions asked here.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Thanks.","Tracy Ward","Sarah, if we can open up for questions, that would be great.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brendan Maiorana of Wells Fargo.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Question, I guess, probably related to Tom, I just wanted to dive into the end disposition outlook a little bit that implied guidance for the back half of the year, 2 point -- or for the fourth quarter rather, $2.2 billion to $5.7 billion. Can you give us a sense of one, how close do you feel you are on either getting a European transaction done, which may move you more to the midpoint or higher end of that guidance? And then two, if you look at what I think is roughly $2 billion of asset sales or dispositions outside of either Europe or Japan, how should we think about the likely cap rates and the timing of those dispositions and how confident you are that they'll close in the fourth quarter?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Okay, Brandon, let me start by answering your questions about Japan and Europe, and Tom will answer the question about the balance of the activity. On Japan, I'd just like to give you a somewhat scripted response. We've been working hard on a Japan recapitalization and in fact, have received one of the 2 major licenses required for J-REIT. Any consideration of a development fund that's secondary to our decision-making on our long-term vehicle in Japan, which will probably not happen this year, I'm not in a position to comment further on our Japan plans at this time. So moving on to Europe. As you know, we've actually made progress on controlling PEPR sooner than we thought. That was always in the very back end of our 2003, '13 10 quarter plan. And obviously we started the recapitalization process now earlier than we expected. Unfortunately, these things are minor. You kind of only hear about them when they're done, and you really have no sense of how much progress we're making or not making as we work on these things. So it's kind of difficult for me to comment because we have ongoing dialogue on this topic. But I feel really good that when you take into account the 2013 10 quarter plan, which is what we've laid out, that we'll meet not only all our objectives with respect to deleveraging, but also our other priorities of realigning our portfolio with our strategy and also getting the asset utilization up. So -- and I wish I could give you more specifics about that right now, but I can't.","Thomas S. Olinger","Brandon, on your question regarding how we feel about our disposition activity and cap rates, we feel good about our disposition activity. The bulk of it's in the U.S. Cap rates will likely be in the high 6s to around 7. And that lines up with what our thinking is around our entire 10 Q plan, particularly when you think about Japan assets being in the mid to low 5s. But again we feel good about our disposition activity that is before us. And as I mentioned, we've got about $1 billion in the market, 90% of that we think we're going to sell, have under contract or select a buyer by the end of this month. And on the contributions front, that's a process we're working through. But the main point there is that our funds that are taking the contributions, which is largely Europe and some of Latin America, have the vast majority of the funding. To complete those transactions, it's just a matter of timing of when those contributions happen.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Caton, Morgan Stanley.","Chris Caton - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was hoping you could comment on the leasing environment in CapEx. The AFFO statement shows a little over $60 million of leasing and maintenance together. As you\u2019re renewing or releasing properties that were last leased at the trough of the market, is there any temporary shift in capital required to secure the rent increases that you're seeing in the portfolio now or expect to see next year?","Eugene F. Reilly","Sure, Chris, this is Gene. Let me take that. I might kick it to Gary. The short answer is no. We are not seeing additional GI requirements or other building improvements required to get the spaces leased or to push rents. And if you look at our stats, there's a couple of things to keep in mind. You see a general uptick in capital as a percentage of NOI, but that's driven by seasonality and it's also driven by the fact that we did a ton of leasing during the quarter. So if you look -- we would expect these numbers to come back into range. And if you look at the past 4 quarters, that's a pretty good guide to what we see going forward. So you got naturally have an upward trend during the course of the year in capital.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Spector, Bank of America.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm here with Jamie Feldman. And just thinking about PLD AMB going forward, I'm sure you and Hamid have had some great debates on division strategy. I guess, Hamid, can you talk about that a little bit? How has Walt impacted your thoughts about the future strategy, the future Prologis here going forward?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Jeff, it's a good question, and the honest answer to it is that while Walt and I are not in agreement on everything all the time, but I would say that with respect to our strategy which we've laid out and discussed and fully vetted before the merger was even announced, I would say we started out being 95% aligned and the last 5% we worked out. So it's been a very collaborative effort, and I'm going to really miss Walt going forward because he's been a great division to the company and a great sounding board. The best thing about him is that it is very hard for CEOs to let go. And Walt has been very supportive without, in any way, feeling that he needs to get involved in the minutia on a day-to-day basis. So we sort of figured out what we're each kind of focused on at the beginning, we supported one another throughout. And I'm really going to miss him. So let me leave it at that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Bilerman, Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I'm just curious. As you think about the deleveraging plan and the sources for deleveraging. And obviously there's a lot of irons in the fire in terms of asset sales and contributions. And I think, Tom, you actually mentioned that in the Investor Day and you talked a little bit on the call about being disciplined and patient about trying to get the best execution. I'm curious how you think about your stock in terms of selling equity for a more immediate impact to that deleveraging goal. And then how you think about selling equity relative to an NAV estimate of 35 to 38, but also a $59 NAV that you put out for 2016. How you think about selling equity in that context and effectively if that's the view of value, you effectively just would never do it because you'd be diluting shareholders that dramatically and reducing that growth. Then I want to understand how you're thinking about those levers as we move forward.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Michael, let me start that, and I'll pass it over to Tom. I think one of the things we try to make very clear in the investor forum was that we have 4 pillars to our strategic plan going forward. And the 2 pillars that are -- or the 3 pillars that are relevant to your question are our realignment strategy, getting our portfolio to align with our strategy of global markets. That naturally puts us in a position of selling a bunch of assets that are not a fit for the company\u2019s strategy and that produces some capital for the company. But really the decision is driven by a portfolio realignment goal. Secondly, we want to rationalize our funds and have a risk mitigation measure. Because we are global company, we need to manage our exposure to these foreign currencies. And the best way of doing that is by using Private Capital vehicles and matching our remaining equity with local debt. That's the way we neutralize ourselves. While the formation of Private Capital activity, which was really delayed for the last 3 or 4 years post the financial crisis, that also produces capital. But really we have that goal of mitigating risk anyway, whether or not we had a deleveraging third pillar. And then we come down to deleveraging, and we have to look at the results of the sale activity, the fund formation activity, and see where that takes us at the end of the day. And at the end of the day, if we actually accomplish all the things that we've got planned, I think our leverage will be actually in the low 20% range, lower than our target of 23%. So to go and issue equity, put the pricing aside right now, would be a little crazy because that would drive our percentage of leverage even below 23% when we're done with the plan. And we're not doing anything unnatural with the plan in terms of timing. I mean we're taking our time, and we deliver it, and we want to get good execution on that. So to make a long story short, I think the path that we're on will get us there. But this is not a religious belief. If at any point in time we see that issuing equity is an attractive alternative for our shareholders -- and by the way, the $59 thing, that was a 4-year out kind of a number. I think we've been very clear that our NAV is 35 to 38, and a company like us should be trading with the right balance sheet at the premium to NAV just like all the other blue chip companies. So you can read that as you will, but we think sort of on the upper end of NAV and some premium over that is when even thinking about equity, if we needed it, it would begin to make sense. And based on our plan, I don't think we need it. But we'll see how the plan goes. We're very confident about it. Tom?","Thomas S. Olinger","To Hamid's point on do we need it, I mean clearly from a user standpoint, we would not need to issue equity when we look at our development pipeline and our users from that perspective. It's clearly growing, and we're seeing a lot of opportunity. But even in the face of that growth, I don't see a need for us to raise equity because we're going to have more than ample sources from this 10 quarter plan. And our challenge actually won't be -- it's going to be finding ways to use that additional capital that's coming in that has those additional uses over and above our deployment opportunities, and over and above our debt that's maturing. So from that perspective as well, we would not need to raise equity.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Mailman, KeyBanc Capital.","Craig Mailman - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Jordan Sadler's on the line with me as well. I was hoping maybe you guys could drill down a little bit more to the expectations on rent spreads turning positive. Maybe if you can offer any color on the magnitude we're going to see in 4Q and heading into 2013. And then just a breakdown of which markets you're seeing the best momentum in versus the ones that are going to be the biggest drag going forward.","Eugene F. Reilly","This is Gene. I'll start with answering the question. First of all, it is really, really difficult to predict this going positive or negative. So getting much more precise on that wouldn't be a very good idea. I mean the best way to look at this is, what is the trajectory of this line? And we're clearly headed to turning positive. We think that will happen next quarter. Frankly, when it does happen, it may bounce around. It may go slightly negative. But it is clearly headed in the right direction. In terms of individual markets, Southern California, South Florida, parts of New Jersey would clearly be places where we're going to have the opportunity to push rents. We have extremely high occupancies. But frankly, if you look at some of our regional markets, and you can look this up in the supplemental, we're really pushing occupancies in these markets as well. So what we see happening is a broad-based recovery in fundamentals in the Americas, and I'll let Gary speak to other geographies. And outside of the U.S., Mexico conditions are very, very tight and rents are frankly going really fast in Brazil. So rather than be precise about what happens next quarter, I think the really important thing here is what's happening with fundamentals, and what will drive a sustainable increase in rents and create an environment where we can frankly push rents really hard going forward into the next year.","Gary A. Anderson","Just to underscore what Gene said, I mean if you look again at the trailing 4 quarters, the trend is very, very clear, and it's undeniable. We are headed in the right direction. We have been heading in the right direction since the second quarter of 2010. And again, I think we all believe that 2003 -- 2013 in the aggregate will be positive. When you look at Europe, again we're sort of bouncing around. We're in an inflection point in Europe, and we're starting to see rent growth in certain of the global markets in certain size ranges. The global markets where we're seeing traction would be the East and West Midlands, London; in Germany would be Hamburg and Cologne. And we're seeing some traction in actually the south of France and also the south of Poland. In Asia, rents are strong throughout China. Again, we talked last month about China having 8.1% rent growth compounded per year. And they continue to trend positively. And in Japan, again we're actually seeing rent growth in the Tokyo and Osaka markets, particularly in Class A space. And that rent growth we're seeing is 4% to 6%. So again we're headed in the right direction, and we're highly confident of that for 2013.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Sakwa of ISI Group.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I guess I just wanted to see if you could kind of balance for us the third quarter earnings season is coming in pretty weak for a lot of multinational companies. I mean some of that is driven by FX, but a lot of these companies are missing on the top line and just citing kind of weaker business conditions. And you mentioned a number of positive things kind of early in your comments, and I'm just wondering to what extent some of the factors that are impacting some of these multinationals just haven't really caught up with the fundamentals or do you think there's just something very different about what's impacting your business and what's impacting their business?","Hamid R. Moghadam","The latter, and let me try to elaborate on that. We just had our Customer Advisory Board Meeting in Denver about a week and a half ago, and we had our global large customers represented there. These are household names that you've heard of, and it usually involves the head of real estate. And they basically said exactly what you just said. He said the fundamentals of our business are not great, but we are out of space. And we have kicked the can down the road and kicked the can down the road, but there's population growth, there's consumption growth. And while we don't have pricing power on the top line, we have needs for space. And we got to take out costs out of our system, and the only way we can take costs out of our system is by revamping our logistics chain. So that's one thing that makes our business a little different than the other businesses. The other factor is e-commerce. A lot of these retailers, a lot of these companies are setting up parallel distribution chains for their e-commerce divisions, and that's picking up a fair amount of new space. The part that's missing or has been missing now in terms of a demand driver was the housing market. And actually based on my reading of your stuff, you guy's maybe are even more bullish on that than we are. But certainly the housing market is turning, and that will turn on that last engine that's going to fill up our 100,000 square foot spaces. So look, all you got to do is look around you and the business environment in terms of top line growth for these companies is not strong. But the need to restructure their supply chain and to take costs out, and the fact that they delayed taking space and kicked the can down the road for the last 4 years in the face of almost 12 million more people, consumers in the U.S. than 4 years ago and similar kinds of growth in many of the other regions, probably with the exception of Europe, is what's leading to our success. And by the way, we didn't have the kind of surge coming out of the downturn that some of the other companies did. But it was primarily an earnings surge for them. It wasn't a top line search because really they were taking out their personnel cost, and that was driving their bottom line growth. So top line is anemic. We're a solution for taking out cost out of the system, and they just can't delay it anymore is what we're hearing from these guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Toti of Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","I'm here with Evan Smith as well. I have a very quick question. We're hearing from a number of our broker affiliates from the ground in the U.S. that port volumes are picking up pretty maturely. Are you seeing this in the context of your assets and also in the context of sort of mixed messages from both FedEx and UPS, especially with regards to the results today?","Eugene F. Reilly","This is Gene. I'll start, and I think others are going to have points of view. Well port volumes are recorded, and they are picking up. And yes we're seeing that, but frankly they've also been volatile. And the other thing is when you compare what's happening with real trade that will affect demand in our buildings with, for example, what's FedEx's last commentary on their business, they are 2 different things. We have to be very careful to understand what's happening in terms of a company like FedEx in -- across all their businesses versus what will affect demand and distribution space. So as Hamid just said a moment ago, and we're seeing a lot of demand coming from reinvestment into the supply chain. And if you think about it, we've got a 0 interest rate environment. Companies have a lot of cash on the balance sheet. This is probably going to be a pretty weak earnings season. But where you invest money, it can get a very good return on investment by investing into the supply chain. And frankly for some of them, it's really their only alternative of using capital. So at this point, that's pretty meaningful.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Stewart of Green Street Advisors.","John Stewart - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Tom, I have a very short 4-part question for you. Can you please remind us again what -- how much you expect to book in merger costs in the fourth quarter? And then can you please put the tax benefit in layman's terms for us? I presume that was noncash, but can you kind of explain what it\u2019s related to and how it worked? Then can you please give us the cash mark-to-market and when you think you'll see the inflection point on a cash basis? And then last but not least, just comparing square footages quarter-to-quarter, it looks like some of the assets held for sale might be in France, so could you address what you expect the cap rates to be on the assets held for sale in France?","Thomas S. Olinger","Okay, I will address a couple of those first and then Gene and Mike can help me out. So on the merger costs, we're coming in or we're forecasting $75 million approximately for the full year. On the tax benefit, the tax benefit, we realized this quarter was consistent with what we've seen in the past several years in the third quarter. As tax returns get filed and completed, there are true ups that happen. And the bulk of the true ups or the benefit is coming through really related to contributions, activity that happened in the treatment of dividends around those contributions and how you account for those. And as we true up and finalize our tax returns, those true ups surface and we clean them up. The other important aspect of that is it is noncash, but when we built up those reserves, there was a cash component to it to the extent that it might relate to interest and the like on dividends. So -- and it did go to through core FFO, and that's why it's being reflected as core FFO now. So when the reserves were built [indiscernible] core FFO, when the reserves are released, it comes back through core FFO. But the important thing here is not so much the mechanics of what happened is we don't expect these to be -- have similar such benefits going forward. We're really through set contribution period and don't see any more like that. But it is eventually cash because that's a liability that we do not need to satisfy at this point. Your next question was on cash mark-to-market. I'll ask Gene to comment on that.","Eugene F. Reilly","Yes, as we're talking about mark-to-market in terms of our rents, I think we've been saying it's pretty much right on top of market rents at the moment. And it's trending in a positive direction. Just want to say it's marginally positive.","Gary A. Anderson","And that's true of Europe and Asia. Europe's right on top of mark-to-market. Japan's under-rented and China's significantly under-rented today.","Hamid R. Moghadam","And then, John, your last question was on the held for sale pool in France but as you know, we won't comment on any transaction until it happens. So once we close the transaction, we'll talk to you about cap rates in general.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ross Nussbaum of UBS.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I'm here with Gabe Hilmoe. These are questions unrelated. The first is it looks like you booked about $20 million of merger acquisition and integration expenses in the quarter. Just curious what those were, given that there's already been some distance since the merger occurred. The second question relates to the leasing CapEx. Looks like it's ticked up in a trailing 4-quarter basis up to 12.7% of your NOI. Or maybe expressed differently, you're now spending $1.50 per square foot in TIs. I'm curious, does that relate at all to the higher retention rate? Are you consciously selling out and putting a little more capital out the door upfront or is that merely a coincidence?","Thomas S. Olinger","9","Ross, this is Tom. I'll take the merger acquisition piece first. It's really a function of timing this quarter. It's 2 pieces. One is just as people are leaving the company, that's triggering certain merger costs. And people are winding down in Q3 as well as Q4. There's also some restructuring that we talked about last quarter that is happening in our European finance organization. That's a piece of it. And then there's some professional costs as well that are higher this quarter. And that's a little bit to do with the European finance restructuring and also the closeout. As you know, we brought PEPR in-house this quarter, and we fully -- there are some costs related to that as well.","Gary A. Anderson","Okay, Ross, let me try to answer the rollover costs. We leased 39 million square feet this quarter. And if you look at our portfolio of 565 million feet or whatever it is and look at an average lease term, which today is about 5 years, that is the normal level of rollover and leasing. It should be a little under 30 million feet. So when we calculate those costs per square foot, we're dividing them by the entire portfolio. So because we're leasing 20% more space, there are going to be more leasing costs in this quarter compared to a quarter where leasing activity is actually lower not in a per square foot basis, but on a percentage of NOI basis because it's a percentage of the entire NOI. If you actually look at the trends on a per square foot of leasing, they bounce around, but they're not trending up. They were lower, then they picked up and now they're ticking lower. There's a seasonality to this because there's a lot of leasing in the fourth quarter that's month to month, and those leases virtually have no TIs. They're all on an as-is basis. So while you do get some volatility in December, but if you look at the annual numbers and compare them even though we don't have comparable numbers, it doesn't seem to us that there's anything going on.","Hamid R. Moghadam","The other thing I would add to that is when you look at the leasing and turnover cost in terms of term that we're leasing, the cost on a per term basis is actually down. So we're not behind occupancy at any -- from any perspective. I mean our costs are actually trending down on a per term basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Guinee of Stifel.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","First, Walt, we are really going to miss you. Second, the way it looks to me, Tom, is that you're basically implying about a $0.40 per share FFO in the fourth quarter. And with all these asset sales, you're probably going to be trending down a little bit in 2013, which I think is all well and good. But the big issue is that the primary valuation metric for PLD is implied cap or premium discount to NAV. Can you talk a little bit about how you're managing the dispositions such that your implied cap rate doesn't decline at all as you have $4 billion, $5 billion worth of asset sales? And you're continually looking at this on a going forward basis, I'm assuming.","Hamid R. Moghadam","John, this is Hamid. We actually are not that smart to manage the timing of disposition. We have a pretty robust process for determining what assets are strategic and what are not, and it started out with a sort of global regional other market exercise. And then within the global markets, we looked at trimming our portfolio. So we have a sell list of what we want to sell over the first couple of years post merger. If anything, we've actually made better progress on that than we expected to because the markets have been good for selling assets, and we've been selling more assets as we've had success in the marketplace. So we don't really try to time it with respect to, \"Oh, if we sell these assets, the cap rate looks high this quarter and maybe that will hit our NAV maybe later.\" We're just getting it done. Obviously the assets we're selling, and we'll report on the aggregate number and see it in our supplemental, are the lower quality assets in our portfolio. We've been very explicit about that. So whatever -- the direction of cap rates in the company on the assets that remain will be going down because we're selling the high cap rate assets out the back. So you should expect that trend -- in a static cap rate world, our cap rate should go down over time because the portfolio is getting higher quality every day. And if you really want have a discussion about cap rates, we'd be happy to sit down and tell you what we think cap rates are market by market. It'd probably take too long to do it on this call. But we have very clear views on that. And I think we're responsible for if not half, probably 1\/3 of the product that's being put on the market and being sold. So we kind of know what's going on in the market with respect to real estate sales. And the market is very good.","Thomas S. Olinger","John, from a standpoint of run rate, if you look at the midpoint of our full year guidance which is $1.73, that implies we did $1.32 year-to-date. So that would imply $0.41 for Q4 to that midpoint. And it is a lower run rate than what we experienced in Q3 net of the deferred taxes. And it really is a function of the lumpiness that we're going to see regarding contributions and distributions. No, it's not -- unfortunately, it's not a straight line, and we're going to have ebbs and flows in Q3 with a lower quarter. We expect Q4 to be a much bigger quarter. And so there is some dilution in there, namely with our ability to redeploy the proceeds in the most accretive way, not just paying down the line but also being able to put it into new developments and the like and waiting for more higher interest rate debt to mature.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Let me give you one more thought on a way to think about dilution, which is I think your question. Basically, we know what activity we're going to do in terms of dispositions and fund formations, and we've given you ranges on the plan, and that's what we're executing. And if you put timing aside a little bit, we know what kind of debt we're going to get to, to repay preferreds and all that kind of stuff over time. And depending on the timing of those, those could be breakeven or they could be 200 kind of basis points to the bad depending on whether we're selling high-cap assets and retiring low-cost debt in a given quarter or something. But that's not where the major dilution numbers are going to come from. The major dilution number or accretion number is going to come up -- come out with how much land we monetize because the incremental return on our development pipeline is very high because the land is earning a negative return in terms of carrying cost and property taxes and all that. So the more of our land that we put into build-to-suit or our production, the quicker or the less dilution we have, and maybe we can have accretion if we put a lot of it to work. The message we hope that you take away from this call is that actually our build-to-suit business is going really, really well, and it's really picked up.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Bilerman of Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Tom, just a couple of quick follow-ups. I definitely appreciate the pro rata information on income statement balance sheet. Do you have just the first one, just same-store NOI on a pro rata see through basis? Obviously 2.7% is everything altogether, that's number one. Number two is just on the merger expenses, which you've talked about little bit on this call. You obviously say it a lot this quarter. You have you said $75 million for the year, which is $22.5 million for the fourth quarter. We're up to about $210 million of expenses. My memory, which is a little bit weak, but I think it was like $175, $200 of target when you guys announced the merger. And so I'm just curious, are we -- after the fourth quarter, is it ending? Because now we're at $210 relative to that original budget, so that's number two. Number three was just on rent growth. I want to -- when you talk about rent spreads turning positive next year, is there any rent growth built into that assumption for 2013? And the last question is just on Page 36. You have an adjustment of straight-line rents and amortization of lease intangibles, which is a positive $15 million. Can you break that out between what is current, which you disclosed as being negative $4 million? Is the balance everything related to the development pipeline as a positive adjustment?","Thomas S. Olinger","Michael, so on the same-store NOI look through, I don't have that...","Hamid R. Moghadam","And let me just say this. We don't actually track it that way. Culturally, would be a really bad thing to do. With respect to operating statistics of our portfolio, we have the one-portfolio policy. And whether it's in funds or balance sheets, our operating people responsible for delivering that performance are judged and measured by the overall results, not what they do for the funds versus the balance sheet. So we don't even keep track of it that way, and culturally, it would be a really bad signal to keep track of it that way.","Thomas S. Olinger","But, Michael, I wouldn't -- we can get you that number. I wouldn't expect it to be materially different than what we reported in any meaningful way, just given the mix of assets. And particularly given the strength in U.S., I would actually expect it might be a little higher given the proportion of U.S. On merger costs, we're done at the end of 2012 with merger costs. And what's happening in relation to our regional estimate, it's really 2 things. I guess 3 -- 2 things. The first is when we originally gave that guidance, we hadn't contemplated the PEPR cost, that's one. And the second piece of it is we just have higher costs related to personnel. And it's a function of 2 things. One, more synergies, more people that we had redundant positions than we originally estimated, so that's a good thing. It clearly drove our merger savings higher, but there was a cost to that. And the second piece was the financial reorg we're doing in Europe. So those pieces would make up the majority of the delta over our original estimate. And again, timing will close that out on -- at the end of 2012. Your last question regarding straight-line rent, again, I don't have that memory, but we can break that out for you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Salinsky of RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Hamid, I think you mentioned that you expect a little bit more -- you expect the margins to come in a little bit in your earlier comments. And also just looking out to the fourth quarter there, you talked a lot about e-retailing. How are you looking at inventory build on the retail side right now? Have you seen a normal build there or has that been a bit light?","Hamid R. Moghadam","No, I think it's still light compared to -- we're going to a choppy market. There's an election. There's a fiscal cliff. Three's all the stuff that you read about in the paper, so I think people are not getting over to excuse with respect to the amount of inventory they're going to carry in the chain. Having said that, I think consumer confidence is a lot stronger than most people would've guessed given all these headwinds. So I think we'll see. I think these guys are going to have a pretty good Christmas. And we may get caught pretty short on inventory into the new year. But that's a guess. I'm not an expert. You guys know more about that stuff than I do.","Thomas S. Olinger","Margins?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Oh, margins. Margins -- look, our land bank has gone from my getting a lot of questions about, is it worth any sense [ph] of what you're carrying here to how much more than what you're carrying it is its worth. I mean clearly, a 19% margin will tell you that our land cost basis aggregate is low because normal margins shouldn't be 19%. I think normal margins should be 14%, 15% for spec products and maybe 10%, 12% for build-to-suit. And the 19% is not the most impressive number. The 19%, given the mix of build-to-suits, was actually pretty impressive, but it just means that the land may be mispriced in a different way than people think.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brendan Maiorana.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Hamid, a question. I just want to follow up on the land. I heard the comments earlier that development seems like it is -- it's improving, the outlook is improving, the margins are high, and you mentioned I think in an earlier response to a question that land is going to drive earnings growth just given that it's a negative carry today. But you did start development during the quarter, but there was about $90 million of land acquisitions and $90 million of land monetized through development. When do you think that calculation starts to whittle your land balance down that you monetize land more than what you buy?","Hamid R. Moghadam","So I think as we laid out in our investor forum, I think a company our size that thinks that the opportunities are in the world in a normal year, about $2.5 billion needs to have about $1.5 billion of land around. And we now have about $2 billion of land around. So over time, and I would say 3, 4 years, we'll get our land bank down to where it needs to be. But it's going -- where it needs to be is about $1.5 billion. So it's not materially lower than what it is today. Now the reason land goes up is that when you put land into production, you have to put infrastructure into it and that counts as land. So land going up in the short term -- we bought a few parcels, particularly for some of our build-to-suits. For example, we bought some adjacent parcels to some parcels that we have because the build-to-suit that we procured needed more land than we had. And more importantly, we put infrastructure into the land, and that drives up the cost. So as you wrap up your development activity, your land number is actually going to go up because of infrastructure before it starts coming down. But we are pretty confident that we are on a good path. And if you take a 3, 4, 5-year view, we'll get down to where the land should be. Mike?","Michael S. Curless","I think it would be important to add, we are in very select situations, reloading our development machine with buying select parcels in places like Paris, Tokyo and L.A. But of all the land we bought this year, it's important to note that some 85% of that land will be put into production by 2013. So we are buying it but putting it very quickly back into production. In fact, 1\/2 of the land we bought this year will be in production by the end of this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Mueller, JPMorgan.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","In terms of the question, what part of the 10-quarter plan do you think is -- maybe the right term isn't the riskiest, but, yes, call it the riskiest to pull off by the end of 2013? Is it raising the capital in Europe? Is it raising the capital in Japan? Is it finding buyers for noncore stuff in the Americas?","Hamid R. Moghadam","The risk is part of the plan. In terms of timing or in terms of actually getting done?","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, getting done in the time frame you were talking about.","Hamid R. Moghadam","By 2013? I don't see it being risky. I don't -- I'm not trying to be Pollyannaish, but I don't see a whole lot of risk in executing it during the entire 10 quarter plan. I think if you're asking me what part of them will happen in the fourth quarter and what part of it will happen in the second quarter next year or first going next year, I think there's a lot of volatility around that. And I got to tell you, we've got to really be careful about those kinds of motivations not driving us to do silly deals, which we won't. So if we're all patient, take a deep breath, we'll get there and we'll get there -- we'll more than get there, I think, by the end of this plan.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Spector, Bank of America.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is actually Jamie Feldman here with Jeff. I guess my first part of my question is just a follow-up to that prior question. How are you guys thinking about the risk from the fiscal cliff and what seems to be generally slowing business decision-making on both your fourth quarter expectations and full year for next year for the 10 quarter plan? And then my actual question is actually following up, Hamid, you commented you think new lending requirements might hold back new development this cycle. I was hoping you could give maybe some examples of that or a little more color on what you mean and across what markets.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Okay, on the fiscal cliff and all the economic headwinds, all I can tell you is what our customers are telling us and what they're telling us is that they don't have a lot of pricing power, that their top line growth is anemic, they're selling more units but not with a lot of pricing power. So their margins are under pressure, and supply chain is the key to them actually maintaining margin or slowing down its erosion. So it's not like they want to spend money on more real estate, but they kind of got to, to maintain the unit flows that they're dealing with even at lower margins. That's the essence of what we're hearing from our customers. And the second part -- spending. Oh, yes. Actually I was talking to a couple of lenders at ULI last week, and it was interesting. They are -- most of the big lenders are already operating under Basel III with respect to these capital charges, even though they're not required to be. And boy, the mass of it is very punitive on construction lending. All construction lending is recoursed. The loan-to-value ratios are 60% to 65% with recourse to the best borrowers. I mean the matches doesn't work for a private guy trying to put 35%, 40% equity into a deal to do a spec deal at a low margin. So I think it's going to be pretty tough to build a new building. In fact there was an article, I think, in the Wall Street Journal today in the Journal that the bankers are screaming and they're going for some relief to the regulators to try to loosen this up a little bit. But the way it's structured now, I don't think you're going to see supply coming on board the way it has in previous cycles, which is really good for us.","Okay, that was the last question. So thank you for being here. And let me just leave you with 3 key takeaways. First we had a great quarter, and we're making excellent progress on our strategic priorities. Second, the main drivers of the recent uptick in demand are lack of construction, supply chain reconfiguration and growth in consumption, all the things we've just talked about.

My name is Kim, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Tracy Ward, you may begin your conference.","Tracy Ward","Thanks Kim, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2017 conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations.","This morning, we'll hear from Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover results and guidance and Hamid Moghadam, our Chairman and CEO, who will comment on the company's strategy and outlook. Also, joining us for today's call are Gary Anderson, Mike Curless, Ed Nekritz, Gene Reilly, and Diana Scott.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings.","Additionally, our first quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures and in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom, and we'll get started.","Tom Olinger","Thanks, Tracy. Good morning and thanks for joining our first quarter earnings call. I'll cover the highlight for the quarter, provide updated 2017 guidance and then I'll turn the call over to Hamid.","We had a strong start to the year with core FFO of $0.63 per share, which exceeded our expectations by little over $0.02. The outperformance from all areas of our business with $0.01 from operations, a little less than $0.01 from deployment and the remainder from strategic capital.","Asset quality and location have never been more important as supply chains extend closer to major population centers. Our portfolio is well-positioned to take advantage of this secular shift toward the end consumer.","We leased over 39 million square feet during the quarter, down from last year as we were effectively running out of space to lease. Global occupancy at the end of the quarter was 96.6%, an increase of 50 basis points year-over-year. Notably, occupancy in Europe increased 180 basis points over the same period to 96.7%.","Our share net effective rent change on rollover was a very healthy at 19.6%. U.S. was 29.2% an all-time high in the fifth straight quarter above 20%. Our share net effective same-store NOI growth was 5.8% for the quarter, driven by higher releasing spreads and a pick up in average occupancy. U.S. led the way with same-store NOI growth of 7.1%.","Our same-store pool does include development completion that are available for lease. Excluding these development assets, our same-store would have been 5.1% on a global basis for the quarter.","Moving to capital deployment, we had an active first quarter. Margins on stabilizations and starts remain very good and build-to-suits were 77% of our first quarter starts. Dispositions and contributions are on track. Fire activity remained strong and market cap rates depressing slightly. As a result, we're accelerating disposition timing.","We completed several transactions in our co-investment ventures during the first quarter, further streamlining our business. We sold our investment in European logistics venture generating $84 million in proceeds. Simultaneously we combine those $600 million venture into our targeted European logistics bond resulting in a vehicle with $3.2 billion in assets.","In the U.K., we formed a new $1.3 billion development to hold venture, generating $213 million in proceeds. In the U.S., we acquired our partner's remaining equity interest in our North American Industrial Fund or NAIF for $710 million and currently own a 100% of this $3 billion vehicle.","Finally, we acquired an additional 25% interest in our Brazilian platform for $80 million and currently own 50%. We expect to recapitalize our ownership in NAIF over time, providing us with about $1.8 billion of future incremental liquidity.","All of this activity is consistent with our plan to rationalize our funds into fewer differentiated vehicles. We now have 10 funds down from 20 in 2012. During this same period, we significantly increased our third party AUM and corresponding revenues and now over 90% of our fees from -- 90% of our fees from these vehicles are perpetual life.","Turning to capital markets, during the quarter we completed two-yen financing, underscoring our ability to access the global capital markets at very attractive levels. This included recasting our \u00a550 billion revolver at a 40-basis point spread over yen LIBOR and we completed a \u00a512 billion unsecured loan at a fixed rate of 95 basis points and a term of over 10 years.","Our leverage increased to 36.7% on a book basis at quarter end as a result of deployment timing. However, we expect to work this back down below 35% by year-end. We ended the quarter with $3.8 billion in liquidity and remain well positioned to self-fund our future deployment.","Moving to guidance for 2017, I'll cover the significant updates on our share basis. So, for complete detail, refer to Page 5 of our supplemental. We're increasing our forecast for year-end occupancy to range between 96% to 97%. We're also increasing and narrowing the range for same-store NOI growth to between 4.5% and 5.25%.","The impacted development completions on our same-store pool is less than 50 basis points for the full year. Our in-place leases continue to be 12% under rented globally and this will be a significant driver of NOI growth forward.","Cash same-store NOI growth should be higher than net effective by over 100 basis points for the year as the lag from longer lease terms and steeper rent bumps begins to close. There is no change to our 2017 deployment guidance; however, you should note that the acquisition of the remaining equity interest in NAIF is not included in these amounts.","For strategic capital, we now expect net promote income for 2017 to range between $0.12 and $0.14 per share. The increase of $0.06 at the midpoint is due to rising property values from higher-than-expected rents and slight cap rate compression.","I want to remind everyone that there will be a mismatch between the timing of promote revenue and its related expenses. As a result, in the second quarter, you will see a net promote of $0.13 to $0.15 per share with the remaining expenses recognized over the balance of the year.","Our 2017 estimated core FFO was fully hedged relative to the U.S. dollar and we've already hedged most of 2018 and almost half of 2019. We also remain well insulated from foreign currency movements impacting NAV as we ended the quarter with over 93% of our net equity in U.S. dollars.","With the strength and operations, higher promote and higher deployment, we're increasing and narrowing our 2017 core FFO range by $0.10 at the midpoint to between $2.72 and $2.78 per share. The components of the raise are driven by $0.06 from promote, $0.04 from operations, $0.01 to $0.02 from net deployment timing offset primarily by slower development leasing in Brazil.","Our revised guidance represents a year-over-year increase of 7% at the midpoint or 8% higher excluding promotes. The success of our strategy of having the highest quality assets and into locations is evident in both our financial and operating results. 2017 is off to a great start and we remain focused on continuing to drive growth while further simplifying our business.","With that, I'll turn it over to Hamid.","Hamid Moghadam","Good morning, everyone. As you just heard from Tom, we had another great quarter. The strategies we put in place years ago, combined with strong market fundamentals and relentless exclusion by our team will lead to continued good performance in the foreseeable future.","In my commentary, I'll touch on some nuances on the margin, but the basic message is that our business is strong and absent an external shock, we expect it to remain that way for quite some time.","Looking at the current market dynamics, following a period of accelerating demand last year, the U.S. industrial market levelled off to a more sustainable pace in the first quarter. Demand was broader than just eCommerce and was driven by other sectors such as housing and transportation. This picture would have been even stronger but for several retailer bankruptcies.","Turning to supply, I would like to flag a few markets where we see some risk. In the U.S., strong demand and sub 5% vacancies seem to have encouraged elevated levels of spec development in some regional markets like Indianapolis and Louisville as well as larger markets like Dallas, Houston, Atlanta and Southern California's Inland Empire.","Public REITs have remained disciplined, accounting for just 16% of spec start in the first quarter. By contrast the handful of merchant developers, backed by institutional capital are fueling this wave of development.","After seven years of demand outpacing supply, we still expect to reach equilibrium in 2017, but given the number of new starts underway this year, we now expect supply to slightly outpace demand in 2018. Nevertheless, it's key to remember that a market in equilibrium at 5% vacancy still translates into pricing power for quality properties in the right locations.","For us Europe continues to benefit from the favorable supply-demand balance and record low vacancies, especially in the U.K., Germany and the Netherlands. We expect Europe to boost our growth starting in 2018. Development in Europe remain disciplined in the first quarter and in our case, 100% of our starts in the region were build-a-suits.","The exception to discipline in Europe remains Poland what its low barriers to development and builders who continue to lower investors with artificially inflated headline rents.","Recently I fielded many questions about the potential of -- potential relocation of manufacturing activities and its impact on our business. I'd like to remind everyone that starting more than a decade ago, we began to realign our portfolio towards major population centers to take advantage of the consumption power in these regions.","With very few exceptions such as the border market in Mexico and a tiny piece of our business in China, our holdings are oriented towards the consumption, not the production end of the supply chain. As a result, our logistic real estate is increasingly the last touch on goods before they reach the customer.","While we're monitoring policy developments around the world on tax and trade, we remain as convinced as ever that our focus on high barrier markets where land is scarce and new development is expensive and where more than 85% of our portfolio is located will help us deliver strong relative performance over time.","To conclude, we continue to have a positive outlook for 2017. Our strategy to own top-quality logistics real estate in sought after locations near consumers has never been more relevant. Over the next few quarters, we'll continue to show how quality and location can create a strong foundation for sustainable earnings growth in the years ahead.","With that, I'll turn it over to Kim for your questions. Kim? Operator? Can the participants hear us? Is there a way somebody can send one of us an email or something? I don't know what happened to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rob Simone. Your line is open.","Rob Simone","Hey guys. Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking the question. Hamid, did I hear you right that you expect supply to outpace demand next year?","Hamid Moghadam","Yeah best guess, I think demand will be in the low 200 million feet in the U.S. and supply, which is not a lot of guesswork by the way. You kind of know what supply is going to be out in 12 months and the 14 months. I think supply is going to be like 230 million to 245 million. So maybe\u2026","Rob Simone","Oh! Sorry, I was going to ask do you guys have a view for kind of what that may mean for the pricing environment and your roll up?","Hamid Moghadam","Nothing. In terms of our forecast, we were pretty much counting on supply exceeding demand in their sub 5% vacancy market in 2018, 2019 timeframe and we're not really saying anything new. We just don't want anybody to be surprised when supply finally responds to demand.","And the issue is I would say focused on maybe five or six market and if a few players.","Rob Simone","Okay. Great. Thanks. I'll queue up again.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sumit Sharma. Your line is open.","Sumit Sharma","Sumit Sharma, but that's okay. All right.","Hamid Moghadam","I think it was worst.","Sumit Sharma","I've heard it, yeah. So, it's okay. All right so Sharma is on. Okay. So, we've been -- we've been tracking some of the demand for logistics assets in Europe and I guess across the world and have recently noticed more discussions on last mile delivery, particularly as it works in the Continent.","I think Amazon was out over the week -- in the headlines over the weekend with some 1300 last mile warehouses needed in Continent I guess. So just wanted to get a sense of how your portfolio, specifically the European portfolio is positioned in terms of last mile versus let's say bulk?","And second, I guess how does the CBRE co-venture equal into this equation as it applies to the U.K. side of things?","Hamid Moghadam","Okay. That was two questions but since they -- they destroyed your name, we're going to let you go away with it. So, let me start with the last one first. The U.K. joint venture is purely the reason for it is that the capacity of our existing funds to absorb completed product is limited and our U.K. development machine can produce some very good assets at very good margin.","So, we needed a home for our excess development volume in the U.K. and that was the purpose of forming this center. So, it's very, very simple.","With respect to the last mile industrial real estate, let me give you the cynical view and my view because there are two views out there. The cynical view is that everybody is calling. They're not so great real estate, that old obsolete, poorly located last mile and putting some shine on it to get better cap rate execution on sale.","I can assure you that's not what we're doing. We are very deliberately going after the last mile opportunity by actually investing in infill sites in major metro areas around the world, but specifically in the U.S. and Europe and to redevelop and densify assets to do multistory buildings in these land-constraint locations.","In fact, we had our ground breaking on our first property of this type in the U.S. last week in Seattle and you can expect us to have further announcements of these kinds of properties. And if you remember, we basically had two company strategies coming together.","Before the merger AMB was very much and more of an infill large market player. Prologis was much more of a bulk player. We have now rationalized those two portfolios coming together by reducing everything down to the global market, but there is still a very large component of near infill last mile last, last five miles whatever you want to call it.","The name is not important, but infill real estate in major -- metro areas, which were predominantly the old AMB assets. now AMB's presence in Europe was lower than Prologis and so I would say the mix of those opportunities are greater for us in the U.S. then in Europe, but we are just as deliberate about those opportunities in Europe and you can see us getting after that opportunity in a major way with some initiatives that we have ongoing right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck. Your line is open.","Blaine Heck","Thanks. Good morning out there. Just wanted to talk a little bit about the uptick and same-store NOI guidance. I guess it was a little surprising given that you saw same-store expenses tick up a little higher this quarter than they've been running. Maybe for Tom, can you talk about whether the increase in expenses was expected and what's driving that increase?","Tom Olinger","Yeah, the increase in expenses is primarily due to just higher real estate taxes. You see the offset in revenues as well. So, they're recoverable. It had about a 30-basis point impact on revenues. So quite small actually. So, same-store revenue growth was still over 4% with OpEx. So, nothing to look into the expenses. It's really a matter of little bit of timing and mostly the real estate taxes, but don't expect that to be a trend this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman. Your line is open.","Jamie Feldman","Great. Thank you. Hamid, you had commented on retailer bankruptcies maybe dragging on some of the demand in the quarter you're seeing across the markets maybe specific markets and maybe what your expectations are going forward?","Hamid Moghadam","Yeah Jamie, I don't know if I have any unique insights on retailer bankruptcy, but let me give you this because there are fixed in our portfolio. We monitor credit loss pretty carefully and we underwrite every tenant's credit in every industry sector.","In our typical pro formas, we assume about a 0.5% credit loss. We're running at 20 basis points. So, we're significantly below trend and for those of you who have been around long enough as you have, in the global financial crisis we got up to the low 1% range in terms of credit loss.","So, if you pinpointed to what some people refer to as troubled retailers, our exposure to those guys is less than 0.5% or 1% of the portfolio and frankly in a lot of those instances we would rather gave up the space than they\u2019ve in the space. So, I don't -- that's not on my first three pages of issues I worry about.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico. Your line is open.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. Can you just quantify a little bit more the impact of consolidating NAIF and also what was the benefit to full year FFO and then from a yield basis, it looks like it might be -- you gave some of the pro forma NOI adjustments. It looks, it's not clear if that was for a full quarter or not, but looks like you bought it around six-type yield, is that correct?","Tom Olinger","This is Tom. I'll take that. So, first of all from the impact of the earnings on the year, you've got to look at deployment in total. So, as I said in my prepared remarks, we see deployment higher by $0.01 to $0.02 for the full year.","Clearly, NAIF is part of driving that increase. However, we've also talked about, I also mentioned that we're accelerating sales as well. So, from a timing perspective those are offsetting to about $0.01 to $0.02 a share.","The impact for the quarter in our EBITDA that we show in the supplemental, we do pro forma for a full quarter impact of that. So, you are seeing the full quarter impact of the NAIF transaction in our stock.","Hamid Moghadam","Yeah and the real cap rate the way we count it was midsize, but given that the portfolio was pretty well occupied, the actual cash yield was higher than that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick. Your line is open.","Tom Lesnick","Hey, good morning out there on the West Coast. Hamid, I appreciate your comments earlier about the shifts in supply and demand and calling out a few markets there. I guess bigger picture with the potential repeal and\/or replace Dodd Frank and the relaxation of lending standards, do you think that the investor base this time around will remain more self-disciplined or do you think that the banking system will really have to be the governor once again?","Hamid Moghadam","Well I think Basel III is actually the bigger governor than Dodd Frank. So, they need to obviously count based on risk based capital rules and that just makes the business less profitable than it was before given the reserve requirements and they need to retain.","So, I think there's that general backdrop anyway. As to people's discipline, I don't know. Memories are not very long in this business, but I think the business has really, really changed in other ways than just the banking system.","I think land is much more difficult to come by. The cities are getting much, much tougher on land and those are tougher and more expensive. So, the average cost and size of the industrial building is going up. So, the barrier for entry of smaller players is now higher. There is a ton of information.","You get on this call and there are 200 people on this call right. So, all of them just heard me say that I think supply is going to be a different picture in the first quarter next year and there are some people that are potentially getting a little bit over their skis.","Well guess what, that word will get around pretty quickly. Now I don't want to give too much credit to Prologis and our role in this call, but I think there is just so much information around that investors cannot escape the reality of what's happening to these markets and frankly they are accountable to their investors.","So pretty soon they're going to get called from pension funds, why you're putting out money when the legislator and the business is saying that the market is getting softer. So, I think it's just a different environment than it was in the last cycle.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line David Rodgers. Your line is open.","David Rodgers","Hey guys and Hamid maybe I don't know if Eugene and Gary want to take some of this too. But I wanted to ask about rent growth and retention. Clearly, you've been driving retention down and driving rents higher. You're down to that point of about 75% retention overall, I think in the first quarter.","I guess maybe give us a sense for how that compares across the regions and then also if you could just talk about how that you might level off here in terms of the pushback that you're seeing from tenants moving into the second quarter?","Eugene Reilly","David it's Gene. Let me start and Gary can pile on. So historically we've got to put this in context. Historically 75% retention is the number of people actually seek to achieve. So that's a very, very solid level. Now we've been at elevated levels obviously in the 80s for many quarters and if you look at a trend line, we're headed down.","But I am perfectly comfortable with mid-70s. Frankly I am comfortable with probably 70% and even a little bit below that because what we're asking the teams to do today is really push rent and be more aspirational in this -- in this environment where we have vacancy rates that we've literally never seen before in many, many markets.","So, I wouldn't be concerned about the direction. And so far, at least our activities in terms of pushing rents have bearing fruit and you look at the rent change look at that. In terms of how that's distributed across the Americas, I'd say in the U.S. you frankly it's pretty consistent across markets.","In Mexico, we have much more trouble pushing rents right now. That's really a Peso effect and Brazil has a challenging economic and political background. They're not pushing rents there at this point. So, Gary, I don't know if you would add.","Gary Anderson","I would say for Europe, we're in a position today where we are trying to push rents in most markets. So, you can see that coming through our numbers. Obviously, occupancies are high. From a market rent growth perspective today, Europe in 2017 we're forecasting of just under 2.5% accelerating here to above 3%.","So, things are heading in the right direction certainly in Europe. In Japan, candidly market rent growth is probably around 1% and we're forecasting about the same next year will be different market to market, stronger in Tokyo, less strong in Osaka. And in China, again market rent growth is accelerating. It's probably around 3.5% today and it's going to go over 4.5% next year.","So, I'd say arrow up on market rent growth and given the strength that we're seeing in occupancies we will be pushing rents in most of those markets as well.","Hamid Moghadam","The only comment I have to add is that if retention had to come in at 80%, I would've been all over these guys that were not pushing rents high enough. Frankly we would have been running it too high and just facing taking the rents as they come.","So, we're pushing term, we're pushing credit. Somebody if we have the lease that are concerned on renewal with a tenant we're going to replace them with a high credit quality tenants. So, I look at the lower retention as a positive sign and I actually wish that it were even lower rate.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee. Your line is open.","John Guinee","Great. Hamid, because of the butchering of the name I'll get 17 questions for you. So that is full shorter than last time, but we can't. This is a development question, I am looking Page 23 and Page 26 of your supplemental.","First on the land it looks like half of your land at share is South Florida, Central Valley, Mexico, Brazil, the United Kingdom and Japan.","Hamid Moghadam","Well you just covered half the world economies.","John Guinee","Do you own the right land in the right markets? And then the second question as a sort of a second part of this question, if I'm looking at your development portfolio, can you give a little more color on what you're building where? For example, you've got 6.2 million square feet under construction on the West at about $76 a square foot, which seems kind of low to me. Exactly where is that development being built?","Hamid Moghadam","All right. Let me make two general comments and then turn it over to other for more specific color. First of all, seriously the markets that you went through Japan, West Coast, Florida and all that, if you had to mile up together, they all probably have the world's economy.","But there are two really, really big and significant land positions we have. One is Beacon Lakes in Florida and one in Tracy which is the REIT -- and which relates to your $76 a foot type question. It is low because the land in Tracy at this point is pretty much free because we've pretty much returned our total investment on that land and I know the accounting doesn't quite work that way.","But the land at Tracy is like a good $30 a foot of FAR on their market. So, it should be $100 a foot and $70 because we got really good price of land and by the way, we have another 800 acres of it for free. So, you can see us do a lot of business at very attractive land basis over there.","Beacon Lakes is not quite as dramatic as that, both in terms of size and the advantage of the land value, but it is significant and those are the two large pieces of land and do you guys want to talk about specifics?","Eugene Reilly","Yeah just to give you a little color John. This is Gene, if you look at the overall land bank, we had too much land in Mexico and we're working down as quickly as we can. We have a lot of land in Brazil, but we control much of that through effectively land JVs.","So, we're not like carrying that land and that's going to be -- we're going to make a lot of money on that land over the next five years obviously in the last couple of years, not much activity.","In terms of what are we building where, Hamid pretty much answered the question. The low cost per square foot is driven by really two things. One, we have a ton of activity out in our park in Tracy, California, which is in the Central Valley.","And secondly, we have a really, really high percentage of build-a-suit right now. I don't know Mike if you some color on that, but build-a-suits tend to be bigger and they tend to have lower values per square foot.","Mike Curless","Maybe just to tie it all together, for broader view John, overall mix globally is going to be 45% of Americas, 25% Europe and 30% in Asia, which is very comparable to last year. Often, we start with margins in the quarter at 19%.","In fact, those are normalized in the 16% range over the year and Gene's comment on build-a-suit, we were at 77% build-a-suit in Q1. That was a function of a lot of continuation of a very successful build-a-suit program. We expect that to normalize over the year in the mid-40s, but I would expect that to be higher than our build-a-suit percentage last year.","So, net, net, I think we feel once again good about the mix and the quality of our development volume and the quarter here on NAIF.","Hamid Moghadam","On the overall land balance, I would say there is a $150 million of land that we have, that I would not buy all over again. I think the rest of it we're totally good with and we think is going to be a great driver of growth for our portfolio.","But there is probably a $150 million of it that with the benefit of hindsight win by and would be disposing over time.","Mike Curless","Which is less on sellers that we had at the merger of that stuff. So, we got through a whole bunch of that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman. Your line is open.","Craig Mailman","Hey guys. Just curious looking at the starts in Europe, it looks like it was 100% build-a-suits and I know you guys been pretty positive on what you're seeing over there. I'm just curious this is a trend that's likely to continue and maybe what it really indicates here as you look at the existing stock versus kind of the tendency that is doing with the build-a-suit to you guys and where are those build-a-suits. Are they more infill or are they more bulk?","Hamid Moghadam","Yeah, I would say that they're -- look we're a 100% build-a-suit. We're not forecasting a 100% build-a-suit for the full year. I think we're going to end up some of the 15% to 16% just like last year. They're spread all around Slovakia, the Netherlands, Italy and the U.K.","So going back to the earlier question, is our land in the right place? Of course, it is. If you're doing 50% to 60% build-a-suit on land that you own, by definition your land is in the right place.","Most of this I would describe as infill as opposed to bulk. Candidly most of this had to do with retail. It was apparel. It was consumer good and actually one was automotive.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman. Your line is open.","Manny Korchman","Hey Tom, a question for you. If we think about capital deployment, especially outside of guidance, do you have an event like the NAIF buyout. Is there anything like outside I contemplated in or out of guidance sort of a big bulky plan like that and B, why are you excluding that from guidance?","Tom Olinger","So, don't anticipate any other transaction like that. That was not in our initial guidance because that came together quite quickly with discussions with our partner, but don't anticipate any other large transactions like that during the year.","The reason why we don't put it in our guidance per se as an acquisition because those assets are already reflected. They're consolidated on our balance sheet. They're all there. So, we don't reflect them as an acquisition because we're not adding to our portfolio. We're just taking a bigger piece of the portfolio.","So that's why we describe it separately and don't try to confuse our acquisitions, which are real incremental adds to our portfolio.","Hamid Moghadam","But these things just to be clear, I don't want you to take from what Tom said that we're asleep over here and we're not looking at opportunities. If the right opportunity came along and we could buy it at the right number or we could finance it appropriately at the right number and finance it appropriately at the night right number, we would look at all of those opportunities and we have been looking at all those opportunities.","And just that we don't know about any of them right now, but we're always looking and we're always working on things.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao. Your line is open.","Vincent Chao","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just seeing with that the line of thinking about the right opportunities coming along, just curious if there are other larger end deals out there that are interesting right now outside of your funds. Clearly a global logistics properties is undergoing a strategic review, but just curious how that factors into the thinking?","Hamid Moghadam","I can't think of a significant transaction in the industrial sector in the last three or four years that we have not looked at thoroughly underwritten and had a point of view on. So, you could expect us to be looking at everything. Now we're very selective about what we pull the trigger on, but let's leave it at that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel. Your line is open.","Eric Frankel","Thank you. Hamid, could you -- I think the term last mile has certainly gotten some legs over the last few quarters, and it's generated a lot of investor interest in this sector. Could you qualify the term further in terms of what type of functionality and what kind of demographics around the building would really qualify as a facility that would facilitate the delivery of packages to consumers?","Hamid Moghadam","The need to be located in a market with a significant population and a high level of affluence, college education, Internet usage, connectivity etcetera, etcetera, it needs to be dense, it needs to be supply constrained either physically or politically because of the nature of its residents.","So putting all those filters on the markets in the U.S., I would say the top markets would emerge as San Francisco, Seattle, New York, Miami, possibly Chicago, parts of LA. And the buildings, there is no rules that I can give you about the type of building you will be in terms of size or number of stories, but the new varieties are likely to be multistory.","They're probably not as important to have dock height access and demand in smaller truck access and they need to be near thoroughfares. In terms of -- in terms of rent potential, it would be trading really significantly at the different price points at it -- if you will 10 mile out type of real estate.","In other words, there needs to be a pretty significant rent gradient and there are some markets who are being close to the center action or not being that far away from that don't have a rent gradient because basically it's a very suburban eyes market. It's very spread out like it's tough to imagine last mile and Houston even though it's a big city and hits a lot of the other greats here because it doesn't have the supply constraints and the concentration of population in neighborhood, it's very spread out.","So those would be the criteria and I got to tell you, they are -- it's unfortunate and you've seen us use the word last tough more than last mile because last mile is really not a last mile. It's last drive or 10 miles and it's really the last touch before you hit the consumer directly.","There is a lot of really awful old, tired real estate that it rebranded as last mile we always get a chuckle out of that when we these packages come around. So, a lot of those properties don't meet the criteria that I just spoke.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim. Your line is open.","Ki Bin Kim","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. We talked a lot about that last mile and different markets and supply and demand, but Hamid when you look at the industrial landscape besides development, just more market specific and maybe asset quality, where do you think the best places are to put your capital to work and what I mean by that is it still kind of A assess in A markets or has it gone down to maybe A assess and B markets. So just how do you think about that.","Hamid Moghadam","Look, the real estate market is not that different than the bond market. When the waters are warm and calm, people get a lot of courage and people really stretch for pricing of the assets. All fear goes out of the market.","Junk spreads collapse and the yield premia of not so great real estate collapses on top of prime real estate etcetera, etcetera. We have been in one of those environments for some periods of time. So, I do think junkier real estate has had a rally just like junk bonds have had a rally.","When there is a little bit more fear in the marketplace and people sort of gravitate towards quality, those spread roll out and prime real estate will do better. We're not smart enough and we're certainly not agile enough at almost 700 million feet to trade around that.","You guys may be in terms of the stock, but we're not. So, we need to set the strategy and execute on it because we can't trade around the site portfolio we have.","Our view is that in the very long term, having infill real estate near the population centers in these quality locations with supply constraints wins regardless of possibly one year out of five or two years out of five when the junk rallies. In the long term, you get much better adjusted returns by being in these markets.","And we think in our estimation the cap rates historically if you average it over long periods of time, have been far, far more than compensated for by the higher growth rate of those markets. So yes, you pay the premium in terms of the lower cap rate, be in those markets, but you picked up double maybe 250% of that in terms of incremental growth rate.","Just look at where you are today in Los Angeles or San Francisco with respect to those -- where those rents are compared to Memphis just to begin, Memphis, when I started my career in 1980, the rent at Memphis were probably higher than they are today, but not in these supply constrained markets that we talked about.","So, if you're playing a long game, not a quarter-by-quarter game, you want to have money invested in supply constrained markets where people want to live and this is going to become much more important as the winners in industrial space are going to be more on the consumption end because of eCommerce than the production and which is the way the world used to work in the old days.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Neil Malkin. Your line is open.","Neil Malkin","Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just given the focus and bias toward the end consumer, can you give us a flavor or feel for how much of your portfolio currently is that and consumer versus bulk supply chain and how that also stacks up in your development pipeline, I guess if you just focus on the U.S.?","Hamid Moghadam","It is a continuum. There is not a bright spot that one property falls in and one property falls out. I think the best way of looking at that is to look at the global markets, which our share is now almost 90% in global markets and the big regional markets, we don't have any tertiary markets. We've sold all of those.","Now within the major markets, about a third of our portfolio is around the 100,000 feet or lower. About a third of it is in that 10,000 to 250 range and the rest of it is in the 250 and up range. I would exclude the 250 and up range even though I can think of a couple of larger buildings that are very infill.","But I would say, two thirds of our portfolio meets the consumption. I would say the production and the other way of coming at it other than our properties in the northern part of Mexico there is very little production going on. In fact, Chris what's the manufacturing percentage in our portfolio today?","Chris Caton","It's less than 5%.","Hamid Moghadam","Less than 5% of our portfolio is oriented towards manufacturing. So by definition, the rest of it is on that consumption or in the wholesaler end of the supply chain.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Simone. Your line is open.","Rob Simone","Hey guys, thanks for the follow-up. Tom this one might be for you, but I was wondering if you could expand a little bit on the tick up in free rent this quarter over last quarter? I think it was about $20 million versus $14 million last year and I guess given where you guys occupancy is today and in that most of the leasing already being completed, I guess you would have expected that tick down.","So, I am just looking for additional color and what should we expect going forward?","Tom Olinger","Yeah good question, so when we report free rent, straight line rent, that's reported on leases that commence in the quarter, so which is different than what we report when we lease signings right. So, the leasing activity reported lease signing. The straight line rent, free rent is a function of leases that commence.","So, when you look at Q4 versus Q1, Q1 had almost 50% more lease commencements happening right. Q1 is our biggest role. We signed those leases well in advance of Q1. So, the signing showed up a quarter or two ago, but the actual commencement is what triggers the straight line rent free rent.","So that's what's driving that aspect of it. When you look at concession, I don't have the numbers offhand, but concessions are clearly continuing to tick down right. Even though you're seeing those numbers grow it's a function of commencements, but also we're signing longer leases.","Leases are also increasing right. Rents are going up dramatically. All that increases your nominal amount of rent, but when you look at that concession relative to the whole value of the lease, clearly, they're ticking down.","Hamid Moghadam","Well, we were just having this conversation earlier. We're going to just put that out in the package next time and show its trend over time because it's obviously a question that comes up every call and we need to just show it to you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sumit. Your line is open.","Sumit Sharma","Okay. It's me again.","Hamid Moghadam","One question now.","Sumit Sharma","Yeah, yeah. They got the name right, so sticking with the old cynical thing and not looking at the bright side of life from the Monty Python thing, I guess how of -- we spend a lot of airtime on last mile and definitions have been exchanged and you mentioned a bit about multistory warehouses.","I guess what I'm wondering is how much of this stuff is if you look at some of the experience in London versus Asia, Asia it's done well, but in London it's been viewed as a bit of a science experiment, particularly some properties next to Heathrow had issues with ramps and such. So how do you mitigate that as you are looking towards I'm hoping more builds of that nature in the U.S. judging by your comments?","Hamid Moghadam","So, let me give you a story, which you may find amusing, but the developer of MX 2, which is the building you're referring in London went to Singapore is now almost 10, 12 years ago, literally asked us to give them a tour of our Alps project in Singapore, which we did.","It took the plans and built the same building in London without thinking about the differentiated truck sizes in those two markets, which is why MX 2 stays on lease for as long as it did. That's the story you can file away. The person in question is no longer in the business. So that's what happened and that building -- why that building didn't lease. It was the wrong building in the wrong pocket.","I think it's all a function of land values. I think when land values get to a certain point, multistory will make sense and there are a few markets in the United States that are approaching that point. Obviously in Japan you've got the benefit of smaller trucks and very high land values.","So that's why you see the five or six or seven story building. I think you're not going to see that in the U.S. anytime soon, certainly not in my career in bulk. Oftentimes people have asked what's the size of that opportunity? I think there are probably five or six obvious markets in the U.S. where that opportunity exists I think I mentioned them all before.","In those instances, it is not hard to imagine that eventually it could have a portfolio of three, four, five million square feet and I'm talking 10 years out. So just for thinking purposes if you got five or six cities at three to five million, you got 20 to 30 million feet of product that is multistory in these major markets and the value of that product is about double what it is for our traditional investor product in our portfolio.","So, in terms of value, we could end up being about 10% of the business order of magnitude, incremental over time. That's the best I can do to size the opportunity set for you. Time will tell how successful we will be, but I think we'll be really successful.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line at Eric Frankel. Your line is open.","Eric Frankel","Thank you. Just two very quick follow-ups. One, what is for your multistory development in Seattle you just started, who are your, who are the tenants that can possibly take that. I can only think of three at this point that are really big parcel delivery companies. So, it's Amazon, UPS and FedEx?","And then second on the supply front, do you see opportunities down the road for potentially helping some of these developers recapitalize some projects if they feel like they got over their skis and the profits that developers have underwritten or maybe little bit aggressive?","Hamid Moghadam","I think those developers will do fine because they\u2019ve got some institution's money and it\u2019s the old-fashioned game. If it works on the upside, they have their promote and equity interest and if doesn't work on the outside, they got some fee upside, they got some fees and got going for a while and the institution which is oftentimes a pension fund through an advisor ends up beating it.","So, I don't think there's going to be a lot of distress because these are by and large not heavily bank financed deals. These are more institutionally financed types of deals. So, I think you'll have some disappointing returns for the investors and hopefully they won't finance them next round of development.","I think that's going to how it -- that's how it's going to resolve itself. In terms of your first question, could you repeat the first part of your question?","Eric Frankel","Customer composition.","Hamid Moghadam","Oh, just stay tuned. I think our issue right now is trying to figure out how to respond to the interests in that project. So, when I am at liberty to talk about it I will.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman. Your line is open.","Manny Korchman","Hey just wondering in terms of demand from capital or institutional investors for product, I think Hamid earlier you had said that there's demand ahead of the supply and so developers are getting comfortable building more supply. If we were to take that same analogy I guess and think about capital? Is it more capital chasing assets and their supply of assets? Is that a fair assumption?","Hamid Moghadam","Well yeah and that's why cap rates that we keep saying are stabilizing, are going down because the way the capital is pushing those cap rates down, but we don't blame -- we're not building our business around cap rate compression and rents growing at 10%, 12% a year or like they have been.","I think we've shared our assumptions with you. They're essentially based on flat or slightly uptick in cap rates and moderate rental growth, it varies by market, but sort of in that 3% to 4% or 5% range in the U.S. market by market. This is market rent. Same-store will actually be pretty much baked in at somewhat higher because of -- because of the mark-to-market obviously.","But happy to go through those assumptions, but we're not building a business around the market being exuberant going forward. I think our assumptions are much more sobering.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters.","Hamid Moghadam","Okay. Great. Thank you for your time and interest in the company and good luck with earnings season. We'll see you all around pretty soon. Take care.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Tracy Ward, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Tracy Ward","Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2014 conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations.","This morning, we will hear from Hamid Moghadam, our Chairman and CEO, who will comment on the company\u2019s strategy and the market environment; and then from Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover results and guidance. Also joining us for today\u2019s call are Gary Anderson; Mike Curless; Ed Nekritz; Gene Reilly; and Diana Scott.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I\u2019d like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates as well as management\u2019s beliefs and assumptions.","Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filing.","Additionally, our fourth quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures, and in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Hamid and we\u2019ll get started.","Hamid Moghadam","Thanks, Tracy, good morning, everyone. We had a terrific quarter to finish off an excellent year. A year into our three year strategic plan, which we presented to you back in September 2013, we are ahead on both earnings and deployment targets. Our outperformance reflects the strength of our reposition portfolio, which today is focused on the highest quality assets and the best markets around the globe. Our earnings in 2014 exceeded the top end of our guidance driven by operations and capital deployment.","Let me take a few minutes to discuss the three key elements of our strategic plan. Our first priority has been capitalized on the rental recovery. The improvement in market fundamentals has been strong, but somewhat uneven across regions. It is well underway in the Americas, Asia and certain parts of Europe at a pace ahead of our initial projections, while Southern, Central and Eastern Europe lag behind. In the U.S., net absorption in 2014 was right on our forecast, double the rate of deliveries. Our U.S. occupancy outperformed the market by 320 basis points, demand was broad based.","At year-end, we were more than 98% occupied in many of our markets. This occupancy combined with double-digit rent change on roll over resulted in same store NOI growth of more than 5% in the U.S. and 3.7% of overall. For 2015, we forecast deliveries of 165 million square feet against absorption of 225 million square feet leading to further increases in occupancies.","Moving to Europe, despite the bifurcated recovery at 95%, our occupancy in the region outperformed the market by 210 basis points. As we forecasted, cap rate compression has been a headwind on rent the growth in Europe. What\u2019s surprising is how far and how fast cap rates have dropped on the continent? While absorption and delivery information is hard to come by in Europe, we estimate Class A absorption of 66 million square feet compared to new deliveries of 45 million square feet in 2014. This drove market occupancy up by 150 basis points.","Looking forward, market occupancies in Europe will continue to rise as the supplier remains constrained. We see space utilization running at a high level forcing customers to leave more space to support their incremental growth just as they did in the U.S. two years ago. In Asia, market conditions continue to be strong and pretty much on plan.","Our second priority has been to realize value from our land bank through development. Last year, we put $430 million of land to work in developments with an estimated overall profit margin of 20%. These outside margins are driven by the low book value of our land which has a build out potential of about $11 billion of properties overtime.","Our third priority has been to leverage our scale to grow earnings. Our global reach allows us to deploy capital where we see the highest risk-adjusted returns often ahead of the pack. In the U.S., where market conditions are strong and values are high, we have been a net seller of non-strategic holdings. Conversely in Europe, our focus was on development where we acquired quality assets at significant discounts to replacement cost. Timing here was critical as cap rates compressed throughout the year.","For perspective, we took the proceeds from our dispositions and contributions at a weighted average cap rate of 6.2% and redeployed those proceeds into higher yielding assets at a weighted average cap rate of 6.8%. The net result was a favorable spread of 60 basis points on investments. As a result, we are able to grow earnings and at the same time, improve the quality of the portfolio.","Moving to strategic capital, we continue to have a significant investor queue with steady interest across all our funds. In 2014, we raised about $2.5 billion of third-party strategic capital. What\u2019s remarkable is that each of our funds has outperformed its respective benchmark for all time segments in the past five years.","To sum it all up, we expect market conditions globally to improve from these healthy levels. Our market leading position in Q series around the world gives us the ability to deploy capital profitably and we have the financial capacity to carry out our plan. And as we\u2019ve explained before, we are well insulated from movements in foreign currency.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom.","Thomas Olinger","Thanks, Hamid. We had great results for the fourth quarter and full year. Core FFO was $0.48 per share on the quarter and $1.88 in 2014, representing an increase of 14% year-over-year. Leasing volume for the operating portfolio in the quarter was 33 million square feet.","Development leasing totaled 9 million square feet, our highest level in seven years as we continue to see strong demand for new space. Average term for leases signed in the quarter increased sequentially from 45 months to 60 months. Quarter-end occupancy was 96.1%, up 110 basis points from the third quarter. The sequential increase was driven by Europe, the Americas and spaces under 100,000 square feet.","GAAP rent change on rollover was 6.2% led by the U.S. at 11.4%. This metric may sling quarter-to-quarter based on the composition of rolling leases. In 2015, we expect rent spreads to continue to increase and exceed 2014 levels. Cash rent change on rollover was flat for the quarter.","GAAP same-store NOI on an owned and managed basis increased 4.1% in the quarter and 3.7% for the full year at the high-end of our prior 2014 guidance range. GAAP same-store NOI on a share basis in the fourth quarter was 4.9% driven by the outperformance in the Americas, which represents about 75% of our share of NOI.","Moving to capital deployment, development stabilizations totaled $1.1 billion with $236 million our share value creation or $0.46 per share. Development starts in 2014 totals $2 billion with an estimated margin of 20% indicating the book value of our land bank continues to be significantly undervalued. We acquired $1.5 billion of buildings during the year was $659 million our share at a weighted average stabilized cap rate of 6.4%. The majority of the acquisitions were through our co-investment ventures in Europe.","We invested $679 million in North American industrial fund at a 6.1% weighted average stabilized cap rate increasing our ownership to 66%; we begin consolidating this venture in our financial results this quarter. Contributions and dispositions totaled $3.2 billion driven by non-strategic asset sales in the U.S. and the formation of our U.S. logistic venture. Our share was $2.2 billion and was at a weighted average stabilized cap rate of 6.2%.","Looking at realized gains in 2014, we generated a $172 from development and $37 million VAC\u2019s. We measured the realized gains on VAC\u2019s has the difference between the sales price and the value of the building based at on an industrial use. Turing to capital markets, we continue to exploit the low interest rate environment, while maintaining significant liquidity. In the fourth quarter, we issued a \u20ac600 million euro bond and raised a total of $356 million in equity with $214 million through the exercise of warrants related to the formation of our ELP venture back in 2012, and an [indiscernible] issued through our ATM program. Our debt metrics and liquidity strengthen this quarter as leverage declined to 36.5%, debt to adjusted EBITDA fell to 6.8 times and liquidity increased to $3.4.","Another indication of the strengthening of our balance sheet is the significant amount of nominal fixed charge coverage. On a run-rate basis, we\u2019re generating over $1 billion of excess EBITDA over fixed charges annually, our excess coverage is continue to grow in 2015, given expected leverage levels and pace of EBITDA growth. So we\u2019ve discussed before we\u2019ve taken significant steps to minimize our foreign currency exposure on both NAV and earnings.","With our U.S. dollar net equity at 89%, we\u2019ve effectively insulated our balance sheet in operations from movements in foreign currency. Europe comprises about 7% of our non-U.S. dollar net equity with sterling representing the majority of this exposure. We\u2019ve minimized our Euro net equity exposure by naturally hedging with Euro denominated debt, which has the added benefit of very low borrowing costs. We currently have $3.8 billion Euro debt with an average interest rate of 2.6% and a term of over seven-years.","While we have continued to see the U.S. dollar strengthen over the past quarter, the impact on Core FFO from the decline in the Euro and the Yen in the quarter was less than $0.01. The bottom line is we virtually eliminated the risk of FX movements significantly impacting our NAV and earnings.","Let\u2019s turn to 2015 guidance. For operations, we expect our year-end occupancy to range between 95.5% and 96.5%. We expect to stabilize $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion of developments, an increase of $700 million at the mid-point over 2014. We are forecasting that the increase in NOI from development stabilizations will be the largest driver of our 2015 Core FFO growth. The higher volume and stabilizations will contribute about $0.14 a share to 2015 Core FFO. Looking forward, stabilizations will continue to be a significant driver of NOI growth, given projected starts of approximately $2.5 billion in 2015.","GAAP same store NOI on an owned and managed basis is expected to grow between 3.5% and 4.5%. As you know, it is our share of same store NOI that impacts earnings, we expect our share for same store growth in 2015 to be 5,200 basis points higher than owned and managed. As I mentioned earlier, this is driven by the higher performance and our higher ownership of the Americas relative to Europe and Asia. Our share same store NOI growth will contribute about $0.13 a share to 2015 Core FFO.","Our net G&A, we expect the full year to range between $238 million and $248 million. We forecast the whole G&A flat despite a planned increase in AUM. On the capital deployment front, we are seeking an increase - we are seeing an increasing volume of profitable development opportunities in 2015 and expect starts to range between $2.3 billion and $2.6 billion. Our well located land bank and global customer relationships are driving increase build issues activity, which we expect to account for about one-third of our starts in 2015.","On the specular [ph] development front, we are largely building in our existing [indiscernible] master parks. The average occupancy in the markets where we expect to start and stabilize back this year is about 97%. While acquisitions are always hard to forecast, we are estimating building acquisitions to range between $1 billion and $1.5 billion. We expect dispositions to increase from 2014 and range between $1.5 billion and $2 billion with activity coming from the Americas, Europe and value-add conversions in the U.S.","Contributions to our co-investment ventures will be driven by development stabilizations, and are expected to range between $1.3 billion and $1.8 billion. We expect to realize development gains of between $200 million and $250 million in 2015. Putting this all together, our share of net deployment is about $600 million.","For strategic capital, we expect revenue to range between $210 million and $220 million, which includes an expected net promote from our PELP venture in the fourth quarter of 2015 of between $0.03 and $0.04, which is in line with the net promotes we\u2019ve earned in 2014.","Now putting all of our guidance together, we expect 2015 Core FFO to range between $2.04 and $2.12 per share. This represents year-over-year growth of 11% or an increase of $0.20 at the midpoint of our guidance. The year-over-year growth is primarily driven by development stabilizations in our share of same-store NOI and reflects dilution of about $0.08 a share driven by the timing of dispositions and increased level of deployment during the year. From an FX perspective, we\u2019ve hedged the majority of our affiliated 2015 Euro and Yen net earnings effectively insulating 2015 results from any FX movements.","In closing, we are very pleased with our results for the quarter and the year. We delivered ahead of our 2014 plan and have strong momentum heading into 2015.","With that, we will open up for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brad Burke from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brad Burke","Hey, good morning guys. I wanted to ask about the sources of capital over the course of 2015. It looks like you\u2019re planning on deploying around $600 million into development and acquisitions over the course of the year, that\u2019s net of your contribution and dispositions. You raised equity during the quarter. So I was wondering whether or not we should expect you\u2019d be raising additional equity in 2015?","Thomas Olinger","Thanks, Brad, its Tom.","Brad Burke","Okay.","Thomas Olinger","When you look at our net deployment in 2015, it\u2019s about $600 million all together. If you exclude our share of acquisitions, we are actually generating about $200 million of net proceeds in 2015. So decision about how we\u2019ll fund any growth really gets down to acquisitions. And it will be a function of the opportunities that we see in the markets and the volume of activity we see and the relative returns, and that\u2019s going to drive our decision on how we capitalize and what equity we raise. We clearly have the ATM program it\u2019s a highly efficient way to issue equity. We also have $3.4 billion of liquidity that we plan on maintaining that level. Our plan assumes that level of liquidity throughout the year, our lines under on and sitting on some cash. So we feel very good about our ability to fund any growth and it\u2019s going to be a function of opportunities we see returns we can earn, and where our share price is trading.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Jamie Feldman","Great, thank you. I was hoping you could focus a little bit on fundamental demand. Just give us some color on what weakness or any weakness you\u2019re seeing from changes in oil prices and we\u2019ve seen a pull back in some of the durable goods numbers I think that earnings were relatively weak today. So just kind of any big picture thoughts on what\u2019s happening in the broader economy and the impact on demand as we roll into 2015?","Eugene Reilly","Sure, Jamie, it\u2019s Eugene. I\u2019ll take that one. So so-far we\u2019ve really haven\u2019t seen an impact and of course impact from oil prices are going to take some time to apply itself out. So at the moment if you actually look at the markets that would be affected by that particular statistic, Houston and Dallas, they are looking pretty good right now.","Now having said that, there isn\u2019t any question that a long-term $4 to $5 price of oil is going to have negative impacts on Houston, and it\u2019s probably going to have negative impacts on the state of taxes generally but we have not seen that. In fact, in Houston, fundamentals are robust. Our portfolio there is about almost 9% leased and about 10% of our customers have any exposure to - which roll in directly. So I\u2019m not particularly concerned, but having said that, when we look at future capital deployment and development thoughts in the state of Texas, we will be very selective on the sub-markets where we\u2019re active in and of course a very delicate one.","Thomas Olinger","Yes, the only thing Jamie, I would add to that is that remember we have, we\u2019re also pretty active in Europe and Japan and those are two net importers. And a drop in the price of oil actually helps those economies.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Toti from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","David Toti","Thank you, good morning guys. Tom or may be can you just comment on the rent spreads in the quarter $6.2 versus $9.7 in the third quarter. How much was that was a function of market mix or your weakness or spending specifics you\u2019ll be great.","Thomas Olinger","Yes, this is Tom and I\u2019ll let Gary or Eugene add-on. It really was a function of mix this quarter. And particularly in Europe and the amount of role we saw in Central and Eastern Europe.","Hamid Moghadam","Yes, I think that\u2019s it, that\u2019s the big story. So Europe counted for about 33% of our leasing this quarter, typically, you see it about 25% and 26%. And in disproportion amount of leasing was done in Central and Eastern Europe, which were markets that were lagging. I mean that\u2019s not a good thing we\u2019re leasing space in those tougher markets. So it\u2019s driving occupancy and NOI. And as we\u2019ve said, this number is going to be volatile quarter-to-quarter, but we feel very good about going into 2015 when you look at our annual rent change number.","So we think it\u2019s going to be up over 2014 and as Tom said in his opening remarks driving same store NOI about 3.5% to 4.5% range on an owned and managed basis and higher than that on a Prologic\u2019s share basis given our disproportionate waiting to U.S, so a net-net we feel good about it.","Thomas Olinger","Yes, the only thing I would add to this is that we are going to be positive and strong throughout the year. The first quarter will be the weakest quarter, which is because of demographics of the leases and our rent change will accelerate throughout the year. So just be prepared on that because you are going to have the same question three months from there.","David Toti","Yes, same as [ph] expectation actually with respect to Europe, Southern and Central Europe.","Thomas Olinger","Yes, for Q1, so good point, I\u2019ll leave it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Ki Bin Kim","Thanks. If I heard you correct on because you provide guidance on what you expect on realized development profit in 2015. And just a couple of questions around that, which I think is a important metric that I think we haven\u2019t [Indiscernible] that for a very long time. What was on 2014 versus 2015 and if I just do some simple math, I mean it seems like the margin is closer to 15%, if I compared to your contribution guidance in 2015. So I guess with more disclosure. I have questions around that, but maybe if you could provide some more color?","Thomas Olinger","Okay. We did discuss what our expectations are for realized development gains. So just to be clear, we talk about when we stabilize assets, we will talk about what our margins are at that time or margins are above 20% and what we are stabilizing, which is similarly high levels on starts. On for realized gains, those are gains as a function of ours contributing those developments overseas into our ventures are also third party sales. So those are realized, they go through the P&L.","The most important thing about those realized gains are that\u2019s taxable income and it drives AFFO growth as well as dividends. And we had a $172 million of realized development gains in 2014. We are forecasting realized development gains between $200 million and $250 million in 2015. That\u2019s a function of higher stabilization that are coming off the development pipeline next year or in 2015, and those getting contributed into ventures as well.","Hamid Moghadam","Yes, and then of course there is the unrealized gains that are the other half that don\u2019t even hit the P&L, which is pretty interesting you know, you are in a business that generates couple hundred million dollars of value creation and basically doesn\u2019t show up anywhere in the P&L. Until couple of years later as in effect to getting free $200 million of real estate every year of that will produce a return. So over time you get the return, but you\u2019re not getting it in anyway upfront.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vance Edelson","Great thanks. Could you provide some color on U.S. rental rates and the continued strength there, specifically the relative rent change between larger and smaller warehouses and then what are some of the driving forces are for the demand in big-box versus small?","Eugene Reilly","Yes, sure it\u2019s Gene, I\u2019ll take that. Our - we\u2019re getting to occupancy levels that are historic, yet we haven\u2019t seen before. And what we\u2019re finding is that small customers that segment of the portfolio, I think had about a 180 basis point increase quarter-over-quarter. So that\u2019s really the portion of the portfolio that we have left to lease. And frankly that\u2019s where we have more pricing powers. So you have more rent growth with the smaller customers. And as I said on previous calls, that product has much higher replacement costs and we have ways to go before we reach that, so that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to see a continuation of that.","In terms of big box and then Michael made some commentary on this, but we see sort of two types of demand going on in the United States. Big-box demand which is heavily oriented to e-commerce, we don\u2019t see that slowing down. That\u2019s going to be episodic quarter-to-quarter because they are very big transactions, so we think that will continue. And then on the small side of the spaces, you just have an awful lot of pent-up demand in that category and very little, it\u2019s in construction and most of the markets.","Hamid Moghadam","Yes, but in terms if big-box demand, particularly in the build-to-suit segment, we\u2019re seeing a definite increase on size requirements, which are reflective, I think of more confidence that the customers have in their futures space needs.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Vincent Chao","Yes, good morning everyone. I\u2019m just curious in Europe, and the comment sounded very similar to what we have been hearing over the last couple of quarters, in terms of rents being capped by lowering cap rates, but obviously doing very well in the occupancy front.","I was just curious given the economic conditions there and some of the key measures that are going on, if there\u2019s been any particular markets where you\u2019re seeing maybe an increased opportunity to deploy capital or invest that maybe a little bit different than what you have seen over the past few quarters. Just give an competitive level or your outlook for those markets.","Gary Anderson","Vincent, our thesis in Europe is to be simple. Our forecast when we prepared to 2015 plan, in no way anticipated obviously QE. So on the margin, QE in Europe, is a positive. So and that\u2019s now reflected in our guidance or anything. So if anything on the margins, there is upside in our numbers going forward. Now is to how important that will be et cetera, I can\u2019t really tell you but I tell you that cap rates in Europe have probably compressed 75 basis points anyway and maybe more in some places not UK.","UK compressed couple of years ago, and it\u2019s one of the most cap rate markets in the world. But the rest of Europe, I think has compressed 75 basis points to 100 basis points maybe depending on the market and that is definitely a headwind on rental growth. I think it will be a more emmenic [ph] rental growth as a result of that. But we\u2019ll take it in terms of increased value its okay.","Thomas Olinger","But Vincent, I guess one thing to add, in terms of the weight of capital and ECB is driving cap rates down. We\u2019ve been in front of this, if you think about it. Look back to 2013, we deployed about $600 million in third party acquisitions; this year or last year rather 2014, about $1.2 billion; and prior to that, we\u2019re investing in our funds. So I think we\u2019ve been in front of it, certainly the tougher environment on a go forward basis to acquire I would say large portfolios and [indiscernible] but we\u2019ll be selective.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks. Good morning. Hamid, I can appreciate the fact that the business is performing well. And then you guys are in a position to increase development starts. I\u2019m just wondering given some of the comments Jamie made about some of the consumer demand in drop some companies like CAT, how you guys think about manage the development risk and potentially what are the warning sign that would get you guys to potentially pull back on the development stats.","Hamid Moghadam","Steve, that\u2019s a really good question and something that we think about all the time. Our business has a lag with what\u2019s going on in the real economy. Remember when the business turned around sort of in 2011, we\u2019re all sitting around wondering when, why people we\u2019re not taking space and what the redoing was the utilization rate was going up, and utilization rate was absorbing all the net new demand. But not transplanting into more space being leased. And then finally people could no longer the utilization rate and they have to new space. Nobody wants to lease industrial space because they liked it they only do it because they have to.","So finally, U.S. absorption picked up and that ended up being a big driver of demand. So as the economy has sputters and these - the data sets that are coming out are really erratic. I mean some data is really good and surprises people and some data like the cats of surprises the negative. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see the impact of that until couple of years down the road, and unless it\u2019s a steady trend up one quarter, down one quarter, that won\u2019t affect anything, but if it\u2019s a steady decline obviously we\u2019ll show up in our numbers and demand for our product down the road. But I don\u2019t really think that that\u2019s an overall, we are going to be experiencing that anytime soon.","Now, how we manage this is pretty simple, we are buy and large most of our developments. Well, and third of them our businesses, so those are leased and we know actually 35% of them and we know kind of where that stands. And of the balance of 65% I would say the vast majority are in parts where we already have in a couple of buildings or many buildings and we are building the next incremental building. And those parks that has usually lead to the next building been built are 97% occupied today.","So on the margin, we may guess wrong on one building in one park, but it\u2019s not like the office business where you drop a million square foot building and three years later maybe you\u2019re wrong about the market. It\u2019s a very incremental kind of growth. So that\u2019s what we do. We look at how space is leasing every day, every minute by talking to our people.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citi. Your line is open.","Michael Bilerman","Yes, good morning out there. Tom, I was wondering if you can just provide a little bit more granularity in terms of the FFO increase is coming from development, I think you in your opening comments talked about $0.14 incremental in 2016 gross about $70 million of FFO. And I guess when I look at the development pieces that we have it\u2019s about $700 billion give or take of pre-stabilized developments that are obviously rolling into 2015. And then overall $700 million increase in the amount [ph] of development stabilizations in 2015 out just to 2014. And I assume the pre-state wide developments are earlier and $1 billion out of the $2 billion of developing ending in 2015 or probably later. You are going to get this continual FFO growth.","And so maybe just provide us a little bit more details of the up and down, exactly how much NOI was recognized in 2014 off of what base, how much of that is still over from last year and how much was coming at 2015 so I assume it\u2019s probably helping 2016 as well?","Thomas Olinger","Yes, Michael. Simple math would be we stabilized $1.5 billion in 2014, we\u2019ll stabilize $1.8 billion if the midpoint in 2015, just take a simple half year convention. So we\u2019re going to get a half a year pop from 2014, take the yield to 7.5%, we\u2019re going to get half a year pop from 2015 stabilizations, so half of the $1.8 million take that at 7.5% yield. That gets you roughly $70 million, that\u2019s your $0.14 a share.","The important thing like you said is, what this means going forward. The pop we got in 2015 until our stabilizations of reach are steady state of development, you\u2019re going to continue to see this incremental pop from stabilizations every year, because in 2016 we\u2019re going to be stabilizing the other half, you\u2019re going to get a full year run rate on that $1.8 billion. We\u2019re starting about $2.5 billion at the midpoint in 2014, so that ought to be stabilizing in 2016. So I would see, I think we\u2019re going to continue to see this pop until we reached the point that our stabilizations and our run rate at a steady state converge.","Hamid Moghadam","And the only other thing, Michael, I would add to that is that if you train a normalize kind of our earnings for the development ramp and all that, there is one other thing you normalize for and that is dispositions over acquisitions. Our dispositions tend to be more front-end loaded. Our acquisitions, and development completions and stabilizations tend to be back end completion. And that training mismatch erodes or dilutes us by about $0.08.","So the $0.14 delivered will be offset by $0.08 of the bad in a steady state kind of environment. So net, net, net it\u2019s not as big as you would think. And in a normalized year, obviously acquisitions and dispositions would be equal and would be roughly the same timing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum from UBS. Your line is open.","Ross Nussbaum","Hi good morning guys. I wanted to follow-up a little on Steve\u2019s question, if market trends in the U.S. continue in the manner that they\u2019ve been going which is that absorption has been outpacing construction so our industry occupancy rates are moving higher, it would lead me to believe that one of two things are about to have an either, you\u2019re going to see accelerate market rank growth, or you\u2019re going to have to see more supply coming. So I guess the question is which one is it MBD [ph] and why?","Gene Reilly","Ross, its Gene. I think both are going to happen, as you\u2019re going to have one in certain markets, and the other in markets where you can have more supply. But overall at these levels we have nine markets above 98% of occupancy and 19 markets above 96%, that\u2019s in our portfolio. And the underlying markets that we\u2019re doing business in there are getting to occupancy levels they haven\u2019t seen before. So my guess, and by the way at the same time the constraints on supplying new space, continue to get more difficult. So the entitlement process isn\u2019t easier building our kind of product, building industrial product is particularly challenging.","So I think you\u2019re going to see more rent growth than immediate reaction in terms of new supply. As we\u2019ve forecasted we think supply will pick up in the U.S. next year. And we\u2019re going to get closer to equilibrium, but the other thing I\u2019d point out is that as a percentage of stock, these new completions are still very, very low. And frankly as a percentage of stock, the net absorption is also low by historical standards. So there is probably some upside there as well.","Gary Anderson","But let me tie this just something that we talked about in I think our Analyst Day may be two to three years ago, when we laid out the thesis for very substantial rental growth, which in those days was actually quite a position to take and it actually has played out pretty much that way, may be a little bit better than the U.S. and a little less in Europe, but fundamentally the same way. We laid out three steps in this rental increase scenario. Step one, is just a simple rollover of lease time at the trough to market rents. Just spread to market of the existing leases.","Number two, the catch up of market rents are that point in time to replacement cost rents, which is kind of the phase we\u2019re in now.","The third step is that as construction volumes increase, price of construction is going to go up and we\u2019re seeing this in many markets at substantially higher than inflation, because margin will come back into the subs and into the general contractors, and construction costs were going up. And also land costs are going to be new cycle land cost with new entitlements, bursement [ph] and all of that. All of that stuff is coming in at significantly higher than inflation. So replacement cost is not a static number, it\u2019s a number that is going up pretty fast right now. Now at some point it will normalize, but I think that we are in the middle to late stages of Phase II, but Phase III hasn\u2019t even started. And there are some markets that are further behind, some markets that are more closer in. Inland Empire, I would say your rents are right about the place where you can develop profitably and interestingly, because of rent, it\u2019s because cap rates, but same difference. So replacement cost as a moving target and expected to move a lot in the next couple of years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee from Stifel. Your line is open.","John Guinee","We\u2019re ready. Well, okay. Couple of one long question. Tom looks to us like your weighted average cost of interest went down from 4.2 to 3.6 as a result of all the tenders you did. What\u2019s to us the back of the envelope is that\u2019s worth about $0.10 a share in FFO growth for 2015 over 2014, is that the right math. And then second is what you are thinking about your dividend policy. And then for Hamid, PLD stock in oil is about 47 bucks a share will be higher in two years.","Thomas Olinger","By the way, John, before we answer any of those questions, I just wanted to give credit to keys for doing the best pronunciation of your name ever. So let\u2019s start with that.","John Guinee","Yeah.","Hamid Moghadam","So on the impact of the various debt tenders that we\u2019ve done, I\u2019d say over the last two years. The impact over on all of that has been about concerns like you said, however, we saw about $0.03 of that come through in our 2013 earnings or another $0.03 in 2014 and it will get about $0.03 to $0.04 to that in 2015. So the 2015 impact is really $0.03 to $0.04.","Now, if you isolate only the impact of the tenders and your analysis you\u2019ll get a higher number, but you can\u2019t do that because you need to look at what we did to our overall capital stock. We used to run our lines at over $1 billion drawn at a very low interest rate. We are carrying zero outstanding balance at our line. So it is $0.10 is not the right number, it\u2019s really $0.03 to $0.04 for next year.","Gary Anderson","And actually we\u2019ve cashed on the balance sheet which fund the other way in terms of what it contributes. In terms of the - our stock price versus oil, I have no idea other than the fact that in the very long-term both of them are going to be up a lot. And with respect to dividends, which was the other part of your question, by the way pretty good job of asking three questions.","But on the dividends, basically our AFFO is growing pretty rapidly and though our dividends is going to grow somewhere in line or lower than AFFO and higher than inflation it\u2019s going to be in that range. So Tom, you wanted to add.","Thomas Olinger","Yes, I will just add. Our AFFO growth in 2014 was about 22%. And looking at 2015, we see AFFO growth in line with Core FFO growth surround 11%. And we look at and we have to look at our AFFO with realized gains because that impacts our TI. And when we look at payout ratios, this year our AFFO payout would be about 74% and in 2015, I think, it\u2019s going be probably even a little less than that payout ratio. So we\u2019ll be in the low, somewhere in the low 70s, payout ratio in 2015.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Craig Mailman","Hi, just curious, the average maturity overall lease in this quarter, hope the 15 months relative to previous, I mean, even this comment was it something in particular this quarter, or are you seeing tenants trying to take a longer-term perspective on their space needs? And be aggressiveof the fact one for eachchannel that you guys have a pretty good queue of private capital, wanted to be deployed. May be just comment on what geographies that capital is looking for or may be any changes there, and that\u2019s the hurdles. Where there return hurdles? Gary you have something.","Hamid Moghadam","Craig, I\u2019ll take your first question. It\u2019s Eugene. We have now for the last few quarter, we have been aggressively pushing term, with this part of cycle, we are pushing rents and looking for longer-term. Most of you will recall during the downturn we scaled back dramatically and do not want to lock in low rents, so that strategy has been shifting. We have a very, very large sort of quarter-to-quarter change 15 months don\u2019t think of that as a trend. So there is a little that aberration there, but looking at say the trailing four quarters, we\u2019re up about 10% for five months and you\u2019re going to see that continue. So we\u2019re going to continue putting term at least in the U.S. and in Europe it\u2019s probably a different story. Garry has something.","Gary Anderson","Craig, I\u2019ll just say that what\u2019s driving it up, obviously the Americas in the U.K we\u2019re about 75 months, that\u2019s typically a longer-term lease market and you\u2019ve got the market that\u2019s in our favor. Obviously this particular quarter we had development leasing at $9 million square feet, which is driving in the quarter-to-quarter up, because the development leasing with high percentage of builder suites are generally longer-term. But that\u2019s offset by what we\u2019re doing in Continental Europe, we\u2019re trying to stay short in Continental Europe, so our average lease term is about 36 months there, plus or minus, because we want to take advantage of the rental growth when it does come through.","Hamid Moghadam","In terms of interest and private capital I would say, it\u2019s across the board. And at pretty high levels, I would say comparable to the mid-2000s, because there\u2019s a lot of pent-up demand, these peoples set the market out for long time and not that there\u2019s more liquidity in the markets there investors are back in. If I were going to pick one region, I would say Europe is getting the most interest on the margin. As people view Europe as a place that has some cap rate compression still left. And you know in Europe the appraisals are way behind reality. And most people understand that. So they\u2019re trying to get their money invested based on old price as opposed to new prices that are being paid on the margin. But people really do believe this cap rate compression story and the value being less in the European markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Maiorana from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Brendan Maiorana","Thanks, good morning. Tom heard your response to my [indiscernible] question about the development. Stabilization - has an impact in terms of FFO for 2015. If I look at 2014 stabilization, it was only $1.1 billion, which was down from 2013 even though starts, increased, have increased each year from 2011. What cost the stabilizations to be low in 2014 relative to kind of where it starts been in the past couple of years and do you see that risk or swing factor in FFO numbers could be as we look at 2015?","Thomas Olinger","Yes, 2013 versus 2014 was a mix issue because a fair bit of the starts that we had in 2013 where in Japan. And the Japan construction cycle is probably more like 18 months to construct and that leads up. So that was the way that kind of over 2013 and the 2014. But going forward, Japan has been - we\u2019ve had a very steady level of development starts 2013, 2014, 2015 in Japan. So I don\u2019t see that swinging at all, and I\u2019d see stabilizations should get closer and closer to our - forgetting average out like we said long-terms start somewhere in the $2.5 billion range. It\u2019s probably going to take us in 2017 until we get that an equal run rate. But for simple map, I would use sort of a two year lag between starts and stabilizations, that\u2019s a good real fund.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Catherwood from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Tom Catherwood","Just thinking about foreign currency here a bit, was wondering what the same store NOI would have been in the fourth quarter and for 2014, inclusive of the negative currency movement and when we think about that [ph] being 89% U.S. dollar net equity. What kind of exposure FFO was you think you have in 2015 as far as base swings in the year or at the end?","Thomas Olinger","Yes, I\u2019ll answer your second question first. As far as from a P&L perspective we have virtually zero impacts from any FX movements. We have hedged our estimated euro and yen net earnings for 2015 we hedged the euro at about a 1.20, 1.2 and the Yen at 1.20. So we are really locked in for earnings for 2015. So we\u2019re fully insulated.","On an NAV perspective, at 5% move of all of our foreign currencies against us is about $0.25 a share impact on NAV. The other item, yes well the other question was on same-store, we do report same-store on a constant currency basis, so you can see the real impact of what\u2019s happening on the operation side. However, if we look at our same-store impacted by FX, our share would really go up, because we are disproportionably owned in the U.S., so about 75% of our NOI is in dollars. And that relative percentage the U.S. actually becomes a higher percentage, if you FX adjusted because the dollar has strengthened against other currency. So dollar goes up in that scenario, Euro and Yen impact goes down. So when you look at our share, it would actually be more positive on an FX adjusted basis.","The other thing since you brought up FX I do want to touch on as we\u2019ve got the question or two around, in our reconciliation of FFO to our net income down to our Core FFO about whether we are backing out the impact of unrealized FX losses. When you look at our operations virtually all of our FX activity around the world goes through our P&L is realized and goes through our FFO. The only thing that would go through unrealized FFO from a - I\u2019m sorry, go through unrealized FX or anything around the derivative. We take those when they are realized. When you look at our P&L that line that says derivative losses in FX adjustments, there\u2019s two things going on to that line, it\u2019s a negative $20 million number that\u2019s getting added back, so a positive $20 million number. That\u2019s made up of a $36 million loss related to the mark-to-market on derivative, our derivative convertible debt security.","So that convertible debt matures here in March, we think it\u2019s going to convert into equity is the strike price is $38.72. From a GAAP perspective, we have to mark to fair value of that derivative debt against our share price. So our share price went up in the quarter, we had to recognize a loss related though. That we add back that was $36 million. We actually had about $20 million of FX unrealized gains in the quarter and that all related to our hedges that we have about in place, we have about $1 billion of hedges and those hedges, they are worth about $160 million, none of that $160 million have gains that we\u2019ve realized over the last year since we have those hedges in place went through our P&L, zero. So that should go through our NAV but none of that\u2019s going through our P&L. So everything, the vast majority of all the FX that happens around the world hits our P&L, hits our Core FFO.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Michael Salinsky","Good afternoon guys. You talked about your share of the same-store NOI, can you talk a little bit, may be on your renewal basis kind of what your expectations may be the U.S. and Europe specifically. And then as you look forward to 2015, just given the compression we\u2019ve seen in cap rate, as well as the growth that you realized around the primary markets, domestically in the U.S., where do you see the best growth opportunities domestically?","Hamid Moghadam","Okay, I\u2019ll take the first question, just some color on where we would see same-store growth. I\u2019ll talk about it on an owned and managed basis. We would see the U.S. in the mid-five, somewhere next year. Europe and Asia, in the call 1% to 2% range. Now blending that all together when you look at our proportion and ownership that\u2019s how you get something in the mid to high fours for our share of same-store growth next year.","Eugene Reilly","And the growth opportunities, if the question is related to where can we sort of push rents, more aggressively I draw your attention to the desktop manual look away with very, very high occupancies. But I want to call two markets that have really been laggards one is Chicago and the other Atlanta. Both of those markets sort of began to turn the corner in 2014. Huge amounts of absorption, and we\u2019re actually seeing very, very strong rent growths in those markets. And for us that\u2019s $50 million square feet of product and in terms of incremental growth in income, I would probably point to those two markets in terms of potential for the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel from Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.","Eric Frankel","Thank you. Hamid or Tom, who has the lower cost of capital. You or the investor in your strategic capital queue.","Thomas Olinger","I think our investors in our strategic capital queue have the lower cost of capital for core product. I think we have a lower cost of capital for development activity.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick from Capital One Securities. Your line is open.","Tom Lesnick","Thanks, I\u2019ve got a clarification question on the North American Industrial Fund consolidation this quarter. Ownership obviously increased from 42% in 2Q to 63% of 3Q, but it didn\u2019t consolidate, what was the controlled threshold or test a qualified for a consolidation of 4Q that now that ownership is 66%?","Thomas Olinger","This is Tom. It relates to the rights that the limited partners had in that fund and in Q4 we got down to just one remaining investor, so it\u2019s ourselves and one investor, and as a result of that the limited partners rights control right went away. That was a triggering event getting down to one investor.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers from Baird. Your line is open.","Dave Rodgers","Yes, thanks. Either for Tom or for Mike, you talked lot about development in terms of the third of the starts being build-to-suit. Could you talk geographically where you expect those starts to be? That earlier I missed it. And now along those same lines, can you talk about whether you\u2019re seeing any differential in margin or development yield that would be different, obviously geographically it varies? But any difference that you\u2019re seeing start to emerge given kind of the economic environment out there? And then the second question just to Tom, on the promotes I think you did expect some promotes whether there is some potential this year, but I assume aren\u2019t in guidance can you confirm that?","Tom Olinger","Yes, I\u2019ll take the promote question first. In my prepared remarks, I did talk about our guidance does include $0.03 to $0.04 of net promote in 2015, in the fourth quarter of 2015 we have a promote opportunity with our PELP venture or Norges venture in Europe. And again that\u2019s $0.03 to $0.04 that\u2019s in our guidance in Q4 of 2015 and it\u2019s consistent with the level of promote we\u2019ve recognized up in 2013 and 2014 earnings.","Michael Curless","And in terms of, this is Mike, in terms of the complex the makeup of the development volume, I think geographically, as Tom mentioned in his remarks, over 95% of the activity is going to take place in our global market where the fundamentals there are really strong call it 97% occupancy in those markets. From a margin perspective, we take the over in terms of our average relative to global markets relative to some of the regional markets we\u2019re doing business in, but it\u2019s not a big appreciable difference and we still think regional markets are very meaningful part of our business. And at the end of the day, build-to-suits ought to about 35% of the total volume and I would point out that 35% of the larger amount of volume this year would be about 25% increase in the build-to-suit volume from last year. We\u2019re very bullish about how that pipeline looks given the amount of LOI\u2019s and signed leases we have in terms of carry over volume already this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Mike Mueller","Hi, I just wondering Norges, the assets on balance sheet that you can contribute here in Norges JV this year, what are you thinking about that growth 2015?","Thomas Olinger","We don\u2019t have a contribution arrangement with Norges on any under assets, with the JV on the series of assets. Actually it\u2019s two JVs, one in the U.S., one in Europe.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citi. Your line is open.","Michael Bilerman","Yes, just for follow-ups, just in terms of the equity rates in the quarter, when, just in terms of timing, when were you sort of notified that Norges is going to exercise the warrants? And then also when did you make the decision to tap the ATM and at what price, did you do that? And I get the fact that the convert, this coming will give you more equity in March, but I guess where it starting today relative to your NAV, do you have a desire to tap the ATM further, given where it may have occurred in the fourth quarter?","Eugene Reilly","So from a timing perspective, the Norges warrant was exercised in December. And we tapped the ATM program in December. Going back to our plans for 2015, again, it really gets back to acquisition opportunity. So if you strip out acquisitions, our share out of 2015 guidance net, net our deployment generates cash of I think roughly $200 million. So our decision to raise equity will line up with the opportunities we see in the returns that we see with those acquisitions. So that\u2019s how we are looking at it.","If we see great opportunities to acquire portfolios, we\u2019ll think about the smartest way to capitalize that. And I think we\u2019ve got a lot of different way to do that, when you think about our liquidity, our ability to tap the equity markets and the substantial equity queue that\u2019s built up in all of our private capital, our strategic capital vehicles. So we got lots of different ways we can fund deployment in acquisition to particular, if we\u2019d like the economics out there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee from Stifel. Your line is open.","John Guinee","Just Scott I\u2019m sorry. One of a question is that to imply Tom that you\u2019re help promote this 4Q 2015 that also imply that Norges those from 50% to 80% in that same quarter or those apples and oranges?","Thomas Olinger","Yes, those are apples and oranges. We have the ability and this is true and, I think, almost all of our funds where we can earn, we have the opportunity to promote every three years. Fourth quarter of 2015 is the third anniversary of the formation of the PELP venture. Therefore that is the first time, first quarter in which we can earn a promote. Likewise, if you look to 2016 and you can see this in our disclosure or supplemental as we\u2019ve got two other funds, I think, it\u2019s our PELP II fund and [indiscernible] Europe, both are up for promote opportunities in 2016.","So we\u2019re going to see a steady stream of promote opportunities over the next several years given as Hamid mentioned our funds are performing about their bench marks. So I would expect if that holds we\u2019re going to see promotes not just in 2015, but continue one.","Now the other thing you\u2019re referencing is that the PELP sell down right that we have, but we can sell down our ownership interest down to a 20% interest. That is totally independent of any promote of that\u2019s a separate decision and that\u2019s going to be a function of how we want to deploy our capital globally, that\u2019s going to trigger and what opportunities we have, if and when we trigger that sell down right.","Eugene Reilly","It\u2019s also a as long as we think that decision in 10 point increments, it\u2019s not like all or none it\u2019s an 10 point increment and it doesn\u2019t all have to be - that decision doesn\u2019t have to be made in 2015. We have that window coming up every year, so we can sell as much or as little as we want whenever we want pretty much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel from Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.","Eric Frankel","Thank you. I want to talk about U.S. property values a little bit. Could you talk about the composition of the property sold during the quarter, I think, the weighted average stabilized cap rate at the lowest I\u2019ve seen in awhile. I know that you guys have some unique properties you sold the south part of the Bay Area that where probably is going to be likely converted a couple of years. So I\u2019d like to understand as to where property value thinks our cap rate might have moved?","Eugene Reilly","I would say this we have a one property that would fall under the description of unusual in terms of unusual good, in terms of Bay Area with an upside potential. But the vast majority of our sales actually in the last couple of years have been non-strategic properties in smaller markets from the bottom of our portfolio. So with the exception of that one deal in Silicon Valley, the rest of it would be non-strategic sales. So on average it would be lower than median of our properties, probably a lot lower than the median of our properties.","Eric, bottom line is the price stock on industrial cap rates in the U.S. are in the low fours on the very best markets. And in the low fives for most markets, I\u2019m talking about brand new great product in the markets everybody wants to be in with a good credit tenant.","And I would say low fives in most markets and sixes, six pluses and six, six and halves in some of the less strategic markets. I\u2019m not sure, we deploy capital at those kinds of numbers in fact we won\u2019t, but that\u2019s where the market is.","Operator","Your last question comes from that line of Jamie Feldman from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Jamie Feldman","Thanks, Hamid. I guess can you walk through where you think cap rates are for Europe along the same lines what you just did for the U.S.?","Hamid Moghadam","Sure. London and the Southeast would be four, Midland\u2019s would be low fives, Southern Europe would be six and half to seven, with an aero down by the way on that one, Germany would be in the low fives, same with the rest of Northern Europe. What am I leaving out?","Gary Anderson","Eastern Europe.","Hamid Moghadam","Definitely in Eastern Europe would be six and half.","Operator","There are no further\u2026","Hamid Moghadam","And I\u2019m sorry, just a complete the global, since we talked about everywhere else. I think Japan is low fives hitting high fours and within the J-REIT structure it\u2019s actually trading in high threes.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the presenters.","Hamid Moghadam","Right, thank you everyone for being here, I know how you are battling to storm back ease all the best to you in dealing with that.

My name is Scott, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Prologis' Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Tracy Ward, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Tracy Ward","Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our Fourth Quarter 2016 Conference Call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations.","This morning, we'll hear from Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover results and guidance and Hamid Moghadam, our Chairman and CEO, who will comment on the company's strategy and outlook. Also joining us for today's call are Gary Anderson, Mike Curless, Ed Nekritz, Gene Reilly, and Diana Scott.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to state that this call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, and projections about the market, and the industry in which Prologis operates as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings.","Additionally, our fourth quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures and in accordance to the Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom, and we'll get started.","Thomas Olinger","Thanks, Tracy. Good morning and thanks for joining our fourth quarter earnings call. Our format today will be different than previous calls. I will cover highlight for the quarter and guidance for 2017 and then I'll turn the call over to Hamid who will put this quarter's performance in the context of the recent past and our future outlook.","We had an excellent quarter in an outstanding 2016. Core FFO was $0.63 per share for the quarter and $2.57 per share for the year. This is an increase of 15% over 2015 and consistent with our three-year CAGR of 16%. We earned promotes of $0.01 and $0.15 per share for the year. Excluding promotes Core FFO was up 11%.","For the full year we leased over 180 million square feet as demand for our best-in-class portfolio remains strong. Our properties are located in major population centers where consumption is concentrated and proximity to consumers has never been more critical to supply chain.","Global occupancy reached an all-time high of 97.1% Europe also achieved record occupancy at 96.7%. Our share net effective rent change on rollover was 16%. The U.S. led the way it over 23% the fourth consecutive quarter above the 20%. Notably the U.K. was also above 20% rent change for the second consecutive quarter.","Our share net effective same store NOI growth was 3.2% for the quarter and 5.6% for the full year. On the deployment front we had another very productive year creating significant value for shareholders. Development stabilization had an estimated margin of 27% and value creation of over $570 million. Development starts had an estimated margin of over 20% and our net deployment activity generated surplus cash of $1.4 billion.","Let's spend a moment on our financial position. We achieved our goal of having one of the top balance sheets in the REIT sector. The rating upgrades of A3 and A- in the quarter are acknowledgment of our prudent financial management and balance sheet strength. Our look through leverage at year-end was 27.1% on market capitalization and 34.6% on a book basis. Debt to EBITDA including gains was 4.7 times and our liquidity was over $4 billion. We remain well positioned to self fund our future employment.","We also continue to be well protected from foreign currency movements as we ended the year with 92% of our net equity in U.S. dollars. The bottom line is our balance sheet and liquidity have never been stronger.","Moving to 2017 I\u2019ll cover a few guidance highlights on our share basis so for complete detail refer to Page 5 of our supplemental. We continue to expect net effective same store NOI growth of between 4% and 5%. As discussed at our Investor Day are in-place leases are about 12% under rented and this will be the primary driver of same-store growth going forward. Our share cash same-store NOI should be higher than net affected by 5200 basis points for the year.","Our development starts are consistent with 2016 levels. However our disposition volume is as much lower as we sold the vast majority of our nonstrategic assets. Going forward you will see a contribution and disposition activity in line with development levels, as we continue to self fund.","I want to point out that as a result of the significant amount of cash at year-end, there will be a slight drag on Core FFO of $0.02 to $0.03 per share on the first quarter given the timing of putting the capital back to work.","Related to FX, our 2017 estimated core FFO was effectively fully hedged relative to the U.S. dollar and we've already hedged most of 2018. For net G&A we're forecasting a range of $210 million to $220 million down 3% at the midpoint from last year as we continue to become more efficient. For strategic capital I want to highlight that there will be a timing mismatch throughout the year between one that promote revenue is recognized in the second quarter and when all the related promote expenses are reflected. However we continue to expect net promote income for the full year 2017 of between $0.06 and $0.08 a share.","Putting this all together 2017 Core FFO including promotes will range between $2.60 and $2.70 per share. Excluding promotes our Core FFO at the midpoint is 7% higher year-over-year. In closing we had an excellent year we entered 2017 with terrific momentum and the business keeps getting simpler as evidenced by the brevity of my remarks as you've heard guidance is unchanged from what we provided at our November Investor Day. However I would say the overall outlook for a business today is more positive particularly in Europe. While we are mindful of potential political and regulatory changes we remain confident given our best-in-class portfolio, balance sheet strength and liquidity and durable NOI growth.","And with that I'll turn it over Hamid.","Hamid Moghadam ","Thanks Tom.","I want to use my time with you today to put our recent performance and to the longer-term context and to share my outlook for the next few years. It's hard to imagine that it's been almost six years since we announced the merger between Prologis and AMB. Our initial focus following the merger's closing was to integrate the two companies and to deliver on our promise synergies. Shortly thereafter we announced the quarter plan focused on realigning our portfolio, monetizing our land bank, rationalizing our strategic capital business, strengthening our balance sheet, and investing in technology to make our teams more productive. We met or exceeded the planned objectives almost a year ahead of schedule.","Following the 10-quarter plan we transition division 2016. Our strategic plan to capitalize on what we saw is a significant recovery in rental rates following the sharp decline we saw during the global financial crisis. Our forecast call for a compounded 6% per year recovery in rents and the Americas to 2016 which at the time seemed that's an overly optimistic assumption by some.","The fourth quarter represented the culmination of Vision 2016. Actual rental growth in our markets in the Americas ended up ahead of our forecast at 8% per year. This help drive core FFO growth of 16% per year substantially in excess of the plan the sector most REITs.","2017 is a very different environment than six years ago when we announced our merger or four years ago when we called for sharp rebound in rents. I believe we're now at the cusp of yet another important market transition to a phase for which Prologis is ideally positioned. As you heard from Tom earlier and as you'll hear from our industry colleagues, markets are as healthy as they been in several decades. Occupancies are at record levels, rental growth is extremely strong and the strength is not just e-commerce. In fact there are sectors like housing that will be the source for additional demand going forward.","In the recent recovery phase of the U.S. market, rising tides have lifted our boats. In the next phase, location and quality will matter much more and I'll be a meaningful performance depreciation within the U.S. logistic markets. Continental Europe is lagging the U.S. by about three years. We believe Europe will further extend the growth cycle for our company as its recovery picks up steam. What's been a headwind for us I will become a tailwind for the foreseeable future.","There is a significant embedded rental upside in most industrial portfolios and in our case about 12% of our overall and 15% in the Americas but we need to acknowledge that the easy part of the cycle is behind us. Market rental growth going forward will moderate starting in 2017. However our same-store NOI growth will remain strong into the foreseeable future probably well beyond 2019 especially in large markets with high barriers to entry. What we like about this picture is that supply remains discipline and as a result growth will be more sustainable than in past cycles.","In this environment it will be more important than ever to be closer to key customers and to offer them the right wheels stay solutions in key markets around the world.","Before I turn it over to Q&A, I'd like to share with you our priorities for the next few years including a number of important new initiatives that we've been working on as part of our new strategic plan. In addition to completing the final batch of our nonstrategic sales which remains a priority, the new initiatives are focused around customer experience, application of technology to streamline operations, and advanced data analytics. These activities are designed to further simplify our business, get us closer to our customers and help make us faster, smarter and better. We're seeing tangible results from these initiatives already especially on the customer side and will share these with you in the coming months and years.","Let's now turn to your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Tom Catherwood from BTIG. Your line is open.","Tom Catherwood","Thanks. Good morning over there. Obviously we've seen a lot of statements that have come out of the new Administration. You guys spoke at length about it and the potential impact at the Investor Day. But since the Investor Day how has the outlook changed for your business and how are you planning on potential trade impacts in your strategy going forward?","Hamid Moghadam","Yes, let me start with that and maybe I'll turn it over to Chris Caton, our Global Head of Research after this for his comments because he's been setting this pretty closely. So I would say there is a great deal of uncertainty out there given all the talk about trade with China and Mexico specifically. So I think until there is some resolution on this, they will continue to be uncertainty but we haven't seen that translating into any negative impact on our business so far.","In fact I would say most of the Euphoria around the election has to do with a brighter economic outlook in the U.S. and a brighter outlook on the part of our customers on the margin. Now let's take some extreme cases of what could happen. In the extreme case and I don't think by the way this is the base case, we pull a wall not just in our southern border but all around this country and will stop trading with the rest of the world.","While I think the long term impact of that actually would be negative not just for our business but every business because the rate of economic growth would slow but specific to the industrial business for sure manufacturing will have to take place somewhere which means it will have to take place in the U.S. So demand will go up in the U.S. for sure.","Now they're going to be places in the world where demand will suffer and I think Northern Mexico along the border and China would be the two places where demand would suffer. Those two markets account for 2% of our overall activity. The U.S. accounts for 73% of our activity.","So while I acknowledge that there will be a headwind on overall economic growth, actually its impact on us could be very positive in the short term but that's not what I want, that\u2019s not what I expect and that's how I'm looking for. I think the more likely outcome is going to be a cleaning up some of the provisions of NAFTA there are some issues that need to be modernized, I think it makes sense to do that and I frankly think that this stage has been set from a negotiating point of view or that can be done pretty quickly and pretty easily compared to expectations.","China is a little bit of a different story. I think in China I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re heading for something a little more serious but only time will tell how that's going play out. Chris what you want to add?","Chris Caton ","I think that's a pretty complete answer.","Hamid Moghadam","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Ki Bin Kim","Thanks. Hamid, can you just comment on what you see in supply trends going forward? I know it hasn't been a huge issue in the past couple years, but at least according to some brokers it seems to be increasing and across more markets.","Hamid Moghadam","Our outlook for supplying this year was that supply and demand this year meaning this past year 2016 was that they were going to be at the same level in the low 200 million square-foot range in the U.S. and about 70 million feet in Europe. And actually we were surprised because demand ended up being more like 260 million feet and supply ended up being 180 million feet.","So we continue to deficit in supply that has persisted since the recovery. So again this year in 2017 we're calling for low $200 million square feet of supply and demand. We're expecting those two to be about the same which is by the way great because at 56% overall vacancy and at defective vacancy in the kind of product that we traffic in being in the 34% range in most markets, I think that\u2019s in very, very healthy situation. So we're calling for supply and demand to equalize, let\u2019s say we're off let's say supply ends up being 20 million, 30 million feet more across the base that won't even register on the vacancy rate.","So I think people are just overly focused on that issue. Fundamentally I think financial the banking system for encouraging undisciplined development has changed. Now something changes in the political and regulatory environment where the banks will go nuts again that's the new ballgame but I don't see that just yet and I don't think those regulations are just U.S. regulations, I think they are Basel III and the like that impose some discipline in the banking system.","So it's good to keep an eye on supply I think it's been they clearly feel of the real estate business for as long as I remember. So please continue to ask about it, continue to be concerned about it but I don't think it's going to drive the performance of our business in the next couple of years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brad Burke with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brad Burke ","Hi, everyone. I wanted to go back to market fundamentals for the quarter. Leasing volume is down a little, tenant retention is below 80%, it looks like leasing costs ticked up as a result. Realizing that market fundamentals remain very healthy, is there any reason to think that demand decelerated in the fourth quarter versus what we saw earlier in 2016?","Hamid Moghadam","Demand did not decelerate, we ran at its space to lease. And the reason retention is down as I have told you every quarter we're trying to drive around. So we would like our retention to be a little bit lower and for our rent growth on the margin benefit from that incremental rent growth. So nothing in the quarter surprise me Tom, do you have anything else.","Thomas Olinger","No its consistent again as Hamid said we had little role this quarter it's pretty seasonal that we go into Q4 with pretty minimal role and that was the big driver but we certainly don't see any change in the customer behavior, customer activity, customer decision-making all of that quite frankly is tracking better than what we but we would laid out to you guys in November.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Craig Mailman","Thanks, guys. I was hoping to just get a little bit of color on the second sequential decline same-store revenues you guys had. I think last quarter there were some CAM trueups that drove the sequential decline. But we expect that to maybe be more one-time, but we saw a decline again this quarter. Just curious what drove the deceleration this quarter and maybe how it looks on a cash basis to see if we're seeing the same trend.","Thomas Olinger","Hi Craig this is Tom, so you\u2019re right - in this quarter the sequential decline was driven number one just lower occupancy in the same store pool if you look to Q3 to Q4 so there's about a 50 basis points lower benefit of occupancy and the second thing would be as you alluded to recovery revenue timing.","So there all one-time timing issues that we look into 2017 we see occupancy the levels very consistent year-over-year so the big driver same-store is all about rent change and to put those numbers in context of our guidance of that 4% to 5% range we feel very, very good about that guidance range and if you think about very similar rent change on roll year-over-year about 17.5% and you put that on 22.5% roll you what to contractual role plus is some pulling leases forward very consistent with what we\u2019ve done in the prior-year that gets you right about 4% and when you look at expense leverage and you look at indexation remember we get the benefit of indexation particularly in places like Europe. That all adds up to another 50 basis points. So that puts you right in the middle of our guidance range for 2017.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Vincent Chao ","Hi, everyone. I just wanted to talk about the lease rate being at 97% and record occupancy in the U.S. and Europe, and then also your comments about the retention going down, driving rents a little bit harder. I'm just curious if the current availability changes your view on development starts, the mix of build to suit versus spec. And, geographically, it sounds like a lot of the commentary on Europe was very positive versus your previous outlook. Are you more inclined to build in Europe today than a few months ago?","Hamid Moghadam","Vincent, Europe is more of a build-to-suit market than the spec market anyway, so, yes, a lot of the development in Europe is going to be build-to-suit. And maybe Mike you want to talk about the flavor of our development activity and it's very much consistent with last year as the way I think about it but Mike\u2026","Mike Curless","Look, last year we did 45% in Americas, 25% in Europe and 13% Asia that was a little bit up in the Americas, slightly down in Europe and slightly up in Asia. I expect in this year's ratio to be about the same and a couple of other things to note 90% of the activities are going to take place in our global markets. And I would point I think yesterday I take the build-to-suit range in the 40% to 50% range, which is comparable to we did last year and I think we feel very bullish on our ability to do this build-to-suits, but that's a good range as we sit here today.","Thomas Olinger","Yes, the only thing I would add to all of that is that when we look at our development volume for 2017 at this time of the year, you guys should know about 90% of that is baked in. So really at the end of the day what our development volume does on the margin in the back $100 million, $200 million of it if weather stuff flips into December or January of next year and we don\u2019t do on natural things to meet guidance in that regard, let just be clear about that.","For example couple I think three of our 2016 built-to-suit we\u2019ve just done in the first couple of weeks of 2017. And if we have done them in 2016 we were blown through the top of our guidance range. So we don\u2019t really play those kinds of timing games and we let those things happen when they do. I mean we're going to spend the bunch of money dig into through the snow to start a building to call it a start if it doesn\u2019t make sense to do that.","Hamid Moghadam","We've got a great head start on our business already for this quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sumit Sharma with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Sumit Sharma","Hi. Good morning. Couple of questions on the international markets, saw the yields on the Americas, Canada, Mexico, Brazil development sort of side down about 40 bips q-o-q based on your last disclosure? I guess how much of this is a factor of higher pre-leased activity or the use actually kind of shrinking with other trade shock.","And the second question are on the Cyrela stake. We're reading a lot of reports from brokers as well as actually you guys talking about net absorption dropping 60% year-over-year in Brazil in the logistic sector, so interested in what we should read into this move around acquiring the additional stake, are you calling for a bottom to that market?","Eugene Reilly","Sumit, this is Eugene. So relative to the first question it's really - this is all mix and it's a lot less Brazil. I mean at this point in a cycle we are not building buildings in Brazil, obviously those yields are much higher. So don't get distracted with that.","With respect to what's going on with Brazil in the CCP situation. So demand right now in Brazil is pretty soft and we expected to that in 2017 is going to remain that way based upon the economic and political environment.","Having said that we're very, very optimistic long-term, we're calling a bottom I wouldn't say we're calling a bottom, but we see things getting better from this point forward. And related to the CCP announcement Brazilian law requires that public companies disclose even agreements that are not binding. When there is a definitive agreement will have for all you guys the relevant information. But that's the first step towards recapitalizing the business in Brazil. We're very excited about that and as I said we're very excited about the future that market going forward.","Hamid Moghadam","I would add to Gene's comments that I think the combination of the currency which is well up to bottom the governance change that happened in Brazil. And the interest rate picture which is one of the few place in the world where interest rates are coming down. I think things will bode well for Brazil and I am bullish on Brazil going forward, it's not going to zoom and sort of add from here, but I think this is a pretty interesting entry point from both fundamental real estate valuation, and also currency valuation point of view.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi. Your line is open.","Manny Korchman","Hi, guys. Good morning. I was just wondering - Hamid if you can talk a little bit about just leasing momentum and pace and whether the volatility post election on any of these trade policies have caused either pause or revisit their leasing strategy?","Hamid Moghadam","Honest to goodness, we asked that question on a weekly basis of our people and the answer is no, no, no. I'll tell you what I hear it's not like we are being Pollyannish or sticking our head in the sand, it would be a pretty obvious concern and you guys are right to ask about it. But we haven't seen it in fact if we're doing our Analyst Day again today we would be slightly more positive, in the U.S. and a lot more positive in Europe. So the answer is no, we haven\u2019t seen it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Josh Dennerlein","Hi, guys, it's Josh Dennerlein here with Jamie. Could you speak about investor appetite for your funds? Any change post election? And also curious to know the rationale, as well as what sparked L&D's consolidation of its JV fund with PELP?","Hamid Moghadam","Well, I think you are - on the last thing you're referring to PELP and ELV Alliance combining together. Look we have been on a strategy we're trying to simplify the number of different vehicles we have everywhere including Europe. And our goal is to get in each major arena in the U.S. and Europe to one major JVM, one major open-end fund and that's a goal. We made a good first step too in that direction here in Europe by combining PELP and Alliance. So that - and those two strategies were identical. Those two funds have the exact same strategy and it was a good thing for us as simplified our business.","It was a good thing for Alliance because it allowed them to deploy more capital with us and to have a bigger vehicle and more diversified pull. So that one is done and with respect the demand for our funds, I would say in the U.S. we have a lot of demand from outside the U.S. for U.S. vehicles, including some new sources of capital that we have never seen before including some funds coming out of Japan through the pension system that is going through some changes in regulation and the like. It's early days for that but that's a new source of capital we've seen before.","I think the U.S. funds are slowing down a little bit based on what I'm seeing on the margin because they are meeting their allocations by and large, but their allocations are always lagging because the denominator it keeps getting bigger, and so the allocations for next quarter are going to go upside. I don't expect that to be a meaningful slow down I think it's only at the margin. So the simple answer of your question would be no. There is a lot of interest for logistics product, high quality logistics product everywhere around the world.","In fact we are kind of surprised by the amount of interest and there is low quality of logistics around the world. So, no we don\u2019t see anything.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz with UBS. Your line is open.","Jeremy Metz","Thanks. Hi, guys. Earlier, you'd brought up your expectations for demand and supply to reach parity in 2017, also for rent growth to moderate a bit this year. But can you talk about the ability for market rents to continue to push higher once supply starts outpacing demand? Maybe you can give us your thoughts on this dynamic and what you're seeing in the market to support a runway for market rents beyond 2017. Thanks.","Hamid Moghadam","Well, I think as I mentioned in my comments the last four, five years of projected rental growth have been pretty easy, we fell into a deep hole and just climbing out of that hole with replacement costs going up was what we thought 6% rental growth in the U.S. and then dumping 8% per year growth.","Going forward I think rental growth is going to slow down because we're calling essentially for a market that\u2019s plus or minus at the equilibrium in the U.S. and given the quality of the portfolio in our locations and the like, I think it's can be inflation plus type of rental growth.","I think we've spoken to you guys about a 15% mark-to-market in the U.S. plus 3% growth beyond that in terms of market rent, I think will do better than that but we just had 3% for modeling purposes but I think we will in the near term do better than that, how much better than that I guess we're going to have to see.","Europe is interesting, this is an important point I'm trying to communicate so please - this one is what we\u2019re focusing on. There is going to be a time and we think that time is 2018, we\u2019ll know for sure when we get there. While rental growth in Europe can exceed rental growth in the U.S. and that will drive same-store growth for Prologis beyond just our U.S. portfolio and I think that's a unique benefit that we have as a company.","I mean we definitely separate the back part of the cycle by virtue of having a European drag on our performance, I think Europe can turn into a positive boost on performance from 2018 onwards. So that would be my commentary on rents.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel with Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.","Eric Frankel","Thank you. I know this might be a bit of a dead issue, but do you anticipate any reincarnation of TPP in any form that would hurt you or help your business in Asia and the U.S.?","Hamid Moghadam","Eric we don't have any particular insights on that beyond what you and we read in the paper.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick with Capital One Securities. Your line is open.","Ryan Wineman","Hi, this is Ryan Wineman here with Tom. How would you guys expect a border adjustment tax to impact demand for industrial real estate in both the U.S. and abroad?","Chris Caton","Hi, thanks for the question this is Chris Caton. Hamid gave an excellent outline on the global trends and in particular these efforts focused on stimulating job growth, wage growth in general and U.S. consumer I would be big positive for business.","From a - how might things change perspective, I think they're kind to two key point that I would add to Hamid's earlier remarks. The first is the majority of the U.S. markets are really focused on local consumptions and these are not initial shipment points. And then we think about some of these markets that do you have a component that are kind of initial point of contact for international trade, look growth has been excellent in these markets even as a trade growth over the last few years has been moderate.","So supply chain modernization continues in this market, some irrespective of the trade - the trade picture.","Hamid Moghadam ","And that would be LA, Dallas, Chicago and New Jersey. Those would be the four major markets that have a transshipment component to them. So if you\u2019re going to focus on those, those are the markets to pay attention to.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel. Your line is open.","John Guinee","I noticed that on Page 26 your land position got down below $1.3 billion, which is probably one-third of what it was at the height. Can you talk about what you're thinking about land right now? And, also, I did notice that I think 50% of your land is in the U.K., Mexico, Central Valley of California and a couple other unusual places.","Hamid Moghadam ","So John, thank you for acknowledging that. I mean, just the brief history of land bank at Prologis. At the time of the merger the land bank was in the low 2s and the original cost of that land bank I think was in the mid-to high 3s. So we certainly started with a lot of land and it's not as if we haven't been buying land, we've been buying land good land during this period but we've been selling and monetizing more of it overtime.","So our share of land is about $1.250 billion and our total land is about $1.4 billion or something like that on that order. Our goal is to get to two years of land that we own and given our pace of development and land as a percentage of total development cost, that argues for about $800 million our share and a $1 billion overall land bank across the board.","It will take some time to get there because to be perfectly honest with you there is couple $100 million of land that is the lowest quality land we have, that's the least strategic land I would say 200 of that, that will take a long time for us to sell. So we got to kind of carry that, so think of our goal of 800 million of our share and a 1 billion overall as really being 1 billion and 1.2 billion for a while until we can work our way through that land.","But it's a good market for selling land, it\u2019s a good market for monetizing land, and we are getting much more efficient in terms of how middle land we need to support our $2.5ish billion development activity which is good.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob Simone with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Rob Simone","Hi, guys, thanks a lot for taking the question. I was wondering - and this piggybacks on an earlier question - we know that Mexico is obviously a small part of the business today, but has there been any change in your thinking around your land positions there just vis-a-vis a longer-term outlook for the business? And, if not, what would it take to change your view?","Eugene Reilly","Rob this is Gene, let me take that one. So in terms of what's going on with Mexico let me start with what we see happening on the ground. So demand is still very strong in the population centers, I would say customers on the border are little bit hesitant right now for obvious reasons but turning to your question on land, Hamid just addressed this question, overall we feel very good about the progress we've made. We probably have too much land in places like Houston and Mexico absolutely stands out as one of those markets.","We have some land in Mexico which is in the bucket and need references to take some time to grind through but we also have some very well-positioned land in population centers and I think what we're actually going to monetize through development a fair amount of that over the next couple years.","So I don't think the composition of that land bank is the magnitude of it is too large but the composition of the land bank is in the places that we'd like it to be so I don't think we\u2019re going to change strategy there.","Hamid Moghadam","The value of the land bank is Mexico City in Monterey, the acreage maybe in the border cities but the value of the land is in Mexico City in Monterey. And I would tell you there's a shortage of quality land in Mexico City, absorption and development has exceeded our expectations and actually rental growth in peso has been tremendous even throughout all this talk about that bad things happening to Mexico, the issue is that the currency has been week.","So I would guard distinction between in land markets, consumer markets and the border markets. The border market yes, the acreage is high but the value of that land is not that much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael Mueller","Yes, hi. I was wondering, are you expecting any cap rate movements in 2017? And have you made any changes to underwriting for acquisitions in particular?","Hamid Moghadam","Michael we haven't been active acquires in quite some time. Our volume of acquisitions in 2016 was one of the lowest it's been. So I - we've been saying that cap rates are too low for a long time and we keep getting surprised that they go - keep going lower.","One thing I will tell you about cap rates, I don't think they are at sensitive at least in the private market to interest rate movement as the public markets thinks they are. So you know the trade there's some talk of interest rates going up in REIT selloff and six months later they come roaring back. The private market is a lot less volatile with respect to those cap rates and our portfolios have been consistently selling in the marketplace add values that are in excess of our internal NAVs.","In fact non-strategic asset sales which is mostly what we've been doing, there's been about a 5% surprise across the board for us compared to our internal carrying values. And this is the lowest quality portion of our portfolio. So we've been wrong and we've been surprised on cap rates being low and lower than what we think.","What will happen in the future I think it's a function of how much interest rates do actually increase. Remember cap rates were about the same place that they have been, but interest rates are 250 to 300 basis points lower today than they were back in 2007. So there's nothing that says cap rates have to go up if 10 year treasury is get to 4% or something like that. So I don't know but so far we've had a declining cap rates in recent past as oppose to an increasing cap rate. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Neil Malkin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Neil Malkin","Thanks, guys. Your European exposure the percent of your NOI got 17% and I just wondering if you could talk about what you see happening as far as scenario go you kind of did this earlier in the call with U.S. but there's a lot of very big important election coming up in Germany, France, the Netherlands et cetera. And maybe we know the rise in this sort of Eurosceptic protectionist regime across those countries have gained the popularity in earnest. And I just wondering if you guys have thought all about what would happen if those party got into power and if so, what would have into either the euro currency the impact on your businesses or your tenants, commerce and general over there, any thought would be helpful.","Hamid Moghadam","The good thing about our business Neil is that nobody releases warehouse space because they like to do something fancy. They lease warehouse space because necessities of life go through warehouses. And I' don\u2019t see people eating less food, less apparel or less toilet paper because of the politics of the country. I think the best recent example of that was Brexit, I mean there was all this brouhaha, but Brexit just killing demand in the U.K. and we're 99 point something leased in the U.K. and we had probably the best six month run in the U.K. that I can ever remember.","So some of these things kind of don't follow conventional wisdom of the sky falling that, I don\u2019t have any particular views on currency, but we run our business in a currency agnostic way, that's why we're 92% in U.S. dollars and that's why we hedged a year or two of earnings ahead of time because we don't - we're not in that business, we're not better than anybody else in predicting currency. But we run our business in a manner where we're in effect hedged against those kind of risks.","So, I think as long as consumption continues in Europe and it is the world's largest market is 375 million people may be chopped up into smaller pieces, but those people are still there consuming regardless of what their politics are. I feel pretty good about Europe. ","Thomas Olinger","Neil, let me just share sort of our base case, I mean we've basically got an up arrow on Europe today and if you just look at what's happening on the ground, this quarter Europe again up 60 basis points. And the big gains actually came in our weaker I would say regions, Southern Europe which is trending up to 95.5% occupied and Central and Eastern Europe which trended up to 96.5% occupied. The other place where we made gains is another place that we are struggling less than hundred thousand square foot basis. Again we went up by 240 basis points up to 93% occupied today.","We've had four quarters of positive rental change. And as Hamid mentioned earlier we're expecting a cap rates moderate, so our view is that rents are going to continue to increase. So that sort of our forward forecast our expectation for the next several years, our expectation is that you are going to see a tail end.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Rodgers with Baird. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst ","This is Dick here with Dave. A lot of my questions have been asked already. But, real quickly, with regards to your 2017 occupancy guidance, this is about 100 basis points lower than where you ended the year. Is this conservative or are you seeing something specifically, given where 2016 ended?","Hamid Moghadam","No, nothing particularly, I think there is some level of conservatism in that number, I would expect as to probably be a little higher, but I think what's more important what drives NOI as you all know is average occupancy and average occupancy is what we expect to be very similar year-over-year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Blaine Heck","Thanks. I just wanted to get back to land for a second. Can you guys talk about land prices in general? It seems like we've seen a major increase in most of the primary markets thus far this cycle. So, do you think further increases in land pricing are possible? And how have the increased prices influenced your ability to, number one, purchase land in your targeted markets and sub markets, and, number two, continue to achieve the expectable yields on those developments?","Mike Curless","Blaine this is Mike Curless. If you think about our land portfolio we've mentioned this a couple of times here recently, but we view our portfolio to be up at least 17% undervalued and we're certainly seeing land prices uptick particularly in the larger global markets, but we're also seeing rents higher in those markets which justify higher land prices.","So we're selected as ever. Our primary acquisitions our expenses of our existing parks and those sites that we think we can turn through in two to three years. So we're being very selective on what we buy and there's a market out there for us to be successful in this environment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel with Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.","Eric Frankel","Thank you for the follow-up. I can understand with the quirky land question I was confused for John Guinee there. I was wondering if you could comment a little bit about, I think we're seeing a little bit more in the press about 3D printing and automation starting to make its way into supply chains -- in very small amounts at this point but I was hoping you could maybe touch upon and give some examples of your customers upon this technology or what you might see going forward. Thank you.","Hamid Moghadam","I think 3D is an important technology and I think it will be really consistent with the automation and localized manufacturing. I think what people missed is that they think somehow 3D printing skips the supply chain, but the material that goes into 3D printing is got to come from somewhere and it needs its own supply chain. So I don't really think it really affects demand for industrial real estate in a major way. In fact because the supply chain will be less bulk for 3D printing, because 3D building is -- printing as oppose to mass production is about mass customization and more localized production. I think it requires a more complex supply chain. ","So but I think it would be very difficult for 3D printing for most products to compete with the price of mass production particularly within the introduction of automation. So I think it's a great technology for innovation, for prototyping, but it's not really great technology for mass production. So that's our view of it. By the way it's not new 3D printing has been around for a long time. I remember actually in 1986 being at an MIT campus visit where they were actually printing models of cars that the kind that they used to make with clay models using layers of 3D printing laying down, I think the auto technologies is a lot for component and body manufacturing. So it's been around for long, long time. It's getting better all the time though.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Ki Bin Kim","Hi. Just a quick question. Any particular reasons why the investment capacity went down from $3.1 billion\/$3.2 billion to $2.6 billion this quarter?","Thomas Olinger","That's been capacity - we have stopped trying to raising funds as long as we have uninvested funds and queues and as we work down those funds we'll go raise somewhere on a capital. It's not a real issue, I mean we will raise capital when we need to invest capital, when there is deployment opportunities.","Hamid Moghadam","Also there is a timing lag just between the redemption that we've done and just normal capital raising that that part of the cyclical nature of that.","Thomas Olinger","We actually reduced our share in our funds and allowed some of the accused invest in our funds as a way of satisfying those kits.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Jordan Sadler","It's Jordan Sadler. I just wanted to get a little clarity here on the view on Europe, if you could. First, what's driving the confidence here on Europe? And how can you tilt the portfolio to be a little bit better positioned to capitalize on the opportunity you see coming?","Hamid Moghadam","So I think our European portfolio is really well-positioned, I mean we've spent a lot of time in an effort on cleaning up our European portfolio in last couple of years and I think it's really well-positioned and it's a solid. It's by far the best portfolio in Europe.","So I think where extremely well-positioned to benefit from that. I think the lagging part of Europe if you\u2019re going to pick on one place it's France and I think we're about to see some major political changes in France. So I think that will help our French portfolio, particularly Paris portfolio which has been lagging.","That was the last question.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to our host, Ms. Tracy Ward, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.","Tracy A. Ward","Thank you, Tracy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2012 conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. This morning we'll hear from Hamid Moghadam, Chairman and CEO, who will comment on the company's strategy and market environment; then from Tom Olinger, CFO, who will cover results and guidance. Additionally, we are joined today by members of our executive team, including Gary Anderson; Mike Curless; Nancy Hemmenway; Guy Jaquier; Ed Nekritz; and Gene Reilly.","Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to quickly state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates, as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance, and actual results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings. I'd like to also state that our fourth quarter results, press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO, EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures and, in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. [Operator Instructions]","Hamid, will you please begin?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Thanks, Tracy. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter call. A significant milestone because it marks our first full year operating as a new company.","As you know, at the outset of the merger, we put together an ambitious plan to drive our path for the first 10 quarters as a new company. The purpose of this plan was to build a strong foundation for growth into the future. Today, we're 6 quarters into that plan, and I'm pleased to say that we've outperformed our own high expectations.","Let me take a few moments to review the highlights of our progress. Of the 4 priorities, perhaps the most central to the plan was our decision to realign our portfolio with our investment strategy. Because in many ways, the other priorities follow from this one. We're ahead of plan in terms of focusing our presence in the global markets. This priority contemplated $2.9 billion of dispositions during the course of the 10 Quarter Plan. Today, we're 80% complete, with $2.3 billion of sales at an average cap rate of 7.1%. The dispositions have occurred predominantly in secondary markets, increasing our overall percentage of assets in global markets from 79% at the merger date to 85% today, well on our way to achieving our target of 90% in the future.","Given the number of transactions over the past 18 months, the market has clearly spoken that there is no shortage of demand for high quality industrial real estate. Importantly, we sold properties at prices in line with values embedded in our internal NAV analysis.","On the deployment front, we started more than $1.5 billion of new development at an average yield of 7.9% and a value creation margin of more than 18%. These starts represent a 50% increase over the last year, with a record 57% of them in build-to-suits. In the process, we were able to monetize about $400 million of our land bank.","We've also exceeded our target for our second priority which was to streamline our Private Capital business. Our 10 Quarter Plan contemplated the rationalization of 4 funds. And to date, we've liquidated or restructured a total of 8 funds. At the same time, we're growing our Private Capital business through the formation of new vehicles and raising capital for our existing funds. We exceeded last year's record and raised $1.9 billion of new equity. A big part of this new business was the 50\/50 joint venture with Norges Bank Investment Management that we announced in December. We're excited about this new relationship with such a highly regarded investor and expect to close the transaction in March.","Shifting over to Asia, we selected a J-REIT as the optimal structure for capitalizing our Japan operating platform. We're very pleased with the level of interest and demand for the IPO, which priced earlier in the week at the top of its filing range and will close next week. With these 2 major priorities behind us, we will turn our emphasis to growing our Private Capital platform by raising additional growth capital within existing funds and ventures.","Growing levels of investor interest in industrial property is being met by a dearth of stable operating platforms and experienced management teams. As an owner\/operator with global capabilities across a full range of risk-return strategies, we're well positioned to take advantage of this trend.","Our third priority was to strengthen our financial position. And in this regard, we expect to get significantly ahead of plan following the closing of our J-REIT and Norges transaction. Tom will go into the details of this in his prepared remarks.","Our fourth and final priority has been to improve the utilization of our assets. Occupancy since the merger date is up 330 basis points to 94%, very close to its long-term average of 95%. Our leasing teams around the world did an outstanding job last year. We set records for annual leasing at 145 million square feet; and for the quarter with 40 million square feet. In the U.S., we're continuing to see considerably stronger demand for our spaces under 100,000 feet. Occupancy in these smaller spaces was up 140 basis points in the fourth quarter and up 200 basis points year-over-year. This segment is closely tied to the recovery in the housing market, where we expect demand to increase into the foreseeable future.","Now I'd like to shift gears and offer some brief comments on the key demand drivers for our business. The recovery in the industrial real estate market continues around the globe. All signals point to a positive future for our sector. For example, the IMF is forecasting global trade growth at 3.8% for 2013 and even stronger in 2014. Improving industrial production and new goods orders also indicate strengthening economic growth. U.S. inventories have now been growing for the last 11 out of 12 quarters and are almost back to their precrisis level. We expect further rebuilding of inventory this year that will surpass the previous peak. This is not surprising, given the fact that the U.S. population has increased by 12 million in the past 5 years. We're forecasting 150 million square feet of net absorption in the U.S. in 2013. This may prove conservative as it doesn't factor a strong recovery in housing or the strength we saw in the fourth quarter.","In Europe, net absorption continues to be positive and has been since we began collecting the data series in the first quarter of 2011. Take up also remains well above its long-term average. Supply of Class-A product remains constrained in both Japan and China. We expect the reconfiguration of supply chain in Japan and growing consumption in China to continue to drive demand for our product in the long term.","In summary, strengthening demand in the U.S., Europe and Asia, together with low levels in new construction, is having a positive impact on market rents. Recovery in rents has taking hold in most global markets and is now spreading to regional markets.","With that, let me turn things over to Tom.","Thomas S. Olinger","Thanks, Hamid. This morning, I'll cover 2 topics. First, our fourth quarter and year-end results; and second, guidance for 2013. So let's look at our results. Core FFO for the fourth quarter was $0.42 a share and for the full year 2012 was $1.74 a share. Net operating income was stronger than we expected, driven by higher occupancy and development leasing. This was partially offset by higher G&A expenses due to accruals for our compensation plan as a result of an increase in our stock price and our accomplishments for the year.","Turning to our operating portfolio, occupancy at quarter end was 94%, up 90 basis points from the third quarter and 180 basis points year-over-year, setting leasing records for both the quarter and the year as Hamid mentioned. Leasing activity during the fourth quarter was strong across all space sizes. At year end, our spaces over 0.5 million square feet were 100% occupied, and spaces over 250,000 square feet were 98.5% occupied, while small spaces were at 90%.","GAAP same-store NOI for the fourth quarter was up 0.1%, bringing the full year to 1.3%. GAAP same-store in the fourth quarter was essentially flat as a result of lower-than-normal operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2011. On an adjusted cash basis, same-store NOI was up 0.8% for the quarter. Rent change on rollovers decreased 2.4% for the quarter. The decline was primarily driven by European regional markets where leases were signed at the high point of the prior cycle. Looking at the Americas, rent change was effectively flat in the fourth quarter, down only 0.6%. Rent change is continuing its upward trend, and we expect positive rollover in 2013.","Turning to our capital deployment, we had contribution and dispositions of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter, with our share of this activity at $1 billion. We made significant progress in the past few months on our asset realignment strategy, with the formation of the Norges venture and the launch of our J-REIT. While the Norges venture hasn't closed, it is impacting our Q4 net earnings. Therefore, it's important to understand the whole picture when both of these transactions are completed. The net effect of these 2 transactions is an overall net book gain of more than $165 million and a modest increase in our fourth quarter NAV using current FX rates.","Let me walk you through the specifics. First, we anticipate the J-REIT will close next week. Through the contribution of $1.9 billion of stabilized assets, we expect to recognize a book gain of more than $300 million at today's FX rate. This gain is based on contributing an 85% interest in the assets to the J-REIT as we will retain a 15% interest in the entity.","Second, we expect the Norges venture to close in March. The European portfolio is primarily comprised of the former PEPR assets, but also includes some wholly owned assets. The former PEPR assets were contributed to the venture at a value effectively equal to our tender cost to acquire the additional PEPR interest. For the balance sheet assets, we recognized an impairment of approximately $135 million based on the plan contribution value of these developments. About 75% of the impairments relate to the Czech Republic and Spain. These properties were developed by us and on average had a construction start date in the first half of 2008, the peak of the prior cycle. Keep in mind accounting rules require us to recognize the impairment as if we sold 100% of the assets to the venture. However, we will retain a 50% interest and expect the asset value to appreciate over time.","To sum up, we expect to recognize a net gain of over $165 million. And taking into account FX, a modest increase in NAV from these 2 transactions. Additionally, by electing to retain a 50% ownership in our Norges venture, we will participate in the recovery of asset values in Europe, which we think will be significant.","Moving to deployment and acquisitions, development starts increased significantly in the fourth quarter, ending the year at $1.5 billion. We're continuing to see more development opportunities. And as we previously discussed, our land bank is a competitive advantage. During the quarter, we conducted a thorough review of our land bank to refresh both valuation and our intended strategy.","Let me give you some color on this analysis. Our conclusion is that our global land bank has a market value above its book value as of year end and can be divided into 2 segments. First, there are strategic landholdings located in global markets with a book value of $1.7 billion that we believe have a market value of approximately $2 billion. Second, the remaining $200 million of land is not strategic that we intend to sell in the near term. It is on this portion that we recognized a noncash impairment charge of approximately $78 million. The bottom line is we think we can create more value by selling these parcels and reinvesting the proceeds into our global markets. As you know, GAAP accounting doesn't provide for land values to be written up. It does require impairments for planned land sales with projected book losses. So when you look at the land bank in aggregate, we believe the market value exceed the book by more than 10% or by over $200 million on a net basis after the impairment.","On the capital markets front, during the quarter, we completed more than $1.1 billion of debt financings, refinancings and paydowns. On a look-through debt basis, it decreased by $800 million, and we ended the year with 43.9% leverage. We expect the Norges and J-REIT transactions will reduce our leverage further to about 37%.","Now turning to guidance for 2013. For operations, we expect 2013 GAAP same-store NOI [growth] to range between 1.5% and 2.5%. Given the disproportionate level of lease roll in the first quarter, as well as the seasonal nature of month-to-month leasing, we expect occupancy to decline in the first quarter then trend higher and reach between 94% and 95% by year end.","For FX, our guidance assumes the euro at USD 1.35 and the yen at JPY 92.","On the expense side, we expect net G&A to be $220 million to $230 million.","For capital deployment, our 2013 forecast is between $1.9 billion and $2.4 billion. This deployment includes $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion of development starts, with our share at approximately 75%. We have great visibility into our development pipeline and are off to a good start. Our forecast also includes acquisitions of $400 million to $600 million, with our share at about 35%.","Turning to contributions and dispositions, we expect $7.5 billion to $10 billion in 2013. Our share of the contribution and disposition proceeds will be approximately 60%. Over half of the contribution and disposition forecast relates to Norges and J-REIT transactions, which we expect, again, will complete in the first quarter.","Now for our core FFO guidance for 2013. We expect full year core FFO to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.70 per share. As a reminder, our core FFO excludes any gains or losses from disposition and contribution activity. We believe the appropriate 2012 run rate to which our 2013 guidance should be compared is $1.68 per share, which represents our Q4 2012 result annualized. This is also consistent with our full year 2012 result of $1.74, less the onetime tax benefit we recognized in the third quarter.","The midpoint of our 2013 guidance is $1.65 and represents a $0.03 year-over-year decrease versus the 2012 run rate. The decline is driven primarily by the initial dilution from the timing and associated friction of redeploying the significant proceeds from our contribution and disposition activity. Relative to this, the average yield on contributions and dispositions is about 6.8%, while the average yield on our use of proceeds is approximately 4.2%, consisting of debt repayments, preferred redemptions and capital deployment. This dilution is largely offset by new Private Capital revenues, increased NOI from development stabilization and same-store growth and lower taxes from structure efficiencies. The timing of contributions and dispositions obviously has a significant impact on core FFO. As we previously said, the Europe recapitalization is happening earlier than what our original plan contemplated. If the Norges venture closed in the fourth quarter of 2013, our guidance would increase by almost $0.08. We think our quarterly core FFO run rate by the end of 2013 should be at or above $0.42 a share. So by the end of 2013, we will fully recover our fourth quarter 2012 run rate, yet with significantly lower leverage and FX exposure.","In closing, I'm very pleased with our results this quarter and our progress related to our 10 Quarter Plan. As we've been saying for some time, this is an asset-driven plan, and our achievements will significantly improve our cost structure, our balance sheet and our liquidity. To put this all in perspective, by the end of 2013, we will have reduced our leverage, including preferreds from 50% at the merger to 37%, reduced our non-USD equity exposure from 55% at the merger to less than 35% by year end, all while enhancing the location, age and quality of our portfolio. While we have a little further to go to reach our long-term target for leverage and foreign currency exposure, we're well positioned to take advantage of opportunities to continue to grow our company strategically.","With that, I'll turn it back to Hamid.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Thanks, Tom. Before we open the call to questions, let me close with the key takeaways. We had an excellent quarter and a strong finish to the year, and I couldn't be more proud of how our teams have executed. I also think it's easy to lose sight of the magnitude of these accomplishments.","As a quick recap, since the merger we have sold $2.3 billion of assets; realigned over $12 billion -- that's $12 billion of fund assets; raised $2.4 billion in new private capital; increased portfolio occupancy by 330 basis points; started $1.9 billion of developments, with an average margin of 19%; and reduced our leverage by 1,300 basis points post the Norges and the J-REIT transactions. These efforts have allowed us to build a strong foundation for sustainable growth and to reach our goal of being a blue chip REIT as we discussed at our investor forum. We have the portfolio, the customer relationships, the balance sheet and most importantly, the team to capitalize on market opportunities by leveraging our scale and global footprint. As always, we'll do this in a responsible manner.","We'll now open the call for your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel, Nicolaus.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","John Guinee here. Hamid or whomever, looking at Page 29, which is your development story, it looks to me like you've got about 10 million square feet -- I'm sorry, 11.2 million square feet in the U.S. alone at a development number of somewhere between $73 and $76 a square foot, which strikes me as fairly high for bulk industrial. What exactly are you building and where are you building it to come up with $73 to $76 a square foot?","Hamid R. Moghadam","John, I'll have Gene answer that.","Eugene F. Reilly","Sure John. I'm actually having trouble reconciling the page number, but as to the cost per square foot, these are driven primarily by a lot of starts in the Los Angeles market. That is not an usual number at all. And if you're looking at an Americas number, it is going to incorporate Brazil. John, I'm going to continue. So in Brazil, our development costs range from $95 to over $100 a square foot, so it's a real mix issue. And if you want to look at the downside, we can certainly develop, for example, a large floor plate build-to-suit in the, call it, low to mid-40s if you're in a market like Dallas, for example. So there's a pretty broad spectrum there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Jamie Feldman here with Jeff. I guess my question is more on guidance. I was hoping you could provide a couple of details, which are, what's the cash same-store NOI growth rate? What is the AFFO based on your guidance range? And then, I guess, bigger picture on the development or on the dispositions, kind of how should we think about that getting from the $7 billion to $10 billion, kind of what would you be selling? What kind of pricing and what's the appetite?","Thomas S. Olinger","Okay. Jamie, this is Tom. I will take those. So first on cash same-store NOI, I would expect cash same-store NOI to be at the high end of our GAAP range. We've clearly been trending cash higher than GAAP same-store, which you would -- which is consistent with this point in the cycle. Next on AFFO, AFFO for 2012 will come in right in about the low 90% range. I would expect the same range for 2013. On the dispositions side, when you look at dispositions for the year -- we'll step back, when you look at contributions and dispositions for the year with the guidance, the midpoint is just under $9 billion. And when you think about the Norges and J-REIT transactions, that's a little over $5 billion. So you're left with about a little over $4 billion left. And when you look at the buckets of what's left, it's really 3 things. One, there are about $1.3 billion of asset repositioning. So selling out of non-core markets and assets. There's about $1.5 billion of contributions into existing funds. A lot of that's in Europe, but also in platforms in Mexico and Brazil. And we have about a little over $2 billion of what I would call fund rationalizations, so these are just continuing asset sales out of existing funds that are either -- that we're rationalizing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Just a couple of questions, and I'm sorry if I missed this, but did you go into detail about the impairments that were taken in the period?","Thomas S. Olinger","We did.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","And is there -- I guess, it's a fairly recurring event at this point, and I guess, what's your sentiment relative to the asset base and potential impairments going forward? How that impacts your decisions on future contributions? I'd just like to get more of an understanding about the nature of the accounting and the strategic decisions behind that, those kind of charges.","Thomas S. Olinger","This is Tom, I'll take that question. I believe the impairment is over. We don't see any impairments going forward really at all. What's driving this is clearly our change of intent on a very small portion of our land bank, which we believe we can redeploy that capital and quite frankly, generate a much better return by redeploying that capital, so that's on that point. And on the European asset side, these were assets we had planned to hold for the long term, very good assets, but as we talked about in my prepared remarks, these assets were developed at the peak of the cycle. But the important thing is, we had to pick up 100% of that value change even though we only contributed 50% of the asset into the venture. I mean, that's just the way the accounting rules work. So it's a very lopsided view of what really happened, when in reality we're keeping 50% of the upside of those assets. So if -- I would call it accounting gymnastics and don't expect to see much, if any, of that going forward.","Hamid R. Moghadam","And I would question that characterization of, this is a recurring event. I think it's the first time we've done it as a merged company, and it was after a strategic review of our land assets in Europe primarily.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Tom, just sticking with you just in terms of peeling back the onion a little bit on sources and uses. So just at the midpoint, you're going to generate $5.25 billion of cash from the sales, then you talked about that being at about a 6.8% cap rate. And then as a use of the cash at a 4.2% for debt repayment, preferred and sort of capital deployment. And I'm wondering if you can just sort of go through the amounts that you're using for each and the timing because I assume it is going to be bumpy throughout the year as the cash comes in, but you won't be able to use that cash immediately, and so maybe just walk us through some of that. And then you talked about new private capital and lower taxes, but you didn't quantify the change of those line items year-to-year, and so if you can go through that as well that would be helpful.","Thomas S. Olinger","Okay, I will try to address all of that. So you're right. When you look at the midpoint of our contribution and disposition guidance, it's about $5.25 billion, but for round numbers, just call it, $5.5 billion. And our share of deployment is about $1.4 billion. When you look at the debt side, which again we think will be around 4.2% blended yield on what we could get after, there's several different components of it, and I'll try to give you the bigger pieces. Number one, the biggest piece is debt transfer. That's about $1.1 billion. So when you think about the Norges transaction, debt going, transferring from our balance sheet into the venture, although it's very small. We also have contributions in Europe where debt is getting transferred to the funds. And when you think about the J-REIT transaction, where we're extinguishing debt in connection with that transaction, so that's all about $1.1 billion. There's the convertible debt of just under $0.5 billion that matures. There's bonds that mature of about $400 million. And then there's about $700 million of other debt that some of it's maturing and some of it's debt we think we can get after that matures beyond 2014 with minimal friction. The -- one more piece would be the preferreds, as you mentioned. We can redeem all but one series of our preferreds. That's just under about $0.5 billion. And then the balance of that, to finish it out, would be on our line. So when you look at the blended yield on all of that activity, on all of that reduction of leverage, that's about 4.2%. And you're right, from a timing perspective, this will be lumpy as we look through half the quarters of 2013. Now clearly, with the Norges and the J-REIT transaction happening mid-to-late in the first quarter, that will clearly have impacts throughout the year. Because when you step back, there is really a timing difference here, as we said in my prepared remarks, to really put this capital back to work. And although we can reinvest in very, very profitable development activity, there's just a timing gap between as we're constructing those assets, the only real yield we get is cost to carry, which is about 4.5%. We don't get that yield out of our pipeline.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc.","Craig Mailman - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Jordan Sadler's on with me as well. Can you guys just maybe address, I guess, last quarter you kind of commented that you think rent spreads were going to start to turn negative here. I know you had mentioned it's going to bounce around a bit, but the negative 2.4% this quarter is a little surprising. Just what are you seeing on that front? Do you think it's early in '13 or is that getting pushed out, the expectation?","Gary A. Anderson","Craig, it's Gary. As we said last quarter and most quarters, this is going to bounce around on a quarter-to-quarter basis, it's a bit volatile, but I think the important thing for you to do is to look at the trend line on a year-to-year basis. And that trend is absolutely undeniable, and it's positive. So we're definitely trending in the right direction. We would fully expect that we'll see positive rent change on rollover for the full year 2013. If you want to dig into Q4 specifically, Tom said at the outset that it was related to Europe leasing, and it was. I'll just remind you, for the quarter, we had record leasing for the company at 40 million square feet. We had record leasing for Europe at about 12 million square feet. When you pull back the onion with respect to Europe, it's actually pretty interesting, the composition of the leasing. 70% of the leasing was in France, Germany, Poland and The Netherlands, and that shouldn't surprise you. Those are our big markets. But 20% of the leasing was in Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Spain. Slovakia may not surprise you, the Czech Republic and Spain should. Peel the onion back even a little bit further and it gets even more interesting. In the Czech Republic, we did leasing in Uzice, which is -- the market's about 30 kilometers north of Prague. In Spain, it was in [indiscernible] which is sort of a secondary market and [indiscernible] we're actually seeing leasing. So the long and the short of it is, we're seeing leasing in non-core submarkets that we haven't seen really for the past 3 years. And those markets are rolling off peak rents. So again, while we're seeing somewhat higher rental rolldowns in Q4, I think we're seeing greater activity in the non-core markets. And I'll take the NOI from those non-core markets as opposed to the quarter-to-quarter rent change any day.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Maiorana with Wells Fargo.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to go back into the evaluation for the assets that were sold or to be sold in the Norges in Europe and the J-REIT. I think in the prepared remarks you guys mentioned that they were above the internal values within the NAV, but as outsiders as we look at it, the cap rates appear higher than what we'd use for -- where those regions would come out at least on an average basis. So I'm wondering what is -- if these values are above the internal NAV, first, is that excluding the pickup that you get in management fees? And second, what does that suggest about the values or the appropriate cap rates for the remainder of the portfolio that will be in both in Europe and in Japan?","Hamid R. Moghadam","So let me give you a global answer on that. I think the Japan, the IPO has to be priced at NAV by definition, which is based on appraised values, and those are actually within 10 basis points of our cap rate to the good. In other words, the appraised values were at a 10-basis point lower cap rate than what internally we had in our model. So that's pretty simple and actually you'll have to wait to see where the thing trades. But I think the indications of what the valuations are going to be are going to be pretty strong at the public level. So that's pretty simple to talk about. In Europe, it's a pretty simple math. We actually end up buying the bulk of what we recapitalized in this transaction through a tender process at PEPR. And basically our goal was not to make a spread on the deal or anything like that. We just wanted to get it from one format that was not right into another format that was right. And we did that on a breakeven basis a year sooner than we wanted to. Now you could argue that we could have hung in there and done it at 50-basis point lower cap rate and maybe we could have. But we chose to actually break even on that transaction and establish a very new major relationship with a major investor, and we kept 50% of the portfolio that we get to write up, plus a promote on the other 50% that we sold. So I think what it says about cap rates is that it was a really good transaction for the company from a capital allocation point of view. And if you take all of that and compare it to the range of cap rates that we have used in our investor presentations, and you -- particularly blended in with the dispositions, which are off the bottom of the portfolio, we're selling you our least desirable assets, actually you would conclude that we are -- we were a little low on our NAVs before and the market -- based on the market speaking, we should be a little bit higher than what we had before.","Thomas S. Olinger","And Brendan, to answer the second part of your question regarding management fees, yes, the increase in management fees from the formation of those new ventures is in our NAV calculation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Auerbach with ISI.","George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just one question for Tom. The trailing 4 quarter of CapEx as a percentage of NOI has been ticking up through the year. I guess it makes sense given how much leasing you're doing, but with the portfolio at 94% occupied, where do you think that ratio goes in 2013?","Eugene F. Reilly","I'm going to take that, this is Gene. And we think that as you look at 2012 going into 2013, these overall numbers will stay the same. You accurately point out that substantial leasing activity is going to move the CapEx number. But if we break this down a little bit and just look at property improvements, for the last couple of years, we've been really ticking along at about $0.05 per square foot per quarter of property expenses agnostic of leasing. And we think that's going to continue at that rate, so we do not see uplift there. With respect to the cost to lease our space, that's held pretty steady. If you look at it on a constant basis, which should be on a kind of cost per square foot as you do leasing, and that's -- it's right around $1.37. So again, we see that as being fairly steady. And frankly, I'm really happy about that because we're doing more small tenant leasing in the last couple of quarters, and those generally have higher TIs. So looking at the trailing 4 quarters numbers, the way we've done this book, it's going to take another few quarters for those numbers to sort of rationalize. If you look at the book last year, we didn't even start doing that until the fourth quarter. So we got to digest this and run it through a little bit further. But I would say, you get a 13.9% number there for this quarter, that's going to go down because that's pushed up by the high velocity of leasing. So I'd say it'd be in the 12s, but let it play through for a couple of quarters.","Hamid R. Moghadam","George, I wouldn't look at those numbers quarter-by-quarter. I look at them year-over-year because there are seasonality and all kinds of things. And really the right time to look at these is where the different segments in terms of size of portfolio are about the same level of leasing. We're basically out of big space. I mean, we have 100% occupancy on spaces over 0.5 million feet. 1.5% on spaces over 250,000 feet and 10% in the small spaces. So most of the new leasing that's going to be done is going to be the small spaces, and those are going to be more expensive.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just real quick, if we're looking at the sequential occupancy increase into Q4, was all that coming from leasing or was there any, I guess, significant impact from asset mix change?","Thomas S. Olinger","There's no impact from disposition activity.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And real quick, in terms of the build-to-suit or in terms of the guidance for development starts, can you talk about what the percentage of build-to-suits is in that mix?","Michael S. Curless","This is Mike. Last year, we enjoyed a very high build-to-suit percentage, as Hamid referred to, at 57%, and we would expect on a going forward basis that to more level off approximately more in the 50\/50 range going forward. We're certainly very optimistic about our build-to-suit pipeline when you consider the U.S. pipeline is as strong as we've seen in some time. We're seeing some pickup in Europe, and we're seeing our customers, potential customers in those pipelines changing some of their requirements with more of a focus on what we would consider global markets as they're intending to be in more major population centers to serve their customers potentially in one-day delivery cycles, and we think that's going to bode very well for our build-to-suit prospects in the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Truxillo with Bank of America.","Thomas C. Truxillo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Tom, I appreciate your comments on where you think leverage is going and on walking us through the sources and uses on how you get there. But given how the Norges JV is going to be structured, essentially debt free, it seems like at least the timing of how that leverage is going to be split between your wholly owned and your joint ventures, has changed a little bit. I mean, you had the goal of wholly owned being 25%, JV is 40%. It seems like those 2 ratios are going to be maybe inversed here for a while. Can you talk about the timing of that? And do you still plan to get wholly owned assets to a 25% leverage number?","Thomas S. Olinger","Yes, I think the -- yes, we will get the wholly owned to 25%. And I think the reality is that our joint ventures will actually be less than 40% when you really look at it long-term because we have several ventures now, the Norges venture, the Allianz venture, that are using little or no leverage. Brazil, no leverage. So I think the reality is 25%, yes, we're going to hit that number on a wholly owned basis and my guess is our -- the JV is actually lower than 40% what we said long term.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Stewart with Green Street Advisors.","John Stewart - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","I've got one for Hamid and 2 quick housekeeping items for Tom. Hamid...","Hamid R. Moghadam","Uh-oh, yellow flag.","John Stewart - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","I'll try to keep it short. First of all, Hamid, congratulations on all you have been able to accomplish since the last call, particularly in Japan and Europe. A question on Japan. What is the rationale for essentially leaving half of the portfolio on balance sheet and how did you arrive at what went into the J-REIT and what stayed on balance sheet? And then for Tom, just following up on the accounting treatment for the European JV, will you initially consolidate that? Just curious about when you're referring to the debt transfer. And then lastly, on G&A I think you gave us a net number, what would the gross number be? And I presume at this point that all merger integration costs will have been realized. Is that right?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Okay. I'll answer the accounting questions and Tom can -- let me answer your question, first of all, thank you for your congratulations. But I get to talk about it, the team gets to do all the hard work. So we appreciate it on behalf of the team. Secondly, the rationale was pretty simple. We think there is a tremendous upside in values in Europe. And we were able to recapitalize PEPR, which was the primary component of this and bring it in-house basically at a pretty good value, and that's essentially where we recapitalize it with the Norges transaction. So we like -- originally, we were going to do an 80\/20 deal, but we looked at these values and we said, this is the best place we could have our capital invested over the next couple of years. So we like owning 50% of this portfolio. And if you really look at the economics at that 50 -- on a 50\/50 basis, plus a promote opportunity, we think in the next 3 years, we could have maybe 50% of the upside economics of this deal and meet our objectives. So that was pretty easy. Now on the J-REIT side, I think you asked about that too. On the J-REIT side, the selection of the portfolio was pretty easy. Those were the assets that were essentially unencumbered and stabilized on the balance sheet that were ready to go, and in the pipeline for the J-REIT, there are a further 8 properties that are under development or in late stages of development, actually pretty well leasing up. And 2 assets from the old AMB portfolio that have some secured debt on them that needs to get resolved. So of those assets, when they're ready to go, we're hoping that the J-REIT will transact on those assets as part of its redesignated portfolio. So I think that answers all of your questions.","Thomas S. Olinger","John, I'll tick through yours. Norges will be on the equity method of accounting, as will the J-REIT. Merger expenses were done, happy to close the cover on that book, won't have merger expenses in 2013 related to that transaction. And on a G&A perspective, gross G&A, of course just excluding property management or Private Capital, which is the way we look at G&A. Gross would be between $290 million to $300 million for 2013 on a gross basis before capitalization.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Yes. The only difference between the gross and the net in our vocabulary is basically what's capitalized into development. And that number will probably increase over the next couple of years, the portion that's capitalized will increase.","Thomas S. Olinger","Just given our development activity.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple of questions. I'm actually looking at the footnotes in the back of the supplemental, and 2 things caught my eye. The first is, there's been about $220 million spent on merger, acquisition and other integration expenses, including $28 million this last quarter. How much more should we expect in 2013? And then the table that's sitting right next to it, the free rent number, almost $17 million in the fourth quarter. Can you give us a sense of how many of the leases that are getting signed have a free rent component and where should that number trend over the next year?","Thomas S. Olinger","Okay. Ross, no merger expenses in 2013. We're done with merger expenses after 2012.","Eugene F. Reilly","On the free rent, I mean, I hesitate to tell you where that number is going to go, but in general if you look across the geographies, concessions are declining and that includes free rent. And frankly, I'm struggling to think of a place where that's static. So the concessions are declining. So we would expect to see free rent lower in the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Hamid or Tom, when you gave your presentation back in the fall, your stock was trading at $34, trading close to $40 now as you look at your sources and uses for 2013 and beyond. How do you think about common equity at this point?","Hamid R. Moghadam","I have never answered that question in a good way. So I'll take the fifth on that completely. But let me really get to the essence of your question, which is kind of leverage and where it's going and all that. So after Norges and J-REIT, the company will be 37% levered. We think of the 30% additional interest that we're keeping in the Norges transaction as a temporary investment. Hopefully one that we will liquidate, if you will, in the next 3 years for the terms of the agreement that we have. That is about 2.5 to 3 points of leverage. We also have some convertible preferreds, just under $500 million of them, that are technically expiring in 2015. We might be able to get at that a little bit earlier. Who knows? I mean, you would think those guys would want to convert at some point given where the strike prices are. That's another 1.5, 2 points of leverage. So I mean, based on what we've done, assuming that we don't do anything else, and we plan to do plenty of other things, our leverage will be in the low-30s. So we have a pretty good path to reducing leverage. So I know I didn't quite answer the question you asked, but I think I answered the question that I could answer.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just wanted to ask about the U.S. housing recovery and how you're thinking about that this year. At the prior peak, what was the percent of the home oriented tenants in your portfolio and where are you today and what are you thinking about that going forward?","Eugene F. Reilly","Jeff, this is Gene. Let me take a stab at that. Let me give you a general answer first. With respect to housing, we've been talking about this recovery for a while. And what we have in our forecast is a continued sort of modest recovery in home building in the U.S. So as I look at our U.S. operations, we have upside potential if this recovery really picks up steam. And there's an awful long way to go. I mean, we were at 1.8 million in annual starts of homes at the peak.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Yes, that's not going to happen.","Eugene F. Reilly","I don't think that's going to happen. But we were down to 500,000, 600,000 and now we're trending up 700,000. And we have upside in our numbers if that really picks up steam. And if the recovery completely stalls and reverses, then we probably have downside. The question you asked about what percentage of our tenants are related to home building, that's probably a pretty big number. But it has a bandwidth to it. In other words, you don't have a lot of tenants who are 100% necessarily, but you have many tenants that are generally related to it. And that's probably something we can work on for you guys to get some more detail. But if we look at what our leasing activity is shaping up to be in the last quarter, this current quarter, more and more demand from the carpet guys, the tile guys, appliance sales are up. And in markets like Las Vegas or Phoenix that were really, really hurt, we're finally seeing some good demand. And that's why you're seeing the occupancy levels in the smaller spaces go up. But a little more of a complex answer to be precise in the numbers. But I am personally quite optimistic that this trend's going to accelerate.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, just 2 quick follow-ups, one was just in terms of debt to EBITDA, just thinking about leverage in a different way. It would appear as though once you stabilize the existing developments underway plus the developments you're going to start in '13, and you sell all the assets you plan to sell this year, and you have the growth in EBITDA just from the increase in same-store, that you're probably in the low-7s debt to EBITDA, so I just wanted to make sure that we're sort of on the same path and the same page. And I think you've talked about a target of 5 to 6x. It would seem as though, I guess, some of these other sales will eventually get you that goal. But I want to make sure we're thinking about it the right way. And the second one is just in terms of spend. Tom, you talked about $1.4 billion of deployment this year, but I assume on those developments, you're not spending all of it this year, and you have $800 million left to spend on the existing pipeline, so call it a $2.2 billion total commitment that you've put out there. How much of that actually gets used in 2013 as we think about the sources and uses? And I think you forgot to answer the question that I'd asked earlier about Private Capital contribution in the lower taxes and how much that's impacting '13 versus '12.","Thomas S. Olinger","Okay, first on the EBITDA question, you are right in the ballpark there regarding it being in the low-7s. And clearly, with the additional pieces that Hamid mentioned, that will get us down into the low-6s if not putting a 5 in front of it.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Yes. To get into the 5s, we need a more robust recovery in rents, which we'll get, but it will take a while for it to roll over through the rents. So I think we'll get there, but it's not going to be primarily because of deleveraging activity. I think if we just look at deleveraging and not a substantial growth in rents, we'll be in the low-6s, and I think we need that last little hump on rents to get into the 5s.","Thomas S. Olinger","And then Michael, on your question about deployment, you're right, we're not going to spend all of the money on our 2013 starts. The midpoint of that's $1.650 billion, but we had $1.155 billion of starts in 2012. And we're going to be spending -- what we haven't spent in '12 we're spending all of that in '13. So the numbers actually are fairly much in line with what I pointed out. So that -- the $1.4 billion I gave you is really the full spend.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Yes, but here's the math I think that you're trying to do. Obviously, we own the land. So when you guys were talking about the yield on incremental investment, you were looking at it at total investment. You got to back out the land. The yield on the incremental investment is much higher and the land is for free. Actually, it's negative in terms of what it costs us.","Thomas S. Olinger","And then Michael, I think your last question was regarding Private Capital and deferred taxes with the contribution. I mean clearly, we've talked about the deferred taxes, the deferred tax liabilities we have in our books, so if that was your question. When you look at the drop, we dropped deferred taxes by about $75 million from Q3 to Q4, and that was largely a result of contributions. So that balance started at about $525 million, it's down to $450-ish million now. We'll drop that number by another $260 million when we transact -- the Norges closes. So that's going to take our number down. It's going to have a 1 in front of it. And so we've really worked it down and the most important thing is, the vast majority, if not almost all that liability, was really moved from a structuring standpoint. So we didn't have to settle that obligation with the relevant taxing authorities in cash. We were able to move that liability through structuring. So and that's really important because that's often a piece people miss from a NAV perspective. They look at the NOI side of the house, but they don't look at the liability that gets moved off the balance sheet. So that's really important for you guys to look at.","Hamid R. Moghadam","And I think there was a question earlier about cap rates in Europe and all that. That in effect is a negotiating item. You can either do the deal at a lower cap rate and incur that deferred tax liability or you can negotiate a deal at the higher cap rate and transfer that liability. So we obviously reported to you the worst possible cap rate number. There's another way we could have shown it to you, which would have shown a much lower cap rate.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel.","Hamid R. Moghadam","John, they got your name right, I thought you'd be there.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Oh, sorry about that. I'm sorry. I had it on mute. I think what you're saying, Tom, in this regard is that you really should look at -- or is another couple hundred million dollars of implicit or explicit proceeds on the Norges deal because the tax liability goes away or does it just get pushed down the block?","Thomas S. Olinger","Well, I think it's one and the same, right? Because when you transfer -- if we transfer that liability to an entity, which we now only hold 50%, 50% of that liability has been relieved.","Hamid R. Moghadam","It's cut in half in nominal dollars, and it's cut into a fraction in present value dollars, given that it's pushed out way into the future.","Thomas S. Olinger","But if you look at just what we completed in between -- in Q4 in Europe, as well as the Norges transaction, that's a drop of over $300 million.","Hamid R. Moghadam","It's like cash.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Maiorana with Wells Fargo.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Tom, I just wanted to follow up on the same-store guidance, the cash number, which it sounds like cash is probably 2.5%, maybe 3%, I think the high end of your GAAP number is what you said. If I look at '13, it looks like you've got some nice tailwinds from a same-store perspective, occupancy should be up year-over-year. You've got rent spreads that are getting better. You've got positive in-place annual rent bumps, and you've got that large free rent portion as it stands in your portfolio today that ought to be little down at least a portion of it during 2013. So maybe sort of plus 2.5% to 3% strikes me as a little bit conservative, especially relative to what I think was a cumulative 25% NOI growth that you guys provided back in September over the next 4 or 5 years. I'm just wondering if you could sort of lay out how '13 shakes out relative to the longer-term expectations of same-store NOI growth over the next few years.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Well, '13 would be, if you take those next 4 years. I mean, just given the nature of how this stuff rolls through the portfolio with expiration of leases, obviously in 2008 and '09, certainly in 2008, you're still rolling off peak rents, and by 2009, you pretty much got to the bottom of the market and every new lease you were doing there was at a pretty low number. So when you roll out 4.5, 5 years forward of that, by '14 it should really pick up. But we roll 15%, 20% of the portfolio in any given year. So even the market -- if the spot rents recover substantially, it still takes a while before it works through the portfolio. But our thesis, if we were doing our investor conference today as opposed to last September, I would tell you our outlook on rents would be stronger than it would have been last September. And the reason for it is that at least for the next month, the cloud on this whole fiscal cliff thing is a little bit more positive. And the tone in Europe is more positive, and we got [indiscernible] economics in Japan. So if you look at those 3 factors alone and China has definitely turned a corner, right? So if you look at those 3 or 4 political factors alone, we would have a more optimistic outlook. But the leases make it a while before it rolls over the portfolio. Let me tie this to guidance because this is really important, and you guys are going to get this, but I just want to state it. If you look at the $0.06 of the onetime tax thing last year, and you look at the $0.08 of dilution of Norges because we weren't even thinking about doing that deal until the very end of 2013 or a deal like that, that's $0.14. If you adjust the guidance by $0.14 to keep it kind of comparable, our earnings growth range at midpoint is 8% in terms of FFO per share growth over last year, and that is with significant deleveraging. I think that's pretty impressive and the primary driver of that is same-store growth. So yes, you're right. We're on that path, and I'm very optimistic about the prospects for our business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","You talked a bit about pricing in Europe for assets. Can you talk a little bit about domestically and where you expect that in '13? And also on the development side, can you talk about where you expect the development margin is for the starts that you're planning in '13?","Michael S. Curless","This is Mike Curless. I'll take the margin question first. What we saw last year, I think you saw margins in the [indiscernible] -- in the 18% range, which we were certainly happy with that. And we've mentioned on the call many times before that our expectations typically are about 10% for build-to-suit and 15% for spec. And a margin of 18% this year would definitely indicate, as Tom mentioned, that we have built-in increased land value within our portfolio. And as you look forward to next year in terms of margins, we have an expectation over time to have a little bit more of a normalization back into that 10% to 15% range as land prices continue to increase over time in terms of their market value. And in terms of pricing with respect to dispositions, given the nature of the product, type and the locations, we would expect similar results next year, but we were happy to have cap rates in the low-7s in terms of our disposition activity when you consider that we're selling older product, tuning up our investment strategy in terms of ending up with more of our assets in the global markets, we're at 85% now, up from 79% since merger. All-in, we think our disposition strategy will be similar to this year, which will really help us tune up our investment strategy.","Hamid R. Moghadam","The only thing I would add to what Mike said is that if you look at that 18% margin, it is -- given the mix of almost 60% build-to-suits, that should have been sort of 12% to 13%. So we have 5 or 6 extra points of margin easily there. And if you kind of look at land as 25% to 30% of the total cost, that tells you that the land bank is 20% undervalued, if I'm doing that math carefully, correctly, 20% to 25%. So that's one way to get too comfortable with the fact that actually I think there is NAV upside in the land bank, and I think with increasing rents that, that spread gets bigger over time, but of course, we're always buying new land and the spread on the new parcels of land will be lower.","So anyway, wanted to thank everybody for joining our call, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.

[Operator Instructions].","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Tracy Ward, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.","Tracy Ward","Thank you, Melissa. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2012 conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. This morning, we'll hear from Hamid Moghadam, co-CEO and Chairman, who will provide an update relative to the company's priorities and will share the company's view of the operating environment. He will then turn it over to Bill Sullivan, CFO, to cover results and guidance. Additionally, we are joined by members of our executive team, including Walt Rakowich, Gary Anderson, Mike Curless, Nancy Hemenway, Guy Jaquier, Ed Nekritz, Tom Olinger and Gene Reilly.

And in accordance with Reg G, we've provided a reconciliation to those measures. [Operator Instructions] ","Hamid, will you please begin?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Thanks, Tracy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2012 earnings call. This morning I'll provide an update on our key priorities and share our views of the operating environment. Our results exceeded our expectations. It's shaping up to be a very good year for us with strong momentum across all of our business lines and solid execution on our 4 key priorities. We've made excellent progress on strengthening our financial position, as well as aligning our portfolio with our investment strategy. We are now 3 calendar quarters into our 10-quarter post-merger strategic plan, and we generated $1.4 billion from our net disposition contribution and deployment activities. This amount is about $650 million or 45% ahead of our 10-quarter plan to date. As a result of this realignment activity, we've been able to increase our share of assets in global markets from 79% to 84% and reduced our assets in other or exit markets from 8% to 6%. These trends will continue as we execute the balance of our 10-quarter plan. ","We've been somewhat below plan in capital deployment, but we expect development volume to pick up in the coming quarters due to lack of supply of Class A facilities, which I'll address in a moment. Interestingly, we're once again seeing opportunities to utilize our platform for value-added conversions. During the quarter, we completed one such transaction in Silicon Valley, generating an economic gain of more than $23 million or 38% higher than the value of the property as an industrial asset. ","Turning to Private Capital, I'd like use this opportunity to give you an update on our Japan operations as well as our Private Capital initiatives there. I spent last week in Japan, and my time with the team further reinforced my assessment of the quality and scale of opportunities that we have before us in that market. We're having great success leasing our development projects in Japan, often prior to the completion of construction. You recently saw our press release on a million-square-foot development project in Tokyo that was fully leased before we broke ground. We expect to have more news of this nature to share with you in the coming weeks and months. ","At the same time, vacancies for modern [ph] logistic facilities in Tokyo and Osaka have fallen below 5% and rents are moving up. Our operating assets in Japan represent the highest quality product in the market and actually within our entire portfolio. With cash yields in the mid-5% range and long-term financing costs under 2%, Japan offers the highest cash spreads among all of our global markets, and local investors appear eager to allocate capital to real estate in this yield starved environment. We've seen strong Japanese fund flows into the U.S. REITs as well as J-REITs, the latter causing a narrowing of the gap between J-REIT share prices and their underlying NAVs. As a result, we are reassessing our fund-formation strategy for Japan. We're now upsizing our development fund to be formed later this year. We're receiving strong interest from our large global investors and are substantially oversubscribed in this fund. ","At the same time, we're taking another look at that J-REIT market as an alternative to the private open-end fund as the future vehicle for long-term ownership of operating assets in Japan. While we've not yet chosen this as our preferred structure, we think it is only prudent to see if the J-REIT market offers a better alternative for our company. It will take some time for us to explore this alternative fully. ","In the meantime, the capital markets are now offering us the opportunity to mitigate our yen FX exposure by swapping some of our existing U.S. debt into yen-denominated obligations. This strategy has the added advantage of reducing the associated interest cost by more than 150 basis points a year. This review process will surely delay the formation of our Japan ownership vehicle, but we're confident that we'll meet our 10-quarter deleveraging plan by executing on a number of other initiatives in Europe and Americas. ","Turning now to our fourth priority, we make great progress on improving the utilization of our assets. Our leasing teams continue to deliver excellent results across the board. Leasing activity was stronger than expected, a very positive sign in the first quarter, which is usually a soft leasing quarter. And notably, rent change on rollover was strongest it's been for many years. ","For the first time in 4 years, market rents have surpassed our in-place rents. While there will be some volatility in this metric over the next couple of quarters, this improvement occurred earlier than our earlier forecast. We expect the going-forward trend to be similarly positive. ","Additionally, our land bank decreased by about $50 million driven by the monetization of land into new development projects. ","Let me now offer a few observations on the economic trends we monitor most closely. Global trade volumes remained well above peak and the current IMS forecast indicates additional growth in global trade of 4% this year and 5.6% next year. Relative to consumption, retail sales remained strong, and container volumes are also above peak levels. This is prevalent throughout the Americas and Asia, with Brazil and China taking the lead. ","Inventories remained a key demand driver for industrial real estate in the U.S. During the quarter, real inventories grew in excess of our internal forecast at a 4% annualized rate, causing the real inventory-to-sales ratio to move slightly off its record low. The growth in consumption and rebuilding of inventories is translating into further improvements in the operating environment. ","Net absorption in the U.S. was positive for the seventh consecutive quarter at 25 million square feet. We continue to forecast absorption at a healthy 160 million square feet for 2012, up 1\/3 from last year. This improvement in absorption, combined with continued record low new construction volumes, is driving the increases in rental rate in many of the global markets where Class A is scarce. While some European markets continue to lag the U.S., our teams continue to deliver strong results as occupancy increased by 50 basis points from the fourth quarter. Bear in mind that the vast majority of our European portfolio is located in the U.K. and Northern Europe, France and Poland, which continue to perform well on a relative basis. ","Our customers, particularly in the U.S., are increasingly optimistic. ","To sum up, we're making great progress on our priorities. Our markets in the Americas, China and especially Japan will provide strong growth prospects for us over the next 18 to 24 months. While there are macroeconomic headwinds in Europe, our team there has done an outstanding job of leasing space at good rates in an uncertain economic environment. ","Before handing the call over to Bill, I'd like to say a few words about his substantial contributions to Prologis over the last 5 years. As you know, Sully is retiring from the company and this will be his last call with us. Sully has been the key leader on Prologis' executive team and a fixture on these calls since April 2007. The world has changed dramatically over this period, and Prologis has come a long way since as a company. One important constant throughout this period has been Sully's unwavering commitment to our shareholders, and we owe many thanks for his tireless efforts on behalf of the company. Walt and I truly believe that Prologis would not be where it is today had it not been for Bill Sullivan's incredible leadership and dedication to our company. Sully's leadership, business acumen, integrity and laser-like focus on always getting it right have proved invaluable to Walt and me, the executive team and to the company. Bill's decision to retire earlier than the original plan is a testament to how quickly the 2 companies have come together. He's ready to move forward knowing that his work at Prologis is complete, his efforts are appreciated and his legacy of excellence is admired by all his colleagues in and out of the company. We all wish him the very best for the future, and we'll certainly miss his camaraderie and wonderful sense of humor. ","With that, let me turn the call over to Bill.","William E. Sullivan","Thanks for those kind words, Hamid. I'm not worthy. This morning, I plan to cover 3 aspects of the company's financial position and strategy: First, the summary of our Q1 results; second, an overview of our capital markets activity; and third, an update on our guidance for the year. ","Let's start with our Q1 results. For the first quarter 2012, we generated core FFO of $0.40 per share, which modestly exceeded our internal forecast. The outperformance was principally due to higher-than-expected net operating income across our portfolio. Typically, you see a material decline in occupancy in the first quarter of the year. The slight increase experienced this quarter, combined with a slight roll down in same-store rents, contributed to higher-than-expected rental income. Additionally, the mild winter minimized seasonal operating expenses, although we also had a corresponding decline in reimbursable revenue and therefore, the drop in operating cost has a minimal impact on NOI. ","Offsetting the operating performance was a quarter-over-quarter increase of approximately $9 million in net G&A. Only $3 million of which is recurring. Slightly over $4 million of this increase is seasonal to the quarter, approximately $3 million related to new compensation programs and approximately $2 million related to mark-to-market adjustments on existing compensation plans given the increase in our stock price over the quarter. ","Diving deeper into the operating portfolio. All regions contributed to the strong leasing volume, and, in total, we leased about 31 million square feet during the quarter. In spite of the economic headwinds, Europe generated another solid quarter of leasing, posting a 50 basis point increase in occupancy from the fourth quarter. Rent change on rollover decreased a modest 1.1%, the lowest rent rolled down we have seen in over 3 years. The solid occupancy gains year-over-year, combined with the modest rent roll-downs, culminated in an increase in same-store NOI of 1.7%. ","Turning to dispositions and contributions. During the quarter, we completed $994 million in land and building dispositions and contributions. Our share of the proceeds was $762 million. The building dispo's and contro's were priced at a weighted average stabilized cap rate of 7.2%, which was modestly better than our expectations, demonstrating that demand remained strong for high-quality industrial real estate even in secondary markets. $13.5 million of these proceeds were from land dispositions and we also monetized about $50 million in land that was put to work in new developments. ","On the capital deployment front. During the first quarter, we committed approximately $322 million of capital, of which, approximately $244 million was Prologis' share. Total deployment included $211 million of development starts, $71 million of building acquisitions and $40 million of land acquisitions and infrastructure spend. From a fund rationalization perspective, we had a very productive quarter. We bought out our partner's 63% interest in NA2 and now own 100% of this $1.6 billion portfolio. As we talked about on our fourth quarter call, this purchase is modestly accretive to FFO but dilutive relative to our debt metrics. We concluded and dissolved P Cal [Prologis California] fund, dividing the portfolio equally with our partner, bringing our 50% share of the fund's $1 billion of real estate directly onto the balance sheet. And we disposed the 11 of the 12 assets held in Fund 11 and expect to wind up this fund later this year. During the quarter, we also raised $128 million of third-party equity for Prologis' targeted U.S. Logistics Fund. ","Turning now to capital markets. During the quarter, we completed more than $1.3 billion of debt financings and refinancings, with approximately $1 billion related to the REIT and $296 million on behalf of our property funds. Notable transactions for the REIT include a $642 million multicurrency senior term loan and an all-in drawn margin of 150 basis points over LIBOR, that is extendable at our option through 2017, and $372 million in TMK bond financings with a weighted average term of 5 years and a weighted average rate of 1.05%. Both of these financings were beneficial from a natural currency hedging perspective. Importantly, we have paid down $1.4 billion of debt on a look-through basis since the second quarter of 2011. We remain highly focused on delevering the balance sheet, enhancing our unencumbered asset pool and expect to make significant progress on improving our leverage and debt metrics over the course of 2012 and '13. ","Notably, already in Q2, we have paid off $449 million of our 2.25% convertible notes and repaid $59 million of senior unsecured notes at maturity. ","Now I'm turning to guidance for 2012. We are maintaining our full year core FFO forecast of $1.60 to $1.70 per share. As a reminder, our core FFO excludes any gains or losses from real estate transactions, as well as any impairment charges and merger integration cost. From an operating perspective, we are modestly increasing same-store NOI guidance for the year to 1% to 2% positive, based on the strength of the first quarter occupancy and better-than-expected rent roll-downs. We continue to expect occupancy to trend higher reaching 92.5% to 93.5% by the end of 2012. And while we still expect to see net effective rent growth in select markets, rent change on rollovers is expected to be more negative in Q1 given leases rolling down from prior cycle peaks. However, we continue to believe we are nearing the end of this roll-down cycle. ","On the expense side, we now expect net G&A to total $208 million to $213 million for the year, given the marked-to-market on the comp plans we saw in Q1 as well as expected increases to professional fees associated with fund activities and systems implementation. ","On the capital deployment front, we are maintaining our full year forecast of $1.5 billion to $2 billion, about 60% of which will be our overall share of total expected investment. The vast majority is targeted for the second half of the year and includes $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion of development starts primarily outside the U.S. and $400 million to $600 million of acquisitions, mostly in funds in the Americas and Europe. ","Finally, we continue to expect contributions and dispositions in 2012 to total $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion with a potentially larger emphasis on dispo's and contro's in the Americas and less in Japan. Net of our co-investment in the fund activity, we expect Prologis' share of the proceeds to be approximately 75%. ","Before closing, I will provide you with a quick update on our systems integration. Consistent with our plan, we completed the first of 3 milestones and are well on our way to creating a world-class information management platform. The new Yardi 7.0 system, implemented effective April 1, harmonizes our operating data and allows for the entire company to be on one instance of Yardi. It eliminates manual reconciliation. And our access to global operating property info on a realtime basis is fabulous. Finally, our field teams are ecstatic with the usability of the new system. This is a real home run. ","In closing, we feel great about where we are and where we're going. With the heavy lifting associated with the merger and the first major step of the systems integration behind us, I feel it is an appropriate time for me to step aside and to focus on the next phase of my career aspirations. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time here working with the analyst community and working for our investors. Most importantly, working with the incredibly talented group of professionals at Prologis has been a highlight of my career. I'll leave soon, confident that Tom will do a fabulous job as the new CFO, and I wish Tom and the company all the best going forward. ","At this point, I will turn the call back to the operator to open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It's Ross Nussbaum. A question on Japan. Can you walk through maybe the pros and cons of what you see behind pursuing a J-REIT versus an open-end fund? And does the timing and decision to do that depend on what GLP does and how the market reacts to their potential offering?","Hamid R. Moghadam","The answer to the latter part is no, because we don't really plan our own strategies around other people's timing, which we don't control. The answer to the first part is that we don't know just yet. We are actually pursuing both avenues right now, and we were basically exclusively following the open-end fund format up until, I would say, a couple of weeks ago. But given the substantial interest and the narrowing spreads to NAV, the J-REITs are becoming just much more compelling, and of course the decision is not just an instantaneous decision, because those factors change. But if, in fact, the J-REIT market proves to be deeper than it's been, and we think there is a real need for a substantial company in this sector to be active in it, it may prove to be the better alternative. So I guess the most straightforward answer I can give you is that we're studying the 2 alternatives very carefully, next to each other, and we'll make a decision in good time. It is a pretty significant and permanent decision because it has long-term implications and we need to be thoughtful about making it. In the meantime, the real capital need of the company is in the development area because it's really going gangbusters. And so that one, we're going to go ahead and just get that one done, because the opportunities there are really proving to be larger and more profitable than we thought because of the rent cycle.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm here with Jamie Feldman. I guess, Hamid, if we could just focus a little bit on the ISM report today, definitely better results than what our economists were expecting. But they continue to call for or warn about the pending fiscal cliff in January. Can you just tie together, I guess, what you're thinking these days when you saw these results and the conversations you're having with your customer?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Okay. Let me answer that question and maybe even a broader question, which is that you guys know that we exceeded our expectations in the first quarter, and we weren't stepping on the scale in any way. I mean, it clearly, the first quarter is always a slower quarter. A lot of the month-to-month leases go away and, in the last 3 years, the first quarter has been pretty soft. That didn't happen this quarter, that's why we beat, by a couple of cents, our own internal estimates. But we had healthy debate internally about guidance and whether we should move guidance up or keep it where it is. And we decided to keep it where it is not because for the lack of confidence in our business. In fact, it looks terrific right now. But we've seen this movie before. In fact, we've seen the movie and the sequel and now we're looking at the third one. In '10 and '11 the market went soft on us in May, June. And we do have the fiscal cliff at the end of the year. I personally have no confidence in our politicians to get it right and it could happen again. So I'm not the best guy to address the fiscal cliff issue but I'm just telling you that all signals today from our business and our customers are fabulous, okay? Better than expectations. Even in Europe, better than expectations. By the way, I wouldn't add fabulous to Europe, I would just say better than our expectations and good, but fabulous everywhere else. But who knows? I mean, this could go soft on us again and you guys are better positioned and your economist is in probably better position to answer the question than we are around this table. But from our perspective, things look really good.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan from Morgan Stanley.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","On the value-added conversions, you mentioned the one that you monetized in the last quarter. I mean that was a big initiative several years back and now clearly, at least in the Bay Areas, there's a healthy bid for land and development of other property types. I mean, is this something that we could see pick up over the course of the year, or are you actively trying to harvest more sites right now?","Eugene F. Reilly","Paul, this is Gene, let me take that. And Hamid might have some comments. But these things will tend to be episodic. We are pursuing a number of smaller, value-added transactions. Some are value-added acquisitions. In Phoenix, we have a couple of those that we've had vacant, had leased up. You'll see us sell those in the upcoming quarters. In terms of value-added conversion activity, we think we're moving into a market cycle where that activity will pick up dramatically. This is an opportunistic transaction we've talked about. Don't expect to see one of these every quarter. But we're certainly moving into a part of the cycle where these are beginning to make a lot more sense again.","Hamid R. Moghadam","And the only thing I would add is when we rolled out the strategy actually in '07, which now seems like ancient history, we actually said that going to be about $30 million a year, and guess what? It's been about $30 million a year. I think in the combined company, it's going to go up. And I do think Silicon Valley is on fire. These opportunities really come up in only a couple of markets. They don't happen in the less infield markets but certainly happen in Southern California in Silicon Valley and places like that. And based on what I'm seeing in Silicon Valley, that a lot of it is going to happen right there, in the Bay Area, given all the activity that's going on, I mean, social media and the other sectors. So yes, I think we're entering the sweet spot of the cycle. But I just want to remind everybody, we actually have delivered at about what we said we would back in '07, and we certainly didn't anticipate the great, whatever you want to call it, '08 to '10.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Steve Sakwa with ISI Group.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Hamid and Bill, I just want to make sure I understand kind of the math as it relates to the deleveraging and the contributions in sales as your kind of roll out for the balance of the year. So if I heard you correctly, $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion of contributions, of which your share is 75%. Can you just help us think about sort of how that progresses throughout the year? And then secondly, what, I guess, would be outright asset sales on top of that, or is that number embedded inside of that number?","William E. Sullivan","Steve, the building and land asset sales are embedded inside the number, and so total for the year and what we're targeting is the $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion, and we've done $1 billion so far this year. And our share of that first $1 billion was a little over 75%. And so as we look to the rest of the year, we're clearly focused on getting the Japan development fund done, which will add a couple hundred million dollars to that number. In Europe, we have sizable contributions targeted for the second half of the year, and we've got 3 active funds there that are acquiring right now in PEP II, Patel [ph] and our Allianz fund. And then in the U.S., Mexico and Brazil, we have a healthy pipeline of dispositions of assets and contributions, particularly in Mexico. And then it is likely that we will do one decent-sized fund on the order of $400 million to $500 million in the Americas between now and the end of the year. And so when you sort of add it all up, it's probably -- of the $4 billion that's left at the midpoint of that guidance, you could probably see something on the order of $2 billion coming out of Europe, a couple hundred million out of Asia and then the remainder out of the Americas.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Yes, and the only thing I would add to Bill's commentary is that we're really focused on this 10-quarter plan and, as you remember, we didn't actually really provide the detailed quarter-by-quarter numbers of that, because, frankly, when you do, then people get locked into that, and we are not that precise in terms of timing things. And we're certainly not going to do anything stupid to meet an arbitrary timetables. So really what we're trying to do is get to a certain balance sheet by 2013. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're actually way ahead in terms of the start we've gotten. We're also spending money, by the way, a little bit less, not as fast as we thought. Now I think some of that will catch up on the build-to-suits that we're doing, but net-net-net we continue to be committed to the balance sheet parameters that we talked about, and I think we're very much on track for getting it done by 2013.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc.","Craig Mailman - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","It's Craig Mailman here with Jordan. Maybe could you just give more color on your comments regarding market rents versus the in-place rents to the portfolio. In what market are you guys seeing the biggest spreads between the 2?","Eugene F. Reilly","It's Gene. Let me just take that and I'll probably kick it to Gary for some color. But, I mean, if you look at across our portfolio, as Hamid mentioned, we think we've passed the really key threshold. We're in positive territory. And if you break it down a little bit, in the Americas markets, we're kind of right on top of that number. And frankly one of the markets that we are -- we have sort of the highest rents as compared to market, happens to be Los Angeles. And that also happens to be the, by far, the fastest rent growing market in the U.S. So that will turn on pretty quickly, and obviously it really has turned on a lot in the last 6 months. So that tends to move the needle a lot. In the Americas, in Brazil, we don't have this huge portfolio, but we're actually way below market rents, because they're accelerating quickly. Mexico, I'd say, we're probably right on top of it. I'll kick it to Gary for...","Gary A. Anderson","And in Europe, I think, again, we're right on top of the marked-to-market right at our portfolio rent level. Like Gene said in the Americas, for us, it's really the global markets that are driving rent change over time, markets like Hamburg and Paris like we've talked about in the past. In Asia, Japan is under rented today, so we're seeing rental increases in Asia, but the marked-to-market is certainly under 100%. And in China, it's well under 100%. So we're seeing pretty significant rent growth in those markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from Macquarie.","Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie Research","If I could squeeze in 2 quick questions. One, if you pursued a J-REIT strategy, would that be externally managed by PLD or internally managed? And second question, given the positive momentum we've had for several consecutive quarters in the industrial sector, and given that you have a $3 billion land bank that has been written down by $1 billion, most of it during the depth of the recession, I'm not sure how to ask this question, but how would you view your land bank, and if you could mark it to market based on the strong operating fundamentals you've seen, how would that look like and how would you describe your land bank today?","Hamid R. Moghadam","You answer the first, I'll answer...","Unknown Executive","Let me -- just from a J-REIT market, Ki, the J-REITs, by definition, are externally advised, and so there's a separate management company that if we pursued the J-REIT concept, we would intend to control and own that management company. But by definition, in Japan, the J-REITs have to be externally advised.","Hamid R. Moghadam","And to the question on land bank, I think, it's an excellent question. And one that we think about a lot. If you want to answer that question by looking at actually land comps that are trading, you'll have a very limited answer, because there aren't that many comps in terms of land trading in the U.S. or, frankly, anywhere else. Japan, there's a fair amount, because there's active development, but other than that there's not a lot of data points out there. But if you plug in sort of some of the rents that we're achieving in the better performing markets like L.A. and Miami and DC and places like that, Houston, and you crank through construction cost and you back into a land residuals, certainly we're at a place where the impaired values of land are way below what those land residuals are. Now nobody has started buying land on that basis yet, but I think they will. And I think, probably, the best answer to your question is a general one, which I think land is going to go -- it's what I said a couple of quarters ago, I think land is going to go from being something that everybody struggles with and there's a race between much you can haircut existing book value to one, that's going to be a source of tremendous growth an opportunity for our company and our customers going forward. So I think people's attitudes about land are going to change substantially.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Hamid, I just want to come back to this exploration of J-REIT and effectively using a public company over there. As you think about the struggles that Prologis had with PEPR and you think about some of the other externally advised structures that were in Australia, Japan and other places. I mean why go down the road of having a listed entity versus what is your strong suit in terms of open-end funds and your fund investors in the Private Capital business where you have this long history with and just sort of go down the road, they're willing to pay the values that you want today to start the fund and you can accelerate your deleveraging goals and sort of get to this balance sheet that you want quicker rather than delay it potentially to the end of the year, because just as you said, who knows what could happen with fiscal things and you sort of have the bird in the hand right now. Why not just grab it with all the complexities and issues that may go around of having a public entity?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Okay. The question is the bird in the hand versus the one that's an unknown, and the answer is that the open-end fund is also not without its risks. For one thing, the open-end fund is going to be the first of its kind in Japan. And our timing on that, we've pushed back prior to this decision to look at the J-REIT alternative to the third quarter. We, in fact, have a book of business that I will let Guy talk about on the open-end fund, which makes it an extremely viable alternative for us, probably a quarter or 2 delayed. But very much there as a good solid alternative for us to benchmark the J-REIT alternative against. But we would be imprudent if we didn't look at that opportunity, and we're well aware of the challenges of an externally advised structure. But the good news in Japan is that, that's only available structure. So we're not doing anything weird or different. The idea of having a third-party advisor run these assets is actually the way J-REITs, as you know, are set up in Japan. So it's not, for lack of a better term, it's not a PEPR-type problem, where investors prefer really an internally managed structure with its own management because that option is not available. So I think it's a really different kettle of fish altogether from the PEPR-type project structures that are, I would agree with you, problematic. So to summarize, we have not made a decision. We have to evaluate the opportunity to its full extent. And when we do, we'll figure out, which one is the best for our company and our shareholders and that's the one we'll pursue. Guy, do you want to talk a little bit about the open-end fund.","Guy F. Jaquier","Sure. Relative to open-end fund, I mean, we are targeting $750 million of third-party equity for that. Today we have something over $1 billion worth of prospects in various forms of analysis, due diligence, approval. Some of those are extended processes people go through, but we found that when we get these prospects to Japan to look at our properties people, to meet our people, it's a strong story, and that's a story that we've got the best team on the ground. There's nobody else that has 100 or so local people who can develop lease, own and operate. The properties we have for our seed portfolio about $2.5 billion or more worth of properties. I mean these are our newest. I mean, these our newest and best, they've been completed in this last cycle, and they show really, really well. So we're not going to stop what we're doing on the open-end fund. We're going to do these 2 in parallel, so that we can find out what is the best option for Prologis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sri Nagarajan from Cantor Fitzgerald.","Srikanth Nagarajan - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Just wanted to follow up on Hamid's comment on Japan open fund timeline being a little delayed, if you can just outline or give us some color on the delay there. And as well as a quick follow-up on the capital deployment. I mean you had guided about $770 million to $980 million in developments charge and could we fairly assume right now, given the state of the world economy, that most of this would be Japan-centric?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Mike will talk about the development volume. I think with respect to the open-end fund, you heard my answer and Guy's answer, so I'm not sure what else we have to add there. But originally, we produced documents for the Japan fund at the end of 2011. That's when we put the private placement memorandum together. The average time of formation of a fund today, and actually there was an article about this in one of the magazines that goes around, is about 18 months. So we had a very ambitious plan together, and we still have a very ambitious plan together even within the timetable that we're talking about. So we're talking about third or fourth quarter with that proceeding. So yes, it's a quarter behind, but that's not unusual in this environment, and we feel pretty good about that. It's just that I don't want to do something to get a quarter or 2 and meet an artificial timetable if it's not the best thing to do. So we're going to resist that, but you've already heard me say that. Mike, you want to talk about development...","Michael S. Curless","Sure. Let's talk a little bit about the mix of the pipeline for the year. We did get out, certainly, a fast start in the first quarter with $211 million of starts, and Japan was $163 million of that start. But overall, across the year, we envisioned the development pie looked something more like 40% in the Americas; 45% in Asia, heavily driven by Japan; and call it, 15% in Europe, and compared to our mix from last year, that would be 10 points higher in the Americas, about the same in Asia and 10 points lower in Europe, which feels pretty good relative to all of the factors in play. In terms of mix, 93% of that activity we had in the first quarter was build-to-suit. So we expect to see our build-to-suit percentage to be a good 15, 20 points higher than we saw last year. We have to see this number in approximately the 40s for this year in terms of build-to-suit percentage, given the fact that our pipelines are much more robust in the United States and Japan in terms of build-to-suit. So that gives you a little flavor for geography and mix on the development pipeline.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers from our RBC Capital Markets.","David Rodgers - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes. Hamid, when I listened to your comments about the health of global trade or some of the forecast that you provided early on in your comments about U.S. land and the appreciation that you kind of expect to see there. Wondering along the same lines of the spec development comment that you just made is that, at what point do you feel comfortable really ramping up U.S. development? It seems like yield are coming back, market rents appreciating. Getting a sense for, is the hurdle for you guys more a balance sheet issue, where you'd like to monetize more the fund assets you brought on board, or is it a fundamental issue, and I guess the hurdles to get over that to really accelerate that U.S. spec pipeline?","Hamid R. Moghadam","It's absolutely not balance sheet, and by way of reminder, we are already a doing a couple of spec buildings in the U.S.; Houston, we did one; Miami; LA; Washington. We've got a big problem. We start to do spec buildings and they turn into build-to-suits. So I guess it's kind of a high class problem. They're leasing up a pretty quickly. So that's why they show up as maybe build-to-suits that are pre-leased, but I'm not really exaggerating. We've been doing this for some time and we'll continue to do it in a prudent way. But volume-driven development gets companies into trouble. We've seen that movie before, and we're going to be careful with development and the land is not going anywhere. It's sitting right there and it's very well located. And I think cap rates -- put it this way, cap rates I don't see going up anytime soon. And I'm pretty sure rents are going up, so whatever margin we have in them is going to improve as we prudently execute our plan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Maiorana from Wells Fargo.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So just to follow up on that, Hamid. I think the margin, the value creation margin, on the development starts in the quarter was around 26%, is that sort of a fair level that you guys think is appropriate throughout the region, if you exclude Japan and you look at Europe and the Americas? And if so, does that indicate that you think you're likely to accelerate the development just given that capital deployment level seem to be in line with what the expectations were a couple of months ago when you guys initially gave guidance?","Michael S. Curless","This is Mike. I'll take that one. In terms of the margin we saw in the first quarter, it was a higher margin than expect to be than our overall average, largely driven by the fact that activity took place in Japan and Brazil. And I would say, for the remainder of the year, we certainly expect our blended margins to normalize somewhat and be much more in our typical range, for example, we would fully expect all of our build-to-suits in U.S. and Europe to be in the margins in the 10-plus range and speculative construction would be in the mid-teens and\/or higher. So over the entire year, we would expect more of a normalization, more of a blend that would translate to normalized margin we've seen in the past, slightly higher perhaps but in the mid-teens approaching 20s, on average.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Guinee from Stifel.","John W. Guinee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Going back to the more mundane, Hamid, it looks to me like your re-leasing cost have been running about $1.35 to $1.40 for a while now. It went down to about $1.14 for this last quarter. About the same time you also showed an improvement in your rent roll-downs. Is there anything unusual going on here in terms of shorter lease term, more deals done in-house, that sort of thing that would cause this rather significant change?","Eugene F. Reilly","Yes, this is Gene. Let me take that question. It does have to do with shorter lease terms, and I would not expect the turnover cost to stay at $1.14 -- $1.30, $1.35 is a number that would be more sustainable. We did have a drop-off in lease term over the quarter, and we have high retention rate, and both of those things will tend to push down those costs. But I would not expect that to be a trend. In fact, the trend in terms of tenant demand is increasing comfort with longer lease terms. This really just had to do with the mix of deals we did in the quarter, and we had a couple of very large, very short-term renewals that were related to big customers with 3 or 4 moving pieces. So I would expect this to sort of go back to the trends that you've seen in the last couple of quarters.","Hamid R. Moghadam","And we're not trying to do more deals in house or anything like that, in fact, we have expanded our use of the brokerage network and we have more of an open listing kind of approach because we think that's the right way of doing that going forward, so we're not trying to save on commissions.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of John Stewart from Green Street Advisor.","John Stewart - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Maybe one quick one for Hamid, if I may. How much better ballpark in terms of execution would you require to go to make the JV route worthwhile as opposed to an open-end fund? And then quickly for maybe either Bill or Tom, if you look at the net asset value detail on Page 28 and you zeroed on in the deferred income tax liability, the $620 million there. Can you remind us how much of that is related to PEPR, and then, hypothetically, if we were to assume that the end game is to sell off an 80% interest in PEPR, what would be both the accounting and economic ramifications?","Hamid R. Moghadam","Okay, John, let me answer the question. I don't think we will be sitting there side-by-side and looking at, okay, we're going to get 2% more out of one execution versus the other, so let's do that one. I don't think it's that kind of math. I think it's going to be an assessment of the long-term sustainability of each program. And whether than a natural, local investor base that likes to be uninvested and not have a currency issue, if you will, on a long dated asset, whether that is more sustainable, if you will, structure with more capacity because really our development business, as I said a couple of times, is ending up being a much bigger opportunity post-earthquake and tsunami than we thought. And so our capacity needs are going to go up because of the development pipeline being bigger, so it's really, which is a more sustainable and larger capacity pipe, because I think at the end of the day, the pricing is going to be pretty similar. Otherwise, we wouldn't do it. So it's on all the other intangibles that are going to drive the decision. Go ahead, Bill.","William E. Sullivan","Let me just add relative to the deferred taxes. I don't have the exact numbers in front of me, but on the $600-plus million, I'd say about 2\/3 of it is related to PEPR. And ultimately PEPR, the vast majority of the PEPR assets are long-term -- high-quality long-term hold assets, and so any realization of that deferred income tax is a function of how we contribute and\/or sell the assets, whether you sell assets directly or into these and the discussion on the net present value of that income tax liability. So we don't envision a substantial realization of that in the near future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller from JPMorgan.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","On the disposition guidance, the $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion is the same as what it was last quarter. Considering that you've taken Japan largely out of the mix, I know you gave us a breakdown of where you expect the dispositions to come from, but what changed relative to last quarter in terms of those other regions? Where did you pick up the slack from?","William E. Sullivan","I think we're slightly more focused on the Americas in terms of, again, getting out of some of the exit markets that we've identified as well as creating a fund within the Americas with some high-quality assets. It took a lot of assets on the balance sheet in the second -- in first quarter, and we have a fabulous portfolio of Canadian assets. And so the opportunities to create some fund vehicles, one or more, have gone up. And so that basically takes up the slack.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Seriously, here's the way I think about it, conceptually, and maybe it's helpful to you guys. The U.S., the 2 companies before merging had been in the U.S. the longest. A pretty substantial part of the portfolio was acquired, not developed. Some of these assets were in other exit markets or in regional markets that we're trying to down weight. So really the opportunity to sell assets in the U.S. is primarily strategic, because we're trying -- the biggest realignment opportunity anywhere in our universe is in the U.S., because that's probably, when we started, the biggest mismatch between the assets we want to hold in the long-term and the total assets that we have, the difference being salable properties. In Europe and in Japan, where the other 2 big concentrations are, those are essentially, by and large, developed assets very, very high quality, much higher fit between the totality of those assets and where we want to be strategically. So the realignment opportunities there are actually smaller than they are in the U.S. And that's more of a fund-formation type of balance sheet activity as opposed to selling to align with our portfolio. So we're getting very good reception in the U.S. on our asset sales, and so that's where we're going to push more business. And we think it's a very receptive market for selling assets in the U.S. In fact, it is better than the end of last year, and we're going to continue to execute in a prudent way. That's why we don't mind. I think we think assets in Europe that we have are trading at higher cap rates than they'll be trading in a year or 2. So we're not in a big hurry to sell in those markets assets or, frankly, to re-, if you will, contribute those assets immediately, because we think there's upside in the valuation, substantial upside in the valuation. So I think, strategically, the U.S. is where we're trying to point more of the sales and less of it overseas.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan from Morgan Stanley.","Chris Caton - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","It's Chris Caton with Paul. Hamid, I just wanted to follow up on that point, you talked about pricing in Europe. Can you kind of take us between A and B, and how do you see that market trending over the next year given some of the headwinds there from an asset pricing perspective, or from a capital raising perspective on a limited partners side.","Hamid R. Moghadam","I think the capital raising prospects for Europe are pretty good. People realize that Europe is a bargain today, and pretty much the same what happened to the U.S., some markets snapping back in terms of cap rates. And people are viewed -- well there's some people standing around waiting for distressed opportunities in Europe, and I think they'll essentially have the same experience as the people who were standing around distressed opportunities in the U.S. But to answer your question specifically, I think a lot of the valuations in Europe, European -- good quality European markets are in the 7s and those historically would've been in the 6s. And I think they will be the 6s within a reasonable period of time. So I think -- don't get me wrong, we are going to execute on our plan and all that, but on the margin, if we have the marginal million dollar portfolio to sell, we're more likely to sell it in the U.S. because it's closer to what its normalized value is in our view than in Europe. That's all I'm saying. But we're still going to form the funds and do our business the way we planned on it. It's just that there's a bias to not being in a hurry there because we think there's room in the CapEx to come in somewhat. Financing costs in Europe are maybe 50 basis points higher than they are in the U.S., but cap rates are way wider than that for the similar quality property. So it only makes sense that we do what I just described.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman from Bank of America.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Sticking with Europe, can you just give a little bit more color on operating fundamentals there? Kind of how deep is the pool of interested tenants, what your outlook for the rest of the year?","Gary A. Anderson","Sure. Jamie, It's Gary. Maybe I'll start with customer sentiment. I don't think customer sentiment in Europe has changed really for the past 8 quarters. There is cautious optimism, and you know our customers, basically, and have, for the past 2 years, really been really thoughtful about taking that incremental bit of space, but they have been taking that incremental bit of space as you can see in the numbers, 50 basis points this quarter and 280 basis points over the prior 3 quarters. Like last quarter, it's expansionary. They're sitting there basically at very, very high utilization rates, and they have to take that next incremental bit of space, and they're doing it. The key drivers in terms of our customers is still automotive. It's still e-commerce and it's nonfood retail. So again I think is cautious optimism and they're taking space as they actually have the business.","Hamid R. Moghadam","But they're not in a big rush to make decisions, which is exactly where the U.S. was maybe 2 years ago. And that's the difference. The deals are around and they'll take their time, and they got to go to 5 more committees and get 3 more approvals before they pull the trigger.","Gary A. Anderson","That's actually, probably the best comment because I mean, I think if the operating guys in the ground could make a decision for themselves, they would take incremental space, but they're having to kick that decision upstairs to corporate, and that decision process is prolonged.","Hamid R. Moghadam","But if you talk to our team in Europe, they are very -- our conversations go like this, \"Are you sure you guys are sounding as positive, are we hearing you correctly?\" It's really that kind of conversation -- we have a confident, competent team with great assets in Europe, and they're not backing off, and they have delivered, so far, delivered great.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Hamid, with the stock now trading basically at the midpoint of your $35 to $38 NAV range, do you have any desire whatsoever to issue additional common equity, sort of in order to delever, and I understand you said there's no timeline, you sort of want get through the deleveraging through next year, but it does sound, at least, some of the assets, sales and contributions are pushed a little bit further back, as you sort of evaluate the J-REIT stuff and you put more product in the U.S. on the market. So I'm just curious how you think about equity today especially when it's trading basically in line with the NAV, so it's little bit less dilutive relative to the issuance last year.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Michael, I'm holding Sully back because he's trying jump on the table and answer that question, because every time in the past, I've tried to answer that question and I've totally messed it up. So let me have him, since he won't be on this call next quarter. Let me have him...","William E. Sullivan","So Michael, I will answer that question very simply, there's no right answer for that question. If we said yes, people would go crazy. And if we said no, people would go crazy. And so we have made the conscious decision that, that question will not be answered either in investor meetings or on these calls.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Or anywhere.","Operator","Your last question comes from line of Brendan Maiorana from Wells Fargo.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I just have a follow-up with respect to expiring rents. Do you guys think that the expiring rent levels are going to go down on a cash basis as you look out to the balance of 2012 and into 2013 given low rents that were signed at the trough of the markets, in late '09 -- I mean, late '08, '09 and '10, or were those more reflective of sort of the teaser rates and the cash rents that are in place from those low initial rents are now sort of closer to market?","Eugene F. Reilly","It's Gene. Let me take a stab at that. I'm not sure I'm completely understanding your question, but if you focus on what do expect for the remainder of 2012, and I think as Sully mentioned, if you look at the composition of what's rolling, and we look at the vintage years of those leases, we're going to see roll-downs that are more negative than you're seeing this quarter. And it will resume, the overall trend, toward positive rent change probably sometime end of the year, early next year. So hopefully that's responsive to the question, but if we look at the composition of those leases, they'll roll down a little more negative than you saw this quarter.","Hamid R. Moghadam","[indiscernible] fewer and fewer pre-peak leases though to sort of answer that piece of the question and if we're talking about rent change, one thing I would like to add about Europe for example is that, for the first time in 16 quarters, we've had positive rent change in Europe. That's an unbelievable stat. Now you can look at that stat any way, I mean, you can discount it because of mix, you can discount it because of the fact that there are higher percentage of renewals than new leases. But the fact remains that we are getting closer and closer to an inflection point and it's undeniably heading in the right direction.","William E. Sullivan","And just final point, our cash same-store NOI was actually closer to 4% this year, so well above the cap. And so we're starting to see this come through.","Hamid R. Moghadam","Okay. With that, that was last question. So let me just summarize. I think we have a really great first quarter, and I'm hoping that this will continue throughout the rest of 2012. Again, from our perspective, it sure seems that way, but you guys need to make up your own minds about fiscal cliff and the like. But the key takeaways are: Number one, operations around the globe are firing on all cylinders; secondly, we're ahead of our 10-quarter deleveraging plan and realignment plan, and we're confident that we'll meet our objectives in the timeframes that we've indicated them; and finally, the drivers of the business are all heading in the right direction, and we have the properties, the platform and the people in place to get ahead of those trends. Thank you for joining us today, and we'll see many of you at [indiscernible] in a couple of weeks.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.
