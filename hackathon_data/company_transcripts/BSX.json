At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host. Ms. Susan Lisa, please go ahead.","Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Katy. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, President and Chief Executive Officer and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q2 2015 results which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financial Information.","The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Mike will begin our prepared remarks with an update on our business progress and his perspectives on the quarter. Dan will then review our overall Q2 2015 financial results as well as guidance for full-year 2015 and Q3 of 2015. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Keith Dawkins and Dr. Ken Stein.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate, and other similar words. They include among, other things, statements about our growth and market share, new product approvals and launches, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance including sales, margins, earnings and other Q3 and full-year 2015 guidance, as well as our tax rates, R&D spend, and other expenses.","Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause those differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs and 8-Ks filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them.","At this point I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike?","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Susie, and good morning, everyone. In Q2, Boston Scientific posted another strong result as we continued to execute on our long-term commitments. We delivered worldwide operational revenue growth of 6%, 10% adjusted operating income growth and 12% adjusted EPS growth excluding a $0.02 negative impact from foreign exchange. These results reflect the high performance of our global teams, our differentiated portfolio and the diversification of our business.","As detailed in our May Investor Day meeting, our company remains focused on high performance. We aim to drive mid-single digit operational revenue growth and consistent operating margin expansion, which in turn will drive double-digit adjusted EPS growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange.","Dan will detail our commitment to this goal with full-year 2015 adjusted EPS guidance of $0.88 to $0.92, which is unchanged from our original guidance in February. Importantly, we've maintained our EPS guidance despite a $0.06 to $0.07 negative impact from FX versus our original expectation of a $0.04 negative impact. We remain focused on overcoming these FX challenges to deliver against our original adjusted EPS guidance range.","Now I'll provide some highlights on Q2. Dan will review the financials and Q3 guidance and then we'll take your questions. Please note that in my remarks all references to growth are on a year-over-year constant currency basis unless otherwise specified.","Now for a few highlights for the quarter, we delivered broad based global revenue of 6%, on target with our goal for consistent revenue growth as we've now grown revenues 6% or better for four consecutive quarters. This solid and balanced growth is driven by robust execution in our core businesses, strong new product launches, increased traction from our Structural Heart business, continued international expansion and leverage from our acquisitions.","Our MedSurg segment is building momentum and each business accelerated year-over-year revenue growth in Q2 compared to Q1. Endoscopy's year-over-year growth rate improved from 4% in Q1 to 6% in Q2 and this growth is fueled by our new SpyGlass Digital launch and our expanded capabilities in endoscopic ultrasound which is the fast and emerging growing field of minimally invasive procedures.","Neuromodulation revenue accelerated in Q2 growing 9%. This growth was led by continued adoption of our U.S. market-leading Precision Spectra spinal cord stimulation platform, which offers differentiated capabilities via our Illumina 3D neural targeting and CoverEdge 32 contact paddle.","Importantly, we are now entering the primary cell non-rechargeable market in Europe with the launch of Precision Novi. With the Novi technology, we have leveraged the unique and flexible capabilities of the Spectra platform. We're really excited about its potential to take share in a sizeable market that is incremental to BSC.","Turning to Urology and Women's Health, we also improved its top line growing 7% in second quarter after a 3% growth in first quarter. The acceleration was driven by a comprehensive portfolio and our ongoing international expansion efforts. We are excited about the pending Q3 closing of the AMS male urology acquisition as we are confident that this deal will further strengthen our category leading global urology franchise.","Switching gears, our Cardiovascular group grew 10% in second quarter, with Interventional Cardiology outpacing our market growth estimate with a 7% increase in sales. Growth was well balanced across our IC franchises and geographic regions.","In DES, the SYNERGY Stent now represents approximately 30% of our European DES sales and it remains on track for year-end 2015 U.S. approval. In SYNERGY, with its unique bio-absorbable polymer coating and thin strut is designed from the ground up to promote healing. And we're excited to bring this premium and differentiated workhorse stent to the U.S. and Japanese market.","Also as evidence of our commitment to offering the broadest IC portfolio, we announced earlier in the week that we have initiated the FAST study of our first fully resorbable drug-eluting scaffold system. FAST is a true second generation fully resorbable scaffold that seeks to address the limitations of the current commercially available devices. We expect to enter CE Mark countries with a second generation FRS device in 2017.","Our PCI Guidance business also continued to deliver strong results and we recently submitted our 510(k) for U.S. clearance of our integrated fractional flow reserve imaging system. We look forward to a limited market release in both the U.S. and Europe in Q4 of this year.","And finally, the IC performance was fueled by our strengthening Structural Heart business, which includes our LOTUS percutaneous aortic valve and WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure device. We believe that we're uniquely positioned for the long-term to assist hospitals and physicians with a growing Structural Heart demand due to the unique capabilities of both WATCHMAN and LOTUS.","LOTUS continues to penetrate the European market, and we're executing on the pipeline that we detailed at Investor Day. Our clinical evidence continues to build and we remain on track to complete enrollment in both our REPRISE III IDE and RESPOND post-approval study by year-end 2015.","The first 100 days of the U.S. WATCHMAN launch have been very successful and we expect to complete rollout of the first 100 accounts by year-end. We're very pleased with the implant success rate and the high quality of patient outcomes thus far, which reflect our controlled rollout and proven training program.","We have a great deal of clinical evidence demonstrating that WATCHMAN can uniquely benefit a large global patient population. And in terms of U.S. reimbursement, we will understand more about the national coverage decision, as well as the new technology add-on payment in the back-half of 2015.","So overall, we're very excited about our progress in Structural Heart and expect to deliver full year 2015 Structural Heart revenue at the high-end of the $75 million to $100 million goal that we provided at our May 1 Investor Day.","In Peripheral Interventions, the core business continues to execute and the integration of the legacy Bayer business is going extremely well. Bayer grew at a double-digit rate in Q2 and we're seeing strong commercial and operational synergies with our Peripheral business.","We're also encouraged with the early results of our commercial partnership with C. R. Bard and the Lutonix drug-coated balloon technology.","Now, I'll provide comments on CRM. On our first quarter earnings call, we projected a slowdown in our worldwide CRM sales for the balance of 2015 due to difficult comparisons, replacement headwinds and competitive launches, particularly in the U.S. Q2 global CRM sales did in fact slow to 1% decline, and we continue to anticipate some softness in U.S. CRM sales through year-end 2015. But it's very important to highlight that our European CRM business delivered mid-single-digit growth for the fifth consecutive quarter.","In Europe, we are estimating we are taking share with a differentiated portfolio, including full CRT-D and CRT-P Quad systems, ACCOLADE 3T MRI safe pacemakers, and our second generation S-ICD EMBLEM.","In addition, our industry-leading EnduraLife battery technology continued to differentiate Boston Scientific and set us apart with multiple new independent and contemporary longevity datasets that were recently presented at HRS. We believe device longevity plays an important role in reducing costly complications associated with replacement procedures and reduces overall healthcare cost.","These European CRM results are encouraging and relevant. As we expect to launch the 4 Quad in the U.S. in early 2016 and we are transitioning into a full launch of EMBLEM S-ICD in the U.S. in Q3. Additionally, we expect to have Ready MRI in the U.S. by year end 2015. So the products driving above market growth in Europe are expected to be available soon in the U.S. as well as Japan.","In EP, we're beginning to build momentum with 9% growth in second quarter led by our differentiated mapping and navigation system. Rhythmia is now accelerating the pace of its global rollout and physician praise of speed, clarity and density of imaging. We're also encouraged by key upcoming launches in EP such as our navigation enabled IntellaNav, Open-Irrigated Ablation Catheter in Europe slated for Q3 2015.","So stepping back to look across all the businesses, our 6% operational revenue growth reflects the strong diversification of our portfolio, our focus on innovation and our ongoing globalization effort. In Q2, U.S., Europe and Asia regions all grew 6% and the emerging markets grew 12% led by 21% revenue growth in China. Importantly, we believe that we are well positioned to sustain our global performance as several key new product launches are early in their rollout.","To highlight a few in Q2, our WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure Device launched in the U.S. SpyGlass Digital began its rollout. Our next generation EMBLEM S-ICD launched in Europe and our primary cell spinal cord stimulation system, Novi, launched in Europe. All of these launches are off to a good start due to the unmet needs they address for patients and the clinical differentiation in the marketplace.","And finally, we continue to execute on our margin expansion goals. On the back of strong adjusted operating margin expansion of 230 basis points versus Q2 2014, we have high visibility on achieving our 25% adjusted operating margin goal in 2017 and continuing improvement beyond 2017.","So overall, we're executing well globally and delivering on our strategic plan commitments. We continue to believe that Boston Scientific is uniquely positioned to deliver consistent, mid-single digit growth and double digit adjusted EPS growth excluding FX. Given our strong pipeline, global expansion opportunities and significant opportunities for margin improvement.","I'd like to thank our employees for their tremendous winning spirit and their commitment to the company.","Now, let me turn the call over to Dan for a detailed review of our financials.","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Mike. I'll start with some overall perspective on the quarter before getting into the details. We generated adjusted EPS of $0.22, achieving the high-end of our guidance range of $0.20 to $0.22 and representing 2% year-over-year growth. Excluding the $0.02 unfavorable foreign exchange impact, Q2 adjusted EPS grew 12% year-over-year. The strong performance in Q2 was driven primarily by operational revenue growth and gross margin expansion.","Our Q2 2015 adjusted operating margin of 22.1% exceeded the high end of our Q2 adjusted operating margin guidance range of 21% to 22% and represents improvement of 230 basis points over Q2 of 2014. This is the second consecutive quarter where total company adjusted operating margin expanded by at least 200 basis points over the prior year quarter, and despite significant FX headwind, our goal for the full year 2015 remains double digit adjusted EPS growth.","Now, I'll provide a detailed review of our Q2 business performance and operating results. Unless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the second quarter of 2014 and all revenue growth rates are given on a year-over-year constant currency basis.","For the second quarter of 2015 consolidated revenue of $1.843 billion represented operational revenue growth of 6%, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange and the divested Neurovascular business. On an as-reported basis, revenue declined 2% year-over-year. Excluding an approximate 170 basis point contribution from the Bayer Interventional acquisition, organic revenue growth was 4% in the quarter. The foreign exchange impact on sales was a $141 million headwind compared to the prior-year period and it was only $1 million worse than we assumed in our Q2 guidance range.","I will now provide more details on the revenue results for our seven businesses which roll up into the three reporting segments. I'll start with MedSurg where the total group sales of $583 million grew 7% and adjusted operating margin was 30.4%. This represents an increase of 20 basis points over Q2 of 2014 and 140 basis points sequentially. Endoscopy sales grew (14:50) 6% worldwide, driven by double-digit growth in biliary, the largest franchise, fueled by SpyGlass DS and the AXIOS Stent System from our recent acquisition of Xlumena. Latin America continued to stand out with growth north of 30%.","Urology and Women's Health posted solid worldwide sales growth of 7%, driven by strong Urology performance in the U.S. and Europe. Pelvic Floor revenue grew low single digits globally against a market that we believe is down slightly. Emerging markets revenue growth was impressive in the quarter, up almost 40%.","To close out the MedSurg results, our worldwide Neuromodulation business posted solid sales growth of 9% and we're encouraged by the early launch of our Precision NOVI primary cell device in Europe, which gives us our first entry into a $200 million plus OUS non-rechargeable market.","Turning now to the Cardiovascular group, which consists of the Interventional Cardiology and Peripheral Interventions divisions, global sales for the group totaled $743 million and grew 10%. Cardiovascular group adjusted operating margin for the quarter of 30.5% represented a 440 basis point improvement year-over-year on strong stent volumes and U.S. WATCHMAN revenue contribution. We expect Cardiovascular segment adjusted operating margin expansion to moderate in the second half of the year primarily due to the timing of clinical spend.","Worldwide interventional Cardiology sales of $515 million grew 7%. Growth in IC was strong across all regions, with the U.S. up 8%, Europe up 5%, and Asia, up 11%. DES sales grew low single digits globally, with Asia's DES revenue growing double digit for the second straight quarter. This was driven by the continued strength of the Promus PREMIER stent in Japan and strong uptake of Promus PREMIER in China. Worldwide complex PCI solutions also grew low single digit led by solid performance in Imaging, particularly in Japan.","Our Structural Heart franchise was the largest contributor to worldwide IC revenue growth in the quarter, and as Mike mentioned, we're comfortable with the high end of our $75 million to $100 million revenue goal for the full year 2015. The strong growth in IC is a combination of the complex PCI and DES businesses growing slightly above market and strong contributions from WATCHMAN and LOTUS. The comps in our IC business become much more challenging in the second half of this year. We remain focused on driving above market growth by providing the interventional cardiologist with the broadest portfolio of technology and differentiated products to treat the most complex coronary cases.","Peripheral Interventions delivered worldwide revenue growth of 16% driven by strong double-digit growth in the acquired Bayer business and 4% growth in the legacy Boston Scientific PI business. The distribution deal with C. R. Bard for their Lutonix Drug Coated Balloon drove pull through of our broader PI portfolio and Interventional Oncology grew mid-single digits on the performance of new product launches and a focus on the interventional radiologist globally.","Turning now to our Rhythm Management group which includes our Electrophysiology and Cardiac Rhythm Management division, worldwide Rhythm Management sales in Q2 of $517 million were flat to Q2 of 2014. Rhythm Management's adjusted operating margin for Q2 of 14.1% represents a 190 basis point improvement year-over-year, the sixth consecutive quarter of Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin improvement of 100 basis points or more versus the prior year.","As a reminder, we expect Rhythm Management's adjusted operating margin expansion to accelerate in the second half of the year given the launch timing and favorable gross margin profile of the EMBLEM S-ICD and ACCOLADE product lines. We believe that we can drive at least 200 basis points of improvement in the second half of 2015 versus the first-half rate of 14.1%, marking significant progress towards our goal of achieving a Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin north of 20% by 2017.","Worldwide Electrophysiology revenue was up 9% with high single-digit growth in both the U.S. and Europe, and we are encouraged by our first-half performance in EP and the capabilities we are building globally.","For the Cardiac Rhythm Management division, Q2 worldwide sales decreased 1%, consistent with expectations given replacement headwinds, difficult comparisons, and competitive launches. On a worldwide basis, defib sales of $335 million grew 1%. U.S. defib revenue declined slightly on replacement headwinds and continued market penetration of CRT-D Quad systems. As Mike mentioned, we're excited to transition to the full U.S. launch of EMBLEM in Q3 and launch our own Quad system in the first half of 2016.","Worldwide pacer sales totaled $125 million and declined 4%. The decline was primarily U.S. driven as we experienced share loss to competitors with MRI safe capabilities. We expect to have our MRI compatible pacemaker approved in the U.S. in Q4 of this year.","As we communicated last quarter, we expect global CRM year over year revenue growth to be relatively flat in the second half of this year. Despite this flat revenue outlook, we expect to deliver significant year over year adjusted operating margin expansion in Rhythm Management.","Turning now to the P&L. Adjusted gross profit margin for the second quarter was 71.3%, up 100 basis points year over year. Gains from our value improvement programs and our FX hedging program positively impacted gross margin by 150 basis points and 100 basis points respectively and this was offset partially by 150 basis points of negative price and mix.","Adjusted SG&A expenses were $688 million or 37.3% of sales in the quarter. Our Q2 2015 adjusted SG&A rate was down 90 basis points from Q2 of last year and we continue to believe our full-year 2015 adjusted SG&A rate will be in the range of 36.5% to 37.5%.","Adjusted research and development expenses were $200 million in the second quarter or 10.9% of sales. This adjusted R&D rate is roughly flat both sequentially and year over year. We still believe our full year adjusted R&D rate will be in the range of 11% to 12% of revenue and are expecting a sequential uptick in R&D spending as a percent of revenue particularly in the Cardiovascular segment.","Royalty expense was $18 million in the quarter or 1% of sales, consistent with our guidance. On an adjusted basis, pre-tax operating income was $408 million in the quarter or 22.1% of sales, up 230 basis points year-over-year and exceeding our Q2 adjusted operating margin guidance of 21% to 22%. Adjusted pre-tax operating income grew 10% driven by a 28% increase in our Cardiovascular segment.","GAAP operating income which includes GAAP to adjusted items of $189 million was $219 million in Q2 2015. The primary GAAP to adjusted items for the quarter included restructuring related charges of $16 million, contingent consideration expense of $19 million, and amortization expense of $116 million. As of June 30, our total legal reserve was $1.117 billion.","Now, I'll move on to other income and expense. During the quarter, we completed an offering of $1.850 billion of senior notes, with an average interest rate of 3.4%, arranged a new bank term loan of $750 million and refinanced a $2 billion revolving credit facility with a new $2 billion revolving facility maturing in 2020.","We used a portion of the net proceeds from the notes offering to redeem $1 billion of outstanding notes due in 2015 and 2016 with an average interest rate of 6.3%. The remaining net proceeds of the notes offering, together with the borrowings under the $750 million term loan, are expected to fund the purchase price for the AMS male urology portfolio.","Interest expense for the quarter was $106 million, which includes a pre-tax charge of approximately $45 million associated with the senior note refinancing. Excluding this charge, our interest expense for the quarter was $61 million, compared to $54 million in Q2 of last year, and the increase was primarily due to a one month period during which we incurred interest on the $1.850 billion of newly issued notes as well as the $1 billion of outstanding notes due in 2015 and 2016 prior to their redemption. Our next bond maturity of $250 million is not due until January 2017.","Other expense was $8 million, and this consisted primarily of foreign exchange losses incurred during the quarter.","Our tax rate for the quarter was 2.9% on a reported basis and 13% on an adjusted basis. Our Q2 adjusted tax rate includes slightly more than $1 million of unfavorable discrete tax items. And we continue to expect our full year 2015 adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 13% to 15%.","Finally, as mentioned, Q2 2015 adjusted EPS of $0.22 includes $0.02 of unfavorable FX and represents 2% year-over-year growth or 12% growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On a reported GAAP basis, Q2 2015 EPS was $0.08 and includes net charges and amortization expense totaling $192 million after tax. GAAP EPS of $0.08 compares to breakeven on a GAAP basis in the prior year period.","Moving on to the balance sheet, DSO of 59 days decreased four days compared to June of 2014 due primarily to strong collections in Europe. Days inventory on-hand of 163 days was up 10 days compared to June of last year, and up seven days compared to December of 2014 due to higher inventory in advance of launches, and lower cost of goods sold driven primarily by standard cost improvements and favorable product mix.","Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $406 million, compared to $262 million in Q2 of last year. This increase was primarily due to higher adjusted operating profit, lower capital expenditures, and a continued focus on working capital management. We continue to expect our full year 2015 adjusted free cash flow to be approximately $1.3 billion.","Capital expenditures were $46 million in Q2 of this year compared to $64 million in Q2 of last year. The decrease is attributable to timing and we still expect CapEx to be roughly $260 million for the full year 2015. There were no share repurchases in the quarter, consistent with our decision to temporarily suspend the share repurchase program following the announcement of the agreement to acquire AMS men's health and prostate health businesses.","Near-term, our capital allocation priorities are debt repayment, maintaining flexibility and tuck-in M&A. Beyond the 12 to 18 month suspension period, any continuation of our share repurchase program would be subject to business development opportunities, market conditions, our stock performance, regulatory trading windows and other factors consistent with prior guidance and we expect to end 2015 with between 1.360 billion shares, and 1.370 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. And since we plan to keep the buyback suspended for some or all of 2016, we expect the 2015 trend in fully diluted weighted average shares to continue into 2016.","I'd like to conclude with guidance for Q3 and full year 2015. As a reminder, AMS is excluded from our guidance as the transaction has not yet closed. For Q3 2015, we expect consolidated revenues to be in a range of $1.790 billion to $1.840 billion. If current foreign exchange rates hold constant, we estimate the headwind from FX should be approximately $125 million or 680 basis points relative to Q3 of 2014.","On an operational basis, we expect consolidated Q3 sales to grow year-over-year in a range of plus 4% to plus 6%. We expect adjusted gross margin for the third quarter to be in a range of 71.5% to 72.5%, reflecting the favorable gross margin profile of key new product launches.","Assuming a more normalized adjusted R&D rate in Q3 of 11% to 12%, we expect adjusted operating margin in the third quarter to be approximately 22.5%, plus or minus 25 basis points. Finally, adjusted EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.21 to $0.23 per share and reported GAAP EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.10 to $0.13 per share.","For the full year 2015, we now expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $7.275 billion to $7.375 billion, which represents a year-over-year growth of 4% to 6% operationally. If current foreign exchange rates hold constant, we expect the FX headwind to be roughly $460 million for the full year 2015.","Based on our strong first half and expectations for the second half of the year, we now expect our full-year 2015 adjusted operating margin to be approximately 22.5% plus or minus 25 basis points. This represents an improvement of roughly 230 basis points over the full-year 2014. And as a reminder, our initial full-year 2015 adjusted operating margin guidance contained a midpoint of 22%, which we raised to 22.25% on our Q1 earnings call, and our current guidance of 22.5% represents the second consecutive quarter where we will have raised the midpoint of our full-year adjusted operating margin by 25 basis points.","Finally, we are reiterating our full-year adjusted EPS guidance range of $0.88 to $0.92. Recall, this range includes a $0.06 to $0.07 impact from unfavorable FX. We're proud that our team is focused on overcoming these FX headwinds to deliver against our original guidance range. The high end of our adjusted EPS guidance range represents double-digit growth and based on current rates, approximately 15% growth at the midpoint when you exclude the impact of foreign exchange.","On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.28 to $0.34. I encourage you to check our Investor Relations website for Q2 2015 financial and operational highlights which outlines Q2 results, as well as Q3 and full-year 2015 guidance, including P&L line item guidance.","So, with that, I'll turn it back to Susie who will moderate the Q&A.","Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Dan. Katy, Let's open it up to questions for the next 25 minutes or so. In order to enable us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. Katy, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein at JPMorgan.","Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning. Can you hear me okay?","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hear you well. Good morning.","Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Perfect. Thanks, guys. So, two items and I'll start maybe with Structural Heart. So, you had talked at the Analyst Meeting about LOTUS market share trending north of 10% in Europe. Could you just spend a minute on that? I think there was some back and forth at the meeting, just trying to get a sense where LOTUS is at this point. Is there anything more you can give us there?","And then are there any metrics you can share on the WATCHMAN launch at this point in the U.S.? And how should we think about the dependence upon reimbursement either the NCD or the add-on payment in order to drive growth in 2016 and beyond? Thanks.","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Thanks for the question. Good morning. Overall, as we mentioned in the script there, we're very pleased with the performance of Structural Heart overall. We took the guidance up to the high end of the range of $75 million to $100 million, which includes as you indicated, WATCHMAN and LOTUS. And I do think having the combination of LOTUS and WATCHMAN does uniquely position us in a competitive Structural Heart field, particularly given the lead that we have in the U.S. with the WATCHMAN platform globally.","So starting with WATCHMAN, your first question, the great news is we're on track and actually slightly ahead of schedule in terms of our year-end goal of driving 100 large account openings in the U.S. So, we're actually ahead of pace there, which is very encouraging. We indicated during the script we're very pleased with the clinical results that we're receiving and a lot of that's due to the very measured and we believe thorough training program that we've put in place. The implants to-date are being split pretty equally across interventional cardiologist and electrophysiologist which supports our commercial model.","And in terms of the reimbursement, nothing really new to report there. We're going to learn a lot more in the second half of 2015, starting with the NCD. We should learn more about the NCD in November with a final decision in first quarter of 2016. That public comment period was closed in June, and we had over 80 supportive comments and very nice support from HRS, APC and SKY (33:59). So, really happy about our launch of WATCHMAN. Turning to LOTUS, we continue to be on track with the pipeline that we laid out at the Investor Day meeting in terms of the additional valve sizes and the 14 French catheter as well.","And in terms of the share, kind of similar to the feedback that we had at Investor Day. We have about a 90% reorder rate with our existing customers in TAVR which is great given the number of competitors in Europe. Once customers use LOTUS, 90% of the time they continue to reorder consistently. And we have about what we estimate a third of the market share in the accounts that we're currently penetrated in Europe. So, we'll continue to expand new accounts as we continue to expand our training programs, and we make very good progress, we believe, in the second quarter.","Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President-Investor Relations","Keith, do you want to add anything?","Keith D. Dawkins - Global Chief Medical Officer & Executive VP","Just to say, Mike, that on the clinical side the Berlin valve meeting in September we'll have the important data sets including the 250-patient REPRISE II extension one year data and the first 500 patients, that's half the patients of the RESPOND post-market study. And then more important (35:19) data coming out of (35:21) in October.","Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, Keith. So, Mike, what's the appetite as well as the balance sheet bandwidth for additional M&A post the AMS acquisition?","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we're always \u2013 as you know, we've always been, we think pretty smart with our acquisitions. So over the last few years with the Bayer acquisition, EP, Alliant (35:46), and now the AMS, that we've moved into faster markets.","In terms of capacity, we saw, as Dan indicated in his script, we have capacity for tuck-in M&A, which is what we've historically done since I've been here. And so I think you'll see us continuing to be active in the tuck-in M&A area, so long as it hits our strategic fit and financial guidelines that we lay out.","Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Michael. I'll let some others jump in.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Rick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everybody. Turning to the U.S. CRM businesses, you both said I think you expected some additional headwinds from a product, competitive point of view. I'm just curious, was it better \u2013 it was a little worse than I expected, the pressure was a little greater, was it better or worse than you expected? And just as part of that, obviously, you're doing great in Europe with the mid-single-digit growth with the full sort of next wave portfolio. Is that the way we should think about the kind of growth we could see in the United States once you have that in 2016 and beyond?","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The answer to your question is yes. That's really why we articulated that. We grew over 5% in Europe with that new cadence of product. And it's been a consistent, I believe, five quarters in a row of performance like that despite the tough comps in Europe. So, we have a very strong portfolio, and that's the portfolio that we'll be launching essentially in 2016 in the U.S. and then later in Japan.","So, overall, it's kind of \u2013 the U.S. has some pressure. We called it last quarter. We'll continue to see some softness there. So, we anticipate kind of maybe flattish growth in the second half overall CRM. But we really build a lot of momentum going into 2016 with that portfolio and the launch of EMBLEM in the U.S. in the back half as well.","So, I think the other good news is for CRM overall, if you look at the trailing 12-months, we're up 2% to 3%. And so I think if you look at longer-term perspective, we're up two to three points. And given the strength in Europe and as we position the portfolio in the U.S. for 2016, we're positive about, very enthusiastic about driving above-market growth over that time period.","Rick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And just turning to operating margins, just \u2013 Dan, if I'm reading it right, obviously, you had terrific year-over-year expansion. It looked great. It was \u2013 on a sequential basis, everything stepped down a little bit from the first quarter. Is that currency? Is that something about the OpEx that we should be sensitive to? Obviously, you're reiterating your confidence about the year and the second half.","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, Rick. It really is more about the OpEx, and we had talked about that on the Q1 call. But Q2 is historically and should prove again this year to be the highest OpEx quarter of the year, primarily driven by the significant amount of tradeshow activity in all the divisions. Think PCR and DDW and AUA and all the different \u2013 HRS, all happen in the second quarter. So, that's really the key driver. And recall, our range was 21% to 22%, so we called that that was going to be down from Q1, and were able to deliver 22.1%.","Rick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you so much.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Robert A. Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks and good morning. So just a couple of quick questions. I want to focus mine again on WATCHMAN. And first, Mike, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the demand side of the equation. I realize fully that this is a controlled rollout, you need to be careful about training, but in the centers where you are rolled out, what are you seeing from the demand side, either for physicians and patients, anything that's kind of surprised you in the early going and again, particularly interested in terms of just demand for the product in the centers that you're launched.","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So we have Dr. Stein here. I thought maybe he'd provide some commentary on your question then I can add on to it.","Kenneth Stein - Senior Vice President & Chief Medical Officer-Cardiac Rhythm Management","Yeah, Bob. I mean, we've been really gratified at the demand where we've launched it. I mean, really, we've been really carefully controlling the number of sites as we bring them on. As Mike mentioned in his script, we're actually bringing them on a bit faster than we had thought we would when we spoke at the Investors Day. But that really is what's throttling use of the device at this point.","We have folks really asking us, joining all of our training programs. And it's early to say who are the patients who are getting it but what we've seen to-date, both in terms of patient selection and in terms of patient outcome is really right in line with what we expected to see based on our prior clinical trials.","Robert A. Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then the other thing I wanted to ask about as it relates to WATCHMAN is just a little bit more specific on the reimbursement side, relating to the add-on payment. I was wondering if you could set some expectations for us. How confident are you that you will get that add-on payment? And if you don't get it, does that change the way you think about the rollout of the product and the demand for the product in 2016?","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think we really won't to provide any additional comments on the \u2013 on our \u2013 kind of giving a percentage on that. We're very confident in the data of WATCHMAN as Dr. Stein has articulated. We're very pleased with the clinical outcomes that we're seeing in the launch. And so we think the submission has unprecedented clinical data for it, but we won't provide any further comments in terms of putting odds against it. And hopefully at the end of the 3Q earnings call, we'll have better visibility to it.","Robert A. Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","But I mean if you don't get it, does that matter to demand. So, we'll move away from how confident are you that you will get it, but if you don't, does that have a big impact, you think, on the rollout of the product?","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think, we're having a lot of success right now. So, we'll open 100 centers this year and so, there is a strong demand for it. It delivers an unmet patient need for patients who suffer from atrial fibrillation or at risk for stroke. Ken, if you have any additional thoughts on it?","Kenneth Stein - Senior Vice President & Chief Medical Officer-Cardiac Rhythm Management","Just the only other thing that I just want to draw attention to is in addition to the NTAP, CMS has also proposed reassigning into a new higher class DRG...","Robert A. Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right.","Kenneth Stein - Senior Vice President & Chief Medical Officer-Cardiac Rhythm Management","...as opposed to the DRG 251, they proposed reassignment to 273, 274 which would represent a 20% increase \u2013 anticipate reimbursement to hospitals. And we'd expect running about that roughly in the same timeframe as the NTAP.","Robert A. Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Just two quick questions. I guess first, Mike, I'm thinking about SYNERGY and that number you gave us of 30% mix ex-U.S. and that obviously suggests to a lot of us that conversion has been a lot tougher for SYNERGY and there's obviously been more sensitivity to price and value. So, I guess two questions off of that. I guess how would you expect U.S. mix to track relative to the ex-U.S. experience?","And then, just given your comments on FAST, I guess the question I have is, is FAST worth it? I mean, can you actually demonstrate better outcomes with FAST than SYNERGY? Is that investment for shareholders a good investment in your view?","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Starting with SYNERGY, I think the big difference in the U.S. and Europe, really the difference in Europe as well as Japan as well, is high variance, much higher variance of pricing country-to-country. So, we have been very thoughtful about which countries we launch SYNERGY in and which countries we don't.","And so, as you said, it represents 30% of our overall Europe DES revenue mix but it represents greater than 50% of our share in approximately the 10 EU countries that we're selling it into. So, where we sell it, we drive over 50% share and those accounts are paying a premium. And there's many countries that we don't sell it at all.","In the U.S., there is less variance in the pricing across the hospital system. So, as a result of that, we do expect the share to be quite significant in terms of the mix of SYNERGY. So, we do believe it deserves a premium but it will be a premium that won't inhibit its adoption. So, we do believe this will be a share taker and will represent a significant percentage of the mix in the U.S. once we launch it.","On fully resorbable, we're committed to innovation. And we're only going to bring this to the market in Europe and in the U.S. if it delivers unmet clinical needs. So, we don't believe the existing generation products are able to deliver in a workhorse environment, and we're only going to drive the investment in FRS through the CE Mark and\/or the FDA if we're confident that it delivers on the commitments and promise that we'd want it to. Because we believe with SYNERGY, we have a best-in-class differentiated platform with a very large lead in the U.S. And so, we're not going to \u2013 we're going to really maximize that and we're going to be really smart about our FRS commitments.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's very helpful, Mike. And then, Dan, just on CRM margins (45:47) obviously they've been flat or stable the last three quarters. I know you mentioned EMBLEM will give you a boost here in the back half of 2015. So, you pick up 200 basis points on EMBLEM, that kind of gets you to 16%, 17% depending how you cut the math. How do you get the next 200 to 300 basis points over the next 18 or so months?","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I think one thing that you see first of all from the first half of this year is that EP is growing, and that's been a big part \u2013 I mean, CRM gets a lot of the focus, but think Rhythm Management, that also includes EP. And EP grew 6%, grew 9%, so that's a piece of it.","And then the other part, and I think you correctly call it out, is we have significant gross margin enhancing products coming out on the CRM front. So, if you think EMBLEM, you think ACCOLADE and you think our Quad system in the first half of next year in the U.S., those are all accretive to CRM gross margin. So, the benefits of that are all seen in the overall Rhythm Management.","And the last piece I would say is as we talked about our plant network optimization, the work on the most recent one, which is the benefit of moving a lot of the Electrophysiology products from Northern California to our plant in Costa Rica, the work on that finishes at the end of this year and we'll start to accrue the benefits of that in 2016 and beyond.","So, all those in addition to the many other specific programs in SG&A and R&D to drive efficiencies, has us confident that we'll hit that north of 20% number by 2017.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President-Investor Relations","Just on SYNERGY and FAST, Keith, do you want to comment anything?","Keith D. Dawkins - Global Chief Medical Officer & Executive VP","Sure. Yeah, David. Just a couple of things. So in relation to the mix of SYNERGY in Europe, of course, we don't have reimbursements in France yet, which we're anticipating in Q4 and France is the largest DES market in Europe, so that will make a significant difference.","And then with regard to FAST, I think we all agree that the currently available commercial FRS product is not a workhorse product with sub mid-single digit (47:56) market share four years after CE Mark. So we think and we're confident that we can improve on the acute performance of FRS with our differentiated FAST technology. And that's the purpose of this first human use study to study the acute performance of our FAST products and we'll give more details of that at TCG (48:20) this year.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Joshua T. Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking the questions. I was just hoping for an update on the subcutaneous ICD platform, if there's anything new to report on the reimbursement front, any color on the European rollout. I know it's been still very early. And then any details on the launch plan in the U.S.?","And then just lastly if you're continuing to see sequential sales growth for the subcutaneous ICD and whether there may have been any disruption this quarter in the U.S. with the EMBLEM planned launch in Q3?","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Thank you for the question. On reimbursement, the majority of the U.S. population's currently covered with the S-ICD. We estimate we're covering about 200 million lives today, including Medicare beneficiaries, about two-thirds of the Medicaid population and about 40% of the private pay market. And we continue to work on the private pay market, and we continue to make progress there. So, overall, in reimbursement, it's really not much of a headwind, and we continue to make good progress on the private side.","EMBLEM really is off to a very strong start in Europe. We're not going to break out the EMBLEM sales in Europe, but we received very strong momentum off of that new launch. Physicians are very attracted to the 20% thinner design and longer battery life and also the ability to track patients remotely with the patient monitoring.","In the U.S., you're really going to see a launch that'll take place more in the back half of Q3. And so, we're transitioning to that product in the U.S., and you'll see more of an impact in the U.S. in the fourth quarter. But the product itself, as you know, it offers unique features, it also offers much stronger gross margins that are accretive to the company. And we're excited about the future of it.","So, Ken, if you had any other thoughts on EMBLEM at all?","Kenneth Stein - Senior Vice President & Chief Medical Officer-Cardiac Rhythm Management","Yeah. I mean, I think the only thing to add, again, very early, but we've been pleased with the demand that we're seeing from docs in the U.S. who want to get access to the device as we launch it again, driven by what Mike said. It's substantially thinner. It's got a 40% longer battery. It's remote monitoring capable. And so, folks are interested in it.","And then, also just to highlight that we're going to continue to develop clinical data supporting the use of the S-ICD really as a first-choice device for the broad category of patients getting ICDs for primary prevention. Really pleased by the pool of data that was just published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology and recently announced our first patient enrollment in our UNTOUCHED clinical trial, which is really designed to show that outcomes with the S-ICD in the primary prevention population are at least as good as they are with transvenous devices.","Joshua T. Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for that. And just one quick follow-up, a product-specific question or more on the Bayer acquisition and your Jetstream product on the atherectomy side. There's a MEDCAC Meeting yesterday that convened to dive into the Peripheral Intervention space and there had been some speculation that atherectomy reimbursement could be called into question. It seemed benign. But can you just give us an idea on how the Jetstream product is doing relative to internal expectations and maybe any commentary on your outlook for the sustainability of atherectomy reimbursement that's so strong. Thanks a lot.","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you. In the script, we discussed the \u2013 really the Bayer integration is going very well. We won't break out the thrombectomy and atherectomy sales separately given the size of the PI business. But that business, the legacy Bayer business grew double digits, much faster than they had prior to joining BSC, given the synergies that we have with our commercial and core portfolios. So, we're very pleased with it. We continue to see strong demand for the Jetstream product, as well as our below the knee product \u2013 blanked the name \u2013 Rota (52:35). Sorry.","So, I'll turn to the MEDCAC Panel, I think, we welcome that type of dialogue. It reinforces a lot of the clinical research and trials that we've invested for many years in our Peripheral business. And we continue to be confident in the clinical evidence that the PI business generates. And as you indicated in your comments, we don't anticipate a significant change based on that panel.","Joshua T. Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks again.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brooks West with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Mike, just following up on the last question, specifically on Lutonix. Can you guys give us a little bit better idea of the scale and opportunity for the U.S. drug-coated balloon partnership? And then just a little bit more detail on kind of how that product was received when you all launched it in Q2?","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So, the alliance we have with Bard really works for both companies, given their investment in Lutonix balloon and our capabilities in atherectomy, thrombectomy and some of the complex PI procedures. So, the alliance is going well. It's very early. So, we're not going to break out separate sales or give kind of hospital account information given the competitiveness of that field. But I would say the early innings of it are very positive. The companies are working well together. They have excellent registry data that they've presented. And we have a very strong commercial team with a very wide portfolio to help them to leverage that. So, we're bullish about the alliance, but we're going to steer away from providing specific sales breakouts or account information.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Do you see that though, Mike, as something that could be a $100 million product for Boston at some point?","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. You'd have to ask Tim Ring and the Bard team that.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","All right. And then one for Ken. Just on the growth trends in Electrophysiology. Can you \u2013 just a little bit more on what's driving that. Is that catheters? Is it the diagnostic piece you got from Bard? How is the rollout of the Rhythmia system going? Just any kind of detail on trends you could give us there would be very helpful. Thanks.","Kenneth Stein - Senior Vice President & Chief Medical Officer-Cardiac Rhythm Management","Yeah. I'm not going to break it out specifically by product category, Brooks. Rhythmia, again, we are I would say well into the early phase of the launch and really very pleased with how the system's performing. It is really the first next-generation mapping system for arrhythmias \u2013 high density, high resolution. I can't tell you the number of cases that I've gone out and been with colleagues where you do the case and you finish and they say, gosh, we just never could've done this procedure successfully with any of the previous mapping systems. So, so far, everything that we've seen with it during the early launch has validated all of our thoughts when we purchased the technology.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay.","Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President-Investor Relations","Katy, we'll take one more, please.","Operator","Okay. Our last question then comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for fitting me in. Two questions here. First, so, Dan, I couldn't help but mention you said early on that you've grown 6% or better the last six quarters per Mike's commentary. But the guidance assumes a bit of a deceleration. So, basically, are you saying that it's going to be difficult to grow 6% operationally in the second half of this year? And that $61 million this quarter for interest expense, is that what we should assume for Q4 in 2016 once the AMS deal closes? I did have one follow-up question on WATCHMAN. Thanks.","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Larry. So, in terms of the second half revenue, I think there's really three key things that are the headwinds on the back half of this year. The first, and we mentioned this, is the IC comps. So, when you think of Interventional Cardiology last year in the second half, that grew 8% in Q3 and 10% in Q4, so 9% overall in the second half. So, we're up against much more significant comps on the IC side. We now are looking at CRM. We talk about that being flattish for the back half of 2015.","Obviously feel good about the new launches we'll have in late 2015 and early 2016, and with Mike's comments, believe we're on the right side of a share gain strategy beyond that. But the next two quarters, should be flattish in CRM. So, those two \u2013 plus when you think of the operational revenue growth rate, in the first half of this year, we've had six months of Bayer revenue contribution, and in the second half, we'll only have two months without a comparable from the year prior. So, I think those are the real headwinds.","We obviously have tailwinds as well. We're excited about the launch of WATCHMAN, and we're excited about, as Dr. Stein mentioned, Rhythmia, LOTUS in Europe, things like that. But the balance of it, we think 4% to 6% is the right range.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","But Dan, the $61 million per quarter, and then for interest expense, once AMS closes? Just lastly on WATCHMAN, I think this has kind of been asked a few different ways on the call, but how common are the local non-coverage decisions in place for \u2013 that have been put in place for Lariat and how much do you think that's impacting the early uptake? And that's it for me, guys. Thanks for taking the questions.","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. I'll take the interest one quickly and then turn it over for the second one. I'd say the net of the new debt at the favorable rates offset by the fact that we have incremental debt for the AMS acquisition probably puts us in a $10 million to $20 million a year increase in overall interest expense, on an annual basis.","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, Larry, just on WATCHMAN, not a whole lot new there. Just to reinforce, the vast clinical data that we have with WATCHMAN. I would argue is quite a bit different than what we've seen with Lariat in the U.S. So, it's difficult to even put those platforms in the same bucket.","And so, the good news is we've enrolled our first 50 centers faster than planned and we'll likely enroll our second set of 50 centers, the goal of 100 centers faster than plan and we're delivering very good outcomes. And we're receiving strong uptake from it and we'll get more on the reimbursement pathway as we mentioned with the NCD in November and the NTAP as well.","So, we like the momentum that we have and as Dr. Stein said, we'll continue to layer on more and more clinical evidence on top of WATCHMAN to further differentiate it.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for that.","Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President-Investor Relations","Okay.

With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q3 2014 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website, under the heading, Financial Information.","The duration of this morning's call will be one hour. Mike will begin our prepared remarks with an update on our business progress and his perspectives on the quarter.","Dan will then review our overall Q3 2014 financial results as well as guidance for full-year 2014 and the Q4 2014. During today's question-and-answer session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our chief medical officers, Dr. Keith Dawkins and Dr. Ken Stein.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate and other similar words.","They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share; new product approvals and launches; clinical trials; cost savings and growth opportunities; our cash flow and expected use; our financial performance, including sales, margins, earnings and other Q4 and full-year 2014 guidance; as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses.","Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs and 8-Ks filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them.","At this point, I will turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike?","Mike Mahoney","Thank you, Susie. Good morning, everyone. Boston Scientific delivered excellent results in third quarter as the company continues to strengthen and build global momentum.","Our results were driven by above market revenue growth across almost all of our seven divisions, with mid-to-upper single-digit growth in all three of our business groups. 8% in Cardiovascular, 7% in Rhythm Management and 5% in Medical Surgical.","We expanded operating margins to 20.5%, representing 120-basis point improvement year-over-year and a 70-basis point improvement quarter-over-quarter and we delivered 20% year-over-year adjusted EPS growth.","Our third quarter results reflect our sharp focus on delivering meaningful innovation to our patients and physicians, while also providing clinical and economic value to our customers.","Third quarter results built on our first half momentum and through nine months, we have achieved 5% operational sales growth and 20% adjusted EPS growth, demonstrating strong execution of our strategic plan, continued momentum of our diversified product portfolio, improved position in our core markets and strong progress on our growth initiatives.","We continue to believe the Boston Scientific is uniquely positioned to drive sustainable double-digit EPS growth given our reinvigorated culture, a strong pipeline, global expansion and significant opportunities for margin improvement.","I will now provide some brief highlights on third quarter and thoughts on our outlook. Dan will review the financials and fourth quarter 2014 guidance. Then we will take your questions. Please note that in my remarks all references to growth are on a year-over-year constant currency basis.","In terms of highlights for the quarter, first we delivered balanced revenue growth. All three of our business groups and regions grew above market. Second, we delivered exceptional performance in Interventional Cardiology. Third, we continue to build up on track record of consistent revenue growth and expanding operating margins.","Starting with our balanced revenue growth, our 6% reported gain in sales after normalizing for foreign exchange and acquisitions, represents 5% organic revenue growth.","I will discuss the excellent growth delivery by our IC division shortly, but I would also like to note that Cardiac Rhythm Management group delivered strong 4% growth for the second quarter in a row, led by S-ICD, our new MINI ICD and our X4 quad pulse CRT-D system in Europe and pulse generator in the U.S.","Patient and physician demand for our S-ICD, the only defibrillator that doesn't require leads in the heart has been very strong. We now have a full year goal of achieving $100 million in S-ICD revenue in 2014.","The breadth of the S-ICD clinical data set continues to grow as IDE and EFFORTLESS show low complications rates with no lead failures and no systemic infections. We continue to make progress on payer coverage with - recently announcing broader coverage for S-ICD patients.","We continue to gain share in de novo ICD implants and we believe that we now have the number two U.S. share position in de novo ICD implants non-CRT-D. We also believe that we are being rewarded for the clinical and economic value of our battery longevity.","Two very recent new independent contemporary longevity studies were presented at last month's Heart Failure Society of America and have added to a growing body of evidence that demonstrates the superiority of BSC longevity.","These de novo share gains were offsetting replacement headwinds that will likely persist for another 18 to 24 months, given our superior battery longevity. In CRT-D, we believe we have gained at least one point of the de novo shares since launching our X4 quad pulse generator in the U.S. this spring, but still face longevity replacement headwinds in this segment.","Our MedSurg division continues its consistent performance, which is led by endoscopy, accelerating to 7% growth due to the depth and breadth of its product portfolio and strong global leadership position.","Urology and Women's Health also grew above market as our strategy to invest in key international geographies fueled double-digit growth in all international regions for the fifth consecutive quarter. Key to this growth has been our new product registrations with more than 130 year-to-date globally and a strong focus on physician training.","Once again, Europe delivered impressive results with the sales growth of 11%, which we view as a confirmation of our reinvigorated portfolio and strategic approach.","Within Europe, IC, Urology, Women's Health and Neuromod, all grew double digits, but CRM and Endo sales were up mid-to-single digits.","We will continue to diversify for our portfolio in key segments such as the recently closed acquisition of Interventional division of Bayer AG, while we expand geographically. Emerging markets grew 19% and now represent 10% of our total sales.","Now, turning to IC, we delivered sales growth of IC of 8% in interventional cardiology, driven by continued strong performance of our Promus PREMIER DES, but we believe we have maintained U.S. market leadership and gained a meaningful share in Japan.","Other drivers included our next-generation Synergy stent platform, our newly launched REBEL bare-metal stent, the unparalleled breadth of our complex PCI portfolio and strong growth off of a small base from our structural heart franchise, which now includes the LOTUS percutaneous valve and WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure.","Looking forward, we are bullish on our rejuvenated IC pipeline, including SYNERGY, LOTUS and WATCHMAN to name a few, as well as our improved global sales execution.","Our clinical programs are also progressing, so we recently enrolled our first patients in REPRISE III, a 1,000-patient clinical trial, designed to support U.S. regulatory approval of the LOTUS valve system.","REPRISE III is a head-to-head randomized TAVR trial in the U.S. that is powered to show a possible benefit with LOTUS and the reduction of moderate or severe aortic regurgitation.","At the American Heart Association Meeting, EVOLVE II, our pivotal trial designed to support SYNERGY U.S. approval will be a late-breaking clinical trial presentations in November 19th. We are also in active discussions with the FDA and WATCHMAN following a favorable vote at the October 8th advisory panel and we continue to target the first half '15 FDA approval.","Finally, our continuing track record of consistent revenue growth and expanding operating margins now sets the sixth straight quarters of operational revenue growth.","We are delivering on our financial commitments and we are well ahead of the total revenue growth and EPS commitments provided at our February 2013 Investor Day.","For the first nine months of 2014, operational sales growth was 5%, and we have with expanded adjusted operating margin over 100 basis points from our full year 2013 rate.","For the first half of '14, BSC grew adjusted EPS 19% year-over-year, which is well above our peer group suggested EPS growth. We remain committed to double-digit adjusted EPS growth and we believe this represents attractive scarcity value, given our revenue growth and margin expansion opportunities relative to peers'.","We continue to manage our litigation risk and we are confident in our legal strategies. We believe we are appropriately reserved and have strong liquidity and a very manageable cadence of events should our legal strategies have unfavorable outcomes.","In summary, strengthened execution, improved results in our core business are more than offsetting some of the promising, yet delayed adjacencies.","Our European results are evidence of our promising pipeline and we continue to diversify our portfolio of key segments and expand geographically. We have delivered consistent revenue growth for six straight records while driving adjusted operating margin expansion.","A key driver of our consistent track record is the cultural transformation we fostered over the past three years which was [found] in our core values. I would like to thank our employees for their winning spirit and the commitment to Boston Scientific, and also extend a warm welcome to our new members from Bayer Interventional.","Now, let me turn the call over to Dan.","Dan Brennan","Thanks Mike. I will start with some overall perspective on the quarter before diving into the details. We generated adjusted EPS of $0.20 compared to $0.17 in Q3 of 2013, representing 20% year-over-year growth and achieving the high-end of our guidance range of $0.18 to $0.20.","The improved performance in Q3 was driven primarily by operational revenue growth and gross margin expansion. These improvements were partially offset by SG&A spending related to our acquisition Bayer Interventional, core product launches and variable employee-related benefits.","We posted an adjusted operating margin of 20.5%, which represents improvement of 120 basis points over Q3 of last year. We believe we are on track to meet or exceed our profitability goal of roughly 100+ basis points of annual operating margin improvement, which would result in an adjusted operating margin of 20% for the full-year 2014. In addition, we generated adjusted free cash flow of $330 million and operating cash flow $346 million in the quarter.","We continue to execute against our goal of consistent revenue growth and operating margin expansion and believe we are uniquely positioned to drive double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth.","Now, I will provide a detailed review of our Q3 business performance and operating results. Unless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the third quarter of 2013 and all year-over-year revenue growth rates are given on a constant currency basis.","For the third quarter of 2014, consolidated revenue of $1,846 billion exceeded the high end of our guidance range and represented operational revenue growth of 7%, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange and the divested Neurovascular business.","On an as reported basis, revenue grew 6% year-over-year, excluding an approximate 150-basis point contribution from the Bard EP and Bayer Interventional acquisitions, organic revenue growth was 5% in the quarter.","The foreign exchange impact on sales was a $10 million headwinds compared to the prior year period, about $19 million worse than we had assumed in our guidance range.","I will now provide more details on the revenue results for our seven divisions, which roll up into the three business groups. I will start with Medical Surgical, where total group sales of $588 million grew 5% and group adjusted operating income increased 120 basis points to 32.4%.","Endoscopy sales grew 7% worldwide, with strong new product contribution driving growth in all franchises, most notably biliary, tissue acquisition and metal stents. All regions posted growth as well and Latin America was particularly strong growing 21% for the second quarter in a row.","Urology and Women's Health worldwide sales continued to outperform the market and grew 5% with particular strength internationally and an impressive 57% emerging markets sales growth.","To close out the MedSurg results, our worldwide Neuromodulation business was flat in the quarter, which we believe is better than the overall SCS market performance.","As we previously discussed, changes to Medicare reimbursement for physician office trialing of spinal cord stimulation systems went into effect on January 1 and is negatively impacting market growth in 2014.","We are facing particularly difficult comparisons in the second half of 2014, given the anniversary of our Precision Spectra launch, coupled with the acceleration of physician office trial into Q4 of last year in anticipation of the reimbursement change. Our goal remains to grow faster than this market given the strength of our technology and we are encouraged by early physician feedback on our newly launched CoverEdge 32 contact paddle.","Turning now to the Cardiovascular Group, which consists of the Interventional Cardiology and Peripheral Interventions divisions, global sales for the group totaled $723 million and grew 8%.","Cardiovascular Group adjusted operating margins for the quarter of 27.5%, represented a 150-basis point improvement year-over-year. Within cardiovascular, worldwide Interventional Cardiology sales of $508 million grew 8%.","Globally, DES sales grew 10% with U.S. DES sales up 13% and OUS DES sales increasing 8%, led by an impressive 12% growth in Europe. We continued to execute our market segmentation strategy and increased our mix of synergy in select markets to 20% of total Europe DES sales.","Despite the reimbursement cut headwind in Japan, Asia's DES results were up 6% and we believe we gained share sequentially in Japan. Worldwide complex PCI solutions or other IC grew 2% and includes all legacy Interventional Cardiology product lines outside DES, including bare-metal stents, core IC products which include guidewires, balloons and other accessories and imaging products such as Intravascular Ultrasound.","The 2% growth in complex PCI solutions was led by Imaging with 6% growth and core IC with 3% growth. Overall, we are very pleased with our IC performance in the quarter and believe it validates our strategy to drive above market growth by providing interventional cardiologist with the broadest portfolio technology and differentiated products to treat the most complex coronary cases.","In Structural Heart, our LOTUS percutaneous valve posted solid sequential growth on a constant currency basis of a small base and WATCHMAN continued its strong growth with revenue up 40%.","Peripheral Interventions delivered worldwide revenue growth of 9%, which includes roughly one month of revenue from the acquired Bayer Interventional business.","Excluding the contribution from Bayer Interventional, worldwide PI grew 5%. U.S. growth of 16% was led by strength in the interventional oncology franchise as well as the addition of the Bayer Interventional products and revenue synergies within the legacy BSC PI business.","Excluding the contribution from Bayer Interventional U.S. PI grew 8%; partially offsetting this weakness was weakness in Asia where we saw some procedural softness particularly in Japan.","Finally, I will discuss our Rhythm Management group, which consists of our Electrophysiology and Cardiac Rhythm Management divisions. Worldwide Rhythm Management sales in Q3 of $534 million grew 7%.","Rhythm Management's adjusted operating margin for Q3 of 14.1% represents a 160-basis point improvement year-over-year, the third consecutive quarter, where Rhythm Management margins have improved at least 100 basis points over the prior year.","Worldwide Electrophysiology revenue was up 57%, with legacy BSE EP sales roughly flat. We entered into limited market release for our Rhythmia mapping and navigation system with six sites now up and running in the U.S. and Europe and strong physician feedback given the systems' higher fidelity images acquired in a fraction of the time required by the competitors' systems.","For the Cardiac Rhythm Management division, Q3 worldwide sales increased 4%. Growth in CRM was led by Europe, which grew 6%.","On a worldwide basis, defib sales of $348 million grew 5%. U.S. defib revenue posted solid growth of 4%, driven by continued S-ICD momentum in the first full quarter of contribution from our MINI ICD and X4 quad pulse generator as we continue to gain de novo ICD share.","Worldwide pacer sales were flat totaling $132 million. International growth was strong at 8%, led by adoption of our INGENIO family of pacemakers. We believe we continued to gain share in the OUS pacer market.","I would like to reiterate that our belief is that CRM trends are best analyzed over multiple quarters. This is the second consecutive quarter of 4% worldwide CRM growth and CRM sales are up 2% on a rolling 12-month basis, which we estimate to be faster than the underlying combined pacemaker and defibrillator markets. We continue to believe, we will be a net share gainer in worldwide CRM in 2014.","Turning now to the P&L, adjusted gross profit margin for the third quarter was 71.1%, up 40 basis points year-over-year and 80 basis points, sequentially. The increase was largely attributable to benefits from our value improvement programs, partially offset by price erosion.","We continue to believe our full year adjusted gross margin will be in the range of 70% to 71%. Once again, the impact of foreign exchange upon gross margin was immaterial as a result of our hedging program.","Adjusted SG&A expenses were $701 million or 38.0% of sales in Q3 of this year. Note that this excludes acquisition and divestiture related charges of $34 million that are included in our GAAP results.","Our Q3 2014 adjusted SG&A rate represents an 80-basis point increase in SG&A spending as a percentage of revenue compared to Q3 of last year, due to higher spend to support product launches and one-time items related to variable employee related benefits and our acquisition of Bayer Interventional. We expect SG&A to decrease in Q4 of this year as a percent of sales, and we now believe, our full-year SG&A spend will be in the range of 37% to 38% of revenue. ","Adjusted research and development expenses were $212 million in the third quarter or 11.5% of sales. As a percent of sales, this represents a 100-basis point decline in year-over-year spending, due to efficiency gains and the timing of projects. We now believe our full-year R&D spend will be in the range of 11% to 11.5% of revenue.","Royalty expense was $21 million in the quarter or 1.1% of sales, down 50 basis points year-over-year due to a more favorable than expected royalty structure and we expect our royalty rate in Q4 of this year to be roughly flat to Q4 of last year.","On an adjusted basis, pre-tax operating income was $379 million in the quarter or 20.5% of sales, up 120 basis points year-over-year and 70 basis points, sequentially.","Adjusted pre-tax operating income grew 13% with all three of our reportable segments contributing to the improvement.","GAAP operating income, which includes GAAP to adjusted items of $315 million in the quarter, was $64 million. The GAAP to adjusted items for the quarter included litigation charges of $139 million, acquisition and divestiture related charges of $38 million, restructuring and other charges of $29 million and amortization expense of $109 million. Our total accrual for all legal matters was $945 million as of September 30, 2014.","Now, I will move on to other income and expense, which primarily consisted of interest expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $54 million, which is $83 million lower than Q3 of last year and this is primarily due to the refinancing of our public debt in Q3 of 2013, which included a pre-tax one-time charge of approximately $70 million.","Our tax rate for the third quarter was negative on a reported basis, due primarily to the litigation related charges that negatively impacted reported pre-tax income. Our effective tax rate was 14.4% on an adjusted basis and we expect our Q4 2014 adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 12% to 14% and our full-year 2014 adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 12% to 13%.","Finally, Q3 2014 adjusted EPS of $0.20 per share, represents 20% year-over-year growth. Included in the adjusted EPS calculation is an approximately $7 million lower royalty expense, almost equally offset by a higher tax rate resulting from a different geographic mix of earnings.","On a reported GAAP basis, Q3 2014 EPS was $0.03 and includes net charges and amortization expense totaling $230 million after-tax. The $0.03 of GAAP EPS in Q3 of this year compares to breakeven in the prior year period.","Moving onto the balance sheet, DSO of 61 days decreased 5 days compared to September of 2013, due primarily to strong collections in Europe.","Days inventory on hand of 165 days was up 4 days compared to September of last year and up 17 days compared to December of 2013, due to higher inventory in advance of launches and lower cost of goods sold, driven primarily by standard cost improvements and a favorable product mix.","Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $330 million compared to $291 million in Q3 of last year and we continue to expect our full-year 2014 adjusted free cash flow to be approximately $1.2 billion.","Capital expenditures were $57 million in Q3 of this year compared to $56 million in Q3 of 2013. There were no sharing purchases in the quarter as we issued a net cash payment of $414 million to acquire the Interventional division of Bayer AG, we value returning cash to shareholders, share repurchase and M&A remain our top two capital allocation priorities.","Any continuation of our share repurchase program in 2014 would be subject to business development opportunities, market conditions, our stock performance, regulatory trading windows and other factors.","I would like to conclude with our guidance for Q4 and full year 2014. For the full-year 2014, we expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $7,370 billion to $7,420 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 5% operationally and 3% to 4% on a reported basis.","We now expect foreign exchange to be a $55 million headwind for the full-year 2014 and we expect adjusted EPS for the full-year 2014 to be in the range of $0.81 to $0.83. On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.22 to $0.24.","Now turning to the fourth quarter, we expect consolidated revenues to be a range of $1,875 billion to 1,925 billion. If current foreign exchange rates hold constant, the headwinds from FX should be approximately $27 million or 150 basis points relative to Q4 last year.","On operational basis, we expect consolidated Q4 sales to grow year-over-year in a range of 4% to 6%. For the fourth quarter, adjusted EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.20 to $0.22 per share and reported EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.09 to $0.11 per share.","I encourage you to check our investor relations website for Q3 2014 financial and operational highlights, which outline Q3 results and 2014 guidance.","With that, I will turn it back to Suzie, who will the moderate the Q&A.","Susie Lisa","Thanks, Dan. Roxanne, let's open it up to questions for the next 30 minutes to 35 minutes or so. In order to enable us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourselves to one question and one related follow-up.","Roxanne, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Bruce Nudell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse","Good morning. It is very clean impressive quarter. Just in terms of this [stent] number which is very impressive and well above the market, is it possible to continue that sort of momentum with the contribution of SYNERGY, perhaps offset by lapping of the German issue et cetera?","Mike Mahoney","Thanks, Bruce. It's Mike. Good morning. We are certainly pleased with our total DES performance, [online] order quarter, but also for the year-to-date. Year-to-date, our performance DES as a percent in the quarter, it was 10%, big share gains in the U.S. Promus PREMIER and also Japan.","Also, we continue to see strong growth in Europe, so really it's balanced across the globe. As we look forward to, not to provide guidance, but as we look forward at 2015, we continue to see positive momentum there in the portfolio, we anticipate large vessel product to be approved in Japan, we expect to expand the reimbursement for SYNERGY in Europe beyond the countries that we are currently selling it in and we continue to maintain a kind of disciplined tiered pricing strategy that offers innovation to physicians and patients.","We also expect to further strengthen that business based on the adjacencies and hopefully WATCHMAN approval on the first half of 2015 and the ongoing progress of LOTUS, all of which provide a hail over to our poor Interventional Cardiology business.","Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse","Just speaking of WATCHMAN, congratulations. Third time to [charm], it looks like in my view, approval is going to happen. It just seems that given the messiness around the panel et cetera, reimbursement may be more of an issue. How should we be thinking about that? Should we be thinking about national coverage determination, new technology add-on payment? How should we be thinking the pace of adoption, because it is clearly needed in certain populations?","Mike Mahoney","Yes. We are very encouraged by the progress. I think, whenever you bring a unique - and you are the first one to do it, innovation to market it takes a while. We are pleased with the panel and hopeful for the approval.","A lot of the questions you asked there, our views really haven't changed. We still believe this is a large un-served market, we are still confident in the $500 million market opportunity that we have talked about and we laid that out in our Investor Day.","Even at that $500 million represents just 3% to 5% penetration of the [patients] with elevated stroke risk, who are eligible for warfarin, so we feel like we have been quite conservative candidly in terms of sizing the market. Also, we have appropriately built the WATCHMAN approval timeframes as we look at our as a guidance for fourth quarter and we will provide guidance in '15.","I think, as you look at BSC beyond WATCHMAN, I think, I would stress the strong performance in our core businesses. Some of these adjacencies like WATCHMAN, which are unique and innovative have been a bit slower to market, but they are still in play and we look forward to their positive growth in the future.","Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse","Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Rick Wise - Stifel","Good morning, everybody. Thanks to the excellent quarter. CRM, Mike, operating margins at 14.2% obviously are excellent. Can you give us a little more color? Is this a new sustainable operating margin level? Maybe talk in more detail about what drove that performance. Was it volume, was it cost-cutting and help us understand maybe looking ahead should we expect continued sequential expansion in CRM operating margins?","Dan Brennan","Rick, this is Dan. I will take that one for you. I think that the key is, the last part of your question which is that is our goal, is the continued sequential improvement in that.","For that group, operating margin expansion is their top strategic imperative and it informs all of their strategies. In terms of the Q3 specifics, 160-basis point improvement to 14.1%, the good news is, it's not one specific thing that did it. It is all up and down the P&L throughout cost of goods and SG&A and R&D and our goal is to continue to do that in a very thoughtful and measured fashion over time as part of our goal as the total company to getting to 25% by 2017.","Rick Wise - Stifel","Just sort of follow-up on S-ICD, I mean, clearly you sort of raised your goal to $100 million target now. Can you talk about the rollout? Again, any more details on how many accounts you are seeing? Maybe talk at as well about reimbursement? We had some pushback from physicians who have been concerned about reimbursement.","Mike, you highlighted, maybe talk about the Medicare and commercial reimbursement progress. What is needed to see another dramatic step forward in S-ICDs in '15 and beyond, frankly.","Mike Mahoney","Thanks. We look at this as a long-term platform that's uniquely differentiated and we continue to build on, so we have not changed our market opportunity forecast, which we call the $750 million. We will continue to provide guidance on that in the future.","I would say overall, we are encouraged by the uptick of S-ICD in the U.S. and Europe. The adoption of therapies being driven by growing clinical experience for the system and continued flow of positive data and we are really supporting that, Rick, with a lot of ongoing clinical work and we think that clinical work will build a strong unique platform for long time and we are supporting that with the [data set].","In the terms of the guidelines, the European Society of Cardiology is added to S-ICD in a recommendation for treating patients with cardiomyopathy. As you mentioned on the reimbursement side, we expect positive reimbursement changes the U.S. and we are encouraged by the recent coverage expansion of (Inaudible).","We think all of those things, the ongoing building of evidence, the training that we are providing, the training that our sales reps receive, the experience that physicians have and backed by robust clinical data that we continue to build on will continue to extend the lead that we have in this category.","Rick Wise - Stifel","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question then comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Good morning. Mike, just one question for you and one question for Dan. You have been saying all year that the second half is going to accelerator. There obviously have been concerns about that, but certainly that is the quays. You basically said the global business is going to start looking a lot more like Europe as you get this is product pipeline you are being enhanced.","I guess, I wonder if could you talk about this quarter as it relates to the relative inflection and then the sustainability of these results as you head into '15, would you consider SYNERGY, WATCHMAN, and obviously what you commented on as it relates to S-ICD, and then I had a quick follow-up.","Mike Mahoney","Yes. We want to build a higher performance company. That the company that does it consistently and we measure ourselves by growing faster than the market, expanding operating income margins and driving double-digit EPS growth and building a winning culture in a global mindset that is unique, so that core culture is a big part of what we do and I think the international growth is a strong leading indicator.","The company has had six quarters of consecutive growth and we were very comfortable with our outlook for fourth quarter to extend that to seven quarters. As you mentioned, our international performance in the third quarter was 9%. More specifically, our European results were 11% growth, where we have mostly all of these adjacencies that have been further matured in terms of the rollout.","We won't give '15 guidance, but we have a lot of exciting opportunities in 2015. We will continue to expand our Interventional Cardiology platform like I mentioned it before. We will continue to broaden our CRM platform in terms of S-ICD utilization and clinical work.","We are hopeful for the WATCHMAN approval, we continue to make strong progress with our LOTUS, which we just recently started our trial in U.S. and we are driving momentum there in Europe.","Our MedSurg businesses, time-to-time we have some fluctuations in the quarter. Overall, if you look at a group of businesses, they continue to drive mid single-digit growth, excellent margin improvement and really continue to provide great balance of our portfolio. We are encouraged about the future, but we are certainly not satisfied.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Then Dan, just your GMs were very strong in the quarter. You obviously reiterated that you are on pace for 100 basis points of op market margin expansion this year, but the one thing we see consistent this year is you are still investing a fair amount in SG&A and I wonder as the pipeline expands and you head into '15 and that growth rate is 5%, perhaps even higher than 5%.","Talk to us about that SG&A investments that's necessary in '15 and '16. Does it stay at the levels that we are seeing here in '14 or do you begin to get some leverage on that SG&A investments as you cycle into next two years? Thank you.","Dan Brennan","Thanks, David. I think, as opposed to giving specific guidance within the P&L, I think we can be clear that the SG&A rate will go down as part of us achieving our overall operating income margin targets.","As we have said in the past, there are certain times we need to make investment and be opportunistic and obviously there is pieces of that that have driven the growth that we have been able to put on the board.","Overall, if you think of us getting to 25%, you should see SG&A be a lower percentage of sales on the way to 25%.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Great. Thanks, Dan.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan","Thank you. First off congratulation on a really nice quarter. Mike, I want to get your thoughts on the quarter sector landscape with the consolidation we have seen this year and wanted to get your thoughts on how that impacts Boston Scientific and how you see your role playing out it.","Mike Mahoney","Yes. Great question. Thank you. We are very comfortable with the business units that we plan today. We are playing three big sectors interventional cardiology, Rhythm Management and our MedSurg.","We continue to provide acquisitions and tuck-in acquisitions that strengthen our unique profile in those businesses. We planned a lot of R&D to strengthen those, so we are very comfortable with the business that we sell in today. Also, we believe that, when you cut across these different business units, it is very rare in the hospital system that a hospital will contract for our Neuromodulation products and our cardiology products and our, say, our EP products, so that happens very rarely.","For customers who want to do that, we certainly can enable that, but we don't see that type of bundling across multiple sectors occur very frequently, so we don't think that portfolio in terms of bundling really is an added value, so we don't see much benefit in that.","The benefit that we see in delivering unique innovation to physicians in certain categories, and I think our six quarters of growth and the performance we have in the third quarter would point to that strategy is working and I would also point to the unique margin improvement opportunity that we have.","I think our portfolio is positioned well. We have a lot of opportunities to improve it, but we don't see some of the consolidation that is taking place. Maybe other than the cost benefits and some cost synergies, we don't see a growth benefit with bundling across as multiple sectors that are very despaired from each other.","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan","Let me ask - the performance that we are seeing here it's really been driven as you outlined by the business that you are taking sharing and obviously in drug-eluting stents and ICD and defibrillator business is going well, but these are challenging core markets underneath that.","Do you feel the need to add more pipeline? Obviously, this is a very good quarter, but you are betting on markets that are growing and I know you preferred better market that are growing, so given the kind of questions on a layer WATCHMAN and similar pipeline stuff. Do you want to add more pipelines to portfolio today?","Mike Mahoney","I think we always looking for new capabilities. We just acquired the Bayer technology, but just take a step back, I think in med device most of the markets are fairly challenging, so it's a very competitive business. We feel comfortable and we strive to outperform our peers and to growth faster than market and you are seeing that.","In terms of our thirst for innovation, we clearly want to drive down the SG&A that Dan commented on and we are committed to doing that. At the same time, we are very aggressive in looking at portfolio alternatives that will continue to strengthen our business units.","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan","Okay. Thank you, Mike.","Operator","Our next question is from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","Thanks very much. Can you hear me okay?","Mike Mahoney","Yes.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","Great. Good morning, so two quick things. First on SYNERGY in Europe, can you give us a sense as to market share right now for your stent franchise overall in Europe, relative to the last couple quarters?","What I am particularly curious about is are you gaining share while holding the price premium or have you come off the price premium that I think you initially launched with?","Mike Mahoney","Good question, so we are very selective. Our strategy hasn't changed we are very selective in the countries that we sell SYNERGY in and we are also very selective in terms of the price point, because we think to establish a long-term market that is strong and healthy, that type of discipline is needed, so we haven't come off that strategy, so we are very careful about it.","We talked about potential reimbursement improvements, potentially in France next year, which may make SYNERGY more attractive in that country, so we are disciplined about what countries we could move to and we do have a pricing premium for SYNERGY, so I would not articulate the sheer gains as a result of dropping price in SYNERGY. It's something we could do, but it is not something that we feel a long-term the best for BSC or for the market.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","In terms of the market share specifically, where you are in Europe today and where you think you've been?","Mike Mahoney","Yes. We haven't broken out the specific share of SYNERGY of our overall marketplace.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","Okay. Then just one question on litigation, Mike, just can you give us any update on timing on when you think we will hear something from the J&J bench trial? If there is anything you can say generally it would be helpful to folks on this topic, I am sure people would be interested if there's anything to say, but just mostly looking for a timing update.","Dan Brennan","Sure. Bob, this is Dan. I think as many folks might know, it's a bench trial. It starts November 25th, November 20th, runs through the 25th. If there is more time needed, there's some time set aside the [week] of 15th to wrap it up. We feel confident in our position heading into that. I feel like it's a high bar that needs to be proven in that and it's intended to bench trial post the completion of the trial then the judge will issue his decision at some point post the trial.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","Hi. Good morning. Two questions, first, for you, Mike. In the U.S., a very strong ICD quarter, you raised your guidance on the S-ICD, so that was a contributor. You also called out the quad can in that performance.","In the fourth quarter here, Medtronic will be in the market with their quad can and quad pole, so I wondering if you can discuss how we see the market dynamics playing out for Boston Scientific in the fourth quarter and going forward with Medtronic on the market with both, a quad X and quad [pole]? Thanks.","Mike Mahoney","When we look at CRM, we are really pleased with our performance globally, particularly in Europe. Again, we have more of our most recent portfolio. In terms of market overall, we think the market has stabilized a bit, so it is probably flat to maybe down slightly in 2014.","As Dan mentioned, when you look at the kind of 12-month rolling average, we are up 2%, so we are growing faster than the underlying market. We are still having quite a bit of portfolio to bring to the U.S.","In terms of just our performance, I think when you look at our position in it, we will continue to accelerate S-ICD development. I think that we will continue to get more clinical traction and more comfort level with physicians, so we are positive about that.","We will also going into 2015, have our full year of our MINI platform as well as our quad generator, so in CRT-D, kind of pointing your question there, we feel like we have gained share in de novo implants. We continue to lose a little bit of share on replacement headwinds.","I think despite Medtronic coming to market there, I think, physicians really value the battery longevity capabilities that we offer in our products, so we are very comfortable with the momentum that the CRM business has as we look forward to 2015.","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Dan, can you give us an update on the Mesh litigation, how much is reserved and did you add to any of those reserves in the third quarter? Thanks.","Dan Brennan","Sure, Glenn. As you know, we don't disclose specific components of our reserve. We obviously review our reserve every quarter and believe it reflects what's probable and [estimateable] at that time.","Our accrual for all legal matters of which Mesh is a portion is $945 million as of the end of September, but as you can appreciate I am not going to break that out specifically by individual litigation matter.","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","Can you tell us if that $945 million at the end of September, was that an increase from 2Q or 1Q?","Dan Brennan","It was an increase. Yes. We had $139 million increase in litigation from Q2 to Q3, $139 million charge.","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","Good job on the quarter. Dan, I couldn't help, but ask a tax question, because I know you love how I ask tax questions. Can you just kind of walk us through. I know you gave some helpful comments at Morgan Stanley in September just on the tax outlook.","Maybe just kind of go over the tax position again and comment on to what extent you guys have an exposure or utilize the double-IRS situation? Then also I have a second follow-up after that.","Dan Brennan","Sure. I will start with the double-IRS, so we don't anticipate that the double-IRS would have any impact on our structure. Then relative to overall broader tax commentary, in our prepared remarks, I had mentioned that we think Q4 tax rate will be between 12% and 14%.","Overall this year 12% to 13%, sticking next year with 13% to 15%, overall, again, all that assumes that the R&D tax credit is not reenacted that's worth up to 200 basis points on our overall rate.","Then beyond 2015, as we look to balance all of the elements of our structure, you would see movements in that 100-basis point range increase from 16 outward.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","100 basis points each year going out.","Dan Brennan","Correct.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","Then can you review with us too just the IRS litigation and dispute that you have with the total amount that they are asserting that you owe them and just kind of the context of, I guess, the broader liability picture with the 945. What kind of the total cash potential outflows could be over the next three years or so?","Dan Brennan","Sure. Just in summary on the guiding transfer pricing matter what the IRS has asserted for the period that's in the question now is $1,162 billion, which is in our SEC filings plus interest. What we have in total for all of our tax controversies is $1.5 billion of which [guide] TPV as a portion that and we obviously don't disclose the specifics of that reserve.","From a timing perspective, it has moved more slowly than we would have anticipated and the next event will be scheduling a trial date which could be in '16 or later. With ultimate resolution in '17 or beyond, so it has moved at a pretty slow pace overall relative to the expected timing.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brooks West with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Brooks West - Piper Jaffray","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Question for Keith on LOTUS, just trying to get any anecdotal feedback on the clinical performance with the expanded offering, I know you had data at London Valves. Just any update on the program in Europe would be helpful. Then I have got one follow-up.","Keith Dawkins","Sure, Brooks. As you know at London Valves, we presented the 250 patients out of REPRISE II extension, which confirms excellent key performance and importantly and adjudicated moderate power valve leak rate is 0.6%, which I think is best-in-class of 30 days and no severe leak.","We are continuing the investigation of LOTUS in Europe with the Respond trial which a 1,000-patient post market study. That's on track in terms of recruitment. Also, in that trial, unlike a REPRISE II extension is the addition of the third valve size 25 millimeter valves, so there is 23 millimeter, 25 millimeter and 27 millimeter and that we knew from the REPRISE II CE Mark trial that there are a number of patients that fell within that 25 millimeter range, who didn't get the valve because we didn't have a 27 millimeter and that that negatively affect the pacemaker rate, so it's too early to say yet whether the pacemaker rate is full and with the additional 25 millimeter valve.","We will know that from the RESPONSE study. Also, we had had three strong live cases at PCT and another three strong live cases at London Valves, and one of those three at London Valves was a direct aortic implant in terms of hospital with an excellent result. That's [access].","We are continuing to pursue with the LOTUS valve. Then just finally, of course, our pivotal REPRISE III trial has already started in this country, which is a head-to-head comparison with core valve, just over 1,000 patients. That, plus our pipeline, which is in development makes us very comforted about our offerings.","Brooks West - Piper Jaffray","Thanks for that. Maybe just a quick follow-up there, when would we see the registry data in Europe and get a read on the pacemaker rate. Then just on the Bayer acquisition, maybe not as much of a focus for investors, but that is a piece of business that really has not been invested in for the last couple years.","Just wondering, now that you have got a month or so under your belt there, if you could give a little more clarity on the opportunity set and kind of how we could see the peripheral business grow at Boston Scientific looking forward?","Mike Mahoney","I will just answer the first part of that question. We will have an early count of the RESPOND data before 1,000 patients are recruited. We have not made public the time point of that as yet.","Brooks West - Piper Jaffray","Thank you.","Dan Brennan","Yes. Just a quick comment on our peripheral business, year-to-date, through third quarter it is up about that 6%. Then there is 9% in the quarter with Bayer and probably about 5% or so ex-Bayer.","Overall, our views on it Brooks, haven't changed. We have a nice addition there, where we have an excellent sales force. It's already calling on those customers and there are two segments that we didn't plan and they are clear leader in thrombectomy, so that's a nice addition for us and also in the atherectomy market, you have a market that is growing and it is a market that will put additional investment in terms of the portfolio in both, in the cardiovascular side and also the peripheral side.","It is a nice addition for us. It leverages our current sales force and capabilities as well as operations and we continue to invest in that peripheral vascular market and that should be a nice piece for us.","Brooks West - Piper Jaffray","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","Thanks for taking the question. I had one housekeeping question and two real questions. Dan, on the 4% to 6% organic growth guidance for Q4 is that with or without acquisitions?","Dan Brennan","That's with.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","Is that adjusted for acquisitions or not? In other words, if you adjust for acquisitions, would it be more like 2% to 4% or not?","Dan Brennan","That's correct. Yes. The Bayer and Bard are a little north of 150 basis points, so you back that off of the 4% to 6%. Yes.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","Underlying, you are calling for basically about 2% to 4%. Is that correct? Is there any reason why you would expect it to decelerate a little bit from Q3?","Dan Brennan","Yes. 2.5% to 4.5% is probably the way we would characterize it. There is a couple things that would drive that, some that are Q3 this year-related and some that are Q4 last year-related.","On Q4 last year simple one, we grew 5% last year in Q4, so that was our strongest quarter to-date, so it's a little bit tougher comp overall. Specifically in that comp, is a really tough neuromod comp of 33% growth that they had last year in the fourth quarter.","Then when you think of Q3, we had some businesses that significantly outperformed their underlying market growth rates. If you think IC, endo and CRM at 8, 7 and 4, so a more normalized growth rate they and that puts you into the range that we have put out for the fourth quarter.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","Okay. That's helpful. I wanted to ask one on SYNERGY and one on the J&J litigation. For Keith, prior bioabsorbable polymer drug-eluting stent trials have not shown a clinical difference from durable polymer DES, at one year, how important do you think the clinical difference is at one year for the market acceptance of SYNERGY in the U.S.? Then on J&J, Mike, I appreciate your comments earlier.","Dan, maybe if you could - it's been obviously an overhang for the stock, if you could kind of lay out what you think the key issues are, the facts on your side of the argument, and your ability to manage an unfavorable outcome should that happen. Thanks.","Dan Brennan","Thanks, Larry. I think it's important to understand that all bioabsorbable polymer stents are not similar, so the data for some of the competitor products available in Europe have really related to a thick stent with a thick layer of polymer that laid to resolve.","As you know, we will be interested to see the results of the EVOLVE II pivotal trial which, which is a late break around the 19th of November at AHA, and this will be the first bioabsorbable polymer pivotal trial in the U.S. and we are anticipating FDA approval is in July 2015.","I think, the fact that the polymer and the drug synchronously disappears at about three months time point makes SYNERGY interesting. Obviously, we will give us the opportunity to firm exploring short dual antiplatelet therapy.","Couple that with your key performance, which is I think well-recognized, we are very competent. This is a product and we will be excited to bring it to the U.S. Incidentally, as a note, that we will be holding an investor event in Chicago after the presentation on November 19th. The event will be at 1 pm. Central Time and we can obviously discuss the details of the trial at that time.","Dan Brennan","Then Larry, on the J&J case, this Dan. Two parts to your question, I don't think it would serve us well to get into all of specifics of why we feel like confident relative to our position there. As you can certainly appreciate, the last piece in terms of our ability to deal with any unfavorable outcome, we are confident that we can deal with that.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Josh Jennings - Cowen & Company","Hi. Thanks for getting me involved. I appreciate it. I just wanted to first start with maybe some commentary if you would on the health of the U.S. and international ICD markets from a pricing and volume perspective and your outlook for these markets going forward.","Just on the subcutaneous ICD, increasing your guidance it is nice to see, but maybe you could talk about where you are having the most success on the implant side? Is it cannibalizing or gaining share in the single market segment or is the subcutaneous ICD actually expanding the market and you are having success implants in patients that were previously contraindicated for an [vascular] device?","Mike Mahoney","Yes. Just some comments in the market, just to reinforce what I mentioned a little bit earlier, there are still a challenging market, but we think it's improved slightly, so we are calling the overall CRM market kind of flattish to slightly down negative. There may be kind of zero to negative-2 in terms of the full-year when you roll together both, CRM, including pacemaker and defibrillators.","As we indicated before, we are going a little bit faster than market, quite a bit faster in Europe, where we have all of our new products and slightly faster than market died in the U.S.","Overall, we are pleased with our performance. On S-ICD, I am probably not going to give can give you all the information wanted there. I think as we talked about, we are being very thoughtful with the rollout of S-ICD in terms of our training, the clinical build that we have with it. We have given guidance earlier in the year of $75 million. We are taking that up to comfortable of delivering against 100. We will likely provide additional insights in terms of our clinical strategy and growth prospects as we point towards our January '15.call.","In terms of the marketplace itself, we do think on occasion, it clearly expands the market in some ways. Some patients typically could have an ICD, but there would be young patients, patients with the venous access issues, so in some cases it will expand their market.","Overall, I think if you look at BSE in our portfolio, you have a market that's we think more stable than it has in the past and we the unique innovative platform that's multi-years ahead of the competition that we are committed to building clinical evidence from. Having a product is helpful and strengthens our full Rhythm Management business when you take into account our EP business and more traditional ICDs. Ken Stein, I am not sure if you have any additional comments you would like to make. Dr. Stein?","Ken Stein","Yes. Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Josh. I just want to reiterate what is Mike saying, it's very hard to break down how many of these patients are going to be S-ICD or patients who would otherwise have gotten it transvenous system and certainly we are very happy with our transvenous system as well.","I think if you look at who are the really strong candidates, one of the obvious candidates for the S-ICD today, these are the patient who don't have vascular access or patient who have had recurrent or prior infected transvenous systems, patients with renal failure.","Even though I don't think we have any way to breakdown how many of those would not have gotten that transvenous ICD, certainly there's large number of them who are just completely new to the market.","Josh Jennings - Cowen & Company","If I could ask one follow-up for Dr Stein? Mike, I heard your comments about you are still comfortable with the $500 million market opportunity for the WATCHMAN, I think there has been some consternation after the panel with a lot of panel members, recommending a label of it being \"Second-line therapy.\"","I am just wondering if I could some prospects from Dr Stein about, what has changed in terms of that guidance by the panel as a second-line therapy and does that impact the overall market opportunity? Thanks a lot","Ken Stein","Yes. I will take that. Thanks, Josh. I am just glad. I think what you recognize is you what's important on the panel and beyond the vote, so the commentary and the explanations of the panel members made for the vote. We really are very pleased with the overall outcome of the panel.","I think if you looked at what the comments are and what they said is that they really wanted us just to be more clear in our labeling about who are the appropriate patients for and if you look at we said, I think we are in full agreement with them.","We have never ever thought that this device will have to be a broad replacement for oral anticoagulant therapy. This is a device for patients who are eligible to take warfarin but who for one reason or another have valid clinical reasons to prefer long-term alternative.","What we can't get into details of any our discussions with FDA at this point, from our standpoint really what the panel was asking us to do was to clarify what we have always said we believe to be the appropriate patient population.","Susie Lisa","Okay.

Please go ahead.","Susan Vissers Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thank you, David. Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q4 2016 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release, as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financial Information.","The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour.

Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Good morning. Thank you, Susie, and good morning everyone. Boston Scientific delivered excellent financial results in Q4 2016 with 10% organic revenue growth, a 200 basis point improvement to profitability and 14% adjusted EPS growth. These Q4 results closed out a very strong 2016 overall, with 10% full year organic revenue growth, a 180 basis point improvement to profitability and 20% adjusted EPS growth to $1.11. This 20% adjusted EPS growth includes a significant $0.06 negative foreign exchange impact. We're pleased that we were able to overcome this FX headwind and still deliver strong double-digit adjusted EPS growth.","Our strategy of category leadership in key markets and a diversification into high growth adjacencies is working. It enables us continued investment in innovative medical technologies. We continue to execute against and exceed our strategic plan goals. We believe Boston Scientific is uniquely positioned to drive shareholder value due to our long-term growth profile, ability to improve operating margin significantly and our track record for consistently delivering double-digit adjusted EPS growth.","Point of fact for our previous stated goals, we continue to expect to deliver 25% plus adjusted operating margin in 2017, with plans to deliver an additional 300 basis points of improvement by year-end 2020 to 28%.","We're excited about 2017 and our plans to build upon our global momentum. We are targeting full year 2017 operating revenue growth of 5% to 7% which includes an approximate 70 basis point contribution from the EndoChoice acquisition. We are guiding to adjusted EPS of $1.22 to $1.26, representing 10% to 13% EPS growth. Importantly, this EPS growth includes an expected $0.08 negative or 700 basis point headwind impact from foreign exchange.","I'll now provide some highlights in Q4 and 2016 results, along with thoughts on our 2017 outlook. In my remarks all references to growth are on a, organic year over year constant currency basis unless otherwise specified.","Our Q4 organic growth of 10% was once again very broad based across businesses and regions, led by exciting new product launches, continued global expansion and execution of our category leadership strategy. Diversification of our portfolio has helped us drive excellent results with Q4 sales of 11% in MedSurg, 11% in Cardiovascular and 7% in Rhythm Management. Five of our seven businesses grew revenue double digits and most of our businesses grew faster than the market.","We delivered another quarter of balanced global growth led by 13% revenue growth in Asia, including 10% growth in Japan, 11% growth in the US and 7% in Europe. Another highlight was strong 17% revenue growth in the emerging markets, led by 21% growth in China.","Importantly, the MedSurg businesses continued to deliver. In endoscopy, we posted 8% growth in Q4, fueled by the strength of our portfolio including the SpyGlass DS Visualization System, AXIOS Stent for pancreatic fluid collections and the Resolution 360 Hemostasis Clip. Sum of these three products led our full year 2016 endoscopy growth to 9%.","And SpyGlass DS is an advanced single-use visualization system for the diagnosis and treatment of complex disorders of the pancreas and bile ducts. It's really a cornerstone platform that is highly differentiated and complementary to our core business. Our AXIOS Stent is used for transluminal drainage of pancreatic fluid and reflects the type of innovation we're bringing in endoluminal surgery and other exciting therapeutic categories including pulmonary and oncology to further enhance our global leadership position in endo.","Finally, after closing the EndoChoice acquisition in November 2016, we're expanding our presence in the ambulatory surgery center segment of the market and are excited to offer physicians tailored services from the only GI-specific pathology laboratory in the United States. As previously announced, we're pursuing strategic options for the EndoChoice FUSE colonoscope business and we'll update you when possible.","Turning to urology and pelvic health, we continued our strong performance, growing sales 14% organically in both Q4 and for the full year 2016, led by pelvic floor, laser fibers, strong international growth and the ongoing launch of LithoVue, our single-use digital scope. LithoVue is now in 500 accounts worldwide and provides visualization and navigation capabilities to diagnose and treat stones and other conditions of the kidney, ureter and bladder, while avoiding the need for repairs or sterilization that can be a challenge with reusable scopes.","The AMS acquisition closed on August 15 and we're pleased to report that revenue from AMS grew 5% in 2016. We executed $35 million of AMS synergies in 2016 and remain on track to realize our adjusted EPS accretion goals of $0.07 in 2017.","Turning to neuromodulation, we grew revenue 16% in Q4, led by a solid growth in the U.S. and strong international growth from both SCS and deep brain stimulation. We're also encouraged to see double-digit growth in U.S. spinal cord stim trialing in the quarter.","European uptake of our Vercise DBS Stimulation System has been very promising, in large part due to the Cartesia Directional Lead platform and our partnership with Brainlab for cerebral visualization and mapping. We continue to expect to launch in the U.S. DBS market by year-end 2017.","With respect to our ACCELERATE clinical trial program, after a pre-specified review of the data, we will continue enrollment through the end of 2017, with the results now expected in mid-2018. We do not expect to comment any further on the status of the trial until it has been completed.","Our Cardiovascular group grew 11% in Q4 and 12% for the full year. Peripheral interventions grew 10% in the quarter, which is its fifth straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth and capping off 12% growth for the full year. Q4 organic revenue growth in the division was balanced regionally with double-digit growth in Europe, Asia and Latin America, and our single high-digit growth in the U.S.","Our drug-eluting technologies and thrombectomy portfolio continued to deliver. In drug-eluting technologies, we have two near-term priorities: first, to complete enrollment in IMPERIAL IDE for our Eluvia drug-eluting stent; and secondly, enrollment for the IDE trial for our Ranger Drug-Coated Balloon in the U.S.","Interventional cardiology continued its above-market growth trend, delivering 12% growth in the quarter and 13% for the full year. IC growth was led worldwide by continued strength in drug-eluting stents, PCI Guidance and structural heart. Global DES sales grew double-digit, led by SYNERGY, which ended the year at the high end of our guidance range for 50% to 60% of our worldwide DES mix. We're also really pleased to announce the recent approval of SYNERGY in China.","PCI Guidance also grew double-digits on strong performance in both IVUS and our COMET fractional flow reserve platform. IC performance was also fueled by our structural heart business, which includes the LOTUS Aortic Valve and WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure.","As we disclosed last month, 2016 structural heart revenue exceeded our $175 million to $200 million guidance range. And we expect revenue from these two franchises to contribute approximately $300 million in 2017. We're truly in an exciting position to drive growth and share gains over the long run in these fast-growing markets.","LOTUS delivered a strong quarter in the European market, as the platform continues to build momentum. LOTUS offers physicians unparalleled control during implantation and best-in-class paravalvular leakage rates. Importantly, we continue to enhance the LOTUS platform via LOTUS Edge, which is a more flexible and lower profile delivery system, and Depth Guard which minimizes LVOT interaction during deployment.","We expect to present RESPOND extension data on LOTUS with Depth Guard at EuroPCR in May, which will provide further insight into reducing our PPM rates, while maintaining best-in-class PVL rates. We plan to restart the REPRISE EDGE study in Q2 and launch LOTUS Edge in Europe in Q3. We're also excited to present pivotal trial REPRISE III at EuroPCR in May and believe we remain on track for a second quarter PMA filing and FDA approval by year-end 2017.","The WATCHMAN platform also delivered an exciting quarter with strong growth from existing centers and a continued steady pace of opening new centers. We ended 2016 with over 200 U.S. WATCHMAN centers and expect to close 2017 with approximately 350 centers. This quarter we plan to enroll our first patient in ASAP 2, which is a study examining the use of WATCHMAN in warfarin-ineligible patients and SALUTE, a trial specifically designed to pursue regulatory approval in Japan. So overall, we're extremely pleased with our progress in structural heart and excited about our capabilities and long-term prospects for this business.","Global CRM sales accelerated to a very impressive 8% growth in the quarter, and 3% for the full year 2016 .In Q4, we delivered double digit growth in the US and low single digit growth overseas. The US strength reflects continued share gains with our ACCOLADE MRI Brady platform as well as strong global growth in EMBLEM S-ICD and Quad X4 CRT-P. In the quarter, Japan grew double digits on strong S-ICD adoption, and we're launching our MRI-compatible version of EMBLEM later this quarter in Japan.","In CRM in 2017, we're very excited about our upcoming next generation high-voltage launches. The RESONATE family of ICDs and CRT-Ds will bring multipoint pacing to our CRT products. Updated best-in-class longevity labeling, via our EnduraLife batteries across all families of high-voltage devices and the first and only validated heart failure predictive diagnostic in HeartLogic. The clinical data supporting HeartLogic was presented as a late-breaker at AHA in November. And we have CE Mark in hand, and we'll begin the RESONATE launch in the EU shortly. US approval is expected in Q3.","Turning to electrophysiology, we grew sales 5% in the quarter, and importantly, we're excited about our new RHYTHMIA HDx platform, which provides significant improvements in workflow efficiency and performance, and also enables the platform to support future innovative features and functionality. We're launching the HDx platform in Europe and expect to launch in the US in second quarter.","We continue to strengthen our EP business, and we look forward to multiple therapeutic catheter launches in the second half of 2017 in the EU and the US.","Our strategy of category leadership is working. It's helping us become a stronger partner to our global customers. Our company has excellent momentum going in 2017, and our outstanding 2016 results reflect the strength of our portfolio, our investment in the faster growth segments, our globalization efforts and focus on improving profitability.","We believe we are poised for a strong 2017, and we're very well positioned to continue and strengthen our performance track record in 2018 and beyond, as we enter significant new markets with the differentiated products and platforms that address the unmet needs of physicians and their patients. I truly want to thank our employees for their high performance results, their winning spirit and commitment to advancing science and improving the lives of patients around the world.","Now, let me turn the call over to Daniel for a detailed review of our financials.","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thanks, Mike. Fourth quarter consolidated revenue of $2.191 billion represented 11% growth on both an operational and reported basis. This strong top line reflects an unexpected $20 million headwind from foreign exchange, compared to an immaterial tailwind expected at the time of guidance. Excluding an approximate 40 basis point contribution from EndoChoice acquisition that closed at the end of November, organic revenue growth was 10% in the quarter compared to our guidance range of 7% to 9%.","We delivered Q4 adjusted earnings per share of $0.30, representing 14% year over year growth and exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.27 to $0.29. The double digit adjusted earnings per share growth in Q4 was driven primarily by strong revenue growth, and would have further exceeded our guidance range if not for certain inventory charges related to our LOTUS Edge voluntary field action. I'll provide more details on the inventory charges shortly.","Our full year 2016 consolidated revenue of $8.386 billion grew 12% on both an operational and reported basis and 10% organically, which excludes the contributions from the AMS male urology portfolio and EndoChoice acquisitions in their respective periods. Full year 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $1.11 represents 20% growth, and excluding the $0.06 FX headwind that we effectively offset through operational savings and initiatives, adjusted earnings per share grew 26% versus 2015.","Adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 72.6% compared to 72.8% in Q4 of 2015, and includes the year over year negative 120 basis point impact from foreign exchange. As a result of the LOTUS Edge voluntary field action initiated in November, in which we paused our European limited market release due to an issue with the deployment pin, we recorded inventory charges equivalent to approximately 50 basis points. Absent these charges, gross margin would have exceeded the high end of our guidance range. As disclosed last month, we believe we've identified both the issue and the solution to fix the deployment pin, which is a combination of minor process and specification changes and remain on track with our expected US timelines.","For the full year 2016, adjusted gross margin was 72%, consistent with the prior year, despite the year over year negative 90 basis point impact from foreign exchange. Costs related to our new Malaysia manufacturing plant and AMS integration and quality remediation expenses.","Adjusted SG&A expenses were $801 million or 36.5% of sales in Q4, down 170 basis points year over year, as we realized the benefit of our targeted initiatives focused on reducing SG&A, offset partially by the reinvestment of the medical device excise tax benefit. As we disclosed during the year, we spent the entire medical device excise tax benefit, but the majority of that reinvestment took place in Q2 through Q4. We continue to make progress on our margin expansion targets, as our full year 2016 adjusted SG&A rate of 36.1% is down 130 basis points versus full year 2015.","Adjusted research and development expenses were $251 million in the fourth quarter, or 11.5% of sales, which is down 50 basis points year over year. For the full year 2016, adjusted R&D expenses were $914 million or 10.9% of sales compared to 11.4% of sales in 2015. Royalty expense was 0.9% of sales in both Q4 and the full year 2016, which is roughly flat year over year for both periods.","Q4 2016 adjusted operating margin of 23.7% increased 200 basis points year over year and was slightly below our guidance range of 24% to 24.5% due to the inventory charges recorded in connection with the LOTUS Edge voluntary field action. Excluding these charges, operating margin would have been at the midpoint of our guidance. And even with these charges, Q4 represents the 10th consecutive quarter in which we have expanded adjusted operating margin by 100 basis points or more over the prior year comparable period.","The Rhythm Management team delivered an adjusted operating margin of 17.9% for both Q4 and the full year 2016. This represents a year over year adjusted operating margin increase of 400 basis points for Q4 and 290 basis points for the full year, as the team continues to make progress on gross margin, focuses on expense control and leverages the improved top-line performance of the global business.","For the full year 2016, total company adjusted operating margin of 24.1% expanded by 180 basis points over the full year 2015. We believe this sets us up well to deliver on our 2017 adjusted operating margin guidance in the mid-25% range, discussed in more detail shortly, and our longer-term 2020 adjusted operating margin target of 28%.","In the fourth quarter, we recorded a total litigation related charge of $172 million, of which $170 million related to mesh and the remaining $2 million increase related to other legal matters. During the quarter, we became aware of additional mesh claims as we continued working through the settlement evaluation process, and have now reached conditional, final or near final settlement on 31,000 of our 42,000 claims. To determine our reserve, we continually assess the volume of known claims, estimated cost to resolve each claim, an estimate of the future claims, and the cost to defend each claim in order to calculate the required reserve and make any necessary adjustments. Having now settled or reached agreement in principle with nearly three quarters of all outstanding claims, we continue to reduce the risk on our balance sheet.","Now I'll move on to interest and other expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $58 million, roughly flat to Q4 of 2015. Our average interest expense rate was 4% in Q4 compared to 3.9% in Q4 of 2015. Other expense was $7 million in the fourth quarter, and primarily included a net gain on investments of $13 million offset primarily by foreign exchange losses related to our hedging program. And for the full year, interest and other expenses were $233 million and $37 million respectively.","Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was negative 39.7% on a reported basis, and 11.2% on an adjusted basis. And for the full year, our tax rate was a negative 95.9% on a reported basis and 12.4% on an adjusted basis. The favorability in our adjusted tax rate versus guidance was due to a better than expected and sustainable geographic mix of profit.","We're making good progress towards finalizing our conditional stipulation of settled issues with the Internal Revenue Service for the 2001 through 2007 tax years. We've now reached an agreement in principle with the IRS as to the resolution of the same transfer pricing issues for the 2008 through 2010 tax years, although final agreement is pending, additional calculations of tax and documentations. As previously disclosed, we expect to make a series of payments related to the settlement, most of which we expect to remit during the second half of this year and into the first half of next year. Furthermore, as a result of the settlement, we expect to have access to at least one additional year of O-US cash, which should put us through the end of 2018.","Finally, Q4 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $0.30 includes approximately $0.02 of unfavorable FX and represents 14% year over year growth or 21% growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange.","The additional $20 million of negative FX on the top line created an additional $0.01 of unfavorable FX, which effectively offset the net gain on investments recorded in the quarter. On a reported GAAP basis, which includes net charges and amortization expense totaling $291 million after tax, Q4 2016 earnings per share was $0.09.","For the full year 2016, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.11 at the high end of our guidance range while absorbing $0.06 of unfavorable FX. Full year 2016 adjusted earnings per share grew 20% over the prior year and 26% excluding the impact of foreign exchange.","On a reported GAAP basis, 2016 earnings per share was $0.25 compared to a full year 2015 GAAP loss per share of $0.18. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $454 million compared to $448 million in Q4 of 2015. In the quarter, we used cash primarily to fund previously agreed upon legal settlements as well as business development activities. As of December 31, 2016, we had cash on hand of $196 million. Our full year 2016 adjusted free cash flow of $1.607 billion met our stretch goal for the year and represents growth of 18% over the full year 2015.","Capital expenditures for the full year 2016 totaled $376 million, slightly ahead of our $350 million target, as we made opportunistic land and equipment purchases to help invest for additional capabilities and to build future capacity. Recall that the higher CapEx spend in 2016, which compares to $248 million in 2015, largely reflects the greenfield build of our Malaysia facility.","We initially expected an incremental $100 million benefit to free cash flow in 2017 as significant portions of the construction are now behind us. However, we now expect a slightly smaller incremental benefit of $75 million, resulting in a targeted $300 million in CapEx in 2017 due to additional investments in LOTUS Valve and SYNERGY manufacturing equipment due to higher than planned volumes as well as campus consolidation and plant network optimization activities that were both included in the restructuring program, which was not approved until mid-2016.","This higher CapEx investment is reflected in our adjusted free cash flow guidance for full year 2017 at $1.750 billion. Near term, our capital allocation priorities continue to be managing contingencies, pursuing M&A, and as of January 1, 2017, share buybacks as our share buyback program is no longer suspended. Any purchases under our share repurchase program would be subject to business development opportunities, market conditions, our stock performance, regulatory trading windows and other factors.","We ended Q4 with 1.377 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. And we expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.395 billion for Q1 2017 and full year 2017. I'll now walk through the guidance for Q1 and the full year 2017. For the full year, we expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $8.675 billion to $8.875 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 5% to 7% on an operational basis, including an approximately 70 basis point contribution from EndoChoice, and 3% to 6% on a reported basis.","We expect foreign exchange to be a headwind of approximately $125 million for the full year 2017. We expect our adjusted gross margin for the year as a percentage of sales to be in a range of 72% to 73% for the full year, which assumes a negative FX impact of 50 basis points. We expect this headwind to be offset by favorable mix, standard cost reduction programs and the ramp of accretive new products.","We expect full year adjusted SG&A to be in the range of 35% to 36% of sales as we continue to see the benefits of programs currently underway continuing to offset our reinvestment of the medical device tax suspension benefit. In 2017, we will again reinvest the full benefit of the suspension with strong investments in structural heart and other exciting and durable growth platforms.","Full year adjusted R&D is expected to be in a range of 10.5% to 11.5%. And we expect our royalty rate to remain at approximately 1% of sales for the year. This implies a full year 2017 adjusted operating margin in a range of 25% to 26%, which would deliver on our goal from both our 2013 and 2015 Investor Days to deliver 25% plus adjusted operating margin in 2017. At the midpoint of 25.5%, this would represent 140 basis points of improvement over the full year 2016.","We forecast our 2017 adjusted tax rate between 12.5% and 13.5%, including approximately a 125 basis points of benefit from adopting the new accounting standard for stock compensation. Absent the new standard, we would have forecasted an adjusted tax rate of approximately 14%. This forecast is approximately 100 basis points lower than the previous direction we provided due to the sustainable favorability in our 2016 tax rate as well as the access to the additional year of OUS cash that I mentioned. We continue to expect our tax rate to rise by 100 basis points annually for the next few years.","As a result, we expect full year 2017 adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.22 to $1.26, representing 10% to 13% adjusted earnings growth, which now assumes the full year negative impact of FX will be approximately $0.08 or approximately $0.02 per quarter compared to our previous expectations of $0.06 to $0.07, due to the volatility in rates we've seen over the last few months. In addition, our EPS guidance includes a $0.02 benefit from the accounting change related to stock compensation, the majority of which will occur during the first quarter due to vesting of our annual grants. On a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share to be in a range of $0.86 to $0.91.","Turning to Q1 2017, we expect consolidated revenue to be in a range of $2.050 billion to $2.100 billion. This represents year-over-year growth in a range of 6% to 8% operationally, including the 70 basis point contribution from EndoChoice. We expect the foreign exchange impact on Q1 revenue to be a $20 million headwind.","For the first quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.29 to $0.31 per share and GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.18 to $0.21 per share. As a reminder, our Q1 2016 operating margin of 25.1% was the highest of the year and resulting adjusted earnings per share of $0.28 was also higher from not yet spending the full benefit of the medical device excise tax suspension.","Please check our Investor Relations website for Q4 2016 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q4 and full year results, as well as Q1 and full year 2017 guidance, including P&L line item guidance.","So, with that, I'll turn it back to Susie, who will moderate the Q&A.","Susan Vissers Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thanks, Daniel. David, let's open it up to questions for the next 30 minutes or so. In order to enable us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. David, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And the first question will come from Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning and thanks for taking the questions and also congrats on another fantastic quarter. Maybe just a couple items. So, number one, Dan, could you share with us your thoughts on the cadence of organic growth over the course of the year? Obviously your comparisons get more difficult and so would love to just get your thoughts in terms of how the year plays out, number one.","Number two, the CRM business benefited particularly on the ICD side from the challenges at St. Jude. Just can you give us your thoughts on sustainability? Then I'll sneak in a third, which is just the comment on the ACCELERATE trial, Mike, basically it sounded like you were trying to enroll some more patients at the corrected or new lead position. Is that accurate? Thanks.","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Sure, Mike. Thanks. I'll take the cadence of growth and then Mike can take the other two. In terms of that, I think it really comes down to comps. So obviously very pleased with the organic revenue growth of 10% in Q4 and the full year last year, and believe we've got good momentum heading into 2017. And I think the overall guidance that we have from what we've seen compares very favorably to our peers. When you look at comps, I think that's really where that the Q1 and then the rest of the year story comes in. Our comp for Q1 in 2017 is 8%, so slightly lower than the next three quarters, which are 10%, 9% and 10%. So that's really the cadence as to why Q1 is higher than what you'd see in the last three quarters, is really comes down to overall comps for the company.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Sure and thanks, Mike, a couple comments on CRM. We're obviously really pleased with the performance in the quarter. The business as we talked about grew 8% in the quarter, 3% for the full year, which is we think nicely above the marketplace. And pacer growth has been very strong, 22%. There is some competitive approvals, which we thought would happen about six months ago. But we still expect to do, grow our pacer business beyond the marketplace in 2017.","Really excited about what's going on in defib globally. The S-ICD continues to be highly differentiated, continues to have strong uptake around the world, and really is a very big differentiator for our defib platform. We have our MRI defib platform approved international markets. We hope to have that done by the end of the year in the US.","And what we're really excited about, I commented briefly on the script is the RESONATE launch, which will be effectively in first quarter in Europe. And we think this is very unique, has very differentiated multipoint pacing. It even extends our longevity benefit greater based on additional labeling, and also contains \u2013 we can detail it more with Ken and also at Investor Day, HeartLogic, which we think is a very differentiated heart failure diagnostic tool only available on the RESONATE platform. You combine that with we think CRT, our headwind in replacements will become a bit more of a tailwind throughout 2017. So we think the future is bright in CRM, and particularly once we have our defib MRI approval at the end of the year.","With respect to your third question, you snuck three in there, very impressive. With the third one on the novel (34:23) ACCELERATE, really not much more to comment. We were enabled a pre-specified interim review of the data that was constructed as part of the trial design. We obviously took advantage of that. We feel it's in our best interest, especially given the growth of that division, 12% growth for the full year and 16% in the fourth quarter, and strong momentum internationally and US in spinal cord stim. So we'll continue to enroll that ACCELERATE trial, Likely take to the end of 2017 to finish enrollment, and we'll report out the results when appropriate likely in mid-2018.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Perfect. Thank you, Mike.","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, and I'll just throw in two to get us back on track, but congrats on a good quarter. Dan, just one on cash for you, and then maybe a broader question on R&D. I guess first of all on cash, so cash flow starts becoming a much bigger driver to the business here over these next three years, specifically kind of 2018 and 2019. But you do have significant cash outflows this year. Could you sort of walk us through the timing of sort of mesh and tax payments here in 2017? And with the magnitude of those payments, what impact does that have this year on interest or ability to do M&A and buybacks?","And then another question sort of financially or maybe broadly for Mike. Your R&D spread this year is wider than I can remember in past. I maybe wrong about that, but it seems they're pretty widespread. What gets you to the low end and the high end of the R&D investment cycle this year? And I'll jump back in queue. Thank you.","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Sure, David. So relative to the cash question, I think as you know, we've a significant effort underway to really to derisk and eliminate a lot of the larger liabilities from the balance sheet, as you mentioned, two of the biggest ones being the tax and the mesh. The way we would look at that is by the middle of 2018, we should have put the majority of mesh behind us, right. As you heard in the prepared comments, 31,000 out of the 42,000 are behind us now relative to settlement. The payment of that obviously will lag a little bit, but 2017 and into tail end of 2018 is what we would see there.","The tax, we've mentioned that before, a little more than $500 million, and that should be the majority of that in the back half of 2017 and some might trickle into 2018. So 2017 may be a little bit more constrained on the cash side, although I will say from a credit rating perspective, and our leverage metrics, we start to really free that up as we get to the back half of this year and get back to our capital structure goal. So probably have a little bit more room on that front. So I'd look at 2017 as putting a lot of those liabilities behind us and really freeing it up for 2018 and beyond.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah thanks, David. On the R&D side, we do spend full year almost 11%. Fourth quarter went up a little bit more at 11.5%. We're actually quite pleased about our ability to invest in R&D, and it really gives us the confidence to deliver a strong 2017. And importantly, as we've outlined, we think we'll accelerate growth in 2018 and beyond. A big part of the spend, especially you saw the uptick in Q4 as we have a number of significant clinical trials going on, and the weighting of our clinical trial mix within R&D is a bit higher given that.","So, we have two significant trials going on at PI and the drug-eluting, which we think will differentiators us for years to come in that area. We have a lot of clinical work going on in WATCHMAN and significant clinical spend in LOTUS globally. And so we do expect over time that our R&D as a percent of sales will decrease a bit as we march to our operating income targets. But right now, we're going through a heavier bolus of investment at clinical, which will pay off for the company in 2018 and beyond.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And Mike, sorry, I may have lied. I want to just follow quickly on the clinical spend. One of the clinical trials, I think you mentioned obviously accelerating the update there. I may have missed it, on WHISPER, can you just update us on the timing for WHISPER and when we could expect data?","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah. So that one is on track. The detail is obviously in clinicaltrials.gov. We believe that we'll finish the enrollment of that trial by the year end 2017, so December 2017. And so we haven't provided any additional details on the readout of the data, but we hope to finish enrollment by the end of the year.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Could it be NANS 2018 or probably too early?","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Actually not sure. So, we'll finish the trial, then we'll go through the appropriate steps. Not sure if it will happen in NANS or not.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much. Nice quarter.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, David.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","Hi. Thanks. Okay. Can you hear me? Can you hear me okay?","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Can hear you fine, Bob.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","Great. Good morning. So, I have two questions. The first one is on LOTUS. I just wonder if you guys, if you could just confirm that the device you expect to have approved in the US is indeed LOTUS Edge. And then can you just give us a sense as to when we'll next see some longer term pacer rate data from the LOTUS Edge Australia or the patients that were enrolled in REPRISE Edge before the ship hold? Just curious as to when we'll see some more data there.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thanks, Bob. Yes, we do expect to launch in the US with LOTUS Edge. We're optimistic that we'll have approval by year end of 2017 and I'll have Dr. Ian Meredith comment a bit more on some of the clinical information.","Ian Meredith - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thanks, Mike. So, to address the question of pace, longer term data with pacemakers, at the ACC meeting, you will see 30-day data presented on the first-in-human use of the LOTUS Edge platform. We presented that data as a seven-day discharge data at TCT last year. So you will see 30-day data at ACC. And at EuroPCR, you will see longer term follow-up data on the LOTUS with Depth Guard, which will provide significant insight into the benefits of Depth Guard technology on LOTUS Edge.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","Okay, great. Thanks for that. And then one follow up for Dan on the finance side. Two quick things, one can you just give us your updated views on the potential impact of tax rate reform? Just given your low tax rate, just any updated thoughts there would be great. And then also maybe if you could just quickly comment on why the FX headwind is a little worse. You mentioned greater volatility in rates, but looks like rates have kind of gone in your favors since you last gave guidance. So just curious as to why the FX hit is a little worse than you talked about in December.","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Sure. I'll hit the FX one first. Yeah, and it really is, it's the market basket of all the currencies that we track, right. So we hedge certain ones, largely the yen and the euro. But when you look at what's happened since we had kind of snapped the line on that, the overall trend does see $0.08 versus the $0.06 to $0.07 that we had. And it's also a function of the hedges that we have, when we layer in the hedges and how those roll off. So the $0.08 is the most accurate number as we sit today.","In terms of tax reform, just broadly, obviously a lot of proposals out there. And where we support it, right, relative to making something we have competitive tax rates for the US companies versus global peers, and that provides us as US companies with much better access to our global cash flows. There's a lot of uncertainty out there relative to what the timing would be and the details are pretty scarce relative to transition rules as well. So as you would imagine, we follow that very closely. Some of them are good for us. Some of them are not as good for us and once the tea leaves are out and we see some final proposals, we'll let folks know what the impact is.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","But could it put some upward pressure, though, on the guidance that you've given or?","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Well, it really depends on how they come out. Let me just give you an example, right. So the interest rate deductibility, right, the timing of when that will be put in and what could potentially be grandfathered. Are you, is it from dollar one, are you grandfathered with the existing debt on your balance sheet today, is it only future debt? Those types of things could have big swings. And so it's tough to guess until we actually see what comes out as a final rule.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","Thanks, guys, and congrats on the 10%.","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Next we go to the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning everybody. Michael, actually I think I'll start with Daniel. Balance sheet again here, starting in 2018, just following up in your earlier comments, it looks like free cash flow is going to be relatively less encumbered as you move past some of these past challenges. And when you think about it, assuming further growth and less encumbrance, I mean as I think about 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, I mean you could be generating $4 billion, $5 billion, $6 billion in total cash during that period. That might be a bit optimistic, but even in a period where your cash was encumbered, you were able to be active on the M&A front. Maybe just reflect on some of these topics and as you look out beyond 2017, how are you thinking about that cash opportunity? Will you be more aggressive on M&A portfolio? Are you going to be more aggressive on share repo, instate a dividend? Just help us reflect on those.","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Sure. Thanks, Richard. In terms of looking out beyond 2017, I think you've hit on it and it kind of goes to the answer to the earlier question from David as well. 2017 and the first half of 2018 is really putting a lot of the liabilities and the things that we have today behind us and I'm excited for that time when we get to 2018, 2019 and beyond as you mentioned. So, our goal this year is $1.750 billion in cash flow. Safe to assume that grows. We've talked recently about having $6 billion over the 2017, 2018, 2019 timeframe in terms of accessible cash and being able to put that to use in M&A and share repurchase have been historically and I think would continue to be our two most favorite uses. The dividend probably in the short-term is probably not in the cards, but it's something that we continue to look at every year and would evaluate that as we go through those years as well.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. A little follow-up on LOTUS. How optimistic are you that with the evolving implant technique for LOTUS that the pacer rate will stay down at more competitive levels? We had some encouraging conversations with European physicians. And maybe talk about the process of \u2013 and how long it's going to take to retrain European docs, so that you can generate that better data on the higher implant position? Thanks.","Ian Meredith - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thanks, Rick. It's Ian Meredith here. I think I could take that question. I think there are four lines of evidence that support the notion that the pacemaker rate will be substantially lower. The first you have already mentioned is the depth of implantation, even with a classic LOTUS. And that's a widespread practice that is taking place now. And you will see the emergence of more and more similar centers reporting their data with a classic LOTUS device showing lower pacemaker rate. And I think we'll see several more of those abstracts actually appear. So that's the first line of evidence.","The second is classic LOTUS with Depth Guard. You will see presentations at CRT coming up in a week or two on RESPOND Extend which will, of course, only be seven-day data. Meaningful data will be presented at EuroPCR, so that's LOTUS with Depth Guard. That will be an important line of evidence. Then we'll have the trials of the extension of the data that we already have from the first-in-human study that you know of from TCT last year, will be presented at ACC. And then finally the REPRISE EDGE trial which will be the full complement of patients at EuroPCR. So there are four streams of evidence that seem to be moving in the right direction. The technique for implantation I think has been widely adopted already. And that sets a very strong foundation for people's ability to use Depth Guard when they move to LOTUS Edge.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of Brooks West with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Good morning. Can you hear me?","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yes, Brooks.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","We hear you fine, Brooks.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask a question on the cardiovascular franchise. You've got a monster comp that you're looking at for next year and wanted to understand some of the growth drivers in that franchise that might offset. So, would love thoughts on SYNERGY. Are you at peak mix? Is there further penetration of market share to be had? I don't know if there is anything you can give us on structural heart and expectations there. And then also, I wanted to hit your thoughts on the ATTRACT trial that we're going to see at SIR in March and how that might impact Jeff's venous business. Thanks.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Sure. Yeah. We've earned a tough comp in IC and we're proud of it. And I think the most important thing to think is our IC business is very broad. We used to be a DES company and now we're clearly DES, but all the structural heart initiatives, our complex PCI. We'll continue to roll out a new FFR platform. So the diversity of the IC portfolio is quite strong. Certainly, we do have some challenging comps, but we're comfortable that we're going to grow above market.","And I think if you just look at the momentum that we have in the structural heart business, that will be a growth driver overall for IC. We have a nice new launch coming with SYNERGY in China. And we'll continue to expand our SYNERGY market share. We do think we'll likely won't give a number. We do believe there is more mix improvement we can have with SYNERGY given its acceptance of that platform globally. And we also have a number of new launches. I would call them incremental, but they all help, cutting balloons and so forth in complex PCI. So I think given the diversification and geographies, the breadth of that portfolio, the exciting growth in structural heart and our complex CTO bag as well as improved mix of SYNERGY opportunity in China will help grow that business well in 2017.","On ATTRACT, I think that's potentially great upside for the company. I believe that study gets read out in March and we're well-positioned for that business with our ZelanteDVT catheter, our commercial base globally and also just the capabilities we have in venous broadly. So, we'll see how it happens in March, but that could provide some additional upside for that franchise obviously in 2017 and well beyond, especially if that study is positive.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks. And then just one follow-up. Have you said or can you remind us, Mike, what's the most recent timeline for LOTUS Edge back on the market in Europe? Thanks.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","We've quoted early third quarter is our aim for LOTUS Edge back in Europe. So we want that to happen, but it's important to note that our current LOTUS platform is doing extremely well in Europe. And you talk to many physicians and they certainly want LOTUS Edge, but they're very happy with LOTUS and its current capabilities, its ability to position the device, low PBL rate. So, we want to launch LOTUS Edge, but we're more than pleased with the growth of our current LOTUS platform.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Perfect. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on a great year, guys. Let me start with the 2017 guidance. Just to ask a different way, the mid-single-digit growth in 2017. It's obviously the deceleration is driven by tough year-over-year comps. Dan, can you help us think through the different puts and takes for the businesses as it relates to 2017? In other words, what slows this year versus 2016? Is it across the board? Are there certain areas that are more pronounced? And I had one follow-up. Thanks.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah. So, we're obviously pleased with our performance in 2017 and momentum \u2013 I'm sorry in 2016 and momentum going into 2017 and beyond here. You hit the first one. We're coming up against a 10% organic comp. And the good news for the company, it's broad-based. As I said, five of the seven divisions grew double-digits in Q4. And so, we do have tougher comps really across the board, but that's really offset by strong momentum that we have really across each business.","So the comps are tougher, but we have strong momentum and I don't think I have time to go through each division. Each division has continued on product launches that we can expand globally, a number of new launches. Just take CRM for example. In a tough market we're growing above market and we're really excited about this new RESONATE platform that will launch right now in Europe and likely third quarter in the US. One that we don't talk about, we have some momentum building we believe in our EP business with our new HDx platform. That's just in rhythm management. I talked about IC a little bit ago with Brooks. And also PI, MedSurg continues to do well. Endo is moving into new markets based on our EndoChoice acquisition, the AXIOS Stent. Neuromodulation continues to do well.","So we have a extension of our product launches that we have. We'll continue to grow globally. The business has momentum, which is difficult to build for a company, and we're going to continue to press on that. And what's most important for us is, while we deliver a strong 2017, all these new platforms that we're investing in now that give us the higher R&D spend begin to generate even more fruit we think in 2018 and beyond.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's very helpful, Mike. One for Dr. Meredith on LOTUS. Dr. Meredith, in the past you've talked, you've said publicly you expect the REPRISE III data to be similar to the head-to-head study you published in JACC in 2015. Is that still the case? And can you comment, I know we've talked about this before, and I just can't remember what the response was, but there did seem to be a little bit of a higher stroke rate for LOTUS in that study compared to CoreValve. Can you remind me why that isn't a concern for you? Thank you very much for taking the questions.","Ian Meredith - Boston Scientific Corp.","Larry, it's a great question. I think the best comparison we still have for the REPRISE III data, until the data is known, is the study that you actually mentioned. That of course was not a randomized trial. It was a consecutive comparison and propensity matched patients. So one would assume that the pacemaker rate would be somewhere in that vicinity. Having said that, we have seen the uptake of a higher implant technique across the world and that will influence the practices in the US. So it's hard to predict exactly what the pacemaker rate might be. But I think it would be safe to assume that it would be similar to something that is published in the JACC manuscript that you mentioned.","The second question with the stroke rate, I don't believe that there is an appreciable difference in disabling stroke. The difference, and as was identified in that manuscript, was that there was a pre-specified neurological assessment before and after valve deployment, which means that there was a lower threshold to detection in the LOTUS arm of that study than what we had for the CoreValve arm. So, I suspect that the rate of disabling stroke, which is troublesome for all valves, will be comparable between the two groups.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the questions, guys.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","You're welcome.","Operator","We also have a question from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So, the first question I had was, Dan, when you are talking about this operating margin expansion, I thought maybe it was worth revisiting the sources of that for 2017. I mean, certainly you gave us an overview a while back for the long range plan. But can you talk about the specific components of the operating margin expansion for 2017? And just kind of give us an update on how some of those initiatives have gone, and what's left to go in the tank as you move toward the high 20s?","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Sure. The good news is, Matt, it's across the entire P&L and you can see that when you look at our ranges for 2016 versus 2017. It's expansion in each of the key areas. So when you look at gross margin, we were at 72% for 2016. The range is 72% to 73% and that includes offsetting a 50 basis point headwind from FX. That's continuing to launch accretive products. It's optimizing our plant network and it's really being maniacally focused on reducing standard product cost in a year over year comparison. So, that's really where we get the majority of the benefit in gross margin.","SG&A, we have a companywide initiative, as you've heard about over the last couple years, to really drive that down. You saw the benefit this year in terms of the reduction in our SG&A rate as a percentage of sales. You see it again next year in terms of what we've given for guidance.","And then, Mike (sic) [Matt], the commentary around R&D, R&D is really not the hunt in the current configuration to generate additional operating margin. It's more in the SG&A and gross margin lines. But the two of those are what get us to that 25.5% midpoint for 2017. And then as you look out getting to that 2020, there's probably a little bit less on the gross margin side and more on the SG&A and R&D side to get us to that 28% by 2020.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. And then I just had a follow-up on tax. I mean understanding nobody has the answer to this, I wanted to know if you could help us understand what your exposure could be to a border tax. And then are you doing anything differently as a management team to prepare for these potential changes, whatever composition we might see?","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","No. As I mentioned to the answer to the earlier question, we obviously are very close and plugged into the entire process relative to the border tax, where I would call as a slight net importer. So the border tax would probably be a net negative for us overall. But again, it depends on how that comes in terms of a configuration, what's the rate, what's included, what's excluded and then there are other parts of tax reform that are beneficial around the cash access and others.","So, we really need to see the different elements of how the final proposals come out, put that through and see what the impact is. In terms of whether we're doing anything differently, other than monitoring it and really staying close to that, no, we haven't changed our strategy as a team. Mike mentioned earlier category leadership and driving that. And so, we're monitoring tax reform, but not changing anything we're doing.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks a lot.","Susan Vissers Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.","All right. David, with that, we'd like to conclude the call. Thanks for joining us today.

Welcome to the Second Quarter 2016 Boston Scientific Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session; instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Susie Lisa. Please go ahead.","Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q2 2016 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financial Information.","The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Mike will provide strategic and revenue highlights of Q2 2016, Dan will review the financials for the quarter and then Q3 2016 and full-year 2016 guidance, and then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Keith Dawkins and Dr. Ken Stein.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, organic revenue growth is defined as excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and sales from the acquisition of the American Medical Systems, AMS, Male Urology portfolio over the prior-year period.","Also of note, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate, and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share, new product approvals and launches, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance including sales, margins, earnings and other Q2 2016 results and Q3 and full-year 2016 guidance as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses.","Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them.","At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike?","Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Susie, and good morning, everyone. We continue to beat our long-range strategic plan goals and execute very well as a global team. The success of our category leadership strategy is helping us gain share in our core markets, expand into faster growth adjacencies and deliver solutions that address unmet clinical needs.","Our consistent results continue to demonstrate that Boston Scientific is uniquely positioned to deliver differentiated long-term shareholder value. With long-term visibility and mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, complemented by ongoing operating margin improvement initiatives, our goal is to consistently drive double-digit adjusted EPS growth.","We're very excited about our excellent second quarter performance, first half results and most importantly our plans for the future. In Q2 we drove total operational revenue growth of 16% and organic revenue growth of 10%, excluding the impact of the AMS Urology acquisition. We had strong results across all regions, and five of our seven business units grew revenue double-digits organically.","We've leveraged that revenue growth to drive adjusted operating income growth of 22%, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 23.4%, a 130 basis point improvement year-over-year. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.27, achieving the high end of guidance and representing 25% growth, including a negative $0.015 impact from foreign currency.","So given our strong performance, we're increasing our 2016 guidance for revenue and adjusted EPS. We're increasing our full year organic revenue growth guidance from 6% to 8% to 8% to 9%. Full year operational revenue growth guidance, which includes the benefit of AMS, is increased from 9% to 11% to 11% to 12%. We're maintaining our full-year adjusted operating margin guidance of 24% to 24.5%, which at the midpoint is roughly 200 basis points of improvement over 2015. We're also increasing our adjusted EPS guidance by a penny over our prior range to $1.07 to $1.11, which represents 15% to 19% growth. Importantly, this adjusted EPS guidance includes an expected $0.05 negative impact from foreign exchange.","I'll now provide some highlights on Q2 results and our 2016 outlook. In my remarks all references to growth are on a constant currency, organic, year-over-year basis and they exclude the benefit of AMS.","Our second quarter revenue growth of 10% was broad-based across businesses and regions, led again by exciting new product launches, continued global expansion, and execution of our category leadership strategy.","We drove double-digit growth in five businesses: Endo, Urology Public Health, Neuromodulation, Interventional Cardiology and Peripheral Interventions. In addition, each region accelerated sequentially. The U.S. grew 8%. Europe grew 9%. Asia Pac delivered 16% growth with every major country in the Asia Pac region up double digits this quarter. Emerging markets also continued to deliver as sales grew 20%, including China revenue at 21%.","Our MedSurg businesses, Endo, Urology Public Health, and Neuromodulation continued to be a priority focus area for the company and each of the businesses maintained or accelerated growth from first quarter. These three businesses represent 40% of our operating income in the second quarter and they delivered adjusted operating margin of 32.8%. This is up 20 basis points sequentially and 240 basis points year-over-year.","Our global Endoscopy team continues to perform at a high level, with revenue growing 11% in the second quarter. We continue to see strong growth in our core Endo business, supported by our innovative portfolio and broad-based global expansion initiatives.","Key Endo growth drivers include the single use SpyGlass DS visualization system, the AXIOS stent for drainage of pancreatic fluid and our next generation hemostasis clip, the Resolution 360. High-single-digit growth in U.S. Endo was complemented by double-digit growth in every region outside the U.S.","As we continue to develop commercial and physician training capabilities in emerging markets and add focus in pulmonary, which helped drive 25% growth in BT, Bronchial Thermoplasty led by the U.S., Japan and China.","In Urology and Public Health our investments to become the clear market leader and category leader are being rewarded as growth, excluding AMS, accelerated to 18%.","The business performed at a high level across the various regions and segments, including Kidney Stones, BPH, ED and Surg-Gyn. Our global commercial footprint and focus on physician education has helped us to convert a meaningful portion of the market opportunity created by Astora's exit of the market at the end of March.","AMS sales strengthened the quarter and importantly remediation and integration efforts remain on track.","An exciting new growth platform in our Urology business is the launch of the LithoVue platform. LithoVue is an innovative single-use digital scope for treatment of kidney stones that provide customers with enhanced visualization and navigation capabilities. LithoVue resonates with the physicians and hospitals due to less OR downtime for sterile processing of reusable scopes. Performance navigation characteristics that allow physicians to tackle tougher procedures and the ability to schedule a full day of procedures without the fear of cancellation due to reusable scopes being down.","In Neuromodulation we continue to invest in the fast-growing microelectronics market where we enjoy innovation and supply chain leverage between our CRM and Neuromod business. Neuromodulation revenues grew in the quarter to 12% \u2013 grew 12%. Sales were driven by the U.S. market-leading Spectra platform, the launch of Precision Montage, which offers full-body MRI capability, and our Vercise deep brain stimulation platform. Our U.S. DBS trial continues to progress and we expect to launch in the U.S. in first quarter 2018.","Additionally, earlier this week we announced the acquisition of Cosman Medical, a technology leader in the field of radio frequency ablation systems for the treatment of chronic pain. This acquisition broadens our Neuromodulation portfolio and is highly synergistic with our U.S. commercial team. We're excited to offer physicians treating patients with chronic pain another non-opioid therapeutic option earlier in the treatment continuum.","Now turning to Cardiovascular, which includes our Peripheral and Interventional Cardiology businesses. Overall this segment grew sales 13% in the quarter and delivered adjusted operating margin of 32.2%, up more than 170 basis points year-over-year. Our Peripheral business delivered exceptional results with strong global sales across all regions, fueled by an innovative portfolio. Sales grew 14% on strong results across all regions and segments, including stents, thrombectomy and our emerging drug-eluting portfolio.","We also delivered strong growth in Interventional Oncology, where the integration of Interventional Radiology business of CeloNova remains on track.","In our Venous segment we continue to see very strong demand for our Zelante Deep Vein Thrombosis system. We're the only company developing leading drug-eluting technologies globally on multiple platforms in order to treat complex peripheral vascular disease. The Eluvia peripheral drug- eluting stent IDE trial called IMPERIAL is on track to complete enrollment by year end 2016.","In Interventional Cardiology we're focused on gaining share in our core businesses while expanding in faster growth segments that leverage our capabilities. This strategy is working. In the second quarter, Interventional Cardiology grew 12%, led by Structural Heart, drug-eluting stents and PCI Guidance. SYNERGY had an excellent quarter as we grew DES sales 9%. SYNERGY is now the market-leading premium DES platform, and it's on track to represent 50% to 60% of our U.S. DES revenue mix by the end of 2016.","PCI Guidance grew mid-teens on continued share gains in intravascular ultrasound, and we're encouraged by strong early feedback on the ease-of-use of our COMET Fractional Flow Reserve system. Our leading portfolio of solutions for complex, high-risk PCI patients also contributed to global growth.","The 12% IC revenue growth was fueled by our strengthening in Structural Heart business, which includes our Lotus Transcatheter Aortic Valve and WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure. We believe we are well positioned to drive long-term growth in these two fast-growing markets via our differentiated platforms and expanded capabilities. We also aim to deliver at the high end of our 2016 Structural Heart guidance range of $175 million to $200 million.","Our Lotus valve continues to gain share in Europe, and we're investing significantly in clinical studies, R&D and our global supply chain to develop our capabilities further. We remain on track to launch Lotus Edge at PCR London Valves in September. The Lotus Edge delivery system features a 14-French expandable sheath called iSleeve, and is designed for more flexibility and simplified deployment. It also offers our new depth guard technology, which limits the depth of the valve in a left ventricular outflow tract.","Lotus also offers best-in-class paravalvular leakage rates, and we aim to enhance Lotus with studies to demonstrate improved permanent pacemaker rates with Lotus Edge and depth guard. So our goal is to provide initial Lotus Edge data at PCR London Valves.","We do expect a slight delay in our expanded Lotus valve matrix in Europe, with a 21-millimeter valve estimated CE Mark timing first quarter 2017 and a 29-millimeter valve in Europe in mid-2017. We continue to invest and plan for a U.S. launch with the Lotus Edge platform in late 2017.","Also in Structural Heart, WATCHMAN sales were strong on procedure growth and new account openings. We are developing additional WATCHMAN capabilities in field clinical support, market development and physician training courses. Implant success rates and patient outcomes remain very high as evidenced by the 98.5% success rate in the EWOLUTION registry detailed at HRS in May.","We continued to expand WATCHMAN into new markets, and we're pleased with the recent reimbursement approval and launch in France. Importantly, the unique clinical benefits of WATCHMAN are being rewarded, as evidenced by the French reimbursement at a meaningful premium to competitive LAAC devices.","Post a limited market release of our next-generation WATCHMAN FLEX device, we have decided to pursue design enhancements before returning the next-gen platform to market. Importantly, we anticipate this delay will have no impact on our current WATCHMAN product, and thus no change to our market outlook for LAAC.","Rhythm Management sales increased 5% in the quarter and delivered adjusted operating margin of 16.9%, up 200 basis points year-over-year, as improving profitability remains a core focus. In CRM we improved our global performance and delivered 4% growth in second quarter. Our European and Asia Pac CRM businesses continued to grow faster than the market, offset by slower growth in U.S. CRM.","Pacemaker sales grew 15% globally, with excellent U.S. performance, fueled by our ACCOLADE MRI launch and growth from our X4 CRT-P Quad device.","Worldwide ICD sales were flat as we delivered above-market growth internationally that was offset by weaker sales in the U.S. In the U.S. we faced some near-term headwinds due to a Tacky MRI product gap and replacement cycle headwinds. However, we recently earned FDA approval of our QE X4 Quad CRT lead and the early results are promising.","Importantly, EMBLEM S-ICD is a key differentiator and growth continues to accelerate globally. We continue to expand global S-ICD utilization with more long-term data from the EFFORTLESS Registry, growing physician implant experience, geographic expansion and the recent second quarter 2016 EU launch of EMBLEM MRI, which contributed to our solid international growth.","Due to a change in protocol of our U.S. ENABLE MRI clinical trial we are revising our goal for Transvenous Tacky MRI U.S. approval by year-end 2017, but continue to expect to gain MRI labeling for both new and previously implanted ICDs and CRT-Ds with the new timeline. The continued cadence of data proving the superiority of ENDURALIFE batteries and the pending FDA approval of EMBLEM MRI S-ICD, which is expected in third quarter, will help us offset the near-term headwinds from the U.S. MRI high voltage segment.","In second quarter, European CRM sales grew 5%, representing nine straight quarters of above-market growth, giving us further confidence in our long term CRM outlook. Our EP business grew 6% in second quarter and we're encouraged by double-digit growth in Europe, led by new RHYTHMIA installs and the recent launches of IntellaNav OI and INTELLATIP MIFI OI ablation catheters. The U.S. launch in late first quarter of the Blazer OI catheter will be augmented in Q3 with the upcoming launch of the Nav-enabled version of this catheter.","So to wrap up, our company delivered another excellent quarter. Our second quarter performance reflects the strength of our global team, the depth and breadth of our portfolio, our globalization efforts and our ongoing investments into faster growth markets. Importantly, we believe we are well positioned to deliver continued strong results in the second half of 2016 and beyond. I really want to thank our employees globally for their winning spirit and their strong commitment to Boston Scientific.","Now let me turn the call over to Dan for a more detailed review of our financial results.","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Mike. In Q2 we generated organic revenue growth of 10% versus our 6% to 8% guidance range and adjusted EPS of $0.27, representing 25% year-over-year growth and the high end of our guidance range of $0.25 to $0.27 cents. The strong adjusted EPS growth performance in Q2 was driven primarily by revenue growth upside and a lower SG&A rate versus prior year. And given the strong performance in the first half of 2016, we are again raising full year guidance for revenue growth and adjusted EPS.","Consolidated revenue of $2.126 billion represented operational revenue growth of 16%, exceeding the high end of guidance and excludes the impact of a $24 million headwind from foreign exchange which was in line with guidance.","Excluding an approximate 500 basis point contribution from the AMS Male Urology portfolio acquisition, organic revenue growth was 10% in the quarter and 15% on an as-reported basis. Adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 70.7%, decreasing 60 basis points year-over-year and unfortunately 130 basis points below the midpoint of Q2 guidance due to a few factors that I will detail.","The year-over-year decrease is due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, which was a 120 basis point headwind as well as costs related to our new Malaysia manufacturing plant, the AMS integration, including the AMS quality remediation expense. Compared to guidance, the shortfall is due to inventory charges in advance of new product launches, inventory write-offs related to WATCHMAN FLEX and more unfavorable FX.","We now expect Q3 and full-year 2016 adjusted gross margin to be in the range of 71.5% to 72.5%, which includes an expected 75 to 100 basis points of unfavorable foreign exchange. A key element in the second half increase is lower expected inventory charges, and we will also benefit fully from the lower 2016 standard costs of our products as we will have sold through all of the inventory valued at last year's higher standards.","Adjusted SG&A expenses were $763 million or 35.9% of sales in Q2, down 140 basis points year-over-year. We continue to believe our full-year rate will be between 35.5% and 36.5%, which at the midpoint would be a 140 basis point improvement compared to last year.","Adjusted research and development expenses were $222 million in the second quarter, or 10.4% of sales, which is down 50 basis points year-over-year. As a result of a slightly lower R&D rate in the first half, we expect our full-year 2016 adjusted R&D rate to be between 10.5% and 11.5% of sales, or 50 basis points lower than prior guidance.","Royalty expense was 0.9% of sales in Q2, roughly flat year-over-year.","Our Q2 2016 adjusted operating margin of 23.4% was in line with our guidance and represents a 130 basis point improvement over Q2 last year, which marks the eighth consecutive quarter in which we will have expanded adjusted operating margin by 100 basis points or more. As a reminder, we've signaled a sequential decrease in adjusted operating margin from Q1's rate as we experience the usual increase in SG&A from Q1 to Q2 due to seasonal trade show activity and began to ramp re-investment of the medical device excise tax suspension.","Our first-half 2016 adjusted operating margin of 24.2% positions us well to achieve our full-year adjusted operating margin guidance of 24% to 24.5%, and we remain on track to reach 25%-plus in 2017. Q2 adjusted operating income grew 22% year-over-year, with all three reportable segments expanding adjusted operating margin by at least 170 basis points over Q2 2015.","Specific to Rhythm Management, the team delivered an adjusted operating margin of 16.9%, up 280 basis points year-over-year. In the second half of 2016, we expect Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin to continue to improve and be 18% to 19%. This second half gain is expected to result from realizing the full benefit of 2016 product costs, leveraging the improved top-line performance expected of the global CRM and EP businesses, and we continue to believe Rhythm Management is on track to deliver an adjusted operating margin of 20% in 2017.","Turning to the balance sheet, we had some key developments in the quarter that helped reduce future uncertainties. Before I get into the details of the activity in the quarter, let me try to frame out the next three years of expected cash flow at a high level. From 2017 through 2019, we believe we can generate cumulative adjusted free cash flow, after CapEx, approaching $6 billion. We expect to allocate roughly two-thirds of that $6 billion to a combination of M&A and share repurchases.","As you are aware, the two most significant liabilities on our balance sheet are our IRS transfer pricing case and the mesh litigation. During the quarter, we took two important steps to manage these liabilities. First, we reached a stipulation of settled issues with the IRS for the 2001 to 2007 tax years. And importantly, this stipulation also provides a framework to settle the remaining years 2008 through 2015 as well. While there's work to do to conclude all the years, we are confident we will bring these to conclusion over the coming quarters. With a payment in 12 to 24 months, this would eliminate one of the most significant liabilities on our balance sheet.","With regards to mesh, we increased our reserve by $608 million during the quarter. With the same goal of managing our liabilities, we've reached conditional or final settlements on 12,000 claims and made significant progress towards reaching agreement in principle on another 7,000 claims for a total of 19,000 claims. This represents approximately half of the roughly 40,000 known claims, and we expect to make even more progress during the remainder of 2016.","As you know, every quarter we assess all four key components involving calculating the reserve and make any necessary adjustments for all probable and estimable charges, including the volume of known claims, the estimated cost to resolve each claim, an estimate of future claims and the cost to defend each claim.","Our total legal reserve, of which mesh is included, was $2.375 billion as of June 30, 2016, and we believe it reflected our best estimate of what is probable and estimable. Of note as well is that included in this reserve is the Mirowski judgment which we have paid in full subsequent to quarter end. So as of today, the reserve would be closer to $2 billion. As a reminder, this $2 billion includes a number of claims we have agreed in principle to settle, but have not yet paid. Once those settlements are funded, the amount of the reserve will be adjusted accordingly.","Now I'll move on to interest expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $59 million, compared to $106 million in Q2 of last year. The decrease is primarily due to the pre-tax one-time charge of approximately $45 million associated with the senior note refinancing in Q2 of last year. Excluding this charge, Q2 2016 interest expense was $61 million. Our average interest expense rate was 4% in Q2 this year, compared to 8% in Q2 last year. The lower interest rate expense in Q2 of 2016 was primarily due to lower average cost of debt resulting from the senior notes refinancing and the inclusion of the pre-tax one-time charge in Q2 of last year that I mentioned. Excluding this charge, Q2 2015 interest expense would have been 4.6%.","Our tax rate for the second quarter was 47.8% on a reported basis and 14.2% on an adjusted basis.","As reported last week, we're pleased with the conditional settlement reached with the IRS counsel regarding our transfer pricing litigation and plan to use some of the current benefit to repatriate overseas cash, thus we continue to expect our full-year 2016 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 14%. We believe this IRS settlement, in addition to recent progress we've made towards reaching agreements in principle to settle additional mesh claims as I mentioned, are prudent actions to take in the management of our balance sheet.","Finally, Q2 2016 adjusted EPS of $0.27 includes approximately $0.015 of unfavorable FX and represents 25% year-over-year growth or 32% growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On a reported GAAP basis, Q2 2016 EPS was a loss of $0.15 and includes net charges and amortization expense totaling $580 million after tax. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $464 million, compared to $406 million in Q2 of last year.","Given the strong adjusted free cash flow generation in the first half of this year, we are raising our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance from $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, which was formerly our stretch goal. Achieving adjusted free cash flow of $1.6 billion would represent 17% growth, and we continue to pursue inventory management initiatives designed to improve the working capital contribution to cash flow.","In Q2 we used cash primarily to repay $250 million of bank term loans as well as fund the previously agreed legal settlements. As of June 30, 2016, we had cash on hand of $438 million. Near-term, our capital allocation priorities are to manage contingencies and pursue tuck-in M&A.","We ended Q2 with 1.375 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect our share count to increase by roughly 5 million per quarter through the end of 2016 as we plan to keep the buyback suspended for the balance of this year. We expect this to result in a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.380 billion shares for full-year 2016.","I'll now walk through guidance for Q3 and full-year 2016. For the full year we now expect consolidated revenue to be in a range of $8.270 billion to $8.370 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 8% to 9% on an organic basis and 11% to 12% on both an operational and reported basis. As a result of a stronger dollar, at current rates we expect foreign exchange to be a headwind of approximately $70 million for the full-year 2016.","Turning to adjusted EPS, we now expect full-year 2016 adjusted EPS to be in a range of $1.07 to $1.11, representing 15% to 19% adjusted earnings growth. Our previous guidance assumed the unfavorable FX on full-year adjusted EPS would be between $0.05 and $0.06. Given the fact that Q2 saw slightly less unfavorable impact than expected, we now believe the full year impact will be closer to $0.05, which assumes $0.02 to $0.03 in the second half of this year. On a GAAP basis we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.30 to $0.35.","Now turning to Q3 2016, we expect consolidated revenues to be in a range of $2.35 billion to $2.85 billion. This represents year-over-year growth in a range of 7% to 9% organically and 8% to 10% operationally. We expect the foreign exchange headwind on Q3 revenue to be negligible. For the third quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.25 to $0.27 per share, and GAAP EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.13 to $0.15 per share. Please check our Investor Relations website for Q2 2016 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q2 results as well as Q3 and full-year 2016 guidance including P&L line item guidance.","So with that, I'll turn it back over to Susie who will moderate the Q&A.","Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks Dan. Greg, let's open it up to questions for the next 30 minutes. In order to enable us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one quick follow-up. Greg, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, good morning. First off, can you hear me okay?","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey. Good morning, Mike.","Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hear you fine, Mike. Thanks.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Well, first off, fantastic quarter, obviously, so congratulations. Let me just clarify just on a few items. So number one, the pacemaker performance being as strong as it is on the back of the MRI launch, one question I've already gotten from people, is that a clean number? Is there any stocking in that number that we should be aware of? Second, the move in the Structural Heart guidance to the high end of the range, is that WATCHMAN more than Lotus? If you could kind of share any insights into that? And then I'll follow up. Thanks.","Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Good morning, Mike. On the pacemaker, our team has been waiting for a long time for that product approval. We've had some slow quarters in our pacemaker business in the U.S. Outside the U.S. has done quite well with that product for a while, so that's not a stocking number. We were ready for that launch for quite a while. And the team, our commercial teams did an excellent job executing it. So we think it's a very innovative product and long in coming. And the U.S. team essentially did what the OUS teams have done with that product for a while.","And Structural Heart, we continue to be really excited about the future for Structural Heart. It continues to be our largest investment area as a company. We're comfortable with the high end of our guidance that we provided at $175 million to $200 million. We continued to invest long-term in R&D capabilities, clinical capabilities and commercial capabilities to prepare ourselves for the launch in the U.S. And we're really excited about the upcoming data that we expect to see in London Valves on our pacemaker rate with the addition of Lotus Edge and depth guard.","So it's really an important category for us. As you know we continue to \u2013 we outlined at Investor Day back in I think 2013 and 2015 our focus to continue to grow in our core businesses and take share, which we're doing, and importantly expand into faster growth markets. And that's exactly what you're seeing as a company. And our Structural Heart investment really is kind of leading the pack there.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So Mike, I apologize, the question was within Structural Heart, WATCHMAN is what's driving to the high end of the range there?","Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","What's driving the high end of the range there is we're just -continue to open up new accounts. We continue to improve our account utilization. And we continue to build up our commercial capabilities in the U.S.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. The gross margin kind of issues in the quarter, I think that you did a good job of, Dan, walking through what those are. So if we look at the back half of the year and expect an improvement in the gross margin, that's because, one, your inventory issues from the AMS transaction basically you get to a better, safer cost on those products, and then the FX headwind that you saw this quarter on the gross margin should dissipate, is that accurate?","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, somewhat. Let me just make sure we're clear on that. So we're at 70.7% in the quarter. The guidance range for Q3 and the full year is 71.5% to 72.5%. So it implies the uptick that you mentioned in the second half. I think the two key drivers of that are the inventory charges for the CRM products related to the better uptake of MRI-safe brady and quad in the U.S. as well as the WATCHMAN FLEX. We don't believe that those repeat themselves. And then secondly, we will get the full benefit in the second half of the lower manufacturing costs that we have for 2016 standards because we'll now be selling all the inventory at the new standards, and we will have sold off all the inventory at last year's standards. Those are the two main drivers that put us back into the 71.5% to 72.5% range.","FX, we actually assume, is probably somewhat in the same range as where it was in Q2. That's really the reason, if you think back to last quarter, our guidance for FX in gross margin would have implied about 70 to 75 basis points each quarter for Qs 2, 3, and 4. Now it's 120; so that's a 50 basis point difference. And that's the reason why the guidance for the full year came from 72% to 73% to 71.5% to 72.5%.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. All right. I have a long list of questions, but I'll let some others jump in. Thank you.","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David R. Lewis - Aurelian Resources, Inc.","Good morning. In light of a very strong revenue quarter, guys, I hate to ask something as banal as cash flow, Dan, but you don't give us multi-year cash flow estimates that often and I noticed that your $6 billion free cash estimate in the next three years is 10% higher than what we were looking for. Can you just sort of walk us through kind of why that would be and some of the components? I imagine one component's CapEx and perhaps the other is margins. But our margins numbers are pretty high and you're still 10% above us. So what could be driving that significant upside?","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think you answered your own question there, David, a bit. It's margins and CapEx. So one of the things that we have this year is, as we detailed in our guidance at the beginning of the year, is a CapEx number at $350 million that's $100 million higher than we think we need to effectively run each year. So we get that back, hopefully, each of the next three years and then expanding margins. So our goal next year is 25%-plus. And as we've given guidance for or long-term goals for 27% to 28% by 2020, the combination of those two factors and the CapEx I think gets you a long way there. And then the other piece is that we're going to continue to try, from a working capital perspective, to make that be our friend. We have a lot of inventory initiatives in place to really hopefully lead the industry in that regard and be best-in-class. And when we do that, that'll turn something that's going to drag on cash flow into a positive and hopefully see the beginnings of that this year. You see that from us taking our guidance from 1.5 billion to 1.6 billion; a piece of that is the inventory initiatives.","David R. Lewis - Aurelian Resources, Inc.","Okay. Very helpful. And then, Mike, maybe a couple of product questions. I guess the first is just sort of the forgotten biz for Boston MedSurg is sort of no longer forgotten given the organic growth. And specifically, Endoscopy has gone from mid-single growth last year to double-digit growth this year. I wonder if you could just give us a sense of sort of where we are in the product cycles. Is it share gain from competitors? Is it product cycles that is driving that? And then secondarily, on DES on SYNERGY, where do you think we are in sort of share versus mix? And obviously you're growing dramatically ahead of market. So what are some of the factors that are driving that? And I'll jump back in queue. Thanks. Great quarter.","Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, David. Yeah. We've definitely never forgotten about Endo. It's really an incredibly high-performing business and it has been for a number of years. And they really have just continued to grow and expand. So our Endo business enjoys a, first of all, a strong market; a bit fewer competitors in our Endoscopy markets than some of our others. It has very strong growth profile in terms of the market growth and OUS expansion. And we are a very strong category leader across the globe, and we continue to expand particularly in the emerging markets.","The portfolio is really driving a lot of the launch, a lot of the success that you've seen in 2016, led by our SpyGlass digital DS platform, which is driving solid double-digit growth and helps pull through the core portfolio. We also launched a product called the AXIOS Stent which is doing very well, as well as a hemostasis clip. So the portfolio cadence for Endo is very strong. It's very well led. It's very globally oriented.","And they also do a great job of laying out the economic value proposition for hospitals beyond the portfolio. So they continue to perform very well and intentionally somewhere in my comments with Mike in his first question, we're intentionally focusing on investing greater in faster growth markets and faster growth businesses. And they represent 40% of our operating income, the MedSurg sector does now for BSC, so more to come there.","DES is doing excellent. And we had a few critics early on in our launch, saying we weren't being aggressive enough. We signaled all along that we're going to be \u2013 drive an appropriate premium price for this product because we believe it is the best product available in the marketplace and the data is proving that out. And maybe Keith can comment in a minute. So we believe it's the premium product. We do offer a premium price for it, and so we've been smart in our rollout of it. And I think physicians and customers have seen the value of the ease-of-use and the clinical data of SYNERGY. And we expect the U.S. penetration to be probably above 50%, closer to 50% to 60% in the U.S. in 2016, and we continue to roll it out globally. So the team's doing a nice job there.","But again, it's part of the overall story in Interventional Cardiology. Again, pointing to faster growth segments, our DES doing well, a lot of investments in complex coronary and imaging, which are part of the portfolio, and clearly our Structural Heart. So Kevin Ballinger and the team are doing a nice job.","Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President-Investor Relations","Keith.","Keith D. Dawkins - Global Chief Medical Officer & Executive VP","Yes, David. I think the SYNERGY stent operators around the world are appreciating the best-in-class acute performance because obviously if you can't deliver the stent, that's really the end of the discussion. And we have a lot of data now, including the EVOLVE II pivotal data, the EVOLVE (39:35) five-year data, and the real-world scar (39:40) data from Europe confirming the safety. Everybody, both patients and physicians, are interested in stent thrombosis. And the stent thrombosis, as you know from the data, is very low. We have 20,000 patients in investigative sponsored trials with SYNERGY, and these trials are beginning to release their data. And you'll see more flows of data at the meetings during the rest of this year and next year.","David R. Lewis - Aurelian Resources, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, David.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a really strong quarter. So, Dan, you raised the organic growth from 6% to 8% to 8% to 9%, but you only raise the EPS guidance by a penny. And so can you talk about why you're not getting better leverage on the incremental revenue? You kept the operating margin guidance the same. And then I had one follow-up.","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Larry. I think probably the best way to explain that just to do a quick summary of the increase in revenue. So the revenue is $170 million higher at the midpoint of guidance and that breaks down into three things: $20 million comes from FX; $75 million comes from revenue that already came in Q2; and then $75 million comes in the second half. I think the main factor that's offsetting that is if you look at our R&D rate, our R&D rate in the first half was 10.5%. And looking at the second half it's going to be 11.5% to get to the full-year rate of 11%. So that's 100 basis point increase in R&D, largely related to timing and the investments in the Structural Heart that Mike had mentioned. So that, for the most part, offsets the additional flow-through in the revenue that you get \u2013 the additional $75 million of revenue you get in the second half...","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it \u2013 sorry.","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And then we're also \u2013 just as you look at it still very pleased to be at 15% to 19% full-year EPS growth which would be four years straight of double-digit adjusted EPS growth.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. Sorry to interrupt there. And then for my follow-up, at the 2015 analyst meeting, the organic revenue goal was 3% to 6% in 2016 and 2017. You're now guiding to 8% to 9% in 2016. How should we think about the sustainability of the 8% to 9% and your goals in 2017 and beyond? And I recognize you're not giving guidance here, but you're way outperforming what you expected to do at your analyst meeting last year. Thanks for taking my questions.","Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Thank you. The team is outperforming as part of the high performance culture that we have as a company. We're very excited about the full-year guidance, 8% to 9%. As you said, it compares to 3% to 6% we laid out, so it's a pretty strong beat there, and strong momentum across really each region and each business. So, we're not going to provide any outlook into 2017. Clearly outperforming the market at this level is not likely sustainable each year. But that being said, we're constantly looking to outperform the market. We're investing in faster growth businesses, and we're very confident in our ability long-term to drive mid-single-digit revenue growth, improve margins and drive double-digit EPS growth.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for taking my questions, guys.","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Larry.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thanks. Can you hear me okay?","Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yep. Hear you fine, Bob.","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Good morning. So obviously, you've got the best revenue growth here for Boston Scientific essentially since the financial crisis, a higher absolute level of revenues than I think any of us thought, so congratulations on the unbelievable progress. I guess my first question is really kind of philosophical in terms of the long-term now that you've got this sort of higher level revenues and higher level of revenue growth. You guys have given some long-term guidance on operating margin targets and goals. So now that you're kind of outperforming on revenues, what's the thought on those operating margin targets? Is the thought that you'll take an opportunity to spend more and continue to sort of keep those operating margin targets? Or is it more likely that with this higher level of growth that you could be towards the high end or higher of the long-term targets that you've set previously?","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Bob. Yeah, I don't think we'll be changing the trajectory in terms of the margin guidance we've given. As we always say, it's about striking a balance between delivering durable, consistent revenue growth and expanding operating margins. And if you look at the numbers and see what we've done for the last three years relative to revenue growth and particularly on the margin expansion front, looking at 27% to 28% adjusted operating margin by 2020, and a consistent durable growing top line through that period and the goal of double-digit adjusted EPS growth each of those years, I think we're going to stick with that as our targets.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","No, I understand you're sticking with the targets, but I'm just trying to understand philosophically because you're outperforming so nicely here, is the bias more towards opportunities to invest more? Or let some of that through? Because again, these levels are just so much higher than we originally thought.","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Again, it's striking a balance. We do have a lot of investment, as Mike mentioned, relative to Structural Heart. That's a lot of investment to get to the U.S. market and be successful there. And I think we're \u2013 it's always about striking that balance.","Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And I think also we'll do an Investor Day 2017. We haven't nailed down yet. But we're making significant investments in platforms and markets that will have a big impact on the growth rate of the business in 2018, 2019 and 2020. And so you look at our launch in the U.S. of TAVR, our launch in the U.S. in the future of a deep brain stimulation, launching \u2013 only one that will have a drug-eluting stent and a drug-coated balloon for peripheral vascular, and we continue to expand into pulmonary and other areas across the company. So we definitely are investing for long-term growth, and a lot of it is big clinical investments in R&D that will impact the company, particularly in 2018, 2019 and 2020.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And then on Structural Heart just real quickly, what was the driver of you guys providing guidance? It'll be at the high end of the range, is that Lotus or WATCHMAN or both?","Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's both. Both are doing quite well.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks for taking the questions.","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brooks West from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Good morning. Can you hear me?","Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I hear you fine, Brooks.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Great. Thanks, guys. Just to put a cap on the gross margin discussion, so, Dan, those all seem like transient issues with the inventory. And I'm not trying to push for guidance for next year, but as I look at my model we've got you at about 73% gross margins for 2017. I don't see anything that I really need to flow-through into 2017 from this. Is that the correct way to think about it? I mean, you're a little bit lower for 2016, but in terms of thinking about the forward model that should resolve itself and we should kind of go back to where we thought we were going. Correct?","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't talk specifically about a rate for 2017. Obviously, the goal is to continuously increase the gross margin rate. And it'll be part of what we believe is 25%-plus adjusted operating margin for next year, so with that as the goal. The FX in the back half is really the only thing that we believe is consistent from the Q2 performance. The other things I mentioned relative to inventory charges and the benefit from the standards, hopefully, to your point, is a transient thing. So the FX is the only one that continues into the second half.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Okay. Perfect. And then maybe kind of piggybacking on Bob's question, but also thinking about some of the questions around MedSurg. You kind of conditioned us, in terms of the long-term operating margin progression, to think about Rhythm Management. And obviously, you're making great progress there. But given the growth we're seeing in MedSurg and Interventional Cardiology, it seems like that equation maybe needs to change a little bit. And if we allocate a little bit more of the strength in MedSurg to that equation, it seems like we push up to and through those targets maybe more quickly than if we were just relying on Rhythm Management. Is that also a fair kind of way to look at your business?","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think the focus on Rhythm Management has really just been because of where they were, right. Starting off in the high single-digits, it's gotten a lot of focus over the last three or four years. I think we've made \u2013 Joe and the team have made tremendous progress getting it to the 16.9% that it is in Q2, the 18% to 19% that it'll be the second half of this year, and then ultimately the 20% next year and beyond that in 2018 and beyond.","All the while, to you point, MedSurg and Cardiovascular have continued to grow their margins as well. So I think it goes back to what Mike said to the answer to the last question which is there's investments that we're making to ensure that durable growth 2018, 2019, 2020 and beyond and it's not just one business that has that investment. We're investing in all of the businesses. So we spend a lot of time looking at each of the individual segments and the profitability there, and the math adds up to what we've given for our goals.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Perfect. And if I could sneak in just one product question, I'm wondering if Mirviss [Jeffrey] has decided whether to bring a drug-coated balloon to the U.S. or not?","Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, we'll likely be providing additional insights on our clinical strategy with our balloon at the next quarterly call.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Perfect. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Wise from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everybody. Maybe let me start off with Lotus. Mike, you talked about gaining EU share in the quarter. Maybe give us a little more color on that, are you ready to quantify that at all? You've talked about penetration or share of greater than 30% in your selected accounts. And maybe just add some more color on the Edge launch coming up in September. Is this a share gainer? Or no, that's going to require more time and those additional sizes that are coming in the first half of 2017?","Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yep. Sure. Again, the big investment for us in Structural Heart with WATCHMAN and TAVR, and you know, we're planning for the long-term here, particularly with our TAVR, given the market growth profile and how large the market is. And our view that we have a very differentiated platform from the other market contenders, given the controlled release of our Lotus valve and the lowest paravalvular leakage rates. So we think we truly have a differentiated platform in a very large market.","We're a bit hamstrung in the near-term in Europe without having all five sizes. We have three of them today. So that hurts us a bit, but we'll solve that with a 21-millimeter in first quarter 2017 and eventually the largest size at probably first half 2017. So that will help. So in the meantime, we continue to do very well with the three valve sizes that we have. We won't provide any additional guidance in terms of number of accounts or penetration, but clearly it is a share taking strategy. The market's already large. The market's growing, and we're quite confident that we're currently the strong number three player. But that's not going to be our aspiration over the years, particularly as we launch Lotus Edge and depth guard.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Turning to a bigger picture question, Dan obviously is emphasizing the growth in free cash flow this year, the $6 billion number you threw out over the next few years. You're also saying, Dan, that, I think correctly that with the settling or going a long way toward settling the IRS agreements a major uncertainty is off the table. I mean, all that suggests to me that that might give you more flexibility in thinking about M&A or portfolio additions. You just announced Cosman. How are you thinking about this, Mike and Dan? And should we be thinking that there is more possibility for M&A as a result? Any color would be appreciated. Thank you.","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Rick. Yeah. I'll hit it from a financial perspective; maybe Mike can jump in on the strategic side. The goal \u2013 and I think you've framed it out very well, that's our goal is to eliminate the uncertainties that we have on the balance sheet. I think we've taken a lot of good steps in the quarter to do that. And that's going to give us more financial flexibility in the future. And that's the goal. So we should hopefully free up more of that cash flow for the long-term. We gave you the numbers hopefully as goals for the next three years. And the goal is to have as much of that available to fuel the business from an M&A and share repurchase perspective. So I don't know if anything specific, but yeah, I mean, that's really the goal is to eliminate the uncertainties and give us as much financial flexibility as we can have.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. So I guess the first question that wanted to clarify when you talked about MRI-safe timelines, could you just inform us what revising the goal for Tacky MRI timeline, entail what the change was there, and then S-ICDs still on track. Can you talk about how that's doing and how you expect MRI-safe approval to potentially improve sales for S-ICD?","Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Absolutely. We'll ask Dr. Stein to comment on this question.","Kenneth Stein - Senior Vice President","Yeah, Matt. I mean on the MRI, not going to get into any of the details of the change in the protocol. But in the course of conduct of our ENABLE MRI trial, we have made a decision that we do need to revise the protocol with respect to patient screening and eligibility. And that's just the process of getting that protocol or vision through is what's going to cause the push in the timeline. Still have a goal of getting that approved by the end of 2017.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. And on S-ICD?","Kenneth Stein - Senior Vice President","I'm sorry. Could you clarify the question on S-ICD?","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. I was just curious. I may have missed the comment here because the comments went by kind of fast. But do you still have the same timeline for S-ICD MRI approval? And just how is S-ICD performing today?","Kenneth Stein - Senior Vice President","Yeah. We still have the same timeline, anticipating approval Q3 of this year. And really couldn't be more pleased with what we've seen in terms of uptake of the EMBLEM MRI where it's been launched in Europe and the existing EMBLEM device in the U.S. and globally.","Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We expect EMBLEM MRI approval in the U.S. in third quarter.","Kenneth Stein - Senior Vice President","Q3 this year.","Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yep.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. And could you just talk about broader utilization? Obviously, your results were phenomenal this quarter. Are you seeing something going on in either the U.S. market or some of the emerging markets that you play in that's contributing to higher levels of utilization that may not continue going forward? Or do you think that you're really just outperforming your markets from good execution?","Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thanks, Matt. It's Mike. I also don't want to be a broken record here, but I think I want to just reinforce, consistent with our Investor Day presentations in 2013 and 2015, we've continued to invest our portfolio into faster growth markets. So, kind of in the maybe 2011 timeframe, we called our market growth profile about 3% in the markets we compete in. So as we've shifted our portfolio over time into faster growth markets, we think the markets we compete in now are kind of in the 4% to 5% growth range, if you look at the composite of BSC.","So we are pleased that we're outperforming the market, but we'll strive to continue to do so. But we think that we have fundamentally shifted the markets that we play in to about a 4% to 5% growth market versus maybe a 2% to 3% growth market 4 or 5 years ago. So the markets are stronger that we compete in and the team is doing a really nice job of outperforming.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks for the thought.","Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President-Investor Relations","Greg, we'll take one more question please.","Operator","Okay. That question comes from the line of Glenn Navarro from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. Two questions. One, drug-eluting stents in the quarter up high-single digits, significantly outpacing the market. You have Abbott launching Absorb. So my question is, is this high-single digits sustainable, given Absorb coming into the market? Or should we anticipate a little moderation going forward? And then I had a quick follow-up.","Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, yeah. We're not giving DES guidance for the third quarter or fourth quarter. We're going to continue to run the play, which is we believe we have the best product in the market, and Keith can comment a bit more on the clinical data. And we've been competing with Absorb in Europe for quite a while. We would put it at probably less than a 7% \u2013 the BVS probably less than 7% of the global market and it's been on the market for quite a while.","So we feel like we're in the position of strength in terms of our product portfolio, and we continue to look at BVS, it's an interesting technology. And we've got a number of bets and it's a fact (57:58) in the future we can look at a second-gen or a third generation device then we'll eventually bring that to market but at this time we believe that SYNERGY is the premium device and we'll continue to focus on driving that.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then with Keith on the line, I'd love to get his thoughts on kind of SYNERGY versus Absorb. And then my follow-up result was on Eluvia which was just launched in Europe and the data is very strong. And once you come to the U.S. you'll be by far \u2013 you'll be the second DES on the market for peripherals but with by far the best data. So how is Eluvia doing in Europe? And it just seems like this is one product that has a significant opportunity that's flying under the radar screen so just thoughts on Eluvia as well. Thanks.","Keith D. Dawkins - Global Chief Medical Officer & Executive VP","And so, Glenn, in terms of SYNERGY and BVS, obviously there's not a lot of head-to-head data between the two, but BVS has been available in Europe. It's had CE Mark for five-and-a-half years and the penetration, as Mike said, is mid-single digits. And you and everybody else on the call is well aware of the Absorb II and Absorb III data. The safety profile of drug-eluting stents is paramount. Safety profile is more important than efficacy. And with a stent thrombosis rate that is at least 2x SYNERGY, we feel that the first generation, fully absorbable scaffolds, the safety profile is open to question.","We do have an interest in the space. Obviously, as a leader in DES we have to have that. And as you know also we have three shots on goal and our own internal FAST program which is a thinner strap, more deliverable stent, more compliant, less malapposition is in first human use trials now. And we are still anticipating commercialization in Europe in 2018.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then just your thoughts on Eluvia, how it's performing in Europe? And your thoughts on how it will perform in the United States once launched?","Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. So we're early with our Eluvia platform. It's a large investment. We'll be announcing additional data sets on both our balloon and our stent at CIRSE, which I think is in Barcelona in September third quarter this year. So we'll continue to lay out our clinical data there. But I think just, again, the strength of having a \u2013 in Europe, a drug-coated balloon and a differentiated drug-eluting stents for the peripheral vascular offers physicians more options. And so it uniquely positions us in the SFA and it also helps us pull through our core portfolio.","So I think these investments are paying off in Europe, based on the growth, and we've got to wrap up our clinical trial of Eluvia which we anticipate by year-end 2016. And so we look forward to that finishing. And then we'll provide additional comments on our balloon at our third quarter earnings call.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you for taking the questions.","Michael F. Mahoney - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Daniel J.

And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Susie Lisa. Please go ahead.","Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Roxanne. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q1 2016 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financial Information.","The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Mike will provide strategic and revenue highlights of Q1 2016, Dan will review the financials for the quarter and then Q2 2016 and full-year 2016 guidance, and then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Keith Dawkins and Dr. Ken Stein.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, organic revenue growth is defined as excluding the impact of sales from divested businesses, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and sales from the acquisition of the American Medical Systems Male Urology portfolio over the prior year period.","Also of note, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Federal Securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate, and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth in market share, new product approvals and launches, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance including sales, margins, earnings and other Q1 2016 results and Q2 and full-year 2016 guidance as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses.","Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them.","At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike?","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Susie, and good morning, everyone. We continue to perform against our strategic planned goals, and we're encouraged by the consistent strong execution of our global team. The success of our new product launches across many of our businesses is helping us accelerate expansion into faster growth markets and deliver solutions that address unmet clinical needs.","We continue to believe that Boston Scientific is uniquely positioned to deliver differentiated shareholder value through durable mid-single digit organic revenue growth and double digit adjusted EPS growth through our ongoing operating margin and proven initiatives.","We're very excited about the excellent start to 2016 and our plans to build upon our global momentum in 2017 and beyond. We posted excellent result this quarter with total operational revenue growth of 13% and organic revenue growth of 8%, excluding the impact of the AMS acquisition benefit.","Four of our seven businesses grew revenue double digits organically and we, in turn, leveraged that revenue growth to drive 24% adjusted operating income growth, resulting in adjusted operating margin of 25.1% and a 260 basis point improvement year-over-year. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.28, exceeding the high end of guidance and representing 31% growth including the negative impact from foreign currency.","Importantly, we're increasing our 2016 guidance for revenue, adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS. We're increasing our full-year organic revenue growth guidance from 4% to 7% previously to 6% to 8% full-year operational revenue which includes the benefit of AMS. It is being increased from 7% to 10%, to 9% to 11%. We're increasing our adjusted operating margin guidance to 24% to 24.5%. And we're also increasing our adjusted EPS guidance up $0.03 over our prior range to $1.06 to $1.10 which now represents 14% to 18% growth. And importantly, this EPS guidance includes an expected $0.05 or $0.06 negative impact from foreign exchange.","I'll now provide some highlights on Q1 results and the 2016 outlook. And in my remarks, all references to growth are on a constant currency, organic, year-over-year basis excluding the benefit of AMS unless otherwise specified.","Our Q1 revenue growth of 8% was broad-based across our businesses and regions, led again by exciting new product launches, continued global expansion and execution of our category leadership strategy. With the exception of the 3% decline in our Cardiac Rhythm Management sales, all of our other businesses delivered strong organic growth led by Endo at plus 11%, Urology and Pelvic Health, at plus 12%, Interventional Cardiology at 13%, and Peripheral Intervention at 14%.","We also saw strong growth globally with Asia delivering 14%, U.S. 7%, and Europe up 6%. Emerging markets sales grew 21% including China sales at 19%. The MedSurg businesses all accelerated from Q4 of last year and delivered adjusted operating margin of 32.6%, up 360 basis points year-over-year.","Endoscopy revenue grew 11% driven by our single-use SpyGlass Digital DS visualization system, the AXIOS stent for drainage of pancreatic fluid and the limited launch of our next generation hemostasis clip, the Resolution 360. We're also extending our category leadership in endoscopy by developing commercial capabilities in the emerging markets and adding a focus in pulmonary, which helped drive 15% growth in bronchial thermoplasty as it recently launched in both Japan and China.","Urology and Pelvic Health organic growth accelerated at 12% and was broadly based with double-digit growth in kidney stone, pelvic floor and surg\/gyn. Our legacy business grew 15% internationally led by 36% growth in the emerging markets. The AMS remediation and integration are on track and were delivered against our synergy commitments and the global teams are now fully integrated.","As expected, standalone AMS sales declined slightly in the quarter and we expect inventory to be appropriate levels in second quarter. And LithoVue, an innovative single digital ureteroscope that provides customers with visualization and navigation capabilities will be featured in multiple presentations next weekend at the American Urology Association meeting in San Diego.","Neuromodulation revenue growth accelerated 8% in first quarter and sales were driven by the market leading Spectra platform, the most flexible spinal cord stimulation system in the market, the launch of Precision Novi for the primary cell non-rechargeable market, and the solid contribution from our Vercise, our emerging deep brain stimulation platform. Our U.S. DBS trial is making great progress and we expect a launch in the U.S. in late 2017 or early 2018.","In Cardiovascular, our segment sales grew 14% in the quarter and delivered adjusted operating margin at 34.1%, up over 350 basis points both sequentially and year-over-year. Peripheral sales grew 14%, on strong results in atherectomy, thrombectomy, and our Innova bare-metal and Eluvia drug-eluting stent platforms. The legacy (07:52) Peripheral business continued its recent impressive trend as we grow share in the atherectomy market and see very strong demand for our new Zelante deep vein thrombosis platform.","The Eluvia IDE trial called IMPERIAL is on track to complete enrollment by late 2016 or early 2017, and we look forward to presenting 24-month data from our initial trial, MAJESTIC, which had a 12-month patency rate of 96.1% later this year.","We're also seeing continued progress with our Lutonix distribution agreement and encouraging EU sales of our Ranger drug-coated balloon. We're excited to be the only company developing leading drug-eluting technologies globally on multiple platforms, providing physicians with a variety of tools for treating complex peripheral vascular disease.","Interventional Cardiology turned in another double-digit quarter at 13% growth, led by complex coronary drug-eluting stents, PCI guidance, and Structural Heart. SYNERGY had a very strong quarter and we estimate that we added to our market-leading share position in the U.S. and regained market leadership position in Japan.","DES sales grew 14% in the quarter and we believe SYNERGY is on track to represent approximately 50% of our U.S. DES revenue mix by the end of the year 2016. PCI guidance again grew double digits on continued share gains on intravascular ultrasound, and we're encouraged by strong feedback and the ease of use of our Comet fractional flow reserve platform.","Our leading portfolio solutions for complex high-risk PCI patients continues to drive global growth as well. The 13% IC revenue growth was also fueled by our strengthening Structural Heart business which includes our Lotus transcatheter aortic valve and a WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure device. We believe we are uniquely positioned to drive long-term growth in these two fast-growing markets via our differentiated platforms.","Our Lotus valve continues to gain share in Europe, and we are investing significantly to further develop our capabilities. Most recently, best-in-class paravalvular leakage rates were reported for Lotus at ACC last month with pre-discharge rates of 0.4% for moderate paravalvular regurgitation in the first 750 patients of the respond post market study.","We also continue to plan for the U.S. launch with the LOTUS EDGE delivery system at the end of 2017. And we also completed an enrollment in our REPRISE Japan trial where we targeted a 2018 launch. Importantly, the LOTUS EDGE features a 14 French compatible sheath, more flexibility, simplified deployment and our new depth guard technology which controls depth of the valve in a left ventricular outflow tract. Studies to demonstrate an improved permanent pacemaker rate with this optimized technique will begin enrollment in mid-2016.","Also, in Structural Heart, WATCHMAN sales were strong and procedure growth and new account openings both helped by the finalized national coverage determination. We're developing additional WATCHMAN capabilities, primarily by adding resources in field clinical support, market development and training courses. Implant success rates and patient outcomes remain very high quality due to our controlled rollout and proven training programs.","In the ACC earlier this month, Dr. David Holmes of the Mayo Clinic presented data from the first 1,600 patients implanted with the WATCHMAN commercially and reveals 96% procedural success and an average procedure time of 50 minutes. So, overall, we're very pleased with our progress in our 2016 revenue guidance of $175 million to $200 million in Structural Heart revenue.","Rhythm Management segment sales declined 2% in the quarter, yet delivered adjusted operating margin of 16.8%, which is up 290 basis points sequentially as improving profitability remains a core focus.","In CRM as anticipated, sales declined 3% as we faced competitive launches in the U.S. and replacement cycle headwinds. We're optimistic for a second quarter and second half 2016 improvement in our CRM performance. Also as projected, we received two key FDA approvals in March for our ACUITY X4 Quad CRT lead and earlier this week for our ACCOLADE brady MRI platforms including the INGEVITY MRI pacing lead.","Pacemaker sales grew 3% globally aided by our recently launched X4 CRT-P Quad device while worldwide ICD sales declined 4%. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of the EMBLEM S-ICD, which is enjoying strong growth in both Europe and the U.S. and is currently launching in Japan. In electrophysiology, we're encouraged by double-digit growth in Europe led by our RHYTHMIA installations and the recent launches of the IntellaNav OI and IntellaTip MiFi OI ablation catheters.","In the U.S., we're now launching our Blazer Open-Irrigated Therapeutic Catheter for the treatment of Type 1 atrial flutter as we continue to invest in the franchise, launch a portfolio of navigation-enabled therapeutic catheters and build capabilities in capital equipment sales and service. We have a strong RHYTHMIA customer pipeline as many of our new platform enhancements scheduled for release in 2016.","So, to wrap up, our company had an excellent quarter. First quarter results reflect the strength of our portfolio, our ongoing investment and faster growth markets and our globalization efforts. More importantly, we are well positioned to continue our strong performance in 2016 and beyond.","I would like to thank our employees for the continued winning spirit and their commitment to the company. Now, let me turn the call over to Dan for a more detailed review of our financials.","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Mike. In Q1, we generated organic revenue growth of 8% versus our 4% to 6% guidance range and adjusted EPS of $0.28, exceeding our guidance range of $0.23 to $0.25, and representing 31% year-over-year growth. Adjusted EPS of $0.28 includes a slightly lower than expected tax rate for the quarter due to some discrete tax items.","The strong performance in Q1 was driven primarily by revenue growth upside, gross margin expansion and a lower SG&A rate versus the prior year. And as Mike mentioned, given the outperformance in Q1, we're raising full-year guidance for revenue growth, adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS. Consolidated revenue of $1.964 billion represented operational revenue growth of 13% which excludes the impact of a $58-million headwind from foreign exchange. Excluding an approximate 500-basis-point contribution from the AMS Male Urology portfolio acquisition, organic revenue growth was 8% in the quarter. On an as-reported basis, revenue grew 11% year-over-year.","Adjusted gross margin for the first quarter was 72.3%, increasing 100 basis points year-over-year. The increase resulted primarily from cost improvements driven by our value improvement programs and favorable mix, partially offset by price. And similar to Q4 of 2015, the impact of foreign exchange on gross margins was negligible on the quarter.","We continue to expect full year 2016 adjusted gross margin to be in the range of 72% to 73% which we forecast to include approximately 50 basis points of unfavorable FX. Our Q1 2016 adjusted operating margin of 25.1% represent a 260-basis point improvement over Q1 2015 which marks the seventh consecutive quarter in which we've expanded adjusted operating margin by 100 basis points or more. There was very modest reinvestment of the medical device tax benefit in Q1, which represents some timing favorability in the quarter, but we are committed to reinvesting substantially all of the full year benefit during the year.","Thus, adjusted SG&A expenses were $698 million or 35.5% of sales in the quarter, down 150 basis points year-over-year with some of the benefit due to our targeted initiatives focused on reducing SG&A, and a portion due to the more modest medical device tax benefit reinvestment I just mentioned.","Our Q1 adjusted SG&A rate was the lowest in the last 12 quarters, and we continue to believe our full-year rate will be between 35.5% and 36.5%, which, at the midpoint, would be a 140-basis-point reduction compared to 2015.","Adjusted research and development expenses were $209 million in the first quarter or 10.7% of sales, which is roughly flat year-over-year. This is another key area for us to reinvest the benefit of the medical device tax suspension. As a result, we expect our full-year 2016 adjusted R&D rate to be between 11% and 12% of sales.","Royalty expense was 1% of sales in both Q1 of this year and last year and consistent with our guidance. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $494 million in the quarter or 25.1% of sales, up 260 basis points year-over-year. Q1 adjusted operating income grew 24% year-over-year with all three reportable segments expanding adjusted operating margin by at least 250 basis points over Q1 of last year.","Of particular focus is Rhythm Management, which delivered an adjusted operating margin of 16.8%, which is up from Q4 2015's 13.9% and the full year 2015 rate of 15%. For the first half of 2016, we expect Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin to be slightly above 16%. In the second half of 2016, we expect Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin to increase roughly 200 basis points over the first half rate. This second half improvement is expected to result from realizing the full benefit of 2016 product costs, leveraging the improved top line performance expected of the global CRM and EP business, and realizing the full benefits of our plant network optimization program which is transferring a portion of our EP manufacturing to lower-cost locations.","We continue to believe Rhythm Management is on track to deliver an adjusted operating margin of 20% in 2017.","GAAP operating income which includes GAAP to adjusted items of $201 million, was $293 million in Q1 2016. The primary GAAP to adjusted items for the quarter included amortization expense of $136 million, restructuring related charges of $13 million, acquisition related SG&A expenses of $14 million, and litigation related charges of $10 million. Our total legal reserve was $1.895 billion as of March 31, 2016.","Now I'll move on to other income and expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $59 million compared to $56 million in Q1 last year and the increase was primarily due to the incremental debt raised in Q2 of last year to finance the AMS Male Urology portfolio acquisition. Our average interest rate was 4% in Q1 2016 compared to 5.1% in Q1 last year. And the lower interest expense rate in Q1 this year was primarily due to lower average cost of debt resulting from the senior notes refinancing which we completed in Q2 last year. Other expense was $10 million and this consisted primarily of foreign exchange losses and investment losses incurred during the quarter.","Our tax rate for the quarter was 11.4% on a reported basis and 11.8% on an adjusted basis. Excluding discrete tax items in the quarter, our adjusted tax rate would have been 13.5% and we continue to expect our full year 2016 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 14%.","On a reported GAAP basis, Q1 2016 EPS was $0.15 and includes net charges and amortization expense totaling $176 million after tax. GAAP EPS of $0.15 compares to break even in Q1 of last year.","Moving on to the balance sheet, DSO of 60 days increased one day compared to March of last year. Days inventory on hand of 162 days was down four days compared to March of last year and one day from year end 2015. Capital expenditures were $59 million in the quarter compared to $46 million in Q1 2015. And as a reminder, we expect full year 2016 capital expenditures to be roughly $350 million. This is $100 million higher than the full year 2015, primarily due to the construction of our new manufacturing facility and distribution center in Malaysia. And beyond 2016, we expect capital expenditures to return to our more historical run rate of approximately $250 million annually.","Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $250 million compared to $118 million in Q1 2015, and this strong start gives us confidence in our adjusted free cash flow target of $1.5 billion which represents 10% growth, and better visibility to our stretch goal of $1.6 billion which would represent 17% growth, even in a year with an incremental $100 million in CapEx spend as I mentioned.","We're also continuing to pursue inventory management initiatives designed to improve the working capital contribution to cash flow. In Q1, we used cash primarily to fund previously agreed legal settlements as well as business development activities. Consistent with our goal of returning to pre-AMS debt leverage by year end 2016, we still expect to repay $250 million of bank term loans by the end of this year. As of March 31 this year, we had cash on hand of $338 million. Near term, our capital allocation priorities are to prepay debt, manage our contingencies and pursue tuck-in M&A.","We ended the quarter with 1.370 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect our share count to increase by roughly 5 million per quarter through the end of the year, as we plan to keep the buyback suspended for the balance of 2016. We would expect this to result in a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.380 million for the full year 2016.","I'd like to conclude with revenue and earnings per share guidance for Q2 and full year 2016. For the full year, we now expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $8.075 billion to $8.225 billion which represents year-over-year growth of 6% to 8% on an organic basis, 9% to 11% on an operational basis which includes the AMS revenue, and 8% to 10% on a reported basis. As a result of a stronger dollar, at current rates we expect foreign exchange to be a headwind of approximately $100 million for the full year 2016.","As we move through 2016, we are reinvesting the benefit of the medical device tax suspension into innovation to help treat patients and sustain top line growth over the long-term. Focus areas will include R&D efforts including clinical trial spend as well as market development, and in Q2, we've already begun to ramp this reinvestment, primarily in the areas of Structural Heart with both Lotus and WATCHMAN, and other durable long-term revenue growth platforms such as the EMBLEM S-ICD, our electrophysiology portfolio, deep brain stimulation and other fast-growing adjacent markets.","In addition, Q2 is our seasonally high SG&A spend quarter, partially due to the highest tradeshow activity of the year. Thus, for Q2 2016, and consistent with prior years, we would expect a sequential decline in adjusted operating margin to a range of 23% to 24% which, at the midpoint, represents 140 basis points of improvement year-over-year, and puts first half 2016 adjusted operating margin at 200 basis points, up versus the first half of last year.","For the full year 2016, we are raising our adjusted operating margin guidance from 23.5% to 24.5% to a range of 24% to 24.5% now, which also represents a 200 basis point year-over-year gain. This gain is from operational efficiencies and not the med device tax as we are reinvesting the benefits.","Turning to adjusted EPS, we now expect full year adjusted EPS for 2016 to be in a range of $1.06 to $1.10, representing 14% to 18% adjusted earnings growth and an increase of $0.03 to each end of the range compared to our prior guidance.","Now, let me walk you through our updated assumptions for the FX impact on adjusted EPS. Our initial 2016 guidance assumed $0.02 of unfavorable FX on adjusted EPS in Q1 and $0.06 for the full year. In Q1, the combination of exchange rate movements and timing of hedging contracts resulted in an unfavorable impact of $0.01, and we now believe the full year 2016 unfavorable impact will be $0.05 to $0.06. In addition to the $0.01 in Q1, we would expect the remaining $0.04 to $0.05 of unfavorable FX for the full year to break down into $0.02 in Q2 and $0.02 to $0.03 in the second half of 2016.","Excluding the unfavorable foreign exchange, our full year adjusted EPS guidance range represents growth of 19% to 24%. On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.64 to $0.69.","Now turning specifically to Q2 2016, we expect consolidated revenues to be in a range of $2.010 billion to $2.060 billion. If current foreign exchange rates hold constant, the headwind from FX should be approximately $25 million, or 135 basis points relative to Q2 of last year. We expect consolidated Q2 sales to grow year-over-year in a range of 6% to 8% organically and 11% to 13% operationally.","For the second quarter, adjusted EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.25 to $0.27 per share and GAAP EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.14 to $0.17 per share. Please check our Investor Relations website for Q1 2016 financial and operational highlights which outlines Q1 results as well as Q2 and full year 2016 guidance, including P&L line item guidance.","So, with that, I'll turn it back to Susie who will moderate the Q&A.","Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Dan. Roxanne, let's open it up to questions for the next 30 minutes or so. In order to enable us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Roxanne, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins, Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Robert A. Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, thanks and good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. So, to start out, Mike, obviously this is one of the best growth quarters you guys have had in a while, and congratulations on the great start to the year. I was wondering if you could talk to us a little bit about just the broader macro environment and the health of the markets you're in, and maybe just talk about the factors driving growth. And I would really appreciate it if you could talk a little bit about Uro and Endo as well and some of the products that are driving growth in that division because obviously that's where you had some really nice outperformance Thanks.","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yep. Yeah. Good morning, Bob. Thanks for this question. Overall, the market growth we see consistent with what we've mentioned in the past, kind of playing in 3% to 4% growth markets overall for Boston Scientific. And similar to our Investor Day presentation, we're investing in the faster growth markets that would basically accelerate the growth profile another 100, 200 basis points in the markets that we serve.","So, with kind of similar growth rates in IC and Cardiology and CRM kind of in the low-single-digit range and more in the 4% to 5% market growth rates for our MedSurg. But I guess what we're most proud of is really, across the board, with the exception of CRM, we're growing \u2013 and EP, we're growing significantly faster than our competition. And that's really driven by our product launches and really excellent global execution. We're really pleased with the growth in Asia. Profit almost 15%, very strong growth in Japan, very strong growth in Europe. So, across our businesses or regions, our teams are really delivering.","In terms of your question on Endo and Urology, we're very thoughtful about the AMS acquisition and we're seeing the benefits of the commercial synergies between those organizations given the additional commercial footprint that we have as well as the broadness of the bag. And you're seeing that with a really acceleration of our legacy Urology division, in part due to the synergies of our AMS business. We continue to invest in physician training for our Stone Institute, and we continue to benefit from the category leadership based on the premise of the AMS acquisition.","In Endoscopy, it's a very innovative division, and we continue to lead innovation with our digital SpyGlass system which is really a terrific platform for us that we can continue to build from, and that also helps drive pull-through of our core portfolio.","So, the R&D teams are executing as well as the commercial teams, and we continue to be committed to our durable mid-single-digit revenue growth, our operating margin expansion, and our double-digit EPS growth over the long term.","Robert A. Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks for that. And then a follow-up maybe for Dan. Dan, can you just help us? Was there any, in your view, selling day mismatch this quarter versus a year ago? And then on the operating margin performance in the quarter, it sounds like over the course of the rest of the year, there's going to be some incremental spending because obviously you're guiding to a lower operating margin than you started out in Q1. So, maybe just comment on the selling day year-over-year, and then also maybe quantify and describe some of the extra spending that you're going to be undertaking here in the remainder of the year. Thank you.","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Bob. First, quickly on the calendar, no, we don't believe there's an extra impact in Q1. There was obviously a leap year day. But then when you factor in the timing of the Easter holiday, believe it's a true 8% growth for the quarter organically. Relative to operating margin, so I think when you look at Q1 at the 25%, and then you look at the 24.25% which is the midpoint for the full year, one of the key changes there is, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the reinvestment of the medical device tax benefit over the rest of the year. So, little delayed in Q1 getting off to that start, but committed to reinvesting the entire amount for the rest of the year, so that's one.","And I think there's R&D timing as well in Q1, so, our Q1 R&D was 10.7%. If you look at the guidance range, you'd see 11.5% at the midpoint. Part of that's the med device tax reinvestment, and part of it's just the timing of overall R&D. So, that's another 80 basis points there going from the 10.7% in Q1 to the overall average of the 11.5% for the full year.","So still, as you look at the 24.25%, still significant growth versus last year, 190 basis points, and feel good that we're striking a good balance between delivering differentiated adjusted operating margin and investing for a continually growing top line for the future.","Robert A. Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Just a few quick questions. Mike, I guess the issue for us this quarter is that we expected an inflection quarter sometime this year. Obviously, it's coming earlier. But I guess as we think about the balance of the businesses, we actually thought there could be acceleration from whatever the growth rate was in the first quarter out. And I wonder, can you point us to tailwinds, headwinds in the business throughout the balance of the year based on this thought of acceleration throughout the year?","And then, with specific attention, perhaps, within cardiovascular, you talked about those businesses, but in terms of stents, WATCHMAN, Lotus, what's really driving that strength in cardio? So, acceleration and then, particular cardiovascular, and I have one quick one for Dan.","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That is a multipoint question. Thanks, Dave. Just overall we are pleased with our performance in the quarter. We took the guidance up from 4% to 7%, to 6% to 8% organically, not impacting AMS. And as I mentioned, the businesses and regions are performing at a nice level. As we look, we obviously anticipate a solid second quarter given our 6% to 8% guidance in second quarter.","We do face a couple headwinds throughout the year. We do anniversary some key product launches in our Peripheral Vascular as well as our Endoscopy business. We do anticipate some Japan reimbursement cuts that we'll be working through. And we're very bullish on our WATCHMAN program, but we're also anniversarying the initial launch. So, there are a few headwinds but overall, we have an excellent product cadence. The business is performing well. And we feel comfortable with raising our guidance to 6% to 8%.","On the Cardiology side, we're seeing excellent \u2013 our strategy play out. We continue to diversify our Interventional Cardiology portfolio. As we've talked in the future, we really see, in the future, about a third of our business coming from Structural Heart, about a third from Imaging and complex coronary, and about a third from drug-eluting stents.","And across those three slices of the pie, we're doing a nice job of delivering in the short-term and investing for the long-term. Our SYNERGY program is really going as planned. We're on track for SYNERGY to represent about 50% of our mix at a appropriate premium price. And physicians continue to see the benefit of the deliverability and the excellent zero-step thrombosis at beyond the first 24 hours, so excellent clinical data there.","Our Complex Coronary business continues to do well as well as our imaging business. And in Structural Heart as Dan mentioned, I'm actually over in Korea as we speak here. We just had a live case from Australia today and just physician reaction to the deliverability and low PVL rates of our Lotus valve continues to be very high. And so, we are really increasing our investment in that category, given the size of the market potential in the future, and also given the differentiation that we believe that Lotus delivers and our commercial capability. So, hopefully that gives you a bit of flavor. We're pleased with our raise on the guidance and we'll manage our headwinds to continue to hopefully deliver revenue growth at the top tier of our sector.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All right, Mike. That's great color. And Dan, I hate to bore you with a nit here, it was such a good quarter. But we're actually getting your constant currency growth rate this quarter as even higher than you reported. We have a $58 million FX headwind for a 3.3% headwind versus 2%. Are we missing something here in the quarter? And we can take it offline if we're off our rocker.","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, David. I think it's just the rounding of 3%. The way we see it is 3%. So, it's just a little bit in the rounding of the numbers.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks so much.","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yep. Thanks, David.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Mike Weinstein, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, guys. So, when's the last time Boston Scientific grew 8% organic? You guys know the answer?","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'll bet you Dan knows. I don't.","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'd say 10 years, Mike.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","2Q 2005.","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's right.","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","There you go. Let's do it again.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","What strikes me in particular is if I look at the U.S. performance and I back out CRM and I back out AMS, I'm getting to about 15% growth for the U.S. business in aggregate, which is obviously very, very strong.","So, I want to circle back first to Bob's question just to make sure you don't think that there's anything kind of unusual going on in selling days, and I heard your answer there. But we are seeing this particular strength, and not just Boston Scientific. We've seen this in some other end markets over the course of the past week that have come in stronger. Anything that you think is going on that showed up this quarter in particular that is driving this real increase in volumes? And I'm speaking not just of your own performance, but do you have any theories on the broader market looking stronger this quarter than we've seen in a while?","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Good morning, Mike. We don't see a big change in the market from our peers that have reported. We were seeing a 1% to 4% growth rate with the exception of one, which is higher than ours. So, we do feel like we're growing faster than most of our peers. And I also think we're going through maybe a bit of a cycle of some good innovation and some mix benefit. We clearly see a lot of enthusiasm, for example, for S-ICD, despite our headwinds in the near term on MRI, which we're pleased with the pace for approval, we're getting nice mix benefit from S-ICD as well as global uptick of the S-ICD, particularly in Japan. And I think our strategy of category leadership, which we've really stressed for a number of years now is starting to pay off. Many of the large systems in the U.S. are willing and wanting to partner with Boston Scientific given our current platform as well as the pipeline that we've committed to.","So, I think the markets are steady. We have a nice pipeline that's helping some of our mix benefit. And I think, importantly, we're really building up our capabilities outside the U.S. Our Asia business grew very well. And just this year, we've done a grand opening for our Malaysia plant. We have a new R&D center in India. We have new training centers. So, our capabilities in Asia are significantly stronger than they used to be. So, that's also helping to strengthen our business.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Mike, if I look at the Interventional Cardiology business in the U.S., if I look at the Peripheral Vascular business in the U.S., I mean, both just had exceptional quarters; Interventional Cardiology up 21%, Peripheral Vascular up 13%. Would you mind just peeling the onion a little bit and help us understand how those businesses are doing as well as they are? Because obviously, that's well above expectations.","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think it really speaks the category leadership. So, two words that get used a lot in the industry, but I think we're delivering it. We have an excellent portfolio. Interventional Cardiology, as I mentioned, I'm in Korea here at this large conference. And we believe we have the best drug-eluting stent in the marketplace. We have an excellent imaging platform with IVUS and we're launching FFR. We're the leaders in chronic total occlusion. We have the WATCHMAN product for interventional cardiologists who want to implant it, and a very promising and differentiated TAVR valve.","So, I think our category leadership strategies are working in cardiology, and similarly in Peripheral Vascular with our \u2013 I won't go through all of them, but the Bayer acquisition, really has exceeded the investment models that we've had in terms of synergies and growth. And our drug-eluting stent platforms with the stents and the balloon are doing quite well.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I'll let some others jump in, but congratulations, guys, on a obviously a fantastic quarter.","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Mike. Appreciate it.","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from Rick Wise, Stifel, please go ahead.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, Mike. Good morning, everybody. Let me turn to one area of weakness. Obviously, CRM, High Power down 4%, Mike. Can you talk a little bit more about that? And specifically, you called out the replacement headwinds. You've been talking about the replacement headwinds in CRM and High Power for a while. My sense is from your comments in the past is that that \u2013 it's going to shift more to neutral or even a tailwind at some point in the not too distant future. Can you give us any more concrete thoughts about when that happens and the kind of drag it is now and how that could change as we look to 2017 and beyond?","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thanks for the question, Rick. Just regarding our CRM performance broadly and I'll comment on the replacement headwind. It's really as we projected almost a year ago. We knew we were going to have some challenges in the U.S. Our Asia business, our Japanese business and our European business in CRM are doing quite well and growing either at or above market. And the two launches will help us improve growth, we anticipate, in the second quarter and for the second half. And also the team continues to improve operating income margins despite negative growth in the quarter which is good to see.","On the replacement headwinds, we don't have any additional breakdown of data that we're going to provide on this call. But I will say \u2013 and I think in the future we'll consider providing some additional detail so we can quantify that \u2013 but similar to our last call, I do think we have brighter days ahead of us in CRM, with a pacer MRI approval, with a Quad approval. We've also initiated our MRI approval for our defib platform which we see getting approval in mid-2017.","So, the portfolio is very strong. We'll have EMBLEM MRI likely approved in U.S. in third quarter. And so, we do see the headwind of the replacement cycle improving at the end of 2016, which will help us in 2017. So, with a product cadence and improve replacement cycle headwind, we see some brighter days for our CRM business. And in the future, we'll look at quantifying more precisely some of the benefit of that tailwind on the replacement cycle.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks. And as a follow-up, maybe turn to WATCHMAN. Are you inclined to give us any kind of numbers for the quarter? You're adding field support; you're on track for the next 100 accounts. Was there any stocking? Maybe any more granular detail about the progress you're making and the impact of the NCD? Thanks again.","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yep. WATCHMAN team is doing a nice job. Most importantly, we continue to believe in our $175 million to $200 million in Structural Heart revenue guidance. We're on track as planned to open up another 100 centers, and we, again, continually have very thoughtful training program.","The NCD's a very good outcome for us and it really reassures and strengthens our view as to the potential size of the market. And we invest, as you mentioned, in clinical specialists. We're investing in physician training and really to build up the market the appropriate way. So, we're really delivering as planned and we're very pleased with the outcomes and the enthusiasm with WATCHMAN globally.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks again.","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And Rick, I would probably just add one little bit of color on the replacement headwinds as well. It's kind of a tale of two pieces within the franchise there. So, as Mike said, as we head into the end of 2016 and more likely 2017, you'll see the \u2013 more of a tailwind on the CRT-D side \u2013 and then it's more of an ending 2017 into 2018 on the traditional transvenous ICD side. So, there's a little bit of a bifurcation on that one. So, a little bit extra color.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Thanks, again.","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yep.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell, SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Imron Shahzad Zafar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. This is actually Imron Zafar in for Bruce. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a couple questions about the TAVR business. Can you just talk about where you think you are in Europe vis-\u00e0-vis market share and where you think you can go in the next, call it, couple years in that geography? And then also, if you could just give any commentary around this litigation with Edwards on transcatheter valves in the U.S.. Thanks.","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So, on our Lotus program, as Dan outlined, we continue to invest a significant portion of our med device benefit in our Structural Heart franchise. In terms of share, we don't break out our share specifically in Europe. We are more limited versus some of our peers in terms of number of countries we're selling into. So, we're waiting to get reimbursement still for France. So, that's a large market that will open up for us in the future. But we continue to grow above market in the markets that we're serving, particularly in Germany.","And the physician feedback continues be very strong on the low PVL rates which we believe are best-in-class and really the control and fully achievable and repositional capabilities of the platform.","So, we continue to invest and we're excited about the enhancements of our depth guard technology that I mentioned in the prepared comments. Keith, any additional comments you want to mention on Lotus?","Keith D. Dawkins - Global Chief Medical Officer & Executive VP","Yes. So, we've got a pretty rich number of presentations, the EuroPCR next month on Lotus; late-breaking trial on 1,000 patients from the response study, bicuspid valve subgroup from the response study, subclavian approach from the response study, a Lotus symposium, and on the stent side the EVOLVE first human-use five years data for the first time. And then, obviously, as we said at ACC, coincident with London Valves later this year, we're anticipating launching LOTUS EDGE which has a number of features including 14 French compatibility, more simple implantation procedure, more flexible device, and the depth guide technology which reduces the amount that the valve dips into the left ventricular outflow tract during deployment.","So we have a lot going on with Lotus and then the additional sizes of 21 and 29 millimeter. And we've completed, as Mike said in his statement earlier, the REPRISE Japan study which is important.","Imron Shahzad Zafar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And can you just give any color on the litigation with Edwards?","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Yeah. We're not going to comment on our pending legal matters.","Imron Shahzad Zafar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yep.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Vijay Kumar, Evercore. Please go ahead.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Hey, guys. Congrats on a great quarter. So maybe, the first question I had was maybe a housekeeping question on a \u2013 you mentioned ICD declines and double-digit growth in stents. Was that in both geographies? When you say stents up double-digits, was that double-digit in both geographies, U.S., o-U.S.? And similarly on ICDs, I'm just wondering whether declines was only in the U.S. or did you see declines in o-U.S.?","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, Dan, do you want to comment on that one?","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Vijay, thanks for the question. We're not going to get too specific in terms of the growth rates by geography. Obviously, we think of Japan, we had approval for SYNERGY early in the quarter, so we're off and running there. We're on offense there. We had SYNERGY in the middle of the fourth quarter in the U.S., so strong growth there in stents. And Europe which has had SYNERGY for a long time is still doing very well. So, no, I don't want to quote specific numbers for each of the regions there.","And I think, overall, I think Mike's commentary around CRM was pretty detailed, that if you think of \u2013 we're doing very well in Japan. We're doing well in Europe. And the CRM softness has been more of a U.S. product gap issue and we've hopefully solved a couple of those product gaps with the recent Quad approval and with the MRI safe brady approval.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Understood. And I just had one follow-up, Dan. When you think about the longer-term operating margin rate, I know you guys have laid out the 25% margin targets for 2017. Can you just talk about the leverage and your confidence in bending the SG&A line? Because it feels like just looking at the trends, the 25% might be \u2013 there's upside to that 25% number for 2017. And then any comments beyond 2017?","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. We've stated publicly before that by 2020 we believe we'd be at 27% to 28% operating margin, just at operating margin as a company, and the 25.1% is a great start to the year. But as I mentioned, the average for the year should be between 24% and 24.5%. And as always, we seek to strike that balance between delivering the adjusted operating margin and ensuring that durable consistent revenue growth for the long term. And if you look at our numbers this year, if you look at 6% to 8% organic revenue growth, 190 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion at the midpoint of the range and adjusted EPS growth of 14% at the low and 18% at the high end, I think we're effectively achieving that objective. And as you look at 2017 and beyond, we look to continue to deliver high performance and that's the goal.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Josh Jennings, Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks a lot. Wanted to hopefully start off with a question for Dan and just a follow-up on the operating margin discussion and some of the strength you saw in Q1 and particularly in the guidance. Can you talk about AMS integration and is AMS contributing already to operating margin? And how do you see the AMS contribution going through the year and also as it flows down into the bottom line in the accretion levels that you guys had guided to historically? Are you still on track there?","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think the short answer to that Josh is that we are right on track. So we had talked about $0.03 accretion in the year from AMS. We're on track to achieve that. And then next year, we had talked about $0.07 and we should be on track for that. And the difference is really some of the integration costs that we have this year with respect to the quality remediation and some of the things like IT and such that are pushing that down a bit this year. And next year, you should see the full power of what AMS can bring to the margin story for the company.","Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then, Mike, I was hoping to just follow up on the CRM business. Clearly you have some nice approvals over the last month and particularly this week on the MRI, filling that MRI-safe product gap on the low-voltage side, and you initiated your MRI-safe trial for high voltage. I just wanted to get your level of confidence, your team's level of confidence in the timelines there. And maybe just help us think about the steps going forward in terms of times of enrollment and during the enrollment period and follow-up period just to help us think about the safety of that mid-2017 timeline on the high voltage side. Thanks a lot.","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yep. Sure. We feel comfortable with it. I think we've been reasonably accurate on the forecast for some of these big product approvals with the Quad and the MRI pacer. So, we're looking at call it mid-2017, maybe to hedge that a bit, third quarter 2017 for approval of our tachy MRI product.","Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President-Investor Relations","Roxanne, let's take one more.","Operator","Right. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic, UBS. Please go ahead.","Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, Vic, I'm on. Hi. Thanks for taking our question. So, a couple, if I could. One on WATCHMAN, just a follow-up on some of the questions that have already been asked. But what we hear, I guess, from centers, obviously NCD in place and differentiated device. And I think everyone's excited to see how this rolls out. But there is some question, I guess, about how profitable this is to some of these centers. For some, it does seem to be a little bit on the tight side for pricing net of reimbursement, but at the same time doesn't seem to be, from what we can tell, a significant impediment to interest or early adoption.","So, any thoughts on how you see that playing out over time or regionally playing out as it begins to pick up steam here? And then I have one follow-up for Dan.","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. So the NCD was a nice win for us. And we believe we really have the right sweet spot in terms of the WATCHMAN pricing. It is financially viable at most of the heart centers that we have contracted with. So, we stay very close to that, and it's really part of our category leadership strategy. So, we want to price it at the appropriate level given the investment that we've made in the platform, as well as future clinical trials that we're supporting as we advance this new therapy. But we do believe it's financially viable and a healthy product with appropriate margins for the vast majority of our hospital that are using this today.","Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful color. And then for Dan, on some of the work you're doing to drive manufacturing efficiencies and working capital efficiencies, net operating asset turnover here, obviously a key driver for ROIC and you do have an opportunity there from what we can tell. It's obviously a focus. Wondering if you could sketch out how we should see that begin to play out because understanding your manufacturing rationalization or the efforts you have underway, it may not be apparent from the numbers, on a turnover basis, the improvements that you're making. But would love to get a sense of when that'll start to become apparent and maybe start having an additional impact on returns on capital.","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. I think I'd like to believe you'll see some of that impact this year. So, we have a significant emphasis on reducing inventory, and I had mentioned that in some of my prepared remarks, and trying to prove that, from our perspective, we can grow sales at the rate they we're doing but also optimize inventory. And we have a lot of work ongoing to try and do some things to rationalize that. And from a cash flow as well as the other metrics that you mentioned, reduce inventory overall by the end of the year as a company.","So, my goal would be that as we go through the year, you'd see that. It was pretty reasonable compared to Q4 of last year, inventory this year. And so we've stemmed the tide a bit now and I'd look to, for the last three quarters, to see that reduce which will help all of the turnover and asset metrics as well as the contribution of working capital to cash flow.","Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Excellent. Thanks so much.","Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President-Investor Relations","All right. With that, we'd like to conclude the call. Thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest and before you disconnect, Roxanne will give all the pertinent details for the replay.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will connect a question and answer session and instructions will be given at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ms. Susie Lisa, please go ahead.","Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release, as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financial Information.","The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Mike will provide strategic and revenue highlights of the fourth quarter, Dan will review the financials for the quarter and then provide first quarter 2016 and full year 2016 guidance, and then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Keith Dawkins and Dr. Ken Stein.","Before we begin I'd like to remind everyone that on the call organic revenue growth is defined as excluding the impact of sales from divested businesses, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and sales from the acquisition of the American Medical Systems or AMS Male Urology portfolio over the prior year period.","Also note this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share, new product approvals and launches, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance, including sales, margins, earnings and other Q4 and full year 2015 results and Q1 and full year 2016 guidance, as well as our tax rates, R&D spend, and other expenses.","Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs and 8-Ks filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them.","At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike?","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Susie and good morning, everyone. In fourth quarter, Boston Scientific posted another quarter of strong results and closed out an excellent 2015 as we continue to execute against our strategic plan goals.","At our May, 2015 Investor Day meeting, we outlined plans to drive mid-single-digit organic revenue growth and consistent adjusted operating margin expansion, which in turn will drive double-digit adjusted EPS growth, excluding the impact of FX.","We are delivering against these objectives. In Q4, we grew worldwide sales 5% organically and 10% operationally, which includes the benefit of the AMS Urology business. We also grew adjusted operating income by 10% in the fourth quarter, which represents 100 basis point year-to-year improvement, to 21.7%. This solid revenue growth and margin expansion drove very strong 18% adjusted EPS growth to $0.26 and our fourth quarter results reflect our focus on delivering meaningful innovation while also providing clinical and economic value to our hospital customers.","Importantly, our Q4 results built upon the consistent momentum generated over the past few years and contributed the following full year 2015 results. For the full year, we delivered 5% organic revenue growth and 8% operational revenue growth, which includes the acquired sales from Bayer Peripheral and AMS.","In parallel with the consistent revenue growth, we are driving strong improvements to our operating margin. In 2014, we delivered 130 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin. In 2015, we delivered an additional 210 basis point improvement to a full year 22.3%. And per our previous goals, we continue to expect to deliver 25% plus adjusted operating margin in 2017, with plans to deliver an additional 200 basis points to 300 basis points of improvement by year-end 2020.","We delivered full year of 2015 adjusted EPS of $0.93, representing 11% growth for the full year. It's important to note that 11% adjusted EPS growth includes a significant negative foreign exchange impact of $0.10 versus our original expectation of a $0.04 hit when we originally gave 2015 guidance.","We're very pleased that we were able to overcome this FX headwind while investing in the long-term growth of the company, yet still delivering on our commitment for double-digit adjusted EPS growth. We continue to believe that Boston Scientific is uniquely positioned to deliver differentiated shareholder value through durable mid-single-digit revenue growth and double-digit adjusted EPS growth via our ongoing operating margin improvement initiatives.","We're excited about our 2016 and our plans to build upon our global momentum. In 2016, we're targeting full year organic revenue growth of 4% to 7% and operational revenue growth of 7% to 10%. We are guiding adjusted EPS to $1.03 to $1.07, which represents 11% to 15% earnings growth. Importantly, this EPS once again includes an expected $0.06 negative impact from foreign exchange.","I'll now provide some highlights on fourth quarter and 2015 results along with thoughts on our 2016 outlook. In my remarks, all references to growth are on an organic year-over-year constant currency basis unless otherwise specified. Our fourth quarter organic revenue growth of 5% was broad-based across businesses and regions, and was led by exciting new product launches, which continued global expansion and execution of our category leadership strategy.","With the exception of the anticipated 1% decline in CRM sales, all of our other businesses grew organic revenue by at least 6% led by 10% growth in PI. IC had a strong quarter growing 6% against a very tough 10% comp in Q4 2014. And importantly, all three medical surgical businesses grew revenue at 7% while also improving segmented adjusted operating margin by 90 basis points year-over-year to 34.1%.","We delivered another quarter of balanced global growth led by 6% revenue growth in Asia, 5% growth in the U.S. and Europe. Another highlight was strong 15% revenue growth in emerging markets, led by 20% growth in China and Brazil.","The MedSurg businesses continued to deliver. In Endoscopy, we delivered 7% growth in Q4 fueled by the strength of our portfolio, our expanding global commercial reach and ongoing launches of our SpyGlass DS and AXIOS Stent.","SpyGlass DS was launched in July 2015 and is an advanced single use visualization system for the diagnosis and treatment of complex disorders of the pancreas and bile ducts. It's truly a cornerstone product that is highly differentiated and complementary to our core endo portfolio.","Our AXIOS Stent is used for transluminal drainage of pancreatic fluid collections and is also off to a strong start. We'll continue to innovate in endoscopic ultrasound and other exciting therapeutic categories including pulmonary and oncology to further enhance our global leadership in endoscopy.","Urology and public health also continued a strong performance trend, growing 7% organically in Q4 led by laser fibers, capital equipment and strong international growth.","Importantly this quarter we launched LithoVue, a disposable ureteroscope, which provides customers with visualization and navigation capabilities to diagnose and treat stones and other conditions of the kidney, ureter and bladder. And after closing the AMS Urology acquisition in August, we remain on track to realize our adjusted EPS accretion goals of at least $0.03 in 2016 and $0.07 in 2017.","Neuromodulation revenue grew 7% in fourth quarter led by strong growth in both the U.S. and international. Sales were driven by the market leading Spectra platform and the launch of Precision Novi, our first product of the primary cell non-rechargeable market.","In addition, we are seeing really promising uptake of our Vercise Deep Brain Stimulation System due to its Cartesia directional lead system and our partnership with Brainlab. Our U.S. DBS trial is making progress, and we expect to complete enrollment in 2016 and enter the market in late 2017 or early 2018.","Our Cardiovascular group grew 7% in Q4 led by impressive 10% growth in Peripheral Interventions. The core PI business continues to execute and we're very pleased with integration of the legacy Bayer business. The legacy Bayer business grew over 20% for the second quarter in a row as we continue to grow share in the atherectomy market and we're encouraged by our early results from the global launch of our ZelanteDVT catheter, and the U.S. launch of our Innova Stent for the SFA.","We also recently began to enroll our IMPERIAL U.S. IDE trial for Eluvia, our drug-eluting stent. And remain on track for a European launch of Eluvia this quarter.","In addition, we recently closed the CeleNova transaction, which is a synergistic tuck-in acquisition focused on the treatment of liver cancer via localized delivery of chemotherapeutic agents. And finally in PI, we continue to benefit from our commercial relationship with C.R. Bard and the Lutonix Drug Coated Balloon technology.","Interventional Cardiology continues to deliver with 6% growth in the quarter, which represents the sixth consecutive quarter of plus 6% growth in IC. Growth was led by worldwide imaging, U.S. and European drug-eluting stents, our complex PCI portfolio and Structural Heart. PCI guidance grew low teens globally and we're encouraged by the market enthusiasm of our integrated fractional flow reserve platform.","In DES, the U.S. SYNERGY launch is going extremely well. We anticipate that SYNERGY will represent approximately 50% of our DES revenue mix in the U.S. by the end of 2016. In addition, we're launching SYNERGY in Japan and we'll continue to expand SYNERGY in other international markets. We also continue to invest in building upon the strong clinical evidence for SYNERGY as we have initiated the EVOLVE short DAPT study.","Finally, the IC performance was fueled by our strengthening Structural Heart business, which includes our Lotus aortic valve and WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure device. We're truly in an exciting position to drive growth and share gains over the long run in these fast growing markets. Lotus delivered a strong quarter in the European market, as the platform continues to build momentum, despite our near-term size matrix limitations. Lotus offers physicians excellent control during implantation and best-in-class paravalvular leakage rates. In our RESPOND post-market study, 95.1% of patients had zero to trace PVL.","Importantly, we completed enrollment in our REPRISE III IDE study in December, which we anticipate will position us for a late 2017 U.S. market entrance. We're also pleased to announce completion of the 1,000 patient RESPOND Lotus post-market study and those results will be presented at EuroPCR in May.","We're expanding the Lotus platform and expect to launch our next gen 14 French delivery system along with additional sizes in Europe this year. Also in Structural Heart, the U.S. WATCHMAN launch continues to progress ahead of plan. We're pleased with the implant success rates and the high quality of patient outcomes thus far, which reflect our controlled rollout and proven training program.","In addition, Dr. Vivek Reddy of Mount Sinai recently published in JACC a study highlighting WATCHMAN's cost effectiveness versus both warfarin and novel oral anti-coagulants. In the U.S., we opened more than 100 WATCHMAN accounts in 2015 and expect to open an additional 100 accounts in 2016. In Europe, we're looking forward to a full launch of our second-gen WATCHMAN FLEX which already has CE Mark. As for U.S. reimbursement, we await a final NCD decision from CMS by February 8 and we remain confident that WATCHMAN will represent at least a $500 million worldwide market opportunity.","So overall, we're very pleased with our progress in Structural Heart and excited about our capabilities and the long-term prospects for this business. We exceeded our full year 2015 Structural Heart revenue goal of $75 million to $100 million and in 2016, we anticipate Structural Heart sales between $175 million and $200 million.","Now turning to CRM, on our first quarter 2015 earnings call we projected a slowdown in our worldwide CRM sales for the balance of 2015 and through first quarter 2016, primarily due to replacement cycle headwinds and competitive launches in the U.S. Our forecast was accurate as global CRM sales declined 1% in Q4. However, we're very encouraged about our forward-looking CRM position given a strong cadence of new launches expected in the U.S. and Japan in 2016, our leading position and growing awareness of S-ICD, and our replacement cycle headwind becoming more favorable as we exit 2016.","In the U.S., we plan to launch our full X4 Quad system with our Accolade Brady MRI safe system in the first half and EMBLEM MRI safe in the second half of 2016. And we anticipate these releases will strengthen 2016 CRM performance, particularly in the second half.","Pacemaker sales again grew 2% and we recently launched X4 CRT-D Quad device. And while our ICD sales declined 2%, we continue to be pleased with our de novo ICD performance and the EMBLEM S-ICD in particular. EMBLEM continues to drive strong growth and de novo share gains in both Europe and the U.S. EMBLEM is building momentum globally and we look forward to launching EMBLEM in Japan this quarter with a reimbursement premium and expanding S-ICD to additional international markets in 2016.","In Europe, we continue to gain share and grow our CRM business in the mid-single-digit range with our complete portfolio. These consistent European CRM results are encouraging as we look forward to our anticipated U.S. approvals in 2016.","Lastly, in CRM we're continuously mounting third-party evidence of the economic benefits associated with our ENDURALIFE extended battery technology. And recently another third-party dataset from the EuroPace was published, demonstrating the six-year survival of BSC CRT-Ds over our competitors. Also, a recent U.S. study modeled a 14% reduction in Medicare cost from a two-year increase in ICD battery longevity. And an Italian study showed Extended Longevity drove a 29% to 34% reduction in long-term healthcare cost over a 15 year period.","Turning to our EP business, we delivered 8% growth in the quarter. Our Rhythmia platform continues to roll out nicely driven by new installations and higher case volumes. We have a strong Rhythmia customer pipeline in 2016 as well as new platform enhancements scheduled for release.","We did see some softness in EP in the fourth quarter primarily driven by the delay in our European launch of our IntelliNav ablation catheter, which we anticipate launching later in first quarter. We continue to strengthen our EP business and we look forward to continued progress in 2016.","Our strategy of category leadership is working and it's helping us to become a stronger partner with our global customers. As the healthcare environment continues to evolve, we're building new capabilities to support our customers beyond our product portfolio with our Advantix solutions offerings. These offerings are focused on driving operational excellence within cardiovascular and GI labs, and improving the standardizing care for chronic cardiovascular diseases. And just last week, we announced an alliance with Accenture to develop a data-driven digital health solution to improve patient outcomes and reduce cost to treat patients with chronic cardiovascular diseases.","So to wrap up my section, our company has great momentum and our 2015 results reflect the strength of our portfolio and our ongoing investment in the faster growth markets, our globalization efforts and execution of our global teams. More importantly, we believe that we are well-positioned to continue and strengthen our performance track record in 2016 and beyond.","I'd really like to thank our employees for their winning spirit and a great commitment to Boston Scientific.","Now let me turn the call over to Dan for a more detailed review of our financials.","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Mike. I'll start with some overall perspective on the quarter before getting into the details. We generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.26, exceeding the high-end of our guidance range of $0.23 to $0.25, and representing 18% year-over-year growth in the quarter. Excluding a $0.03 unfavorable foreign exchange impact, Q4 adjusted earnings per share grew 31% year-over-year. The strong performance in Q4 was driven primarily by operational revenue growth and gross margin expansion.","Our Q4 2015 adjusted operating margin of 21.7% represents an improvement of 100 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year 2015, total company adjusted operating margin expanded by 210 basis points over the full year of 2014 and we effectively offset a $0.10 FX headwind through operational savings and initiatives. Our full year 2015 adjusted earnings per share of $0.93 represents 11% growth and 23% growth excluding FX versus 2014.","Now for the P&L highlights. For the fourth quarter of 2015, consolidated revenue of $1.978 billion represented operational growth of 10%, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. Excluding an approximate 500 basis point contribution from the AMS Male Urology portfolio, organic revenue growth was 5% in the quarter. On an as-reported basis, revenue grew 5% year-over-year.","The foreign exchange impact on sales was a $110 million headwind compared to the prior year period, which was about $25 million worse than we assumed in our Q4 guidance range. Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 72.8%, increasing 140 basis points year-over-year. The increase resulted primarily from cost improvements driven by our value improvement programs, as the impact of foreign exchange was negligible in the quarter.","For the full year 2015, adjusted gross margin was 72% compared to 70.7% for the full year 2014. The 130 basis point full year adjusted gross margin improvement was driven by benefits of 180 basis points and 50 basis points from cost improvement and FX respectively. This was partially offset by 100 basis points of headwind attributed primarily to price.","Adjusted SG&A expenses were $757 million or 38.3% of sales in the fourth quarter, down 10 basis points year-over-year. The Q4 rate includes 80 basis points of higher spend related to fixed asset write-offs, employee related benefits and litigation fees.","Our full year 2015 adjusted SG&A rate of 37.4% is down 50 basis points versus the full year 2014. As a reminder, the medical device tax has been suspended for 2016 and 2017, which would benefit our adjusted SG&A rate by roughly 100 basis points annually. We're pleased to see that this tax has been temporarily suspended and intend to reinvest virtually all of the benefit into jobs, innovation, R&D, collaborations with universities and other initiatives that will help treat patients and sustain top line growth over the long-term. We expect the reinvestment of approximately 100 basis points to be split roughly equally between R&D and SG&A.","Our guidance for full year 2016 assumes our adjusted SG&A rate will come down by a total of 140 basis points at the midpoint, which breaks down into 50 basis points from the medical device tax suspension and 90 basis points from operational improvements.","Adjusted research and development expenses were $238 million in the fourth quarter or 12% of sales. For the full year 2015, adjusted R&D expenses were $850 million or 11.4% of sales. We expect our full year 2016 adjusted R&D rate to be roughly 11.5%. Again, this includes a 50 basis point increase due to the reinvestment of the medical device tax, offset by increased efficiency and improved utilization of our global footprint.","Royalty expense was 0.9% of sales in both the fourth quarter and the full year 2015. This represents a 60 basis point reduction compared to the full year 2014 rate, and we expect our royalty rate to remain at approximately 1% of sales in 2016.","On an adjusted basis, operating income was $429 million in the quarter, or 21.7% of sales, up 100 basis points year-over-year. We are very pleased with our consistent adjusted operating margin improvement throughout 2015 as we saw year-over-year improvement of at least 100 basis points in each of the four quarters.","Rhythm Management's adjusted operating margin in Q4 was 13.9%, down substantially from Q3 2015, which resulted in a second half 2015 Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin of 15.9%, falling short of our expectation of 17% due to the timing of manufacturing variances and reserve charges as we transition our portfolio and prepare for new product launches in 2016. Full year 2015 Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin of 15% represents an improvement of 160 basis points over the full year 2014.","And turning to 2016, we expect Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin to increase sequentially in Q1 versus Q4 of 2015. With more noticeable improvement in Q2, as we begin to realize the full benefit of 2016 product costs and leverage the improved top line performance expected from the global CRM and EP franchises. And the second half 2016 Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin is also expected to benefit from our plant network optimization program completed at the end of 2015, which transferred a portion of our EP manufacturing to lower cost locations. The net of all these factors drive our expectation for full year Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin to approach 18% for the full year 2016 and we remain confident in 20% plus in 2017.","GAAP operating income, which includes GAAP to adjusted items of $700 million, was a loss of $271 million in Q4 2015. The primary GAAP to adjusted items for the quarter included; restructuring related charges of $26 million, acquisition-related SG&A expenses of $15 million, contingent consideration expense of $37 million, amortization expense of $135 million, and litigation-related charges of $456 million.","The $456 million in litigation-related net charges were primarily related to increases in our litigation reserve for a recent appellate court ruling in Maryland in the Mirowski case. With the remainder related to a combination of increases in our transvaginal surgical mesh product liability reserves and other adjustments. The Mirowski case traces back to the mid-2000s and relates to licensing agreements on patents that have expired. We continue to believe that the facts and the law do not support the court's findings or the amount of the damages and we plan to seek review of the judgment by the Maryland Supreme Court.","We increased our mesh reserve this quarter, as we became aware of additional claims during the quarter, as we continued to work through the settlement evaluation process. Currently, our known claim count is approximately 35,000, and we've agreed in principle to settle over 10,000 of those 35,000 claims. We intend to continue to contest cases against us vigorously, while also looking to settle when reasonable terms are presented. Our total legal reserve was $1.936 billion as of December 31, 2015.","Separately, a case was recently filed against Boston Scientific in West Virginia, regarding the resin used in our transvaginal mesh products. We are confident that the resin used in the manufacturing of these devices is neither counterfeit nor adulterated, and meets required material bio-compatibility and design specifications. We've provided information and materials to DEKRA, a European Notified Body, the FDA and the Department of Justice regarding the resin, our quality processes and our commitment to producing medical devices of the highest quality.","Now I'll move on to other income and expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $59 million compared to $54 million in Q4 of 2014. The increase was primarily due to the incremental debt raised in Q2 of 2015 to finance the AMS Male Urology portfolio acquisition.","Our average interest rate was 3.9% in Q4 2015 compared to 4.8% in Q4 2014. The lower interest expense rate in Q4 2015 was primarily due to lower average cost of debt resulting from the senior notes refinancing completed in Q2 of 2015. Other expense was $10 million and this consisted primarily of foreign exchange losses and investment losses incurred during the quarter.","Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 58% on a reported basis and 0.2% on an adjusted basis. Our Q4 adjusted tax rate includes $3.9 million of favorable discrete tax items and other one-time benefits, primarily related to foreign exchange. Excluding these items, our Q4 operational tax rate would have been 13%.","Now, I'll provide a bit more detail on our full year 2015 adjusted tax rate, where our guidance as of the third quarter had been 13%. As you may know, the U.S. R&D tax credit was permanently reinstated in December, which benefited the full year 2015 adjusted tax rate by slightly more than 100 basis points. We've decided to reinvest this benefit in our tax structure to improve long-term flexibility in our capital structure, the net result of this being a 13% adjusted tax rate for the full year, excluding discrete and one-time tax items and a 9.2% rate including them. After this one-time reinvestment, we continue to expect an approximately 100 basis point increase in our adjusted tax rate annually, and therefore continue to expect our full year 2016 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 14%.","Finally, as mentioned, Q4 2015 adjusted EPS of $0.26, includes approximately $0.03 of unfavorable foreign exchange and represents 18% year-over-year growth or 31% growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On a reported GAAP basis, Q4 2015 EPS was a loss of $0.11 and includes net charges and amortization expenses totaling $504 million after-tax. The GAAP loss of $0.11 compares to a GAAP loss of $0.23 in the fourth quarter of 2014.","For the full year 2015, we reported adjusted EPS of $0.93, exceeding our guidance range, while absorbing $0.10 of unfavorable FX. Recall this is $0.02 more than we expected as of our Q3 2015 earnings call and $0.06 more than we had expected at the beginning of 2015. Full year 2015 adjusted EPS grew 11% over prior year and 23% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On a reported GAAP basis, 2015 EPS was a loss of $0.18 compared to a full year 2014 GAAP loss per share of $0.09.","Moving on to the balance sheet. Days sales outstanding of 59 days increased one day compared to December of 2014. Days inventory on hand of 163 days was up seven days compared to December of last year, due primarily to the acquisition of the AMS Male Urology portfolio.","Capital expenditures were $86 million in Q4 2015, compared to $79 million in Q4 2014. For the full year 2015, capital expenditures were $248 million. For the full year 2016, we expect capital expenditures to be roughly $100 million higher primarily due to the construction of our new manufacturing facility and distribution center in Malaysia. Beyond 2016, we expect capital expenditures to return to our historical run rate of approximately $250 million annually.","Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $448 million compared to $508 million in Q4 2014. Our full year 2015 adjusted free cash flow of $1.366 billion represents growth of 8% over the full year 2014.","For 2016, we expect full year adjusted free cash flow to exceed $1.5 billion, representing growth of 10%, and have a stretch goal to exceed $1.6 billion for the year with initiatives aimed at improving the working capital contribution to cash flow.","In Q4, we repaid $150 million of our term loan and expect to repay an additional $250 million by the end of 2016, at which time we expect our debt leverage will be consistent with our goal of returning to pre-AMS debt leverage by year-end.","There were no share repurchases in the quarter, consistent with our decision to suspend the share repurchase program temporarily following the announcement of the AMS Male Urology portfolio acquisition, and near-term our capital allocation priorities are to repay debt, manage contingencies and pursue tuck-in M&A.","We ended 2015 with 1.363 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect our share count to increase by roughly 5 million per quarter through the end of 2016, as we plan to keep the buyback suspended for the balance of 2016. We expect this to result in a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.38 billion for the full year 2016.","I'd like to conclude with guidance for Q1 and full year 2016. For the full year, we expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $7.9 billion to $8.1 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 4% to 7% on an organic basis, 7% to 10% on an operational basis and 6% to 8% on a reported basis. As a result of a stronger dollar, at current rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a roughly $150 million headwind for the full year 2016 on revenue.","We expect our adjusted gross margin for the year as a percentage of sales to be in a range of 72% to 73%. We expect foreign exchange to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 50 basis points on adjusted gross margin in 2016, as hedging contracts from our three-year program are layered in. We expect this headwind to be offset by a favorable mix, market segmentation, the ramp of accretive new products and our standard cost reduction programs. As mentioned, we expect our full year 2016 adjusted SG&A rate to be between 35.5% and 36.5% of sales, and our full year adjusted R&D rate to be between 11% and 12% of sales.","This implies a full year 2016 adjusted operating margin in the range of 23.5% to 24.5%, the midpoint of which represents 170 basis points of improvement over full year 2015. And importantly, we remain on track to achieve an adjusted operating margin of 25% plus in 2017. Full year 2016 interest expense is expected to be $245 million, about $10 million higher than the full year 2015 due to incremental debt raised in Q2 of 2015.","As mentioned, we expect our tax rate for the full year 2016 to be approximately 14%. As a result, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2016 to be in a range of $1.03 to $1.07 representing 11% to 15% adjusted earnings per share growth.","We expect 2016 adjusted earnings per share to be impacted negatively by approximately $0.06 of FX or roughly $80 million of adjusted income. In terms of timing, this $0.06 should be roughly $0.02 per quarter in Q1 and Q2 and $0.01 per quarter in Q3 and Q4.","Excluding the $0.06 of unfavorable foreign exchange, our full year adjusted EPS guidance range represents growth of 17% to 21%. Despite this approximate $0.06 hit, we remain confident in our ability to deliver double-digit adjusted EPS growth.","Let me walk you through the 2016 adjusted EPS guidance. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.93 in 2015, representing 11% growth or 23% growth excluding the $0.10 of negative FX impact. As you know, our stated goal is to grow EPS double-digits, which would imply $1.02 in 2016. Adding $0.03 of AMS accretion, gets us to $1.05 which is the midpoint of our guidance.","We expect unfavorable FX of approximately $0.06 as I mentioned, but our goal is to offset this through operational initiatives and savings as we did in 2015, and as mentioned, the medical device tax is worth roughly 100 basis points on the OM line but we intend to reinvest substantially all of that back into innovation and have developed the detailed plans to do so.","On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.62 to $0.67. Lastly for 2016, our guidance assumes pre-tax amortization of approximately $534 million.","Now turning to the first quarter of 2016, we expect consolidated revenues to be in a range of $1.89 billion to $1.94 billion. If current foreign exchange rates hold constant, the headwind from foreign exchange should be approximately $45 million or 250 basis points relative to Q1 2015. We expect consolidated Q1 sales to grow year-over-year in a range of 4% to 6% organically and 9% to 11% operationally. For the first quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.23 to $0.25 per share and GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.11 to $0.13 per share.","I encourage you to check our Investor Relations website for Q4 2015 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q4 results, as well as Q1 and full year 2016 guidance, including P&L line item guidance.","So, with that, I will turn it back to Susie, who will moderate the Q&A.","Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Dan. David, let's open it up to questions for the next 25 minutes or so. In order to enable us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. David, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question will come from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Just a couple of quick questions on 2016 guidance. So, the first is, your guidance at the top end of the range at 7% was obviously higher than we expected, I guess, we expected 4% to 6%. So, what factors get us to the top-end of that range and specifically what's assumed for WATCHMAN? And then I had a quick follow-up.","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks. Good morning, David. Yes, the guidance 4% to 7% is higher than we showed at the recent Investor Day meeting. In terms of getting to the higher end of the range, we certainly have to have some good results on our product launches with SYNERGY, WATCHMAN, ongoing advancements of Lotus. We have key product approvals that we're expecting the first half, those need to come through.","We also are launching a number of key products in Japan with SYNERGY and also S-ICD. So we need some strong execution there and continued emerging market growth. So it's \u2013 we've got a lot of product launches, a number of approvals needed. So to deliver the top-end of that we have to have excellent commercial execution and great execution on the regulatory side.","Potentially on some of the downside, we continue to manage, as I mentioned, some of the CRM headwinds, which we anticipate will \u2013 after Q1 improve in second quarter and then improve dramatically in the second half of the year.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. That's very helpful, Mike. And then specifically, I know you mentioned CRM, just to follow-up there. In the fourth quarter, was there anything particular with that third quarter to fourth quarter slight decline, was there anything particular or unique to the fourth quarter that you can cite? And then once again your confidence, what's specifically implied in 2016 numbers? Is that \u2013 does 2016 guidance imply an improvement in the CRM business in 2016 over 2015? Thank you.","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So we're really pleased with quite frankly our overall Urology business and the AMS deal. The business grew 7% in fourth quarter. And, I'm sorry, was your first question on Urology or is it all CRM related?","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I'm happy to hear about Urology, but I was focused on CRM, Mike.","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sorry. The jetlag from Asia. We'll hold the Uro comments for later I guess. So on CRM, we do anticipate improvement clearly in 2016, as I mentioned, particularly in the second half. We anticipate the launch of the \u2013 the approval of the pacer MRI and the Quad in second quarter and we'll also have favorable comps in second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter. So we do see a strengthening CRM business in 2016.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everybody. Just a couple of things. Maybe start with the CRM operating margin. Dan, you did a very clear job of laying out the factors behind the 15.9% instead of your 17% goal. Is the whole of that these variances, and do you come into 2016 thinking that \u2013 do we start off with that sort of 17% level or better as we head into the first quarter, first half?","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Rick. Yeah, I think the way I would say \u2013 characterize that is on the Q3 call, we had talked about kind of being in that 17% range for the back half of 2015. The variances were a piece of it. We also had a little bit higher R&D, about 60 basis points in the quarter. That's timing, that's just going to come one quarter to another, so that doesn't concern me.","The manufacturing and the inventory reserve charges are really in anticipation of the launches that Mike just mentioned around the MRI safe Brady and the Quad launch in the U.S. So those are kind of out of the way now at this point as opposed to having had to take those in different quarters. So I think, the way I would think of it is, the 13.9% in Q4, I'd expect a little bit of sequential improvement in Q1, not a tremendous amount, just a little bit. Q2 gets a little bit better than that and really the back half is where it accelerates to get to that overall 18% for the year. So, I wouldn't look for Q1 to be in that 18% range or Q2, but I think the net of the year, we're very comfortable with that 18%.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And just one product specific question, WATCHMAN, a possible NCD is up here real soon. And if I understood you correctly, you're basically saying you think it's still a $500 million market if that early language holds. But what if the language is basically equivalent to the FDA approval label? Docs are telling us that they're doing four patients a month and that would double if that were the case. Is that the way you see it and so then is it back to $1 billion market, how do we think about all that?","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, overall, we're obviously very proud of our success in 2015 with WATCHMAN, in Structural Heart overall we delivered the high-end of the range there, we opened up 100 accounts. We're going to hear the NCD decision very shortly here. But, overall, we continue to expect guidance is 2016 of $175 million to $200 million. And our job will be to continue to focus on the penetration rate. With 15 million or so eligible patients, we'll continue to drive training programs, excellent outcomes, and \u2013 but for now, we'll continue with our $175 million to $200 million range, and we'll see what happens over the next few days on the reimbursement.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President-Investor Relations","Ken, do you want to add anything?","Kenneth Stein - Senior Vice President & Chief Medical Officer-Cardiac Rhythm Management","Yeah, Rick. I'd say, while we have some concerns about that first draft of the proposed NCD, overall, it was consistent with our expectations, which are that the NCD we expect to be more limited than the full FDA label, likewise always expected to have the registry, et cetera. And as Mike said, we've always assumed modest penetration into the indicated population and really where we go is much more dependent on our ability to train new physicians to implant the device safely and effectively.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for that.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. So, just one quick follow-up on that. So, did you say where you ended up 2015 on that Structural Heart number?","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We didn't give a \u2013 we guided $75 million to $100 million, and we beat the high end of the range. We didn't give a specific number.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","But didn't give the exact number, okay, great.","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Over $100 million.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Over $100 million, understood. So, let me ask about SYNERGY and the launch so far, the feedback we're getting is, has been very positive particularly on the deliverability of the product. It does feel like you are trying to set a premium pricing for the product to the marketplace, can you talk about your success in doing so thus far?","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yep. We're very pleased with the results. It's really tracking to our plan. In the fourth quarter, we did see U.S. DES growth in the mid-single-digit range and that was against about a 10% comparison from fourth quarter 2015, so we delivered a nice number in the first quarter. And just as you said, we are asking and we believe we deserve a pricing premium for the product. It's the only bioabsorbable product in the marketplace with excellent stent thrombosis rates and we also have a tiered offering that has excellent market share as well. So, we think we're uniquely positioned with it. And the great news is we're launching in Japan as we speak, which is obviously a big market, and we also received reimbursement in France. So, we're really positioned well. We're being very careful with the launch of it and similar to our comments at your meeting, we anticipate about 50% of our mix in the U.S. and Japan by the end of the year.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. One product follow-up, Mike, it sounds like Lotus Edge, the timing of introducing that in Europe may be is sliding, just can you provide some clarity on that?","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I don't \u2013 in terms of sliding, we do anticipate 2016 we will launch Lotus Edge, and so I guess, maybe we did push that a bit, but we are confident in a 2016 launch of Lotus Edge and it really is similar to some of the comments on SYNERGY, we continue to exceed our commitments with Lotus. We exceeded the high end of our range, we're on track to deliver our 21 millimeter valve. We'll be launching our Lotus Edge platform and we continue to drive great outcomes on our clinical data, maybe, Keith, you can comment on some of the news you anticipate at EuroPCR?","Keith D. Dawkins - Global Chief Medical Officer & Executive VP","Yeah. I mean, I think, Mike, the important thing is, when we commercialize Lotus in the U.S. late in 2017, we'll have Edge, we'll five valve sizes, 21 through 29. We'll have the [i-sleeve] 14 French compatibility and increased flexibility. The 21 valve is already in the clinical trial, so that will give us four valves. That will be followed by the 29. And we'll anticipate Edge around about EuroPCR or just after. Edge is already in clinical trials. So, we're very confident about moving to the 14 French compatibility, which of course makes us comparable with the other competitors in the market.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. Perfect. Thanks, Keith. Thanks, Mike.","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks and good morning.","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, just wanted to follow up and make sure I heard you correctly on the U.S. ICD and pacemaker pipeline and the timelines for the pipeline. So, specifically, could you just tell us when you expect Quad Pole CRT-D lead approval in the U.S. and then MRI-Safe pacemaker approval in the U.S.? And then also give us any updated thoughts on MRI-Safe traditional ICD and CRT-D timelines for the U.S., since it feels like that's where Medtronic is having the most success. Thank you.","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. I'm really proud of our CRM business. We clearly want to grow faster, but we're in a position now where we can see as we go forward in 2016 and 2017 and beyond, really the strength of the portfolio and I'll give answers to your specific MRI questions in a second here, but we've got these product launches coming second half of 2016. The S-ICD is really gaining excellent momentum globally, we're expanding that and we're going to be moving beyond the replacement cycle headwind.","In terms of the product launches, we feel comfortable with a second quarter launch of both the Quad system and MRI pacer. The MRI pacer likely slipped a little bit out of first quarter into second quarter. We'll also have EMBLEM MRI approval likely in the third quarter of 2016. So, big approvals in second quarter and third quarter.","And then as we go forward with the ICD MRI capability, we'll start that trial very quickly here and we anticipate approval of that product likely in second quarter or third quarter of 2017.","So, we've got a really strong cadence of product approvals coming, MRI capabilities. But I think what's most unique about our offering is this S-ICD momentum that we're seeing around the world. We just received approval in Japan. We have a 5% premium \u2013 reimbursement premium in Japan, continued strong acceptance of the product in training and a multi-year head start. So, as you look to our business going forward, this product cadence will come through, S-ICDs continuing to grow, and our replacement cycle headwind will reverse itself. So as you look forward to CRM, I really believe that you're going to see this business strengthen in the second half of 2016 and 2017 and 2018.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. That's very helpful. Thank you. And then one for Dan, I just want to make sure I understand the margin story, just specifically in the fourth quarter. Is the right way to think about operating margins in the fourth quarter and all the moving parts that you had very strong gross margin performance, and that you took advantage of a very low tax rate to invest a little bit more in SG&A than you originally anticipated, is that from a big picture perspective the right way to think about Q4 margins?","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think overall, and then as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we did have 80 basis points of the fixed asset write-offs and the litigation fees. So, I wouldn't call that kind of investing for the future. So if you take that off, I'd say, again, as we mentioned, very proud of where we ended for the year and the overall improvement we've had over the past two years. If you take 2016 and 2015 together, you'd be looking at almost 400 basis points of operating margin expansion. So in a given quarter, you'll see fluctuations, but the overall trend is extremely positive.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, and good morning, everybody. Maybe I will switch gears a little to the Urology business and maybe, Mike, you could talk about how the integration is going with AMS and very specifically focus on some of the issues that you may be undertaking to help accelerate top line growth from where AMS was performing at sort of the exit rate of the acquisition?","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I won't give a CRM answer on this one. So, I guess, I just wanted to talk about Urology because I like what we're doing here so much. So we \u2013 again, we had nice results in the fourth quarter, business growing 7% overall, really nice job, particularly in international markets as we continue invest in our stone business and training programs, that's growing very well, double-digits outside the U.S. consistently.","And the AMS integration is on track. Thankfully, the teams did a really nice job in due diligence. We did project some softness the first six months post acquisition as we wanted to bleed down distributor inventory levels to appropriate levels and that's exactly what we're seeing. So, that's happening and we likely will see continued softness in Q1, but improving in terms of the legacy AMS business, and that's being offset by the BSC legacy business.","As we go forward in the second quarter, we expect the legacy AMS business to grow much closer to the BSC overall growth rate and then we'll see additional benefit on top of that as we see synergies between the BPH portfolio, the stone portfolio, the ED portfolio and the incontinence portfolio overall.","So, really we're right on track. We're going to deliver our EPS accretion commitment of $0.03 in 2016 and I think it's $0.07 in 2017. So, the integration's gone well. We've had exceptionally low turnover and it's being met very well by the customers.","David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful. Thank you. And then, maybe just a follow-up on the price\/mix environment. As we sort of look at your growth rate, another acceleration potentially on tap for 2016 at the midpoint of your guidance on an organic basis. Can you maybe just sort of talk about how the pricing and mix environment is shaping up because at least from your \u2013 that your peers who have reported earnings results thus far, it sounds like the environment is a tad better, but maybe any thoughts from your perspective would be appreciated.","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, David. This is Dan. In terms of price, as you heard, we mentioned it's about 100 basis point drag on gross margin, so you can kind of back into to what that is. Obviously we don't make assumptions about significant improvements in the pricing environment or significant deteriorations in that. It's contemplated within the range. But as we \u2013 as we look at it, it feels stable, so the product lines that have historically declined, are continuing to decline at that historical rate, they haven't moved significantly, and likewise, the ones where prices stay flat and in some cases increase, have stayed pretty constant and stable. So, over the past 12 months to 18 months, it's felt relatively stable and the guidance for 2016 assumes as that through the year.","David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And mix?","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Mix \u2013 in general for us mix is a good guy. So as we as we sell more of the newer technologies, a lot of which Mike went through that list. The majority of those are accretive to overall Boston Scientific margins, gross margins.","David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Brooks West with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Let me start with Peripheral actually, very strong performance there, you've got a lot going on. I wonder if you could give us just a little bit more detail on kind of product cadence, market dynamics and if we can see the business kind of continue to perform at this level going forward?","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. The team has done a really nice job. Jeff Mervis and the Peripheral group delivered 20% growth in legacy Bayer business and 10% organically overall, so, obviously very strong growth and a few quarters in a row here, and we're projected to set up really nicely in 2016.","So, I think just a backdrop, the markets there are very healthy, we're seeing nice market growth in atherectomy. Our core business, we just launched a new DVT product and also clearly the growing acceptance of the drug coated technology. So the markets overall are strong, and we really have a unique position in terms of our portfolio. You've heard a lot about our drug-eluding stent ELUVIA, we'll be the only company with both a drug-eluding stent and a drug-eluding balloon in Europe, and we're also kicking off our ELUVIA IMPERIAL trial in the first half of 2016.","So we're uniquely positioned in our DES. We're also launching a number of our core SFA metal stents in Japan and Asia and China which will help us grow that business, and we also continue to really expand globally. We've been \u2013 we were light weight in terms of the emerging markets in Peripheral five years ago and we put a lot of investment in there and we're starting to see that become more meaningful in places like China and Brazil.","And lastly, we commented on the call about our CeleNova deal. Our Interventional Oncology maybe a little bit different than some competitors' Peripheral business, but that IO business is a strong grower for us and we like that CeleNova transaction, particularly for the emerging markets.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thanks. And if I could just follow up with one on \u2013 Dan, you mentioned earlier the leverage on the balance sheet was going to get back to pre-AMS acquisition levels by the end of the year. Can you just update us on your thoughts on acquisitions and are you seeing valuation expectations come down in the market? Thanks.","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Brooks. So, yeah, just in terms of the leverage levels, that's get \u2013 to get back to about a 2.5 times debt-to-EBITDA. We remain on track to do that as we had announced in conjunction with the AMS acquisition by the end of this year. We did the debt pay down that we needed to do at the end of 2015, and have in our cash flow projections in 2016 to do the remainder to get to that level. So feel very comfortable there.","Relative to valuations and M&A, so we're still very active in the market relative to tuck-in M&A. Obviously, screen a lot of different opportunities. I wouldn't say I've seen significant changes in valuation expectations across the landscape, it would depend on what division and what stage you're talking about. But, in general, the valuations have stayed fairly constant and we are actively in the market obviously looking for tuck-in deals. And that is part of our cash flow projection for 2016 as well to be able to do some tuck-in deals.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. So, Mike, you're one of the few companies that actually showed an acceleration in emerging growth this quarter, I think about 15% organic versus 13% last quarter, a lot of companies have shown the opposite trend. So, my question is, what's the outlook in 2016? How comfortable \u2013 how much visibility do you have on growth in those markets? And any color would be helpful and I had a follow-up. Thanks.","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm sorry, were you talking the emerging market...","Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President-Investor Relations","Emerging market.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I'm sorry. Yeah, emerging market growth. I think you had 15% organic in Q4, I think 13% in Q3.","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, we were a little bit slower in the second quarter. And we had nice pick up, really the pickup the second half of 2015 was good, but it was also more consistent with what we expected and did in 2014 quite frankly.","And so it's really a continuation of, ex maybe a soft quarter, one soft quarter, the second quarter, kind of a continuation of what we've been doing in 2014 and what we expect to continue to do in 2016. So, we had some softness in Russia in the second quarter, we've seen that stabilize a bit, we have excellent growth in China, excellent growth in Brazil and a number of other countries. So, we continue to register new products, add commercial capabilities, we're building R&D capabilities, new education training centers. I just got back from there last night. So, we put a lot of time and effort in it. We just did a joint venture deal with Frankenman there in our Endo business. So, we feel comfortable about our prospects in the mid-teens rate in emerging markets.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for that. And then Neuromodulation, I don't think has come up on this call, but you had a nice year in Neuromodulation this year, but obviously the competitive dynamics are changing. So just color on 2016 and how we should think about growth and trends there and the sustainability of the nice growth you showed in 2015? Thanks for taking the questions.","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure.","Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President-Investor Relations","Larry, we'll hit that in a sec, but we're going back to the emerging markets revenue question first with Dan.","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, just one other thing, Larry, on that. So one of the other items with respect to emerging markets is just the foreign currency exchange rates. So if you look back at Q4 and think of our $1.978 billion that we reported again, that included a $25 million negative headwind from FX compared to what we had talked about when we gave guidance. So kind of adjusted for that we would have been over $2 billion and kind of closer to the higher end of the range and emerging markets obviously is a big piece of that.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, Dan.","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And Neuromod continues to perform well. We grew 7% in the quarter. We grew 8% full year and we had consistently strong growth throughout the year and we really don't see that \u2013 we anticipate that trend to continue. Spectra continues to perform very well. The launch of Novi outside the U.S. is picking up. And we are getting a lot of \u2013 we are building momentum in international markets in deep brain stimulation and will hopefully get some good luck and get that clinical trial enrolled in 2016 to position that launch. So it's a very healthy market right now and there is a lot of patient demand and so we like to see that that market is clearly growing in the mid-single digit range, if not a bit more.

Welcome to the Boston Scientific Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Michael Campbell. Please go ahead.","Michael Campbell","Thank you, Trisha. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Capello, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q3 results for 2013, which include the reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release, as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call, to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financial Information.","The duration of this morning's call will be approximately 1 hour. Mike will begin our prepared remarks with an update on our business progress and his perspectives on the quarter. Jeff will then review our Q3 financial results, as well as Q4 and full year 2013 guidance. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Jeff will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Dawkins and Dr. Stein.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth and our market share; new product approvals and launches; procedural volumes and pricing; clinical trials; cost savings and growth opportunity; our cash flow and expected use; our financial performance, including sales, margins, earnings and other Q4 and full year 2013 guidance; as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses.","Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs and 8Ks filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them.","At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike?","Michael F. Mahoney","Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin today with some comments regarding our third quarter performance, and then Jeff will then review the financials in more detail.","So overall, it was a strong quarter for Boston Scientific. Our team continues to build momentum, and we are executing against our global strategy. So key highlights for the third quarter include the following: We delivered sales slightly above the midpoint and adjusted EPS above our stated guidance range, which are both above consensus. We delivered net sales of $1.735 billion, which was consistent with prior year on a reported basis, but we also grew our business 4% year-over-year on an operational basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange and the divested Neurovascular business.","In terms of sales on an operational basis, Neuromodulation grew an impressive 32%, Endoscopy grew 8%, Urology and Women's Health grew 8% and PI grew 7% versus the same period in the prior year.","In addition, we're really encouraged with the improved performance of our CRM business, with the return to growth in the third quarter of 1% on an operational basis, despite limited availability of the S-ICD device. We continue to expand our business in emerging markets. Our BRIC sales grew 29% in the quarter, and we opened a new innovation and training center in Shanghai.","Turning to our earnings highlights. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.17, which was above the high end of our guidance range and consensus. On a year-over-year basis, we delivered adjusted EPS growth of 6% while absorbing a $0.01 impact in the quarter due to the medical device tax. We also generated strong cash flow and used $75 million to buy back approximately 6.8 million shares of stock in the quarter.","I'll now move into our business unit performance for the third quarter. The revenue growth figures that I will highlight are all on a constant currency basis and on a year-over-year basis.","So let's start with our medical surgical business. Our MedSurg business executed extremely well during the quarter and delivered 12% growth on a combined basis.","In Endoscopy, we had another strong quarter, with 8% worldwide revenue growth. We continue to grow faster than the market. Our hemostasis franchise continued to lead the way. Our biliary device franchise continued to grow faster than the market, fueled by our Endoscopic Ultrasound platform and the recent launches within Biliary access and retrieval devices. Our metal stent franchise continued to be driven by industry-leading WallFlex platform.","Also during the quarter, we're pleased to announce that the 5-year data from the AIR clinical trial was published online in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Alair has shown to provide long-term asthma control, demonstrated by a sustained reduction in the rate of severe exacerbations and emergency visits over a 5-year period after treatment. With the publication of this 5-year data, we remain positive about the potential for long-term growth for BT and are focused on -- as we continue to execute a coverage and payment strategy for this important technology.","Moving on to our Urology\/Women's Health division. We achieved 8% worldwide revenue growth in the quarter, with a solid 10% growth in Urology, as well as return to growth for Women's Health business, which achieved 7% growth in the quarter. This growth is driven from our international expansion and new product launches. In Women's Health, we're growing faster than the market via the benefit of our recent product launches and favorable year-over-year comparables.","In Neuromodulation, we maintained our consistent momentum from the previous quarters and delivered an impressive 32% growth on a worldwide basis. Our spinal cord stimulation business continues to perform well above market, driven by our Precision Spectra Spinal Cord Stimulator System. We're also pleased with the enthusiastic physician response to our innovative Precision Spectra Spinal Cord Stimulation platform, which really validates our commitment to meaningful innovation.","Now let's move on to our Interventional Cardiology business. In the third quarter, our worldwide IC revenues declined 2% in a market that we have estimated to be declining in the low single digits. While we expect the global market headwinds to persist, we also believe that the market will continue to moderate over time due to underlying patient demographics, particularly in faster growing regions such as Asia Pac and the proliferation of differentiated and premium price technologies such as our SYNERGY Stent platform.","In Europe, our IC performance is driven by Promus PREMIER and SYNERGY. We anticipate U.S. FDA approval for Promus PREMIER in the fourth quarter of '13, which should provide a catalyst for our U.S. business. Also, our next generation SYNERGY Stent continues to perform well. The limited launch in Europe has been positive, and we are supporting this differentiated bioresorbable platform with a comprehensive synergy clinical trial portfolio. Interest in the U.S. remains high as enrollment in the randomized arm of SYNERGY U.S. IDE trial, called EVOLVE II, was completed in September.","In our core IC business, we're delivering improved performance with worldwide sales growth of 3%. We recently launched our Emerge 1.2 millimeter balloon catheter, Guidezilla Guide Extension catheter and OptiCross catheter around the globe. We expect the performance in our core IC business to continue to improve as we expand our commercial rollout of these new platforms.","We continue to advance our structural heart programs in TAVR and atrial appendage. In TAVR, we presented the favorable 6 months results from the first 60 patients enrolled in the Lotus REPRISE II clinical trial. The data which was presented recently at PCR London Valves received the honor of the Best Abstract, demonstrating excellent results with no new valve-related adverse events between 30 days and 6 months. Additionally, there are no cases of moderate or severe paravalvular regurgitation in any patient at 6 months. We believe the results affirm the clinical advantages of this second-generation platform. We anticipate CE Mark of the Lotus Valve in the fourth quarter of '13, and we are in discussions with the FDA to finalize plans for our U.S. IDE trial.","So now we'll move on to our Peripheral Interventions division. In the third quarter, this division delivered 7% growth. This above-market performance was led by our leading balloon stents and interventional oncology franchises. Also, during the quarter, we made significant progress in our PI product pipeline, including major milestones in drug-eluting technologies. The drug-eluting version of de novo stent reached a major milestone enrolling the first patients in the MAJESTIC trial this quarter, which is expected to serve as the foundation of the global regulatory approvals. In addition, we continue to make meaningful progress in our drug-eluting balloon platform and expect to launch that product in international markets in the second half of 2014.","We are pleased with the progress we are making with our Vessix Renal Denervation System, which was launched in Europe earlier this year. The results presented recently from our REDUCE-HTN clinical program confirmed the significant patient benefit of the differentiated system. We recently submitted our U.S. IDE trial design to the FDA and anticipate beginning enrollment in first half of 2014, subject to FDA approval.","So let me turn our attention to Rhythm Management segment. We're very encouraged by the improved performance of this business over the past few quarters. In the third quarter, our worldwide CRM revenues grew by 1%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. We also believe the worldwide CRM market declines have stabilized in the low single digits versus prior year.","In our defib business, we estimate our worldwide third quarter market share to be up slightly versus the prior year, and these results were driven by improved core ICD de novo share and stability in the replacement business.","And also, regarding the S-ICD, we have recently resumed the controlled rollout of the S-ICD. We will continue to build further supply capacity via our 1.5 launch throughout the fourth quarter.","In addition, we are really thrilled with the S-ICD platform that has just recently awarded the prestigious Prix Galien award for the Best Medical Technology. This award is a great honor for our team, and it recognizes the truly meaningful innovation that the S-ICD System delivers to patients and physicians.","So now turning to our pacer business. Our pacer franchise delivered year-over-year growth of 1%. This consists of 3% growth in the U.S. and a decline of 1% in the international markets. We are pleased with the performance of this platform and believe that we continue to drive pacer share gains in the quarter.","Now moving to Left Atrial Appendage. The WATCHMAN product line continues to show strong growth in international markets, with international revenues and implants growing by more than 45% compared to the third quarter on a year-to-date basis. As stated previously, the final PMA module was submitted to FDA in May, and we still expect U.S. approval in the first half of 2014.","So finally, in EP, we look forward to welcoming the new C.R. Bard EP team to Boston Scientific. We anticipate closing this transaction in the fourth quarter, and we're really excited about expanding our portfolio of EP technologies and remain positive by this robust pipeline of innovative technologies.","Now turning to some other important updates. Earlier today, we announced the transition plan for our Chief Financial Officer. Jeff Capello has expressed the desire to take on a broader role and pursue opportunities external to the company. Jeff will remain in his current role as CFO through the end of the year. In addition, Jeff has agreed to remain with the company as a senior advisor through mid-May of 2014 to provide any other transitional support as needed. I'd really like to thank Jeff for his commitment and his leadership during his tenure in 5 years as Chief Financial Officer at Boston Scientific. Jeff has made significant contributions to the company and has built a deep bench of financial talent within the company. Thank you, Jeff, for your collaboration and support, and we absolutely wish you well.","I'm very pleased to also announce that Dan Brennan, Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller, will replace Jeff as the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer effective January 1, 2014. So we, as a company, are very fortunate to already have a very experienced and capable financial executive on our team. Dan has served in a variety of senior finance positions with increasing responsibilities, making him ideally suited for this role. He and Jeff will work together closely to ensure an effective and seamless transition, and I'm confident that by promoting Dan to this critical role, there will be a seamless transition as we continue to execute against the strategic plan as outlined at the Investor Day conference.","So to wrap up the quarter, overall, we're really pleased with the third quarter results and the momentum we are building. We accelerated our growth on an operational basis. We delivered adjusted EPS above our guidance range, and we continue to make progress on our strategic growth initiatives. We continue to focus on margin improvement, while prudently investing in strategic initiatives for future growth as evidenced by our previously outlined productivity initiatives, our recent debt refinancing and a new restructuring program that was also detailed in today's press release. We expect to continue generating strong cash flow, which should help us to enable to fund more share repurchases in the fourth quarter and to continue to evaluate appropriate acquisitions to improve our future growth profile.","Finally, I really want to thank our employees worldwide for their winning spirit and a commitment to our mission of advancing science for life.","Now let me turn the call over to Jeff for a more detailed review of our third quarter financials and guidance going forward.","Jeffrey D. Capello","Thanks, Mike. Let me begin by providing some overall perspective on the quarter before getting to the details. We generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.17, which was above our guidance range of $0.14 to $0.16 and above consensus. This represents improved profitability from the prior year, which was primarily driven by continued gross margin expansion, a lower tax rate and fewer shares outstanding. This was partially offset by increased investments in our strategic growth initiatives and a roughly $0.01 impact from the medical device tax.","In addition, we generated adjusted free cash flow of $289 million and used $75 million to repurchase approximately 6.8 million more shares in this quarter.","Now I'll move to the detailed review of our business performance and operating results for the quarter. For the third quarter of 2013, consolidated revenue of $1,735,000,000 was consistent with the prior year on a reported basis. And excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the divested Neurovascular of business, we grew the business 4%. The actual headwind from the foreign exchange on sales was approximately $40 million as compared to the prior year and was $10 million higher than what we had assumed in the third quarter guidance range.","In Interventional Cardiology, worldwide revenue came in at $472 million in the third quarter, representing a constant currency decrease of 2% compared to the third quarter of 2012. Total international Interventional Cardiology revenue grew 4% compared to the third quarter of 2012.","Worldwide DES revenue, which included the negative impact of the OrbusNeich injunction precluding our sales of DES in Germany during the quarter, came in at $262 million. U.S. DES revenue was $106 million in the quarter. Excluding the impact of product transition reserves, worldwide and U.S. DES revenue declined approximately 2% and 7%, respectively, compared with the third quarter of 2012, all in constant currency terms. We estimate that our U.S. DES share was relatively stable, both sequentially and compared with the third quarter of 2012 in the mid-30s. International DES sales of $156 million grew 2% in constant currency compared to the third quarter of last year, driven by the growth in emerging markets and partially offset by the loss of sales in Germany.","Worldwide non-stent Interventional Cardiology delivered sales growth of 3% as compared to the third quarter of last year in constant currency terms.","Now moving on to CRM. Worldwide revenue was $464 million in the third quarter, representing a constant currency increase of 1% compared to last -- Q3 of last year. In the U.S., CRM revenue of $282 million was up 4% compared to last year. International CRM sales of $182 million were down 2% in constant currency compared to the prior year quarter.","On a worldwide basis, defib sales were $330 million in the third quarter, which was up 2% in constant currency from the third quarter of last year. In the U.S., defib sales were $212 million. This was up 4% compared to the third quarter of last year. International defib sales of $118 million represented a 2% decrease in constant currency from the third quarter of last year.","Worldwide pacer sales increased 1% on a constant currency basis as compared to Q3 '12, driven by continued strong performance from our INGENIO family of pacemakers and CRTPs. In the U.S., pace revenue of $70 million was up 3% compared to Q3 last year, while international revenue declined 1% in constant currency for the quarter.","Additionally, our worldwide Electrophysiology business remained relatively flat on a constant currency basis compared to the third quarter of last year.","Our Peripheral Interventions business continues to deliver growth above the market with worldwide revenue up 7% in constant currency compared to Q3 2012.","Our Endoscopy business continued to grow faster than the market and had another solid quarter with worldwide sales up 8% in constant currency led by 10% revenue growth internationally.","In constant currency, our worldwide Urology\/Women's Health business had growth of 8% in the quarter. Sales growth was particularly strong internationally at 16% compared to the third quarter of last year. Our Urology business maintained a leadership position with 10% worldwide constant currency growth in the quarter, driven by strong international revenue growth of 16%.","Our Neuromodulation business had a very impressive quarter with 32% sales growth worldwide, including 31% growth in domestic market and 47% internationally, all on a constant currency basis.","Now moving on from sales. Adjusted gross profit margin in the third quarter was 70.7% or 270 basis points higher than the third quarter of last year. The increase was largely attributable to benefits from our value improvement programs and favorable product mix, partially offset by price erosion. Looking forward to Q4, we expect adjusted gross margins to be between 70% and 71%.","Adjusted SG&A expenses were $646 million or 37.2% of sales in the third quarter of 2013 compared to $586 million or 33.8% of sales in the third quarter of 2012. During the third quarter of 2013, the impact from our cost-saving programs were offset by continued investments in our strategic growth initiatives and costs associated with expanding in emerging markets. In addition, SG&A expenses in Q3 2013 include the impact of approximately 100 basis points from the medical device tax under the U.S. Affordable Care Act. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales to be between 36% and 37% in the fourth quarter of this year.","Adjusted research and development expenses were $217 million for the third quarter or 12.5% of sales. This compares to $220 million in the third quarter of 2012. We expect R&D spending to be in the range of 12% to 13% of sales in the fourth quarter of this year.","Royalty expense was $28 million or 1.6% of sales compared to $29 million in Q3 last year. We expect Q4 royalty expense as a percentage of sales to be relatively flat as compared to the third quarter.","On an adjusted basis, pretax operating income was $336 million or 19.3% of sales, down 50 basis points from the third quarter of last year. The decrease in adjusted operating margins was primarily due to a negative 100 basis point impact of the medical device tax and investments in our strategic growth initiatives, partially offset by targeted cost reduction initiatives and higher gross margins.","GAAP operating income, which includes GAAP to adjusted items, was $103 million in Q3 2013. The primary GAAP to adjusted items included in the operating income for the quarter were: pretax restructuring charges of $26 million, pretax litigation charges of $76 million, pretax acquisition and divestiture-related charges of $30 million and pretax amortization expenses of $101 million.","Now I'll move on to other income and expense. During the quarter, we completed a public offering of $1,050,000,000 of senior notes and $400 million of a new bank term loan facility. This public offering was highly successful to the strong investor demand, resulting in us being 9x oversubscribed. At the end of the day, we issued $600 million of 5-year bonds at 2.65% and $450 million of 10-year bonds at 4.125%. We used the net proceeds from the bond offering, together with borrowings under our term loan facility, to redeem all of our 5.45% notes, which are due in June of 2014, and all of the 4.5% notes, which were due in January 2015. Based on current rates, we'd expect to reduce annual interest expense by approximately $28 million as a result of this refinancing.","Interest expense for the quarter was $137 million, which includes a pretax onetime charge of approximately $7 million -- $70 million associated with the refinancing. Our next debt maturity of $400 million is now due in November 2015.","Our tax rate for the third quarter was 87.6% on a reported basis and 12.4% on an adjusted basis. The difference between our reported and adjusted tax rate for the quarter is attributable to charges excluding in determining our non-GAAP results. We estimate our full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 12% to 13%. This excludes any other discrete tax items that may arise during the year.","Please keep in mind that our full year adjusted tax rate includes a benefit of approximately 200 basis points for the retroactive extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit for 2012, which was recorded in the first quarter of 2013.","Now moving on to the balance sheet. DSO of 66 days increased 2 days compared to September 2012, primarily due to lower collections in Europe. Despite lower inventory levels, days inventory on hand was 161 days, up 11 days compared to September of last year, due to lower cost of goods sold, primarily driven by standard cost improvements and favorable product mix.","Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $291 million compared to $250 million in the third quarter of last year. Capital expenditures were $56 million in the third quarter this year compared to $46 million in the third quarter last year. We continue to expect our full year 2013 adjusted free cash flow to be approximately $1.2 billion for the year.","Turning to share repurchases. We repurchased 6.8 million shares for approximately $75 million in the third quarter of this year. Since July 2011, we have now repurchased $219 million or approximately 14% of our outstanding shares. We currently have $885 million of capacity remaining under our share repurchase authorization. We continue to believe that our stock price is undervalued, and we expect to continue our share repurchases in the fourth quarter of this year, subject to business development opportunities, market conditions, our stock price, regulatory trading windows and other factors.","We recently announced the 2014 restructuring program that is intended to build on a progress the company has made to address changing global market price dynamics and further strengthen our operational effectiveness and efficiency and to support new growth investments. The company estimates that the program will reduce gross annual pretax operating expenses by approximately $115 million to $200 million, exiting 2015. The company expects a substantial portion of the program savings to be reinvested in strategic growth initiatives. Program implementation is expected to result in total pretax charges of approximately $175 million to $225 million, of which approximately $20 million should be all noncash.","Q3 was another strong quarter for Boston Scientific as we continued to make solid progress on our global strategy. We accelerated our growth on an operational basis in the quarter, and we remained focused on driving top line growth.","We also believe, despite the medical device tax, that we continue to have opportunities to enhance profitability and expect to continue to generate strong cash flow.","Let me now walk you through our guidance for the fourth quarter, as well as updated guidance for the full year. We expect Q4 consolidated revenues to be in the range of $1,780,000,000 to $1,830,000,000. If current foreign exchange rates hold constant, the headwind from FX should be approximately $40 million or around 220 basis points relative to the fourth quarter of last year.","On an operational basis, we expect consolidated Q4 sales to be in the range of up 2% to up 4% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. As an important reminder, Q4 will be a little bit more challenging relative to Q3 from a year-over-year comparison perspective.","On a worldwide basis, we expect DES revenue to be in the range of $285 million to $300 million, and CRM to be in the range of $450 million to $465 million.","We expect Q4 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $0.18 to $0.20 per share, and we encourage you to model to the midpoint. We expect reported GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.04 to $0.08 per share, which includes an estimated $0.07 impact from amortization expense.","Now moving to the full year. We now estimate that consolidated 2013 sales will be between $7,085,000,000 and $7,135,000,000. Assuming that current foreign exchange rates hold constant, we expect the full year headwind from FX to be approximately $150 million.","On an operational basis, we expect consolidated 2013 sales to be in the range of up 0.8% to up 1.5% growth for the year. This assumes that the IC and CRM markets continue to stabilize and we realize the benefits of new or expanded product launches across our divisions and regions.","From an earning standpoint, we are moving up our guidance again for the third time and expect adjusted earnings per share for the year 2013 to be in the range of $0.69 to $0.71 and would encourage you again to model to the midpoint of the range. This range reflects the estimated negative impact of approximately $0.04 per share from the medical device tax.","On a reported GAAP basis, we expect EPS for the year to be a net loss in the range of $0.13 to $0.09 per share, primarily driven by the goodwill impairment charge recorded in the first quarter of this year.","Please note that all of today's guidance does not include any impact of the announced agreement to acquire the Electrophysiology business of C.R. Bard.","As we look forward to 2014, we believe we are on track towards meeting or exceeding our EPS goals as outlined in our Investor Day. We are currently in the process of rolling up our annual operating plan and expect to provide 2014 guidance in late January.","Finally, let me close on a personal perspective. My desire to seek a broader and more expansive role external to the company is not a reflection of my view of the prospects for the company. I feel very proud about the progress we've made as a senior leadership team over the past 5 years, turning around the company and putting it in a much better position. Dan Brennan and I have worked closely and very effectively together over the past several years, and I believe he is the right person to help lead the company as it enters the next chapter. The team continues to build momentum and execute against our global strategy. And I continue to believe Boston Scientific is well positioned to drive top line growth, enhance profitability and meet, if not exceed, the goals we laid out at the Investor Day.","So with that, I'll turn it back to Michael who will moderate the Q&A. Michael?","Michael Campbell","Thanks, Jeff. Trisha, let's open it up for questions for the next 30 minutes or so. [Operator Instructions] Trisha, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Jeff, you were kind enough to give us your personal perspective at the end, but it is surprising news. You've made a significant contribution to the turnaround here. Clearly, the financial turnaround is significant. We welcome Dan Brennan, but why now, just as the turnaround is accelerating? Should we be -- should we have any concerns about the outlook or Boston's commitment to further cost reduction and pipeline building, et cetera?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Well, Rick, in terms of the timing as to why now, I mean, I'm entering pretty much the 10th year of being a public company CFO, and my aspirations are to have a broader role. Mike and I talked about it over the past little while. So the opportunity to do that in the next phase of my career is something I was focused on. I think as you look at why now, I think the company has made a lot of progress over the last 5 years and the natural point would be within a year, right before a new year start, so I think it's a good time to transition with Dan coming on and owning the plan for next year. So I feel good about that. If I felt that the company was not in a good position, I wouldn't be leaving. I wouldn't do that. So I remain very confident that the company has a lot of momentum. We are having a terrific year. I think we're going to finish up the year strong. And I feel very confident of the trajectory of the company and will work with Dan to make sure that we set up an appropriate plan for next year to meet, if not exceed, the guidance we gave people at the Investor Day. So I'm quite confident of that.","Michael F. Mahoney","And Rick, this is Mike Mahoney. I'll just add to that. One, credit to Jeff on this. We have a very deep financial bench at Boston Scientific. And so, Dan's been with the company for a long time and will do an excellent job as CFO, and it's also a very well-planned out transition through 2013, as well as on an as needed basis for an extended period of time in 2014. So this will be done very well. And in terms of the commitment to the strategic plan, we absolutely have it. We laid it out at Investor Day in early 2013. We've been exceeding targets of that plan as has been laid out. We've got a number of important clinical programs that are in flight that we talked about. And we are highly committed, not only to drive top line growth, but to deliver significant margin improvement. As you know, it's a big focus area for us. I think it's further evidenced by the restructuring program that we highlighted today as good hygiene for the company as we deliver operating income margin improvement.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up. Second question. Just following on your comment about restructuring, Mike. Why not talk -- if you could give us some more detail in the targets, is this significantly reducing the plans? And my calculation, rough calculation, is that you could, in '16, fully implemented, it might add $0.10, $0.15 or so to EPS. Are you going to reinvest all of it? And just again more detailed perspective on restructuring.","Michael F. Mahoney","I'll make a comment and Jeff can fill in. So this restructuring plan is very consistent within the plans of the strategic plan and the investor guidance we already provided. So this is within -- embedded within that strategy. So we've talked about a key component of our strategy called funding the journey. And we have a current operating margin of, call it, 19-ish percent that we were striving to improve to 25%. So part of that productivity, there's many facets to that, but one is Plant Network Optimization. And our operations team continues to look at how we lean out operations and reduce overhead. And this is something that we've done before. We'll continue to look at our Plant Network Optimization in our efforts to improve operating income margin. But this action is consistent and not additive to the Investor Day presentation and projections we laid out.","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes, the only thing I'd add to that, Rick, is I think we continue to have opportunities to continue to work on the cost structure of the company, and this is just right in line with that. The lion's share of the benefit will be coming through the gross margin line in the form of rationalizing a number of plants. We currently still have a heavy number of plants, and this allows us to take some plants out of the network. And I think as people have seen, we've done it very successfully over the years, so I'm very confident of the operations team ability to do that. And then it's all around the functions, making the functions more appropriate for the size of company that we're at. So I think it's a good solid program, and the benefit will come over a 2-year period. I would remind you and the other analysts that we did announce today that we expect to start enrolling for our U.S. IDEs for both the TAVR program and for the Vessix program, and these programs are large programs that require costs. So as you think about counting [ph] your models going forward, a good portion of the benefit of these restructuring programs, some will go to the bottom line, some will go to fund those programs to drive the growth of the company going forward.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Jeff, a couple of financial questions for you. The gross margin, very strong in the quarter, 70.7%, I think I heard you say, and 70% to 71% in Q4. Could you help us think about the gross margin beyond 2013, some of the puts and takes? And secondly, the Q4 guidance implies a bit of a step down from Q3, the Q3 growth rate. I think you had said in the past you expect the growth to accelerate in the second half of the year, especially in the fourth quarter with some of the new product launches. So why the conservatism on the Q4 guidance?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Okay. So let me start with the gross margin, and then I'll go to your sales question. Two good questions, thank you, Larry. So as you look at the gross margin -- maybe I'll bridge you kind of from a year-over-year basis. Our gross margins were roughly 68% a year ago. We've taken them up 270 basis points to 70.7%. It's kind of the same story that's been playing out throughout the year in the sense that some of our efforts around price management, segmentation, are really starting to bear fruit, and we are seeing less price erosion than we anticipated. So that's very good news. That's what we thought would happen, and we're getting a little bit more traction. There's also a mixed benefit. Some of our new products are carrying a better gross margin than their predecessors, and that's also very good news. The third factor from a gross margin perspective that was helpful is the efforts of our manufacturing team to further take costs out of the manufacturing facilities and run them more efficiently, we call them value improvement programs, are really getting some strong traction, and that team feels very bullish going forward that they've got more opportunity. So it's really kind of those 3 factors have positioned us really well from a gross margin perspective. And as we look at the fourth quarter, fourth quarter tends to be higher from a revenue perspective than the third quarter because of seasonality in Europe. That will allow us to drive a little bit more margin improvement based on more volume. So we feel good about the gross margins. We did talk about a plan at the Investor Day of being able to drive the gross margins up to 72%. Frankly, we are ahead of our plan based on the strong progress, a credit to the team. I think we also said that 72% wasn't a limit. It's certainly not a ceiling. So some of our competitors are at 75%. So it's the intent of this organization to drive back to more margins that are more indicative of the sector, and this would indicate that there's some opportunity to do that, maybe quicker than we thought. So that's on the margin side. On the sales side, I guess a couple of comments I'd make relative to the sales for the fourth quarter are, if you go back and look at the fourth quarter of last year, we had a very strong quarter for the MedSurg businesses. We were up 10% in Endoscopy, 14% in Neuromod and 9% in PI. So the fourth quarter was our best quarter of last year. So we are up against the most difficult comparable from the sales perspective. Having said that, if you look at our guidance, our guidance is 2% to 4%. If you take the midpoint, 3%, it's not far off what we grew this quarter, the third quarter, and there could be some potential upside to that. I think we'll wait and see how things play out. A lot of that has to do with timing. We do expect the TAVR program to get CE Mark approval in the very, very near future. So stay tuned to that. And so a lot of it just has to do with timing of getting programs approved and market reception in the early rollout. So I would say that there's a good likelihood from a sales perspective that we could do better than the midpoint.","Operator","And we'll open the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Jeff, I wonder if we could talk about, or Mike, subcutaneous ICD capacity coming back in line. It sounds to me from your commentary that first quarter '14 sounds like the first quarter of full commercial launch. I wonder if you could just kind of help us understand the pacing of that business in terms of the ability to service a broader number of accounts in the U.S. over the next several quarters. And we've talked about gross margins. You're obviously guiding for gross margin improvement into the fourth quarter. Is there any impact from subcutaneous on from a negative margin mix perspective over the next several quarters? And then I have a follow-up.","Michael F. Mahoney","Sure. It's Mike here. In terms of the S-ICD supply question. So the good news is in the third quarter here, we resumed selling S-ICD primarily to our IDE locations. And later in the third quarter, just recently, we've expanded that beyond our IDE facilities. So the good news is we are back in the market in our IDE facilities and we are expanding beyond that. And in terms of supply for 2014, we anticipate by first quarter 2014, we will not be supply constrained with S-ICD. So the team has made tremendous progress relocating our manufacturing facilities, reducing the variance and the supply chain, and we expect that we will not have supply constraints as we enter 2014. In terms of the margins, we've discussed this in previous calls, really no change here. As we continue to drive volume, it will improve the margins of S-ICD. And we'll provide additional guidance in the first quarter earnings call.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Very helpful. And Jeff, one theme that seemed to pop up this call. And clearly, you've taken earnings numbers up for the better part of the year. We talked about the cost restructuring announcement, it sounds like it's part of the prior P&L and you're reinvesting those. We also heard about some increased emerging market spending into the fourth quarter. I mean, just from a tone perspective, it sounds to me maybe there's incremental reinvestment to grow. Would you say that you're finding opportunities to incrementally reinvest as the top line continues to improve? Or is the way to think about this, the spending you're making is in line with the prior plan?","Jeffrey D. Capello","I would say that the spending is more less in line with the prior plan, I think, if you look at kind of the midpoint. Third quarter is a tough one to judge it off from an SG&A perspective because it's our lowest quarter typically from a revenue perspective, and timing of cost can kind of move around. We do expect the SG&A rate to drop down in the fourth quarter. So I think it's not dissimilar from kind of the plan that we laid out to the Street. And I think, as we said, clearly, with operating margins of -- in the mid-19s, we think we have at least 100 basis point opportunity to expand margins every year, and that's the focus. And I think that's something that's very achievable for the organization.","Operator","And we will open the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Jeff, I apologize because of the multiple calls going on I may have missed some of this, but I heard you walking through the gross margin step-up. Obviously, a very strong performance this quarter. How much did the neurovascular TSAs -- with Stryker running off, how much did that contribute to the quarter? And then what impact did FX have?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes, thanks, Mike. So the impact of the divestiture was roughly 100 basis points on a year-over-year basis. We now pretty much are done with kind of the divestiture revenue which had very low margin. And then from an FX perspective, it had negligible impact.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So on an organic basis and looked at it as if about 160 basis point positive year-over-year?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","x the neurovascular TSAs?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes, that's about right.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then help us think about the restructuring. I was going through it last night, and I think that however you want to classify it with the Plant Network Optimization programs and the restructuring's going back to the early part of '09. This is either the fourth or fifth restructuring for the company. And I was going back and looking at the math on the expected savings from all those restructurings and, as you know, it gets to be pretty significant. I think the EPS math was like $0.40 to $0.50 in potential EPS contribution now. Obviously, there were headwinds over the last several years from declining end markets, as well as the need to reinvest in the business, so we didn't really see the benefit of that restructuring. How do we think about this one? Now you're at the point where revenues hopefully are growing over the next few years. You're in a better position to manage through some of the end market pressures that won't go away, but you also still need to reinvest in the business, whether it's funding clinical trials or products that need to come to the U.S. market, or even just launching some of those products or continue to build out the emerging markets. How do you think about the savings you outlined in the press release last night relative to reinvestment versus seeing them on the bottom line?","Jeffrey D. Capello","I think it's a very good question. And actually, when we reviewed this restructuring program with the board, I went back and looked at our whole sector over the last 6 or 7 years. And our restructuring actions, if you go back and look at it, are pretty much right in line with all of our competitors in terms of number of charges, dollars of charges and roughly, the benefits are very limited. So I think it's indicative of an industry in transition is what it really is, right? I mean, there's so much change going on, and organizations have to adapt and change. And we are doing that, our competitors are doing that right in lockstep. Having said that, so from a relative perspective, we are more or less right in line with what the competition has been doing. And from a savings perspective and where the savings go or where will they go going forward, I think one of the things to keep in mind is, our P&L is burdened very heavily with the number of acquisitions that are in the critical stages from investment perspective, and that's why you're not seeing as much of kind of a dropthrough. And for some of those programs are coming out of the investment stage and start to accelerate from an earnings return heading into '14 and '15. For others, such as our renal denervation and the TAVR program, we still have quite a bit investment. So as I said to Rick on the first call, I would look at these restructuring programs providing investors with comfort that we can continue to drive the acquisitions that are at the doorstep of starting to return to the company and also carry the new larger programs, and still allow ourselves to kind of expand our margins. So that's the way to think about the restructuring kind of where the benefit goes.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And when you guys laid out your, call it, your LRP earlier this year, this restructuring was contemplated in that?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes. I mean, I think what we said at the Investor Day is that we expect it to continue to kind of deliver on cost savings to drive the earnings of the company. So yes, we continue to restructure the business, and it wouldn't be unusual to be restructurings going forward. And I don't think anybody -- any of our competitors would say anything different.","Operator","And we will open the line of Bruce Nudell with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just some commentary on the x U.S. DES performance. I think we're coming up with about $148 million reported revenues, I'm not sure if that's correct. That was about $10 million below us and about $20 million below the Street. Were there any special considerations in there? First of all, did we get the number right? And secondly, were there any special considerations there and anything about the market dynamics in the x U.S. markets?","Jeffrey D. Capello","So Bruce, your number is a little light relative to -- from a DES perspective outside the U.S. We did about $156 million in revenue.","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Is that reported?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes, that's reported.","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Great. And so -- okay. And so, could you just talk about the x U.S. market dynamics?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Sure. So let's start kind of in Europe and we'll move East. So in Europe, from a market perspective, we continue to see very strong unit growth, offset by pretty strong pricing pressure, to the point where that market -- we think that market's about flat. And we, of course, were off the market for almost a whole quarter in Germany because of the OrbusNeich injunction. So that cost us -- if you look at the performance, that probably cost us 400 basis points of revenue growth. The revenue would have been 400 basis points higher. And now that we're back on the market, we expect to regain our share. So that's important to understand. The other important thing to understand is Asia Pacific. So we've been talking for the last 4 or 5 years about the fact that the Asia Pacific market, we expected, kind of outside Japan, really to be a growth engine for us. This quarter, we grew Asia Pacific drug-eluting stent 16%, 1-6. So the benefits of that strategy is starting to get some traction, and that market is growing. So as a whole, we think the overall DES market was down roughly 2% for the quarter. And we think that, that dynamic, as it continues to improve, bodes well for us with our leading-edge technology platform and our hyper investment we've been making in the emerging markets.","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Fair enough, that's great. And just to clarify, my second question is simple. The revenue guidance for the fourth quarter is not inclusive of Bard. And is Bard -- like it's roughly $25 million to $27 million a quarter run rate for the base business. Is there a potential upside if, in fact, it closes mid-quarter? Or are you pretty certain that it won't contribute in the fourth quarter?","Jeffrey D. Capello","So the game plan would be that, that transaction would close ideally early November. And if that happens, I would assume that it adds roughly 100 basis points of growth to the fourth quarter.","Operator","And we open the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I had some revenue questions. So another very good revenue quarter. And ICDs, particularly in the U.S., came in ahead of our expectations, ahead of the Street. And I'm wondering if you can provide a little bit more commentary. It feels like, from a unit point of view, the market is getting better. And I'm just wondering what's driving this improved volume. And I'm also guessing that perhaps pricing is becoming less of a headwind, so I wonder if you can comment on the U.S. ICD market from a volume and a pricing point of view. And then I have a follow-up on stents.","Michael F. Mahoney","Yes, sure. Mike here. In terms of the U.S. CRM market, overall, we agree with you. We think the market has stabilized. It's not a growth market yet. We still see the market in the low-single digits. And as you indicated, price is probably in the mid-single digits -- low to mid-single digits, offset by volume, gets us to low single-digit overall market for the U.S. But it has stabilized, and the good news, Scott Olson and our U.S. sales team are doing an excellent job in representing the portfolio. And we believe we're picking up some share in the de novo ICD market, as well as the de novo pacer market. So I think a lot of it is the pullthrough of the portfolio that's been invested in, as well as the EP investments that you're seeing. So with the S-ICD coming online, more so in fourth quarter and in 2014, we anticipate that trend to continue. And so, we're supportive. I'm pleased that the market is stabilizing, and we have a nice portfolio to fit into that.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And just one quick follow-up on ICDs. We modeled the replacement, which -- a headwind in the U.S -- has been a headwind, that turning to a little bit of a tailwind for you guys starting in 2014. Is that a reasonable assumption?","Michael F. Mahoney","Yes, we probably wouldn't classify it as a tailwind. We probably classify it as neutral for us in 2014 in terms of the replacement market.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just quickly on Promus PREMIER, just so on the -- following up on Bruce's question on international stents, can you give us a sense of how Promus PREMIER is doing in the European market? And the reason I'm asking is, obviously, that could give us a read-through on how the U.S. uptake of Promus PREMIER will occur. And so give us a sense of Promus PREMIER in Europe, and I think you're still anticipating very shortly the Promus PREMIER in the U.S. launch, too.","Michael F. Mahoney","Yes. We are anticipating an announcement hopefully in the fourth quarter here on approval in the U.S. for Promus PREMIER. In Europe, our strategy is pretty well known. We have a -- we believe we have the 2 strongest stent platforms offered in Europe right now with SYNERGY, which is really our premium price bioresorbable stent. They were backed by significant new clinical trials that Keith outlined in the call, followed by our Promus PREMIER, which has been recently launched in most countries in Europe as our true workhorse stent. And it's difficult to gauge the overall European market share, given the context that we were out of the German market for a number of months and now beginning to get back into that market in the fourth quarter. So we'll be able to flush out the true share numbers in Europe once this German issue has been neutralized. But in general, we're seeing very strong uptick for Promus PREMIER. Physicians, clearly, like chromium PLATINUM platform and the deliverability of the stent. And we're seeing -- we believe, once Germany -- once our supply is ahead in Germany, we'll see nice share gains in Europe across our DES platforms.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And should we assume, from a modeling point of view, some share gains in 4Q and starting next year with the Promus PREMIER launch in the U.S.?","Michael F. Mahoney","That's our plan. We've been waiting for Promus PREMIER for 2 years now in the U.S. And we believe with Promus PREMIER and the combination of our complex CTO devices from BridgePoint, as well as our non-DES product line within Interventional Cardiology, we'll be able to gain share in 2014 in the U.S.","Operator","And we will open the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Wanted to just, I guess, follow up on the prior question on S-ICD. So could you give us just a sense of how quickly you can ramp? And what is the main gating factor now that you have the 1.5 version and have really transitioned some of the production capabilities? Is it -- to the end, is it you're rolling it out more slowly because you want to keep the results high, or is it still production?","Michael F. Mahoney","It's really continuing to mature, our operations and supply chain. So we're comfortable in expanding the usage out beyond our IDE sites. And like any operation supply chain, it's building that capacity out. And we anticipate that, as previously mentioned, that it will be at full capacity in the first quarter 2014. So that's really just ramping up. The development work of 1.5 has been completed. The majority -- many of the components have already been approved by FDA. So we anticipate that the bulk of the 1.5 release will be approved by the end of this year. And we'll continue to ramp up and be in full capacity in the first quarter 2014.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And maybe just one on Portico, I just -- I'm sorry, on Lotus. Just curious on how you view your opportunity for commercial sales in Europe this year considering that there is an injunction versus Portico in Germany. And also, if you could help us with what you think is going to be most important for the company at TCT, if there's any data that we should really be looking for, either from a BSX standpoint or a competitive standpoint.","Michael F. Mahoney","Sure. Hey, Dr. Dawkins, you're still on the phone?","Keith D. Dawkins","Yes, sure.","Michael F. Mahoney","Maybe you could answer that in terms of the highlights of the upcoming TCT meeting next week.","Keith D. Dawkins","Yes. From our point of view, Matt, we're going to present for the first time the full 120 patients of the REPRISE II CE Mark trial for Lotus. We've obviously presented previously the first 60 patients at PCL London Valves. So that's a full data set for the first time. There's also going to be some exciting new Vessix data, increased number of patients followed out to 12 months with Vessix. And obviously, there's a lot of upcoming updates of many of our trials. But I think we would highlight on the Interventional Cardiology side and the PI side the Vessix data and the Lotus data, REPRISE II data.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And any thoughts on the commercial sales of TAVR next year in Europe?","Michael F. Mahoney","Yes. We'll provide more guidance on our 2014 estimate, and specifically with TAVR sales at our earnings call in January.","Operator","We will open the line of Bob Hopkins, Bank of America.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to ask 2 questions. One, I just want to make sure that I've got the restructuring comment clear in my head, because I apologize, I've been popping around between calls here. And I guess, what I've been hearing on this call is the way to think about the restructuring is, it's what's needed to get to where you already planned on being in your previous commentary from a long-term margin and EPS growth perspective.","Michael F. Mahoney","That's correct.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then on the new product front, in Left Atrial Appendage, and I appreciate your comments in the prepared remarks, but I was just wondering if you can talk about how we should be thinking about expectations sort of year 1 post-launch. Are there sort of structural challenges that we need to be thinking about in terms of manufacturing capacity or training or things like that? Or should this be a pretty smooth initial rollout once you get approval? And maybe if I could, could this be a $50 million product in year 1 post-launch? In the United States, I mean.","Michael F. Mahoney","Great question. And Dr. Stein, you could add some additional comments. We'll provide guidance with respect to Atritech, some of the Sadra, in January in terms of our 2014 at our earnings call. The great news is, we are now to manufacture and train physicians for Atritech today. So this business is growing close to 50% in Europe. And we are anxious for the FDA approval, which we anticipate on the first half of 2014. So we do not anticipate a ramp-up issues in terms of operations and supply chain with Atritech. This is a nice, high-gross margin product. One key factor that will be critical for us in the U.S. is physician training and proctoring. So we do have a dedicated team focused on that to ensure that we have a high-quality rollout. So we are comfortable with our capabilities to manufacture the product and to train based on our experiences in Europe, and we'll bring those capabilities to the U.S. once it's approved hopefully in the first half. Dr. Stein, do you have any follow-up comments?","Ken Stein","Yes. Thanks, Mike. I just want to reiterate what you said about the training program. And we're very pleased by the data from PREVAIL that were presented around the time of ACC this year, as well as the totality of data from all of the clinical trials we have in this device. But what those trials have shown is that with a rigorous and comprehensive training program, the device can be implanted very safely and very effectively by new operators. But we do need to ensure that they go through that training program. And so, once we get approval, this is going to be launched with a very controlled rollout ensuring adequacy of training with new operators.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just wanted to follow up, Jeff. I think you had talked about, and this came up at the investor meeting earlier this year, getting to about 100 basis points of operating margin improvement. If we just kind of look at your gross margin for the fourth quarter, is that something that we should look at as kind of a good run rate off of which to now kind of model going forward? And I just -- balancing your, I guess, commentary about the restructuring programs and reinvesting in R&D, it sounds like R&D is expected to kind of increase as we look ahead to 2014. So just how do we think about gross margins? And maybe will we eventually see SG&A kind of come down as a percentage of sales going ahead?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes. So I'm not going to be able to give you guidance by P&L line item because we haven't really finished that yet for 2014. But what I can help you with is, if you look at kind of our operating margins for 2012, they were 18.8%. And if you take the midpoint of our guidance, you get to about 19.5% for 2013. So we'll be up about 60 basis points year-over-year. And it is very, very important that people understand that we have a full year impact of medical device tax in our numbers. So without the medical device tax, we would have been up 160 basis points. Some of our competitors have elected to put it in cost of goods sold, which means it really cut the inventory. They have a half year's impact. So the good news is we get the whole medical device tax behind us in 2013, setting up for an easier comparable relative to some of our competitors from a margin perspective. Having said that, I've said it a couple times and continue to say it, I'm sure Dan will as well, the opportunity for us to expand the margins is real. There is a lot of pressure in the P&L from the growth programs we have. And the organization and the management team is comfortable being able to commit to increasing its operating margins 100 basis points per year.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Perfect. And then just regarding the tax rate, I know that you had highlighted that there was 200 basis points of an impact just from the R&D tax credit. How should we just think about the sustainability of that tax rate going forward? Because it is obviously much lower than a lot of your peers and much lower given just kind of the U.S. and o U.S. mix business you have?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes, so you have to kind of take our rate for this year, which is close to -- we expect to be close to 13%, and add a couple 100 basis points to it, if you neutralize for the extra R&D tax credit. So let's say it's 15%. I think that's a pretty good rate for us for the foreseeable future, subject to what may happen or not with the U.S. tax reform. But I think, a 15% tax rate for next couple of years is probably a reasonable assumption.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, perfect. And then just real quickly, I guess the last question. Looking at the operating margins just kind of by division, CRM saw pretty significant increases as did cardiovascular. Can you maybe just walk through what the main drivers were there?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes. So we continue to remain rather focused on the margins. The cardiovascular margins were up about 110 basis points. And as a reminder, that includes the IC business and the PI business. So that's -- anytime we can drive 7% revenue growth in PI, we're going to see margin expansion. So that's one of the key drivers there. Rhythm Management, we went from 11.6% to 13.4%, so up about 170 basis points. And you recall what we said, we think we can basically double our CRM operating margins the next 5 years. And I've said it a couple of times, this includes a negative dilution associated with Atritech, Cameron and a number of the Rhythmia development programs. So as we continue to do better from a CRM perspective, just like it was a little painful on the way down, when we grow 1%, 2%, we start to get more revenue growth. It is very accretive on the way up. So part of that is revenue growth coming back to Rhythm Management. And then the MedSurg business was down about 30 basis points. I don't lose any sleep about that at all. That group is growing like crazy. And they can still improve their operating margins. So that's just at 1 quarter some cost being in 1 quarter versus the next. But the margins are healthy and expect them at the end to go up.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just Rhythm Management, you said double over the next 5 years?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes.","Operator","And our last question will come from the line of Matthew Dodds with Citigroup.","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a couple of quick product questions. On SYNERGY, are you waiting for the EVOLVE II data to move off to limited launch in Europe? Or do you expect to open it up more as we move through this year and 2014?","Michael F. Mahoney","It's Mike. We do anticipate expanding the launch of SYNERGY in Europe in the first half of 2014. We're also very mindful of maintaining discipline in our pricing strategy. We do see this as a premium price product with that tiered platform that we have. And so we want to be disciplined with our pricing strategy with it but we do see expanding that to a broader release in the first half of '14.","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And does that product have broad reimbursement across Europe in the country? Or is there something special there you need to get additional reimbursement for it?","Michael F. Mahoney","We do have reimbursement for SYNERGY, but we're -- Dr. Dawkins, maybe you can outline some of the clinical efforts we have to try to further differentiate capabilities.","Keith D. Dawkins","Yes. We thought it was important to support this unique product with the polymer and the drug going away at 3 months with a good amount of data. So we have a number of investigator sponsored trials, which will start during late '13 and '14. We'll investigate formally more than 14,000 patients with SYNERGY against a number of other products, particularly looking at complex patient subgroups where acute delivery and acute performance is probably key. And then as I think you know, we're going to investigate a short -- a formal, short DAPT proposition, which will be adequately powered, unlike some of the data-gathering efforts that have been -- previously. And so, we are very excited with the commercial -- the full commercial launch, as Mike said, and the premium price point will be supported by strong clinical data. Obviously, we completed early the EVOLVE II IDE trial. We've also completed the QCA trial. And so, we now have, on the back of the first IVUS study, we have a good amount of randomized data to support SYNERGY.","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And just one quick question on Vessix. Can you say for the U.S. trials, since the IDE has been filed, are you going to go after 160 millimeters of blood pressure? Or can you start at a lower level, like 140?","Keith D. Dawkins","We are not publicizing the details of the IDE right now. We've completed discussions with the agency. Suffice it to say that it is an interesting protocol and it will involve U.S. and o U.S. sites.","Michael Campbell","Okay. With that, we would like to conclude the call. Thanks for joining us today.

Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the conference over to our host, Ms. Lisa. Please go ahead.","Susie Lisa","Thank you, Karen. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q1 2015 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our Web site under the heading, Financial Information.","The duration of this morning's call will be approximately 45 minutes, slightly shorter than usual due to our upcoming Investor Day this Friday, May 1. Mike will begin our prepared remarks with an update on our business progress and his perspectives on the quarter.","Dan will then review our overall Q1 2015 financial results as well as guidance for full year 2015 and Q2 2015. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Keith Dawkins and Dr. Ken Stein.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate and other similar words.","They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share; new product approvals and launches; clinical trials; cost savings and growth opportunities; our cash flow and expected use; our financial performance, including sales, margins, earnings and other Q2 and full year 2015 guidance; as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses.","Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs and 8-Ks filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them.","At this point, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike?","Mike Mahoney","Thank you, Susie. Good morning, everyone. Boston Scientific started off 2015 with solid results in the first quarter, as the company continued to deliver and build global momentum. We delivered 6% operating revenue growth and 18% year-over-year adjusted EPS growth, excluding a $0.02 negative impact for foreign exchange.","We believe that we\u2019re poised to continue the strong execution and in first quarter we announced several new important product approvals and M&A transactions. These improved acquisition at the AMS urology portfolio and the endoscopic ultrasound capabilities of Xlumena, and our recently announced China joint venture with Frankenman Corporation.","We\u2019re also pleased with the recent FDA approvals of our WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure platform and the next-generation EMBLEM S-ICD platform. All of these things reinforce our belief that Boston Scientific is well positioned to deliver at or above market revenue growth, and despite the increased currency headwinds, we maintain our goal of consistent double-digit adjusted EPS growth through our ongoing operating margin improvement initiatives.","I\u2019ll provide some brief highlights of our first quarter but I\u2019ll save the comments on our longer term outlook for the Investor Day this Friday. Dan will review the financials and second quarter guidance and then we\u2019ll take your questions. So please note that in my remarks, all references to growth on a year-over-year basis in constant currency unless otherwise specified.","In terms of the key highlights for the quarter, we delivered 6% operational revenue growth, strong operating margin expansion of 250 basis points versus first quarter 2014 and delivered adjusted EPS growth, excluding currency of 18%. Lastly, we strengthened and diversified our portfolio through new product approvals and M&A.","Our results were driven by strong operational revenue growth at all three of our reporting segments; Cardiovascular up 10%, Rhythm Management up 4% and MedSurg up 4%. In addition, we saw balanced operational revenue growth from all of our primary regions led by Asia at 7%, in the U.S. and Europe at 6% growth. China continues to be our emerging market standout with revenue growth of 25% in the quarter.","So once again, we\u2019re also encouraged by the strong results across most of our businesses but I\u2019d particularly like to point out another strong quarter in the Interventional Cardiology, which grew at 8% after going 9% in the second quarter of 2014. Growth in Interventional Cardiology was balanced across all franchises and regions with 7% global DES growth led by strength in Asia. DES growth also was solid in Europe where the SYNERGY Stent now represents more than 25% of our European DES sales.","Our PCI guidance business also continues to deliver strong results, particularly in Japan where the OptiCross IVUS catheter and ongoing launch of our integrated Polaris imaging system. Finally, our IC performance was supported by our emerging Structural Heart business including our LOTUS percutaneous aortic valve and WATCHMAN LAAC platforms.","So beyond IC, we\u2019re also pleased with our broad based growth of our MedSurg businesses and particularly encouraged by the ongoing strength of our Neuromodulation division. Neuromodulation grew 6% in the quarter, which was a 23% 2014 quarterly growth comp. And since 2011, the Neuromod division has risen from number three to number one market share in the U.S. spinal cord stimulation market.","Turning to Rhythm Management, our EP business grew 6% and our CRM business grew 4% in the quarter and likely ahead of the market growth rate. Our CRM performance albeit against the favorable first quarter comp represents another quarter of above market revenue growth on the strength of our portfolio and global commercial execution. Note for the balance of 2015, we expect to see CRM perform more in line with the overall market growth rate given tougher quarter-over-quarter comparables and replacement cycle headwinds.","So turning now to profitability, we expanded adjusted operating margins to 22.5 in the quarter, a 250 basis point improvement year-over-year and 180 basis point improvement sequentially. This drove 18% year-over-year adjusted EPS growth if you exclude the $0.02 negative impact of foreign exchange.","Importantly, we remain committed to expanding our operating margins and we are making consistent progress and marching towards our target of 25% adjusted operating margin in 2017, which will represent a 620 basis point improvement from 2012 actual.","In terms of EPS, despite the significant currency headwinds, we remain committed to our target for double-digit EPS growth and we\u2019re delivering on our financial goals with eight straight quarters of operational and revenue growth, and we\u2019re ahead of the revenue growth and adjusted EPS targets provided at our February 13 Investor Day. We look forward to updating those targets with you on Friday.","So moving on some other highlights, our first quarter results reflect our sharp focus on delivering meaningful innovation to our patients and physicians while also providing clinical and economic value to our customers.","A great example of this from our PI business is the exciting Eluvia drug-eluting stent data that was released just this morning at the Charing Cross Symposium in London. Eluvia is a drug-eluting stent that\u2019s purpose-built for the superficial femoral artery or SFA. We\u2019re extremely excited about our breakthrough trial results. The adjusted trial enrolled 57 patients at 15 European centers and met its primary endpoint with an impressive 94.4 patency rate at nine months.","In addition to 94.4 patency rate, Eluvia also demonstrated a low target lesion revascularization rate at 3.6% and an excellent safety profile with a 3.6% major adverse event rate with no deaths and no amputations. We expect Eluvia will begin its global IDE in the second half of the year. We expect to receive CE Mark in the first half of 2016. We\u2019re also pleased with the early days of our distribution agreement with C. R. Bard of the Lutonix drug coated balloon for peripheral artery disease, and Jeff Mirviss will highlight these PI vascular solutions on Friday.","We also strengthened our endoscopy portfolio and emerging market capabilities. In China, our endoscopy business announced a strategic alliance with Frankenman Medical. Frankenman joint venture combines the expertise of a global medical device leader and a local market expertise of a recognized leader in China\u2019s surgical device market. This JV will allow both players to reach more clinicians, to reach more patients.","There were 1 million bile duct stone removal procedures being done annually in China as open surgical procedures. Converting these procedures from open surgical procedures to endoscopic procedures is expected to lead to better patient outcomes and health care economics, as well as drive enhanced endoscopy growth. Also in endoscopy, we announced the acquisition of Xlumena, which will enhance the position of Boston Scientific in the field of interventional endoscopic ultrasound called EUS therapeutics.","Interventional EUS is a nonsurgical minimally invasive procedure that uses high frequency sound waves to produce detailed images of the GI tract and the adjacent organs. To complement EUS, our recently approved fine needle aspiration platform is often used to collect tissue samples for cancer diagnosis. These solutions complement our recent launch of the SPYGLASS Digital System and Advanix pancreatic stent. Dave Pierce will provide more insight into the rationale and opportunity for both Frankenman and Xlumena on Friday.","Finally, we\u2019re excited about the transformational potential of our recent acquisition, the AMS urology portfolio. Upon closing, the AMS asset acquisition will nearly double the size of our uro business to $1 billion. Urology devices represent an attractive global market of 4 billion with large unmet patient needs and considerable international expansion opportunities. Upon closing of AMS, the combined business will create a comprehensive portfolio of leadership positions across five major segments.","The deal also offers strong financial returns with an ROIC that exceeds our cost of capital by 2017 and an estimated adjusted EPS impact of $0.03 of accretion in 2016 and $0.07 of accretion in 2017. The AMS deal is also strategically compelling for BSC overall, as it furthers our goal of category leadership in each of our businesses.","Overall, we\u2019ve been demonstrating a strong execution of our strategic and plan and we continue to believe that Boston Scientific is uniquely positioned to drive double-digit adjusted EPS growth given our strong pipeline, global expansion and significant opportunities for margin improvement. I would like to thank all of our employees for their winning spirit and their commitment to Boston Scientific.","Now let me turn the call over to Dan for a more detailed review of financials.","Dan Brennan","Thanks, Mike. I\u2019ll start with some overall perspective on the quarter before getting into the details. We generated adjusted EPS of $0.21 achieving the high end of our guidance range of $0.19 to $0.21 and representing 6% year-over-year growth. Unfavorable foreign exchange impacted Q1 adjusted EPS by $0.02 versus the $0.01 we had assumed in our Q1 guidance range. Excluding this unfavorable foreign exchange impact, Q1 adjusted EPS grew 18% year-over-year.","The strong performance in Q1 was driven primarily by operational revenue growth and gross margin expansion. Our Q1 2015 adjusted operating margin of 22.5% achieved the high end of our full year adjusted operating margin guidance range and represents improvement of 250 basis points over Q1 of 2014. We continue to execute against our goals of consistent revenue growth and operating margin expansion, and despite the significant FX headwinds, our goal for full year 2015 remains double-digit adjusted EPS growth.","Now I\u2019ll provide a more detailed review of our Q1 business performance and operating results. Unless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the first quarter of 2014 and all revenue growth rates are given on a year-over-year constant currency basis.","For the first quarter of 2015, consolidated revenue of 1.768 billion represented operational revenue growth of 6%, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange and the divested Neurovascular business.","On an as reported basis, revenue was flat year-over-year. Excluding an approximate 160 basis point contribution from the Bayer Interventional acquisition, organic revenue growth was 5% in the quarter. The foreign exchange impact on sales was a $117 million headwind compared to the prior year period, about $27 million worse than we assumed in our prior guidance range.","I\u2019ll now provide more details on the revenue results for our seven businesses, which roll up into our three reporting segments. I\u2019ll start with MedSurg, where total group sales of $542 million grew 4% and adjusted operating margin was 29%, a decrease of 150 basis points over Q1 of 2014.","Endoscopy sales grew 4% worldwide, with continued strength in Asia and Latin America and looking ahead, we believe the recent launch of our digital SPYGLASS and the acquisition of Xlumena, a leader in the field of endoscopic ultrasound therapies will help drive above-market growth in endoscopy for the full year 2015. Our recently announced Frankenman JV in China should also drive growth longer term.","Urology and Women's Health worldwide sales grew 3% and strong urology performance in the U.S. and Europe offset challenges resulting from a softer Women's Health market and lower capital sales. Emerging markets revenue growth remains strong in the quarter growing north of 20%.","To close out the MedSurg results, our worldwide Neuromodulation business posted solid sales growth of 6% versus a very difficult comparison in Q1 of last year when the business grew 23% globally. We believe our Q1 performance was in line with market and expect to grow faster than the market for the full year 2015, driven by the strong uptick of our 32-contact paddle and the strength of our pipeline, which we will discuss further at our upcoming Investor Day on Friday.","Turning now to the Cardiovascular group, which consists of the Interventional Cardiology and Peripheral Intervention divisions. Global sales for the group totaled $712 million and grew 10%. Cardiovascular group adjusted operating margins for the quarter of 30.6%, represented an impressive 630 basis point improvement year-over-year on strong stent volumes and manufacturing favorability. Within Cardiovascular, worldwide Interventional Cardiology sales of $495 million grew 8%.","Globally, DES grew 7% with O-U.S. DES revenue growing double digits. DES growth was particularly strong in Asia, driven by Promus PREMIER, stent uptake in China and the launch of the Promus PREMIER large vessel stent in Japan. Worldwide complex PCI solutions grew 4% led by high-teens growth in imaging. We continue to see strong physician demand for our OptiCross IVUS catheter and ongoing launch of our Polaris imaging system.","Overall, we remain pleased with our IC performance in the quarter and believe it validates our strategy to drive above-market growth by providing the interventional cardiologists with the broadest portfolio of technology and differentiated products to treat the most complex coronary cases.","In structural heart, our LOTUS percutaneous valve grew 31% sequentially on a constant currency basis and WATCHMAN continued its strong growth with global revenue up more than 60% versus Q1 of last year. We look forward to highlighting our structure heart franchise more this Friday at our Investor Day.","Peripheral Interventions delivered worldwide revenue growth of 14% driven by revenue from the acquired Bayer Interventional business, which grew 6% overall and 9% in PI. Excluding the contribution from Bayer Interventional, worldwide PI revenue grew 2%. U.S. legacy PI grew 5% in the quarter, partially offset by weakness in Japan and Latin America where we saw some procedural softness.","Finally, I\u2019ll discuss our Rhythm Management group, which consists of our Electrophysiology and Cardiac Rhythm Management divisions. Worldwide Rhythm Management sales in Q1 of $514 million grew 4%.","Rhythm Management's adjusted operating margin for Q1 of 14.3% represents a 160-basis point improvement year-over-year, the fifth consecutive quarter where Rhythm Management adjusted operating margins have improved 100 basis points or more over the prior year.","We would expect more modest Rhythm Management margin expansion in Q2 and an acceleration in the second half of the year given the launch timing and favorable gross margin profile of the EMBLEM S-ICD and ACCOLADE pacing product lines.","Worldwide Electrophysiology revenue was up 6% with both the U.S. and O-U.S. achieving that same 6% growth rate. As a reminder, Q1 is the first quarter where the acquired Bard EP business is fully in the base. We continued the limited market release for our Rhythmia mapping and navigation system with strong physician feedback given the system\u2019s higher fidelity images acquired in a fraction of the time required by competitor systems. We are encouraged that the early signs of stabilization in EP that we saw in Q4 of '14 have continued into Q1.","For the Cardiac Rhythm Management division, Q1 worldwide sales increased 4%. Growth in CRM was led by Europe, which grew 6% for the third consecutive quarter. On a worldwide basis, defib sales of $335 million grew 5%. U.S. defib revenue posted solid growth of 6%, admittedly against an easier comparison driven by continued S-ICD system momentum, EL ICD, MINI ICD and our X4 quad CRT-D pulse generator as we continue to gain de novo ICD share.","Worldwide pacer sales totaled $121 million and grew 3%. O-U.S. pacer revenue grew double digits and we believe we continued to gain share in the O-U.S. pacer market. U.S. pacer sales declined mid-single digits due to share losses to competitors with MRI capabilities. We\u2019ve consistently stated that our belief is that the CRM trends are best analyzed over multiple quarters.","The 4% revenue growth worldwide CRM in Q1 brings our rolling 12-month growth rate to 4%, which we believe to be well in excess of the underlying combined pacemaker and defibrillator market. As Mike said, we would expect CRM growth to be more in line with the market for the balance of 2015 given tougher comps and competitors\u2019 launches.","Turning now to the P&L, adjusted gross profit margin for the first quarter was 71.3%, up 140 basis points year-over-year. The increase was largely attributable to benefits from our value improvement and hedging programs partially offset by price erosion. As a result of our hedging program, FX positively impacted gross margin by 80 basis points.","Adjusted SG&A expenses were $653 million or 37% of sales in Q1 2015. Our Q1 2015 adjusted SG&A rate was roughly flat to Q1 of 2014, and down approximately 90 basis points from the full year 2014 rate. We are encouraged by this lower rate of spend, as we begin to better leverage revenue growth in our structural heart franchise and realize the benefits from a cultural shift in our approach to spending. We continue to believe our full year 2014 SG&A rate will be in the range of 36.5% to 37.5%.","Adjusted research and development expenses were $192 million in the first quarter or 10.8% of sales. This adjusted R&D rate is flat to Q1 of 2014 and slightly below our 2015 guidance due to efficiency gains and the timing of projects. We still believe our full year R&D rate will be in the range of 11% to 12% of revenue and are expecting a sequential uptick in R&D spending as a percent of revenue.","Royalty expense was $17 million in the quarter or 1% of sales, which is consistent with our guidance. This royalty rate is down roughly 130 basis points year-over-year due to the renegotiation of a royalty agreement in Q2 of last year.","On an adjusted basis, pre-tax operating income was $398 million in the quarter or 22.5% of sales, up 250 basis points year-over-year and 230 basis points from the full year 2014 rate. Adjusted pre-tax operating income grew 12% driven by a 38% increase in our Cardiovascular segment.","GAAP operating income, which includes GAAP to adjusted items of $374 million, was $24 million in Q1 2015. The primary GAAP to adjusted items for the quarter included litigation-related charges of $193 million, contingent consideration expense of $27 million, restructuring-related charges of $22 million and amortization expense of $113 million.","The $193 million in litigation-related net charges were predominately related to an increase in our transvaginal surgical mesh product liability reserves. As a reminder, our reserves cover both known and estimated future cases and claims asserted against us as well as cost of defense.","Earlier this morning, as part of our earnings release filing, we disclosed the conditional settlement in the amount of approximately $119 million to resolve 2,790 cases and claims including a case in the district court of Dallas County where there is an approximate $35 million judgment. The settlement and the distribution of settlement funds to participating claimants are conditioned upon, among other things, achieving minimum required claimant participation thresholds. If the participation thresholds are not satisfied, we may terminate the agreement.","We will fund the settlement with two payments to be made on or before October 1, 2015. Our total legal reserve for all legal matters of which mesh is included was $1.453 billion as of March 31, 2015, but keep in mind that our total legal reserve also includes the second installment of the J&J settlement for $300 million, which was actually paid out in April.","Now I\u2019ll move on to other income and expense. Net interest expense for the quarter was $56 million, which is $2 million higher than Q1 of 2014. Other expense was $15 million and this consisted primarily of foreign exchange losses incurred during the quarter. Our tax rate for the first quarter was 97.5% on a reported basis, due primarily to the litigation-related charges that negatively impacted reported pre-tax income.","Our effective tax rate was 13.1% on an adjusted basis, which includes slightly less than $2 million of discrete tax benefits in the quarter. We continue to expect our full year 2015 adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 13% to 15%.","Finally, as mentioned, Q1 2015 adjusted EPS of $0.21 includes $0.02 of unfavorable FX and represents 6% year-over-year growth or 18% growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On a reported GAAP basis, Q1 2015 EPS was breakeven and includes net charges and amortization expense totaling $287 million after tax. Breakeven on a GAAP basis in Q1 2015 compares to GAAP EPS of $0.10 in the prior year period.","Moving on to the balance sheet, DSO of 59 days decreased three days compared to March of 2014, due primarily to strong collections in Europe. Days inventory on hand of 166 days was up 11 days compared to March of last year and up 10 days compared to December of 2014, due to higher inventory in advance of launches and lower cost of goods sold, driven primarily by standard cost improvements and favorable product mix.","Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $118 million compared to $161 million in Q1 last year. The decrease is largely due to the collection of long-dated European receivables in Q1 of 2014. We continue to expect our full year 2015 adjusted free cash flow to be approximately $1.3 billion.","Capital expenditures were $46 million in Q1 2015 compared to $59 million in Q1 2014. The decrease is attributable to timing and we still expect CapEx to be roughly $260 million for the full year 2015.","There were no share repurchases in the quarter consistent with our decision to temporarily suspend the share repurchase program following the announcement of the agreement to acquire AMS Men\u2019s Health and Prostate Health businesses. Near term, our capital allocation priorities are debt repayment, maintaining flexibility and tuck-in M&A.","Beyond the 12 to 18-month suspension period, any continuation of our share repurchase program would be subject to business development opportunities, market conditions, our stock performance, regulatory trading windows and other factors. We now expect to end 2015 with 1.360 billion to 1.370 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding.","I\u2019d like to conclude with guidance for Q2 and full year 2015. For Q2 2015, we expect consolidated revenues to be in a range of 1.800 billion to 1.850 billion. If current foreign exchange rates hold constant, the headwind from FX should be approximately $140 million or 750 basis points relative to Q2 of 2014.","On an operational basis, we expect consolidated Q2 sales to grow year-over-year in a range of 4% to 6%. We expect adjusted gross margin for the second quarter to be in the range of 70.5% to 71.5% prior to key new product launches in the second half of the year. Assuming a more normalized adjusted R&D rate in Q2 of 11% to 12%, we expect adjusted operating margin in the second quarter to be between 21% and 22%.","Finally, adjusted EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.20 to $0.22 per share and reported GAAP EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.09 to $0.11 per share. For the full year 2015, we now expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $7.225 billion to $7.375 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 4% to 6% operationally versus our initial 3% to 6% operational growth guidance for the year, and down to flat on a reported basis.","As a result of a stronger dollar at current rates, we expect foreign exchange to be roughly $450 million headwind for the full year 2015. Based on our strong Q1 and expectations for the second half of the year, we now expect our full year 2015 adjusted operating margin to be between 22% and 22.5%, an improvement of roughly 200 basis points at the midpoint over full year 2014.","Despite a more significant FX headwind when we issued our initial 2015 guidance in early February, we\u2019re holding our full year adjusted EPS range at $0.88 to $0.92 per share. Previously, we assumed that unfavorable FX would negatively impact full year 2015 adjusted EPS by $0.04 or $0.01 per quarter. Based on current rates, we now expect FX to impact full year 2015 adjusted EPS by $0.06 to $0.07 but are not changing our adjusted EPS guidance.","The high end of our adjusted EPS guidance range represents double-digit growth and based on current rates, approximately 15% growth at the midpoint when you exclude the impact of foreign exchange that I mentioned. On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in the range of $0.32 to $0.38.","I encourage you to check our Investor Relations Web site for Q1 2015 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q1 results, as well as Q2 and full year 2015 guidance including P&L line item guidance.","So with that, I'll turn it back over to Suzie who will moderate the Q&A.","Susie Lisa","Thanks, Dan. Karen, let's open it up to questions for the next 20 minutes or so. In order to enable us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. Karen, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll go to Bob Hopkins, Bank of America, please go ahead.","Robert Hopkins","Thanks. I appreciate you taking the question. So two quick things. First, I heard a litigation update there on mesh, and I was wondering I might have missed the numbers. I\u2019m just curious how many cases did that settlement represent? And then how many cases remain outstanding?","Mike Mahoney","Thanks, Bob. What it represents is 2,970 cases that the conditional settlement will cover.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to Mike Weinstein, JPMorgan, please go ahead.","Michael Weinstein","Wow, I hope I can get in my one question. So I\u2019ll ask maybe two questions before she cuts off. So first, could you just talk a little bit about the absorption of FX over the balance of the year and what are the offsets as you\u2019re absorbing the FX headwind? And then I think you gave a LOTUS commentary really for the first time, you talked about 31% sequential growth for LOTUS. I know they\u2019re small numbers still, but could you give us a sense of where revenues stand today? Thanks.","Dan Brennan","Sure, Mike. I\u2019ll take the FX question. So as I mentioned, the initial guidance we gave was $0.04 of FX headwind at the EPS line, and now we see that as $0.06 to $0.07. So don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s important. Our goal I still double-digit EPS growth, so we hold the EPS range at $0.88 to $0.92 and we\u2019ll look to make tradeoffs in other parts of the P&L to offset that and still deliver within the $0.88 to $0.92, because at the high end of that range at $0.92 that\u2019s still double digit for the year versus last year. So basically tradeoffs within the rest of the P&L.","Operator","David Lewis, Morgan Stanley --","Mike Mahoney","I\u2019ll just continue to comment just briefly on the LOTUS, we\u2019ll have quite a bit of time devoted to that on Friday during the Investor Day. At Investor Day we\u2019ll actually give targets for 2015 in our structural heart business as well as 2016. So we\u2019ll provide some more financial detail about an hour [ph] update there in terms of LOTUS. But overall, the program continues to build. We\u2019re enrolling our U.S. IDE trial REPRISE III. We expect to have the trial enrolled by year-end 2015 and we continue to gain share in accounts that we\u2019re selling in Europe. But we\u2019ll provide a more detailed update on Friday.","Operator","David Lewis, Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.","Susie Lisa","Karen?","Operator","Yes, ma\u2019am.","Susie Lisa","Yes, can you just allow them time for one follow-up question.","Operator","Sure. Ma\u2019am, I\u2019m sorry.","Susie Lisa","That\u2019s okay. Thank you.","David Lewis","Great. Thanks. Good morning. So two questions. I guess, Dan, the first one, you were just coming back to margins. Looking at the last two quarters, 200 basis points year-on-year in the fourth quarter, 250 basis points this quarter. I appreciate there\u2019s some currency in those numbers and hedging gains, but you appear to be tracking well in excess of the more than 100 basis points you need to get to 25% in '17. So, is that a fair estimation that based on the results of last six months, you certainly are tracking above expectations that would get you to 25% in '17?","Dan Brennan","Thanks, David. I think the way I\u2019d describe that is that we have good visibility to getting to that 25%. And we think last year, we ended at 20%, 20.2%. And then 2017 is the 25%, so we need to average more than 100 basis points per year in order to get to that 25% number in 2017. And obviously are very focused on doing that. We did raise the low end of the operating margin guidance range for the full year to 22%, from 21.5%. So now our guidance is 22% to 22.5% for this year. And feel like that\u2019s appropriate. Q2 should be a little bit lower, as I mentioned that. It should be between 21% and 22%. It\u2019s historically as it was last year, the lowest OI quarter in a particular year given a lot of incremental trade show and Congress spending with HRS and PCR and DDW and a bunch of others. So look for that to go down in Q2 and then feel comfortable with the 22% to 22.5% this year, and good visibility to the 25% in '17.","David Lewis","Okay. Mike, just a quick one for you. This is an interesting quarter because we saw multiple distribution deals out of the company; Brainlab, Bard, Frankenman. Are these all just one-off deals or is this a trend in terms of where you want to spend your time and money across different products, different regions, and is it related at all to how you think about your margin expansion goals over the next two to three years? Thank you.","Mike Mahoney","Yes. So we want to grow faster than the market and expand our margin throughout, double-digit EPS growth. And I think when you look at the rationale for many of those deals, it\u2019s really about driving category of leadership and being the preferred clinical partner to our physicians. So take the Brainlab example. So we have a terrific spinal cord stimulation business. We\u2019re very early with we think is a disruptive deep brain stimulation portfolio that we\u2019re enrolling the IDE trial now in the U.S. and we\u2019re approved in Europe. But we don\u2019t have as much scale in the neuro industry. So Brainlab has an excellent relationship with neurosurgeons. They have excellent guidance in mapping capabilities and so they will prove to be a smart distributor for us to align with to help build our commercial capabilities and broaden the depth of that portfolio. Similar with Bard, we have we believe the strongest portfolio in peripheral vascular. We recently acquired the Bayer division, atherectomy and thrombectomy and you saw the breakthrough results in our early results of our drug-eluting stent trial in terms of patency rates. But we feel that the Bard alliance is a great complement to that. It brings us into the U.S. sales capability now with the drug-eluting balloon. And so we really use these JVs to help fill in potential areas in the portfolio that maybe gaps as we continue to drive category of leadership.","Operator","Thank you. Rick Wise, Stifel, please go ahead.","Frederick Wise","Good morning, everybody. Maybe Dan, just to start with you, can you talk \u2013 can you break down, give us a little more color on the operating segment performance. Obviously, Cardiovascular outstanding sequentially year-over-year, Rhythm Management excellent year-over-year, a little lower sequentially; MedSurg a little weaker. I\u2019m not sure I understand the drivers behind each. Can you give us a little more there?","Dan Brennan","Sure. I think starting with the Rhythm Management one, I think that\u2019s what you\u2019ve seen over the last 12 to 18 months, and that\u2019s more than 100 basis points per quarter increases in Rhythm Management and again that\u2019s a huge focus for Joe Fitzgerald and the team there. So I think that\u2019s for Q1. It\u2019s in line with what you\u2019ve seen in terms of the activities that are driving that. CV obviously with the more than 600 basis points, that\u2019s a bit of an anomaly. That generally is in the mid to high 20s. So that\u2019s driven by a favorable product mix within IC, as you would expect. When drug-eluting stents do well and when overall the mix within IC does well, that drives more profitability within IC. I wouldn\u2019t expect to see 30.6 going forward. I\u2019d expect that to go back into the more traditional mid to high 20s. But obviously pleased to see that, given the mix that we had in the quarter. And the MedSurg, that\u2019s lower than you\u2019d expect to see at the 29. But overall, again, not a worry there. The growth was a little bit slower in urology at 3% and endoscopy at 4%. They drive \u2013 particularly endoscopy drives a significant amount of the profitability in the MedSurg franchise. As Mike and I both mentioned, we look for those numbers from a growth perspective to increase in Q2 and in the back half and that should take care of the MedSurg. I\u2019m not worried about the MedSurg profitability.","Frederick Wise","Okay. And Mike, just a strategic question building on David Lewis\u2019 question a little bit. You talked about tuck-in M&A as a priority. Obviously, you keep steadily adding to the portfolio in multiple ways. Can you just give us your latest thoughts on \u2013 I mean are you looking for tuck-in deals, are you looking for technology, are you looking for O-U.S. more than U.S.? How do we think about your priorities? Are you just being opportunistic?","Mike Mahoney","I think we\u2019re being pretty efficient. The performance of top line growth at 6 [ph], EPS growth ex-FX at 18 and strong margin improvement 250. And so really it goes back to the strategy of category leadership. And so we want to make sure the acquisitions we look at, it fits our strategic rationale and deliver strong financial returns. The AMS acquisition certainly meets this criteria in terms of nearly doubling the sales growth and ROIC that hits our targets at year three. And some of these alliances are a very cost effective way to extend our category leadership globally, whether it\u2019d be the Bard alliance that we talked about or Brainlab. The Frankenman JV, we\u2019re excited about it. It\u2019s our first JV into China. That business has been growing plus 25% and gives us stronger local capabilities that will build on our R&D and manufacturing capabilities, and we think it will accelerate the growth in endoscopy. So we\u2019re also very active in early private equity venture activity. So all these point towards either alliances, JVs or acquisitions that reinforce our category leadership goal and driving growth at or faster than market and driving margin improvement.","Operator","Thank you. Bruce Nudell, Credit Suisse, please go ahead.","Matthew Keeler","Hi, guys. This is Matt in for Bruce. Can you hear me okay?","Susie Lisa","Yes, Matt.","Mike Mahoney","Can hear you fine, Matt, yes.","Matthew Keeler","Great. So it looks like just on top line guidance, FX got worse. Excluding that, you raised the top in 15 million to 65 million, somewhere in there, and I wondered if you can comment on what\u2019s driving that, and specifically around what magnitude of sales you\u2019re expecting from these recent partnerships and acquisitions; Brainlab, Frankenman, Bard, Xlumena?","Mike Mahoney","We continue to see very strong growth in our core business. The majority of our business is growing faster than market based on recently approved pipeline. We had, as you know, the EMBLEM product in CRM recently approved. We\u2019ll launch that in a more meaningful way in second half of the year. So we expect to see strong uptick of that, the WATCHMAN approval; so very strong cadence of product approvals in our core business. We\u2019ll have synergy approved hopefully in fourth quarter in the U.S. And then consistent with our strat plan, we\u2019re moving into some new adjacencies. Our TAVR portfolio is beginning to pick up, increased traction in Europe and we continue to strengthen our EP business. As Dan talked about, we\u2019re not quite there yet but we did 6% in the quarter in EP and we\u2019re beginning to build capabilities in mapping and make some advances in our therapeutic catheter line. So we kind of walked through all of the businesses, but essentially we\u2019re pleased that in most of our business we continue to grow faster than market based on innovation and strong commercial performance. And many of our exciting pipeline therapies will be discussed this Friday and that gives us quite a bit of confidence as we look out over the longer term period, the strat plan.","Matthew Keeler","Thanks. And just one follow up on the S-ICD. You\u2019ve talked in the past about commercial coverage. Can you remind us sort of how far along you are there and are you kind of \u2013 when you get to 100% or as close to that as you expect to end up?","Dan Brennan","I\u2019m not sure you ever get to 100%, Matt. We\u2019ve had some good wins as we exited 2014 and into the first quarter of '15, so feel like that\u2019s becoming less of a headwind on that relative to the S-ICD.","Operator","Thank you. Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo, please go ahead.","Larry Biegelsen","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just two numbers that you normally give us, I didn\u2019t see in the release, U.S. DES growth and emerging market growth this quarter. And I had a follow up.","Dan Brennan","Larry, this is Dan. So on the DES, I think that\u2019s a trend for us just from a competitive perspective and the fact that we\u2019re obviously a lot more diversified than we were when we started that process many, many years, I think we\u2019ll give the global number and then potentially some growth rates, but not the specific numbers similar to some of our competitors on the DES front.","Larry Biegelsen","So no U.S. DES growth, Dan?","Dan Brennan","We did give \u2013 we said it was low double digit, I believe \u2013 in double digits.","Larry Biegelsen","That\u2019s U.S.?","Dan Brennan","That was O-U.S.","Larry Biegelsen","Got it, all right. And then emerging markets, Dan?","Dan Brennan","We didn\u2019t give the specific emerging markets. I know Mike quoted a couple of specifics within countries with China in the mid 20s, but nothing specific.","Mike Mahoney","I did say it was 7% global DES growth and very balanced across the regions.","Larry Biegelsen","All right, that\u2019s helpful. And then for my follow up, I\u2019m trying to understand what\u2019s in the guidance, Dan. So you did 5% organic this quarter by my math and my math might be wrong. We have 2% to 4% organic for the second quarter and I guess what is the full year organic growth \u2013 what\u2019s included for acquisitions? Is AMS in that new number or is that excluding AMS? And if it includes AMS, it looks like the organic growth rate that\u2019s implied for Q2 and for full year 2015, I recognize AMS isn\u2019t expected to close until the third quarter would be below the 5% that you did this quarter. So maybe if you could kind of just bridge what\u2019s in the guidance and what your kind of organic growth expectations are, that would be helpful. Thanks.","Dan Brennan","The easy one is we don\u2019t include AMS until that acquisition closes. So that is out of our guidance going forward until that acquisition would close. As you think of the rest of the year, particularly as you get into Q3 and Q4, there are some much more challenging comps particularly in IC. So we grew overall as a company. Operationally we grew 7% in Q3 and 7% in Q4. So the comps get a little more difficult as we get into the back half of the year, so feel like that 4% to 6% operational growth which would be 3% to 5% for the full year is a good number for organic growth.","Mike Mahoney","3% to 5%, that\u2019s fair.","Dan Brennan","Yes, 3% to 5% organic, which we describe as excluding the acquisition \u2013 excluding Bayer would be 3% to 5% and operational 4% to 6% for the full year.","Operator","Thank you. Bob Hopkins, Bank of America, please go ahead.","Robert Hopkins","Sorry about that. So just the one follow up I wanted to ask was on the endo business. Obviously, that\u2019s been a very consistent grower for you guys. It was maybe slightly below what we were looking for this quarter, so maybe just some commentary this quarter. And much more importantly, some commentary on do you think that this is a business that can sustain at least mid-single digit growth, so just some comments on this division. Thank you.","Mike Mahoney","It\u2019s Mike. We have a lot of confidence in the endoscopy business. Dave will highlight it for about 20 minutes on Friday. So last year, we grew 5%. First quarter, we\u2019re down a little bit, 4%. We have a number of new product launches that just really are in process right now with the digital SPYGLASS being the primary one, which is beginning to ramp up in terms of its deliverability. And also some launches that Dave will discuss in the second half. So we have quite a bit of confidence that our endoscopy business will continue to be a strong mid-single digit grower and continue to drive operating margin improvement potentially with some upside in the emerging markets with the Xlumena acquisition and the Frankenman JV.","Robert Hopkins","Great. We\u2019ll see you Friday.","Mike Mahoney","Thanks, Bob.","Susie Lisa","Karen, we\u2019ll take two more please.","Operator","Brooks West, Piper Jaffray, please go ahead.","Brooks West","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two quick ones from me. Dan, you said AMS wasn\u2019t in the guidance. If we did want to add that to our numbers, you talked about a Q3 close. Should we just go ahead and throw in a one quarter of revenue for that business, about the scale you\u2019ve described it or any guidance there would be helpful? And then I\u2019m hoping you can help us a little bit with how to think about the U.S. WATCHMAN launch and how that might contribute in the second half. Thanks.","Dan Brennan","Sure. I\u2019ll take the first one. On AMS, it\u2019s roughly 100 million a quarter, so that\u2019s \u2013 and divide that by the months. And whenever we were to close \u2013 whatever your assumption is for closed, just add that in.","Brooks West","Great. And then anything incremental you can help us with how to think about the U.S. WATCHMAN launch?","Mike Mahoney","We\u2019ll spend some time on it Friday. We\u2019re focused on our current 50 sites that did the original IDE trial and we\u2019re opening those sites up again with the training programs. We\u2019ve built up a significant capability with our training and proctoring and we\u2019ll be reopening those sites beginning this quarter in the second half. And then after those first 50 sites are kind of reengaged, we\u2019ll open up 50 new centers. So we have quite tremendous interest in the portfolio and the platform amongst electro-physiologists and interventional cardiologists. A lot of backlog patients that are waiting for it. So hopefully by the end of the year, we anticipate about 100 sites will be up and running with WATCHMAN. And then we see a market opportunity of about 400 sites over the next few years as we continue to develop and open up new centers.","Brooks West","That\u2019s perfect. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Lastly, we\u2019ll go to the line of Jayson Bedford, Raymond James & Associates, please go ahead.","Jayson Bedford","Thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask about the peripheral segment. Growth accelerated nicely from back half '14 levels even if we exclude Bayer. It seems like the rollout of \u2013 or the broader rollout of drug-coated balloons didn\u2019t have much of an impact on the quarter. So I guess first, is that fair? And then second, did the Bard agreement help out at all in the quarter? Thanks.","Mike Mahoney","The Bard agreement is early, so we haven\u2019t seen \u2013 we\u2019ll see more benefit of the Bard deal kind of the back half, if you will, of second quarter and really in the second half of 2015. So really just beginning of tying down the loose ends of that agreement and we\u2019re excited about that, but we didn\u2019t see any impact of the Bard agreement in the first quarter. And the overall PI business, we\u2019re excited about that, because the Bayer integration is going quite well. We\u2019ve done the commercial integrations between the team and so we\u2019re excited about the second half opportunities with our PI business given the portfolio, and very encouraged longer term as you look at the new Eluvia data that was highlighted this morning.","Dan Brennan","And encouraged with the 9% -- this is Dan, the 9% in the quarter for the Bayer business, because one of the reasons we acquired that business was to get into the fast growing atherectomy segment and to get a leadership position in a thrombectomy market. And with the integration ongoing and seeing that 9% overall growth for PI in the Bayer segment, that was nice to see as well.","Susie Lisa","Karen, we\u2019ll take just one more please and then conclude.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go to Kristen Stewart, Deutsche Bank, please go ahead.","Kristen Stewart","Hi. Thanks so much for allowing me in last moment. I couldn\u2019t resist but ask Dan a tax question. No, I\u2019m just kidding. Mike I was wondering if you could just talk very high level just with some of the dynamics that we\u2019re seeing from an M&A perspective with Cardinal buying the Cordis business. I\u2019m sure you know Don quite well from the J&J days and just thinking out strategically and kind of what their strategy is from a PPI perspective, how do you view that, if at all, any risk to the base interventional cardiology business, excluding obviously stents?","Mike Mahoney","Yes, so we\u2019ve been competing with Cordis for a number of years. About 70% plus of their business is outside the U.S. And we\u2019ve invested a lot in our interventional cardiology and structural heart and our peripheral business to drive category leadership. We have quite a bit of momentum. And so we\u2019re comfortable on a couple fronts. We\u2019re comfortable but we\u2019re certainly always pushing to grow harder. One is I think we have some highly clinically differentiated platforms with structural heart, with synergy, with atherectomy and thrombectomy and our drug-eluting capabilities. So we think we have very unique innovation there. At the same time, the more commoditized products which is where really Cordis was, are very good, extremely low cost, very excellent manufacturing processes for those capabilities. So, many of those product lines are already commoditized today, many of those products aren\u2019t driving the growth of the business and we manufactured them at great scale at very strong margins. So we always want to be mindful of new competitors but we continue to invest in not only innovation but also in lean best practices and efficiencies to ensure that we can manage some of the pricing challenges that we typically run into.","Kristen Stewart","Okay. Perfect. And then just I guess for clarification purposes on Friday, I know you mentioned in some instances you\u2019d be giving some aspirational goals for 2015 and 2016 for products. Can you just maybe give us an outline of what to expect? Will you be updating your longer term goals beyond 2017 or just kind of going through product by product and giving kind of the 2015 and '16 outlooks?","Dan Brennan","I think that will give you a reason to come, Kristen. Yes, I wouldn\u2019t want to tell you all the things that we\u2019ll show but good opportunity for people to come on Friday and hear what we have to say.","Kristen Stewart","All right. Well, I\u2019m coming irrespective. See you on Friday.","Dan Brennan","Okay. Thanks.","Susie Lisa","All right. With that, we\u2019d like to conclude the call. We look forward to seeing many of you on Friday and thanks for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Boston Scientific.

Welcome to the Boston Scientific Q1 2017 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. Your hosting speaker, Susie Lisa. Please go ahead.","Susan Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thanks, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q1 2017 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We've posted a copy of that release, as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call, to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financial Information.","The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Mike will provide strategic and revenue highlights of Q1 2017. Dan will review the financials for the quarter and then provide Q2 2017 and full-year 2017 guidance. And then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Ian Meredith and Dr. Ken Stein.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, organic revenue growth is defined as excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and sales from the acquisition of EndoChoice over the relevant prior-year period. Also note, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like: anticipate, expect, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share, new product approvals and launches, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance, including sales, margins, earnings and other Q2 and full-year 2017 guidance, as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses.","Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them.","At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thank you, Susie. Good morning, everyone. After an outstanding 2016, Boston Scientific continued its strong momentum and began 2017 with another quarter of strong results. I'm proud to report that team delivered our sixth straight quarter of 10% or greater operational revenue growth, with first quarter 2017 sales up 10.3% on an organic basis this 9.4% revenue growth represents another quarter of outstanding growth across our various businesses and regions.","At the same time, we continue to invest in meaningful innovation to build out our category leadership across all businesses and drive double-digit adjusted EPS growth over the long term. Also, we're able to meet our commitments and deliver adjusted EPS of $0.29, which is within our guidance range, despite $0.03 of a one-time EPS hit from inventory charges related to LOTUS field action as well as losses incurred before we discontinued sales of the acquired EndoChoice FUSE System.","Adjusted EPS grew 9% year-over-year, excluding the $0.02 negative impact of FX, which came in as expected. If we were to exclude both the FX and one-time inventory charges, adjusted EPS would have grown 18% versus prior year.","Our strategy of category leadership in key markets and diversification into high-growth adjacencies continues to work, as we are delivering consistent above-market growth. In parallel, we continue to invest in new, innovative platforms via our internal programs, like M&A. The Symetis structural heart acquisition we just announced last month. We believe Boston Scientific continues to be uniquely positioned to drive shareholder value due to our strong growth profile, significant opportunity to improve operating margins and our track record of consistently delivering double-digit adjusted EPS growth.","We're excited about 2017 and our plans to build upon our global momentum and drive sustainable long-term growth. We also raised in the low end of our full-year 2017 operational revenue growth guidance from 5% to 7% to 6% to 7%, which includes an approximate 70 basis point contribution from the EndoChoice acquisition, consistent with our expectations coming into the year. Despite the LOTUS inventory charge and FUSE costs that clipped $0.03 of EPS in Q1, there is no change to our full-year adjusted EPS guidance of $1.22 to $1.26. And this represents 10% to 13% earnings growth and includes an expected $0.08 negative impact, or approximate 700 basis point headwind from foreign exchange.","I'll now provide some quick highlights of first quarter of 2017 results and thoughts on our full-year 2017 outlook. In my remarks, all references to growth are on an organic year-over-year constant-currency basis unless otherwise specified. Our first quarter revenue growth of 9% was once again broad based across businesses and regions, with strong execution by global teams.","Most of our businesses continued to post consistent organic revenue growth that is faster than the market, with MedSurg growing 12%, Cardiovascular 8%, and Rhythm Management 8%. We also delivered strong balance growth across geographies, led by 11% revenue growth in the U.S., 8% in EMEA, and 7% in Europe. Now, while emerging market revenue growth slowed 12% due to several factors, our businesses in China turned in another great quarter of 20% growth and we remain bullish on our emerging markets outlook, both in the near and long term.","Turning to MedSurg. The MedSurg businesses delivered organic growth of 12% in the first quarter of 2017 and 15% including EndoChoice. In Endo, we posted 9% organic growth in first quarter and 14% including EndoChoice. Endo growth is fueled by the strength of our franchise in hemostasis, pathology and imaging, to name a few. And the EndoChoice acquisition closed late in November of 2016, and we're pleased with the early results. We pursued strategic alternatives for the FUSE business that was acquired with EndoChoice and ultimately decided to discontinue sales of the FUSE System in mid-March.","In other commercial milestones during the quarter, our Frankenman joint venture shipped its first locally sourced endoscopy product for the Chinese market. We began a collaboration with Northgate to jointly commercialize products to treat gallstones in conjunction with our SpyGlass platform.","Our urology and pelvic health business continued the strong performance, growing at 15% in first quarter, led by sales of products for men's health, kidney stones and pelvic floor. Emerging market sales in urology and pelvic health were very strong, and ongoing launch of LithoVue continues to go extremely well. LithoVue is now in over 700 accounts worldwide and provides single-use digital visualization and navigation capabilities to diagnose and treat stones and other conditions of the kidney ureter, while avoiding the need for repairs or sterilization that can be a challenge for reusable scopes. We look forward to the presentation of additional clinical and cost effectiveness evidence supporting LithoVue at the AUA Annual Meeting next month.","In neuromodulation, revenue grew 17% in first quarter, led by strong growth in the U.S. and the international markets. U.S. growth rates of the patients trialing our spinal cord stim technology remains solid and European uptake of our Vercise Deep Brain Stimulation System has been very promising. We continue to expect to launch in the U.S. DBS market by year-end 2017.","Our cardiovascular groups grew 8% in the first quarter of 2017 against tough double-digit comps in first quarter of 2016. Peripheral interventions grew 7% in the quarter, led by sales of our stent portfolio, Drug-Eluting Eluvia Stents, WALLSTENTs, and next-gen SFA Innova Stent. AngioJet Ultra Thrombectomy device used to treat deep vein thrombosis also grew nicely in the quarter.","Importantly, in Drug-Eluting technologies, we executed upon two key clinical milestones in the quarter. First, we completed enrollment for the IMPERIAL IDE for our Eluvia Drug-Eluting Stent. And secondly, we began enrollment in the IDE for our Ranger drug-coated balloon. And just this week on Tuesday, we presented 12-month results for a Ranger DCB first-in-human trial at the Charing Cross Meeting, with a compelling 12-month primary patency rate of 86% and 91% freedom from TLR.","Our Interventional Cardiology business continued its above-market growth trend, delivering 8% growth in the quarter. IC growth was led worldwide by continued strength in Drug-Eluting Stents, PCI Guidance, complex PCI and structural heart. And despite a 13% year-over-year comparison, Global DES sales grew low-single digits globally in the quarter, led by our differentiated SYNERGY platform.","PCI Guidance grew double digits, with particular strength in IVUS, and we're encouraged by customer response to our COMET wire and fractional flow reserve platform. IC performance was also fueled by our Structural Heart business, which includes the LOTUS aortic valve and WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure device. It is expected to contribute approximately $250 million of revenue in 2017. Importantly, our LOTUS remediation work remains on track, and we are reiterating our guidance for a fourth quarter 2017 return to the European market and submission of our U.S. PMA, as well as an estimated mid-2018 U.S. launch. We look forward to presenting REPRISE III pivotal study results at EuroPCR in just two weeks. And we will present RESPOND extension data on LOTUS with Depth Guard, which we expect will provide insight into further reducing LOTUS pacemaker rates.","We also remain on track to close the Symetis acquisition by the end of this quarter. We're extremely excited to add this highly innovative and complementary valve to LOTUS and provide a broader TAVR portfolio for varying physician and patient needs. We truly believe that our company will be uniquely and ideally positioned to address the needs of both TAVR physicians and patients with this comprehensive portfolio offering.","The WATCHMAN program also had a strong quarter. It continues to build global momentum. We ended 2016 with more than 200 U.S. WATCHMAN centers and expect to close 2017 with approximately 350 centers. We also achieved two important clinical milestones with WATCHMAN. First, we enrolled our first patients in both ASAP-TOO, the study examining the use of WATCHMAN in warfarin-ineligible patients, and in SALUTE, a trial specifically designed to pursue regulatory approval in Japan. So, overall, we're pleased with our progress in Structural Heart. And please join us for an update and webcast on our Structural Heart programs at EuroPCR on May 16 at 10:00 AM Eastern.","Shifting to Rhythm Management. Global CRM sales grew well above market, at 8%, with Brady up over 20% and Tachy delivering low-single digit global growth. This strength reflects continued share gains with our ACCOLADE MRI Brady platform, strong global growth in EMBLEM S-ICD and promising early uptake of our new RESONATE platform in Europe. The RESONATE family of ICDs and CRT-Ds now launching in Europe brings multi-site pacing \u2013 multi-point pacing to our CRT products, as well as updated best-in-class longevity labeling via our EnduraLife Batteries across all families of high-voltage devices.","The RESONATE platform also offers compatibility with the first and only validated heart failure predictive diagnostic in HeartLogic. And while the battery longevity of our competitors' products often limit physician appetite for program multi-point pacing due to the associated battery drain, we have seen strong early European adoption in our RESONATE launch, as patients can benefit from the programming right at implantation given our superior longevity capability.","Turning to Electrophysiology. We grew sales 9% in the quarter, led by improved uptake of our new RHYTHMIA HDx platform. We continue to rollout the HDx platform in Europe and expect to launch in the U.S. late second quarter. Initially, we're continuing to expand the toolkit that supports RHYTHMIA, providing ablation technologies that match the excellence of our Mapping System, and adding tools that expand the reach and utility of RHYTHMIA in different procedure types.","Finally, I'd also like to point out the significant gross margin drop-through in Rhythm Management from the sales upside, with a 530 basis point year-over-year improvement in adjusted operating margin for the Rhythm Management segment. Also, please join us for an update and webcast on our Rhythm Management programs at HRS on May 11 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern.","And finally, before turning the call over to Dan, I want to thank our employees for their winning spirit and commitment to Advancing Science for Life. Dan will now provide a detailed review of our financials.","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thanks, Mike. First quarter consolidated reported revenue of $2.160 billion represents 10% growth on both an operational and reported basis. The contributions from the EndoChoice acquisition was approximately 90 basis points, which was higher than our guidance of 70 basis points as a result of over-performance of the pathology business.","Even adjusting for this additional contribution from EndoChoice, we nicely exceeded our revenue growth guidance range of 6% to 8%. This strong top line also reflects a $7 million headwind from foreign exchange, which is $13 million, or approximately 65 basis points less than the $20 million headwind expected at the time of guidance.","We delivered Q1 adjusted earnings per share of $0.29, representing 3% year-over-year growth and at the low end of our guidance range of $0.29 to $0.31. Importantly, this includes approximately $0.03 of charges related to our LOTUS Valve System voluntary field action and net operating losses related to the FUSE business. Excluding these $0.03 of inventory and other charges, we would have otherwise been at or above the high end of our guidance range. And I'll provide more details on the charges shortly.","Adjusted gross margin for the first quarter was 70.6% compared to 72.3% in Q1 last year, and includes a year-over-year negative 140 basis point impact from foreign exchange. As a result of the global voluntary recall of the LOTUS Valve System initiated in February, we recorded inventory-related and other charges in the first quarter. In addition, while we pursued strategic alternatives for the FUSE business acquired with the EndoChoice acquisition, we incurred net operating losses associated with FUSE until we chose to discontinue all FUSE System sales in mid-March.","These two items negatively impacted the gross margin line by approximately 180 basis points in the first quarter. Absent these charges, gross margin would have been nearly at the midpoint of our guidance range, despite the higher than expected FX headwind. We continue to implement the identified solution to fix the manufacturing process related to the LOTUS Valve deployment pin, which includes a combination of minor process and specification changes.","We believe we are on track to re-enter the European market and submit our U.S. PMA in the fourth quarter of this year. As you would expect, the field action will create negative absorption headwinds in our gross margin, but we plan to offset the impact going forward and now expect our full-year gross margin to be in the range of 72% to 72.5% as a result of the LOTUS and FUSE drags this quarter. This guidance range now assumes a negative FX impact of 90 basis points for the full year.","Adjusted SG&A expenses were $780 million or 36.1% of sales in Q1, up 60 basis points year-over-year. Recall that in Q1 of 2016, our SG&A rate of 35.5% of sales was lower than the remainder of 2016, as the medical device excise tax was suspended and we had not yet begun to reinvest it fully in Q1. Although we spent the entire amount of the benefit in 2016, the majority of that reinvestment took place in Q2 through Q4. As a result, the low Q1 2016 SG&A rate reflected essentially a timing benefit of delayed reinvestment spend and operating margin rates thus benefited.","In the quarter, our SG&A includes additional commissions as a result of the strong sales performance, accelerated levels of investment for the U.S. DBS launch planned for the end of the year, investments in our Structural Heart commercial capabilities and slightly higher than planned litigation charges, among other factors.","Though we're not pleased with our SG&A rate of 36.1% for the quarter, we expect the rate to decline over the course of the year as we continue to realize the benefit of our targeted initiatives focused on reducing SG&A and make progress on our margin expansion targets. As a result, we continue to expect our full-year 2017 adjusted SG&A rate to be in a range of 35% to 36%, which at the midpoint would represent a decrease of 60 basis points versus the full year 2016.","Adjusted research and development expenses were $232 million in the first quarter or 10.8% of sales, which is roughly flat year-over-year. We now expect full-year adjusted R&D in a range of 10% to 11%. Royalty expense was 0.8% of sales in Q1, down slightly from 1% in the first quarter of last year. We expect our royalty rate to remain at approximately 1% of sales for 2017.","Q1 2017 adjusted operating margin of 23% decreased 210 basis points year-over-year and was below our guidance range of 25% to 26% due primarily to the 190 basis points of charges recorded in connection with the LOTUS Valve System voluntary field action and FUSE business, as well the pattern of medical device excise tax reinvestment in 2016 that I mentioned.","We do not expect any additional charges related to the LOTUS field action, and the losses incurred in Q1 2017 for the FUSE business will not recur going forward. Excluding these charges, operating margin would have been 24.9%. And if we had delivered at the mid-point of our SG&A guidance range, adjusted operating margin would have been at the mid-point of our guidance range.","Now turning to segment operating margin results. The Rhythm Management team delivered an adjusted operating margin of 18.8% for Q1. This represents a very strong year-over-year adjusted operating margin increase of 530 basis points. Note, this comparison is to restated segment margins due to changes in our constant currency reporting. To give you more detail on this restatement, we use an internally derived standard currency exchange rate for our constant currency sales and reporting segment results. This standard FX approach is designed to give a more consistent long-term view of results.","Given the recent periods of volatile exchange rate fluctuations, we've seen larger differences between these internal standard FX rates and the actual foreign exchange rates. As a result, we updated our internally derived standard currency exchange rates beginning on January 1, 2017 to align more closely with current actual rates. While this update obviously does not impact total company margins, it does impact our segment margins results, as the process basically reallocates FX impacts away from our corporate expenses and currency exchange line and into the operating income allocated to the reportable segments.","Operationally, the Rhythm Management team continues to make strong progress on gross margin, focus on expense control and leverage the improved top-line performance of the global business, as evidenced by the more than 500 basis point improvement year-over-year this quarter. The rate of improvement for Rhythm Management for the full year 2017 remains unchanged, as we continue to look to add over 200 basis points to the segment's adjusted operating margin with a restated full-year adjusted operating margin target of 18%.","Operational improvements in the Cardiovascular segment adjusted operating margin were more than offset by the LOTUS-related charges in the first quarter, for a net decrease of 340 basis points year-over-year. For MedSurg, the adjusted operating margin decreased over prior year by 90 basis points, driven by the FUSE net operating losses and forward investments as we prepare for our expected U.S. deep brain stimulation launch at the end of the year.","Now I'll move on to other income and expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $57 million, roughly flat to Q1 of last year. Our average interest expense rate was 4% in Q1 of this year compared to 3.9% in Q1 of last year. In January, we used our existing credit facilities to refinance the $250 million of our senior notes due in January 2017, and we have no remaining debt obligations for 2017. Other expense was $2 million in the first quarter.","Our tax rate for the first quarter was 4.9% on a reported basis and 9.2% on an adjusted basis. In the quarter, we recorded an income tax benefit of $28 million related to the adoption of the new stock compensation accounting standard, which was a greater benefit than previously anticipated due to the upward movement of our stock price. We expect this benefit represents the majority of excess tax benefit in 2017 due to the annual vesting of our awards during the first quarter.","We're now expecting a 175 basis point benefit to our full-year effective tax rate from the change in stock compensation accounting, which is 50 basis points greater than previously anticipated. Excluding this benefit, we still expect our operational tax rate to be approximately 14%, but given the 50 basis point favorability from the change in stock compensation accounting, we now expect the full-year adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 12.5% to 13%.","Finally, Q1 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $0.29 includes approximately $0.02 of unfavorable foreign exchange and represents 3% year-over-year growth, or 9% growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This $0.29 also includes the approximate $0.03 of charges related to our LOTUS Valve System voluntary field action and FUSE net operating losses. On a reported GAAP basis, which includes net charges and amortization expense totaling $107 million after tax, Q1 2017 EPS was $0.21.","Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $171 million compared to $250 million in Q1 last year.","In the quarter, we used cash primarily to fund previously agreed upon legal settlements as well as business development activities. And as of March 31, 2017, we had cash on hand of $156 million. Capital expenditures for the first quarter totaled $112 million, as we execute on our plans to make additional investments in SYNERGY manufacturing equipment due to higher volumes as well as campus consolidation and plant network optimization activities. We continue to expect capital expenditures for the full year to be approximately $300 million.","In addition, during the quarter, we continued working through the mesh litigation-related settlement evaluation process and have reached conditional, final or near-final settlement now on over 37,000 of our approximately 43,000 known claims. Having now settled or reached agreement in principle with over three quarters of all outstanding claims, we continue to reduce the risk on our balance sheet and are targeting a resolution of the majority of our remaining mesh claims in 2018. Our total legal reserve, of which mesh is included, was $1.751 billion as of March 31, 2017.","We ended Q1 with 1.390 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding and we expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.390 billion for Q2 and 1.392 billion for the full year 2017.","I'll now walk through the guidance for Q2 and the full year 2017. For the full year, we now expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $8.800 billion to $8.900 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 6% to 7% on an operational basis, including an approximately 70 basis point contribution from EndoChoice, and 5% to 6% on a reported basis.","We expect foreign exchange to be a headwind of approximately $85 million for the full year 2017. We continue to expect full-year 2017 adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.22 to $1.26, representing 10% to 13% adjusted earnings growth and continue to assume the full-year negative impact of FX will be approximately $0.08. On a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share to be in a range of $0.81 to $0.86.","Now turning to Q2 2017. We expect consolidated revenue to be in a range of $2.185 billion to $2.215 billion. This represents year-over-year growth in a range of 5% to 6% operationally, including the approximate 70 basis point contribution from EndoChoice. We expect the foreign exchange impact on Q2 revenue to be a $35 million headwind.","For the second quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.30 to $0.32 per share, representing 11% to 18% adjusted earnings growth. GAAP earnings per share for the second quarter is expected to be in a range of $0.18 to $0.21 per share.","Please check our Investor Relations website for Q1 2017 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q1 results, as well as Q2 and full-year 2017 guidance, including P&L line item guidance.","So, with that, I'll turn it back to Susie, who will moderate the Q&A.","Susan Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thanks, Dan. Kevin, let's open it up for the next 30 minutes or so. Please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. First question. David Lewis, Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Good morning. Congrats on, again, great revenue performance. Mike, just a quick question for you and then a follow-up for Dan. So, Mike, just wondered if you could focus this morning on the two businesses which saw the greatest acceleration from our model, and those basically were U.S. Interventional and Endoscopy. Why don't you just talk about the factors underpinning that performance and the sustainability across the balance of the year?","And then, Dan, for you, I think you did a great job talking about these factors impacting first quarter margins. But could you talk just about second quarter gross margin trends, just to give people some confidence that the margin plan is back on track here as we get to the second quarter and beyond post-LOTUS? Thanks so much. Nice quarter.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thanks, Dave. Good morning. Just broadly on interventional cardiology and then I'll touch on endo. We've discussed at a few different Investor Days, and Kevin Ballinger, just our overall goal of continuing to diversify and strengthen in the faster growth markets in the Interventional Cardiology business. We've already seen the benefit of that with our DES business continuing to grow faster than market despite very difficult comps, the broadening and further impact of our complex coronary IVUS and FFR business.","And then the third leg of the stool there in cardiology is our Structural Heart, where we remain on track to deliver the $250 million this year, really fueled by WATCHMAN, given the impact of the LOTUS recall. And we look forward to getting that product back in the market. So really that stronger balance of businesses within that Cardiology business are leading us to markets that we view in a combined basis are quite healthy, and we're growing faster than the market across those areas.","So we do have some tough comps coming up with DES for the remainder of the year, but we continue to believe the competitive positioning in DES is really a strength of us, given some of the challenges we're seeing with others in the marketplace. And we expect to continue to grow there while growing WATCHMAN, our complex bag as well as getting LOTUS back on the market. And we're excited to close the Symetis deal hopefully in June.","On Endo, that business continues to really deliver excellent performance. You'll be excited to see at the Investor Day the strategy to broaden that business out into exciting new adjacencies going forward. But, again, a strong growth market. We're taking share, led by SpyGlass. The EndoChoice acquisition is working well, moving us into pathology. Strong growth in the emerging markets. And really again just a strong cadence of products with our Resolution hemostasis capabilities, as well as our EUS Endoscopic Ultrasound. So the portfolio and expansion into global markets continues to fuel our Endo business.","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Sure. David. And on your Q2 gross margin question, it's really pretty straight forward. Q1 gross margin was 70.6%. And at the midpoint of Q2 guidance, we'd be at 72.5%. The delta there is 190 basis points. And really the elimination of the LOTUS and FUSE charges of 180 basis points gets you right to the midpoint of where we should be in Q2. So, saw good operational improvements in Q1 that those should continue in Q2 and feel good about the guidance for Q2 in gross margin.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All right. Thanks, guys. Great quarter.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thanks, David.","Operator","All right. Next question is from the line of Michael Weinstein, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. And good morning. So let me just start on a couple of the (30:14) businesses. Endoscopy and Urology both had fantastic quarters. In both cases, the comps get harder from here. So can you just give us your view on sustainability of growth rates? So we're not necessarily talking about what you put up this quarter, but above-market growth rates we got used to in 2016. Thanks.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah. Good morning, Mike. Yeah, so we've taken up the full-year sales revenue guidance, as you know, 6% to 7%. So we pulled up the lower end there based on the strength of second quarter. Broadly across the company, we face 10% growth comp headwinds really for the next four quarters coming up, second quarter through first quarter 2018. But despite that, especially in Endo and Uro and across the board, one, first of all, these are strong markets, Endo and Uro, that are healthy. We have an excellent cadence of product launches, global expansion and acquisitions that are working quite well.","When you look at our Urology business, the acquisition of AMS has gone extremely well. We're ahead of our synergy plan. The standalone AMS business legacy business is growing about 8%, so much faster than it was as a standalone basis. And really what's really disruptive in our Urology business is our disposable scope platform. So we're seeing strong uptake with that. We're continuing to launch that globally and it pulls through our stone business.","Another big key growth driver for us in Urology is we've been underweight in the international markets historically. So we've been disproportionally investing in those markets. And that's really bearing lot of fruit. So we see continued momentum with our Uro business. We do have some tougher comps, but we expect to continue to grow faster than market.","And it's kind of the same story rewound in Endo. Good growth market. We do have some difficult comps, but our portfolio cadence is a quite strong. And, again, this business we're investing quite a bit in the emerging markets and it's paying off for us. So despite the tough comps, we expect to continue to grow faster than market in both those divisions.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Perfect. Let me ask this one question related to LOTUS. And that is, when LOTUS re-launches later this year, you're going to have a challenge of bringing that product back to market that's been off the market for six months. Can you just give us your thoughts on where you think the balance between the two settles out for you as you go to 2018? What do you think the respective positions are of those two products in Europe?","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah, so I'll make a comment and then I'll let Ian jump in. So the good news for us is our team in Europe \u2013 our TAVR team isn't on their hands in terms of the commercial team. They're helping out with WATCHMAN, they're helping out Cardiology. And hopefully if we close early second quarter here for Symetis, they'll begin selling that platform potentially in June, or June or July. So, we'll be back in the market in TAVR valves in Europe and then we'll follow that on with LOTUS starting in the fourth quarter. So pretty soon we'll be back in the game in TAVR.","And I think, Ian, I'll turn it over to you in terms of what you see as the mix there.","Ian Meredith, M.D., Ph.D. - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thanks, Mike. And good morning, Michael. I think that we'll see that the dedicated LOTUS users will quickly take up using LOTUS once again when it's available back in Europe because of its complete repositionability and safety. So, I suspect that the mix will vary from site to site depending on the patient populations and physician preferences. But it is likely that it'll be a 50\/50 mix, but it will vary from site to site.","Operator","Okay. Next question is from the line of Bob Hopkins, Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Can you hear me okay?","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yep. Can hear you fine, Bob.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Hey, good morning. And congrats on such strong results again. First of all, just a quick one for Dan and then a bigger picture question. For Dan, and I'm sorry if I missed this, but for the full year 2017, can you give us the sense as to what the earnings and margin impact will be for the LOTUS recall?","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Sure. So on operating margin in Q1, it's 190 basis points for the LOTUS and FUSE charges. And then you just basically divide that by four for the full year, so it's 45 basis points on the full year.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then from a bigger picture perspective, when we think about the upcoming data release here in a couple of weeks, I was wondering if, Ian, I could just get you to comment on a couple of things because there's been some discussion on previous calls on setting expectations for this trial, especially as it relates to stroke rates.","So if you could just sort of set the stage for us for REPRISE III and any issues that you think you should point out in terms of comparability or what we've seen in previously trials and, therefore, how should we putting these results in perspective, would be really helpful. So just any comments on the upcoming data in REPRISE III and how we should be thinking about the trial data, given what we've seen from previous data sets. Thank you.","Ian Meredith, M.D., Ph.D. - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thank you. It's a very good question. Obviously, we can't comment on the data release prior to presentation at EuroPCR. And that presentation, of course, will take place at 12:30 on the 16th of May. We sincerely hope that you tune in for that.","I think it's fair to comment on the trial, that it is the largest global randomized trial head-to-head platform of two TAVR devices with all the bells and whistles of a high-quality trial. So joint comparisons with other studies is probably not that wise. And I think we should wait for the data to fully understand what this dataset will mean.","I think we could comment on what we expect the pacemaker rate to be. As you know from previous trials, we have observed a higher pacemaker rate, and one would expect that this trial having been completed in December 2015, when you follow up to December 2016. Before we were fully aware of all of the drivers that determined pacemaker rate, one would expect that the pacemaker rate would be in some ways comparable to what we've seen previously.","Then with respect to all of the other variables, I think we have to actually weigh this trial on its merits, given that this is a large head-to-head comparison randomized on an even playing field.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thanks. Any follow-on questions there?","Ian Meredith, M.D., Ph.D. - Boston Scientific Corp.","Okay.","Operator","Next question is from Rick Wise, Stifel. Please go ahead.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everybody.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Hi, Rick.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","First, Dan, a question for you on SG&A. You very clearly called out some of the moving pieces, litigation, some investments. But I'm a little confused. You said you weren't pleased with SG&A even when you normalize. And you weren't pleased because of the higher investment, you weren't pleased because of the timing or the impact of the cost reduction programs. Just help us understand your thinking and some of the drivers of the better SG&A going forward? Thank you.","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Sure, Rick. Yeah, and I think you've delineated some of the reasons in Q1. I think the reason for the dissatisfaction is we missed the range. The range was 35% to 36%. We hit 36.1%. That doesn't add up to success from my perspective for that number in the quarter.","Now, the reasons are there. We're obviously happy to invest in USB brain stimulation. We needed to pay the extra commissions, all the factors that are there. And that number should come down over the rest of the year with the programs that we have in place. But the dissatisfaction comment is really just for the fact that, in the quarter, I would have liked to have rather seen that at the midpoint and it ended up a tick above the high end of the range.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And, Mike, just turning back to CRM side of things. Heart Rhythm Society is coming up. Maybe you or Dr. Meredith want to talk about some of the messages or key events there. But maybe you could talk specifically, Mike, about growth. I mean, you had amazing growth on the CRM side, pacer growth outlook. Now you're anniversarying that. RHYTHMIA seems set with the HDx next-gen launch to be a growth driver. But maybe talk us through some of these many moving pieces, and I'm just talking about a couple, that are going to sustain the kind of growth we're seeing? Or do you think it could accelerate? What are you focused on over the next six months, 12 months? Thank you.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thanks, Rick. And I'll have Dr. Stein comment on HRS. But just a couple of comments on CRM. Really proud of the team there. Continued another quarter of above-market growth globally, plus 8% in a challenging market. And really encouraged by a couple of points.","One, is our Brady platform continues to do extremely well. Based on the quality of that product, the deliverability, the quality of the lead. So excellent job in Brady. Defib continues to gain share. And really we're seeing a strong uptake continuing, especially in the international markets, with S-ICD, particularly in Japan. Excellent growth there. And we launched a new product called our RESONATE in Europe that is an excellent product that helps with the multipoint pacing capability, the extended battery longevity.","And also on top of that, what is a great proof point, and we talk about healthcare economics and so forth, the NICE recommendation that came out in the UK that really proves out the exceptional longevity benefits that we have in our ICD, CRT-D platforms, the cost savings that delivers and the patient impact supported by nine separate independent publications really shows the true economic benefit and the value of our CRM products. And I think that data is well respected and making its way around the world, which is helping us.","Dr. Stein, if you want to comment a bit on what's coming at HRS.","Kenneth Stein - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Mike. And, Rick, thanks for the question. A couple of data releases that I want to highlight for HRS. First, two late-breaking trial presentations. One is the first readout on data from our S-ICD post-approval study in the U.S. So that was an FDA-mandated trial of over 1,600 patients implanted with this system, post-commercialization. And we'll be presenting the acute safety data as well as a good look at the demographics of who is actually getting the device in the U.S. and their acute outcomes.","And then in addition, a WATCHMAN late-breaker which presents the one-year follow-up results of our EVOLUTION trial, which is large 1,000-patient prospective registry of WATCHMAN implantation in Europe. And I'd be remiss if I didn't also point out that we have a follow-on WATCHMAN late-breaker to that at EuroPCR, which focuses specifically on the warfarin contraindicated patients in that cohort. And that may be very helpful as you look towards what we think we're going to see in our randomized ACEP II trial.","The only other things that I'd point out a large number of abstracts from our EP group, looking at some of the newer technologies that we're evaluating for our ablation catheters and with RHYTHMIA and two more abstracts on our upcoming leadless pacemaker looking specifically at how it works in concert with the S-ICD.","Operator","And next question is from the line of Danielle Antalffy, Leerink. Please go ahead.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question and congrats on another great quarter. Wondering if you can update us on the regulatory timelines for the MRI-safe high-power devices and how we should think about the share shifts that should occur there once they do come to market. You've got a competitor that's supposed to be coming to market, but that's unclear given some of their regulatory issues. So just wondering how to think about that. You've been gaining share with the MRI-safe pacer. Should we see a similar type of shift when the high-power devices come to market?","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Good. I'll take it. And, Dr. Stein, please comment. We talked, Susie, fourth quarter this year?","Susan Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.","Year end.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Year end. Ideally by year end, approval of our MRI compatibility with our ICD, which really will be combined on the RESONATE platform, which is really meaningful because no you have multipoint pacing, extended battery longevity and the future MRI compatibility and also a diagnostics tool called HeartLogic. So it's really a differentiated platform for the long run for us. And also we anticipate, as we talked in the past, in 2018, we've seen a slight improvement in our replacement headwind in 2017, and we expect to see a bit more of it in 2018. So, overall, it's a tough market, but we continue to expect to grow faster than the market.","I don't know, Ken, if you have any additional comments?","Kenneth Stein - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Mike. I think I'd just reiterate what Mike said. We are on track according to that timeline that Mike gave you in terms of when we're anticipating approval. Obviously, we can't comment on when we think the competitor is going to get through their regulatory issues and get their approval.","Certainly on the pacing side, we've seen a very big impact and a very positive impact from our MRI labeling with the INGEVITY device there. One of the thing that's unique about our regulatory strategy on the high-voltage devices is this backwards compatibility, where we expect once we get labeling that it would not only be for the new generation devices, as Mike mentioned, RESONATE, but for the vast majority of devices that are currently being implanted in the U.S.","And I think as you look at what might happen once you get approval, it's important to recognize that already a good number of customers believe our backwards compatibility story and do believe that it is likely that, with approval, we'll have the backwards compatibility for the systems they're implanting today. We've been able to execute that strategy in Europe. We've executed that strategy in the U.S. with the EMBLEM S-ICD. So I think we have a lot of credibility when it comes to that.","Danielle J. Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. And then just one quick follow-up, if I could. We talked a lot about on the call the MedSurg, the growth, sustainability a little in cardiology. But just taking a step back and if you look across all the businesses, you've been growing above the market. Granted, comps get a little bit tougher over the course of the year. But, quite frankly, Q1 of last year was a tough comp as well across all of your businesses. And actually, comps for CRM are not as tough.","So I'm just curious, and I appreciate you raised the low end of the sales growth guidance range, but why can't you grow even faster? What do you have coming in the pipeline that could continue this growth momentum? Thanks so much.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Sure. We're certainly pleased with our performance for the last few years. And besides the top line, as we've noted multiple times, the continued opportunity to improve margins faster than our peers to combine it with the top-line growth. So we're pleased with the 6% to 7% guidance for the full year. It's faster than market and it does reflect the reality that we do have 10% growth comp headwinds for the next four quarters. So I think that's a prudent and reasonable guidance range to give, given that comparison headwind.","We do have some particular anniversary of some tough comps, particularly with SYNERGY, which will be 12% comps in 2016. So really that the bigger challenge is comps, and some comps with Interventional Cardiology. Plus, we're off the market in LOTUS until fourth quarter, so that's a bit of a headwind for us. But despite that, we're pleased with the 6% to 7% guidance.","And then moving forward, we have an Investor Day coming up in June. And I think you'll like that event. You'll see a strategy and a pipeline that will continue to drive revenue growth over the LRP time period faster than our peer group and OI improvement faster than the peer group. And so I think you'll be really comfortable with the strength of Boston Scientific over that LRP program. And consistent with the past, we continue to beat those LRP commitments we've done historically.","Operator","And next question is from the line of Chris Pasquale, Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks. First, just wanted to clarify. Does the updated guidance include Symetis? And, if so, what are you assuming for a revenue contribution this year?","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","It does not include Symetis. We wouldn't include that until the acquisition actually closes in Q2. So look for that to be post-close.","Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Perfect. And then Peripheral had another solid quarter, but the U.S. PCI business did slow a bit and continues to lag behind international. You highlighted the progress you made in the ELUVIA and Ranger clinical trials. Could you just remind us what you're thinking in terms of potential FDA approval timing for those products? And how do you sustain momentum in U.S. Peripheral while you wait for them to get here?","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Absolutely. So in Peripheral, we had a strong quarter overall at 7% growth. We had tough comp at 14% growth comp comparison for last year, but again grew at 7%. Stronger, as you pointed out, in the international markets, where we have our Ranger Balloon as well as the ELUVIA Stents, which is really providing some significant differentiation for us in capabilities there.","You saw the Ranger data just came out that we referenced. In terms of approval times for Ranger, we just enrolling that clinical trial just this quarter. And so we'll likely have FDA approval in 2020\/2021, so depends on the enrolment speed. In terms of ELUVIA, we expect that ideally the back half of 2019 or 2020.","Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","And next question is from the line of Vijay Kumar, Evercore. Please go ahead.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Hey, guys. Congratulations on a really nice quarter here. Just maybe, Dan, I had one on the guidance, the 2Q revenue guidance. And I had one follow-up for Mike.","I guess if you look at the second quarter organic revenue guidance, so we're looking at a 400 basis points sequential deceleration. I know that the comps are tougher. But apart from the comps and maybe LOTUS being pulled off, is there any else that we should be looking for the 2Q organic guidance?","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","No, Vijay. I think Mike covered that pretty well relative to the comps. So you think of Q1 we had an 8% comp for the total company, Q2 we have 10%, so that's 200 basis points right there. And then specific to some Q2 anniversarying launches from last year, the SYNERGY launch in U.S. branch in Japan was Q1 really last year. And then the CRM product launches in Quad and MRI-safe Brady were Q2 early and late. And then we also we had the Uro pelvic health share gains from a competitor exiting the market in Q2.","So really happy to be taking share there, and it's a very nice boost to the overall Urology business, but we anniversary that as well. So I think it stacks up pretty well overall when you look at that guidance for Q2 and for the full year. But it really is a story of comps. And I think we still have good momentum in the business.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Does that comp, I guess does it assume competition launching their own stents in second quarter?","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Does it assume what? Sorry.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Does it assume new competitive entrants within the stent market for the Q2 guidance?","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yes. We do see some competitive activity in USDS with some potential competitive launches.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. And then, Mike, one quick one for you. There's some speculation in the market on LOTUS when it comes to the PMA submission. And the debate is, what is the FDA's motivation to accept the PMA given the recall? Or would they ask for a small safety 30-day follow-up kind of study? I'm just curious, have you had this conversation with the FDA and can you confirm whether they've asked you for such a safety study or not? Thank you.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah, I'll turn it over to Dr. Meredith.","Ian Meredith, M.D., Ph.D. - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thanks, Mike. So we have a plan to discuss some of the FDA coming up. It is inappropriate to foreshadow what the FDA will actually require. But one suspects that there will be a small Pinnacle study required to confirm that the Pinnacle issue has been resolved. But it's unlikely that that study will be substantial.","Operator","Okay. Next question is from the line of Matt Taylor, Barclays. Please go ahead.","Ian Mahmud - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. This is Ian Mahmud on for Matt. Can you hear me okay?","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yep. Hear you fine.","Ian Mahmud - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Okay. Good morning.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Good morning.","Ian Mahmud - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So I just want to ask about WATCHMAN. And I know you've commented on some, but just on the trials you highlighted. Can you discuss what expanded label in the U.S. might mean for the market? Have you provided any guidance in terms of timing of those two trials?","Kenneth Stein - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah. I can take that, Mike, if you let me. So I think that there were sort of three different trials we highlighted here over the fall. I think probably the one that's the most interesting and the most direct to your question is the ASAP-TOO trial.","And so ASAP-TOO is a large, global, multi-center randomized trial looking specifically at the use of WATCHMAN in patients who are currently off-label in the U.S. And that is those who are deemed by their physicians to be ineligible for even short-term use of warfarin, which is required on a U.S. label post-implant. We've started enrollment in the trial. I don't think we can go any further publicly at this point in terms of when we expect that enrollment to complete. It is an adaptive trial design and so there is really a lot of play around when that trial might complete its primary endpoint.","In terms of the impact, really what that would do would be to bring our labeling in the U.S. to be consistent with our labeling in our CE Mark countries. So, our CE Mark labeling devices continues with both the warfarin-eligible and warfarin-ineligible patients. And, again, I can't get out ahead of the data, but I would point it to our EVOLUTION data releases coming up at HRS and at EuroPCR, where I think you can get a better look at the different characteristics of those two cohorts.","Ian Mahmud - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got you. Okay, helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Okay. Next question is from the line of Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. One on the quarter and one on Structural Heart. So you initially guided to I think 5.3% to 7.5% in Q1, and you did 10%. So my question is, what was better than expected, what drove that? I mean, that's pretty impressive upside.","And, second, Mike, big picture, do you still expect to accelerate in 2018 over the 5.3% to 6.3% I think organic guidance that you're giving for 2017? And I did have one follow-up.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thank you. Yeah. So we had a quarter that was quite strong. I would say, what surprised us, one, is that the performance of the MedSurg business was very strong. And that was, quite frankly, up more than we thought, given the strength of Neuromod business, Uro and Endo contributing 12% organic growth. So that that was a bit of a surprise to us, especially coming off what was a 11% comp for the whole sector first quarter 2016. So just terrific execution across all three of those businesses and global expansion. So that was a bit of a surprise.","The other one was we knew CRM and Rhythm Management was going to do well, but we weren't planned on them doing an 8%. So, kudos to that team. They just delivered excellent results. And they deserve to, because they have the best battery longevity and an excellent product. So that was a surprise for us to the positive.","And we're also really pleased with \u2013 very excited about the future with the Symetis acquisition in combination with LOTUS. And coming out of a meeting in California this week with a bunch of cardiologists, there is lot of enthusiasm for the unique capability of Symetis and LOTUS combined, and how to help treat patients and also to serve customers. So very bullish on that.","In terms of going forward, given the strong outlook that we provided, 6% to 7% for the full year, which is stronger than market, we'll clearly provide 2018 guidance in the future. And as I mentioned before, I think what you'll see at Investor Day is a company with a very clear strategy, with a deep pipeline that will continue to grow faster than market in our LRP period. And we've got a lot of room to improve margins, as you know, and deliver the EPS growth. So you'll see that Investor Day. And we'll continue to deliver on those three elements of our plan.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's very helpful. And then just for a follow-up for Mike or Ian. We haven't heard much regarding your strategy in either mitral or tricuspid. Do you have anything new to share in these fronts? How are you thinking about those two areas, given the recent doubling down with Symetis in the TAVR market? Thanks for taking the questions.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah, so we've clearly doubled down in TAVR given the strength of that market, the uniqueness of our products and the commercial capabilities that we have. So that's the bet that we've made is doubling down in what we think will be a $4 billion to $5 billion market in 2020. And we're clearly doubled down with our WATCHMAN platform. You're going to see more, not only the clinical trials that Ken outlined, but also more direct-to-patient marketing to continue to expand that marketplace.","We also, on the mitral and tricuspid area, we do have multiple minority equity bets in multiple companies. Quite frankly, we see that mitral opportunity as exciting, but much slower to develop versus the TAVR market, and a business that's likely more segmented out in terms of the number of devices to be acquired. So we like the market. We're going to continue to invest in it with our VC bets. But the primary focus is on TAVR and WATCHMAN.","Also trying to clarify on the PI side on the ELUVIA, we estimate that the FDA approval to be second half of 2019, potentially first quarter of 2020, but we estimate second half of 2019. And our Ranger, we haven't given any timing yet. We just started enrolling this quarter.","Susan Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thanks, Mike. With that, we would like to conclude the call.

[Operator Instructions] Also as a reminder, this teleconference is being recorded. And at this time, we will turn the conference call over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Michael Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Campbell","Thank you, Tony. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us.","With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Capello, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q1 results for 2013, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations to GAAP of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call, along with other supporting schedules, to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financial Information.","The duration of this morning's call will be approximately 1 hour. Mike will begin our prepared remarks with an update on our business progress and his perspectives on the quarter and for the remainder of 2013. Jeff will then review our Q1 financial results and business performance as well as Q2 and full year 2013 guidance. We will then open the call up to questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Jeff will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Dawkins and Dr. Stein.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate and other similar words. These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share; our market-to-market trends; our products, including product approvals, launches and performance; procedural volumes and pricing; regulatory filings; clinical trials and results; cost savings and growth opportunities and their expected impact; our cash flow and expected uses; our expected financial performance, including sales, margins, earnings and other guidance for Q2 and the full year 2013; tax rates and tax impact, R&D spend and other expenses.","Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs and 8-Ks filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them.","At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike?","Michael F. Mahoney","Sure. Thanks. Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. I'll begin today with some comments regarding our first quarter performance, which Jeff will cover in more detail a little bit later.","On an operational basis our sales performance came in at the midpoint of our stated guidance range for the quarter. We delivered net sales of $1.761 billion, which is down 6% on a reported basis and down 4% on an operational basis, and this excludes the impact of foreign exchange and the divested Neurovascular business.","So as anticipated, the year-over-year comparisons in the first quarter were challenging from a top line perspective, primarily driven by DES comparisons and the impact of fewer selling days than in the prior period. We estimate the negative impact of fewer selling days in Q1 2013 to be approximately 200 basis points from a year-over-year growth perspective. And in addition, FX is more of a headwind than anticipated in our first quarter guidance range. However, 5 of our 7 businesses, after adjusting for the fewer selling days, continue to grow at or above the market during the quarter. The revenue growth figures that I will highlight on this call are all on a constant currency basis.","On a worldwide basis, Neuromodulation grew at 6%, Endoscopy grew at 5% and Peripheral Interventions grew at 3% as compared to Q1 of last year. We continue to see strong returns on our investments in emerging markets during the quarter, with combined revenue in Brazil and Russia, India and China growing 35% as compared to first quarter '12. We're also pleased with improved performance of our CRM business relative to the market performance.","In terms of EPS, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.16, which is at the higher end of our guidance range and at Street consensus. On a year-over-year basis, we delivered adjusted EPS growth of 7%, even after absorbing a $0.01 impact in the quarter due to the medical device tax. We also generated solid cash flow and used $100 million to buy back approximately 13 million shares of stock in the quarter. So now let me go into more detail regarding our business performance for the quarter, and we'll start with our MedSurg sector.","So in Endoscopy, we had a solid quarter with 5% revenue growth worldwide driven by strong results internationally. So despite the fewer selling days, we experienced broad year-over-year growth across several of our key product franchises in the quarter. Our Metal Stent franchise led the way driven by our industry-leading WallFlex product family. Our Hemostasis franchise continued to strengthen based on the adoption and utilization of our resolution clip for GI bleeding. And our Biliary device franchise continued to grow faster than market via our Endoscopic Ultrasound platform. In addition, we continue to see improved adoption for the Alair platform. There continues to be a sequential increase in the number of patients seeking treatment, as well as an increase in private payers covering this procedure on a patient-by-patient basis through the predetermination process.","In the quarter, we continued to see an increase in sites, exceeding 250 centers across 18 countries. And we also expect to publish 5-year safety and efficacy data by the third quarter of '13 and continue to execute a focused coding coverage and payment strategy for the important and very differentiated technology. So overall, we believe the worldwide markets in endo are healthy, and we continue to drive above-market sales growth performance on a global basis in 2013.","In our Urology\/Women's Health division, revenues in the quarter were flat compared to the prior year as our growth in Urology was offset by a challenging pelvic floor market in Women's Health. We continue to see strong international growth as a result of our global commercial expansion and effective new product launches. In the U.S., we successfully launched 5 new products, 3 in Urology and 2 within Women's Health. We expect this division to return to growth in the second half of 2013 given our pipeline, further global expansion and the anniversary of the pelvic floor market declines.","Turning to Neuromodulation. Our team is executing very well as we continued to gain market share during the quarter, particularly in the U.S. For the quarter, we delivered 6% revenue growth on a worldwide basis despite the fewer selling days. We recently received FDA approval for our Precision Spectra Spinal Cord Stimulation platform in the U.S. The Spectra platform is the world's first and only system with a three-dimensional programming algorithm and 32 dedicated power sources that will provide patients pain relief to a wide range who suffer from chronic pain. We are currently in limited launch in the U.S. and have been pleased with enthusiastic physician response. Precision Spectra is another example of our emphasis on clinically meaningful innovation focused on patient outcomes, and we have high expectations for this platform going forward.","So despite consistent procedural growth outside the U.S., as expected, we continue to see the worldwide Interventional Cardiology market decline in the low- to mid-single digits driven by procedural softness in the U.S. plus global pricing pressures. While we expect these market headwinds to persist, we believe they will moderate over time due to underlying patient demographics and introduction of differentiated technologies such as our SYNERGY Stent platform.","During the quarter, we estimate that our IC sequential global market share was essentially flat. Our worldwide IC revenues declined 14%, driven primarily by the U.S. In the U.S., as expected, we experienced difficult comparisons to first quarter 2012. We saw the launch of PROMUS Element Plus and predated the U.S. introduction of Resolute Integrity. The difficult comparisons should end in late second quarter 2013, reflecting the anniversary of a competitive launch in the U.S., and we estimate our first quarter U.S. DES share to be in the mid-30s.","In addition, we anticipate an improvement in our IC revenue performance starting in the second quarter, primarily driven by new product launches and improving global commercial execution. In terms of our U.S. -- I'm sorry, in terms of our DES pipeline, our next-generation SYNERGY Stent continues to perform very well. The limited launch we began in Europe after receiving CE Mark approval late last year has been progressing according to plan and expanded to include our Asia Pac region. Globally, customer feedback continues to be very positive, and the selling price has been healthy even in our most challenging markets. Further, enrollment in the SYNERGY U.S. IDE trial, called EVOLVE II, is tracking ahead of schedule with over 500 patients recruited to date.","In February, we announced CE Mark approval of a new stent platform in our DES portfolio. It's called Promus PREMIER. The introduction of PREMIER is another example of our commitment to leadership and innovative product cadence. So PREMIER will enhance deliverability, and is the only platform to have customized stent architecture and other novel features that increase both axial strength without compromising the key performance. We recently began a European launch, and customer feedback has been very positive. Data from the first human U.S. trial -- first human use trial will be presented at a late-breaking trial at EuroPCR next month. We anticipate FDA approval for Promus PREMIER in the fourth quarter of 2013.","So with our PROMUS durable polymer platform, combined with our synergy bioabsorbable platform, we believe that we have the most compelling DES portfolio and pipeline in the industry. So with continued focus on commercial execution, a strength in overall IC pipeline and continued favorable clinical evidence of our DES platforms, we believe that we have stabilized our DES share and that we expect to grow our DES share in the second half of 2013.","In our core IC business, we improved our performance sequentially despite continued procedure softness. We continued the U.S. launch of the Emerge Balloon Catheter during the quarter, and that continued to receive positive feedback from customers. In addition, we accelerated our commercial rollout of the BridgePoint Medical suite of coronary CTO devices that add to our unique and clinically differentiated portfolio of IC products, all of which, we believe, enable us to be uniquely positioned to provide treatment for complex PCI procedures.","So turning to Structural Heart. On the Structural Heart front, we continue to make progress in TAVR with the Lotus Valve. Lotus is a highly differentiated, second-generation valve that is fully repositionable and recapturable post deployment. At ACC, favorable 6-month data for the REPRISE I trial demonstrated minimal paravalve regurgitation, which is an important determinant of late outcomes. Enrollment in REPRISE II, our 120-patient CE Mark trial, is now complete, and we expect the early results will be presented at a late-breaking trial at EuroPCR next month. We anticipate commercialization of the Lotus Valve after CE Mark in the fourth quarter of 2013.","So moving on to Peripheral Interventions. So despite the fewer selling days, PI delivered worldwide revenue growth of 3%. Global revenue growth was led by certain countries in the Asia Pac and Latin American regions that delivered consistent double-digit growth again this quarter. We're also making excellent progress on integrating our next-generation renal denervation system Vessix, and believe we are on track to launch this platform commercially in Europe and other international markets ahead of schedule.","Vessix is a differentiated low-energy, bipolar, over-the-wire device which offers predictable renal ablation coupled with rapid procedure times. We remain optimistic both about the opportunity of the renal denervation market and our position in it. Overall, we believe that the worldwide market in PI is healthy, and we will continue to drive above-market growth both in the U.S. and globally in 2013.","So now let's focus on our Rhythm Management segment. We are pleased with the improved performance of this business. In the first quarter our worldwide CRM business declined 4% in a market that we believe was down mid-single digits versus prior year. In our defib business, we continue to drive de novo share gains with the INCEPTA and ENERGEN family of ICDs, which lead the industry in longevity. And in an environment where hospital and cost pressures continue to increase, we believe now more than ever that the device longevity and its potential to reduce hospital readmissions and infections will continue to be a key differentiator for Boston Scientific. In addition, sales of our highly reliable RELIANCE family of ICD leads remains very strong, leading to a 5th consecutive quarter of elevated lead per port ratios.","So let me now provide an update on our controlled launch of the S-ICD system. During the first quarter, our sales exceeded our internal global forecast and demand has outpaced our ability to supply. We continue to make progress in our efforts to enhance the S-ICD supply chain following early FDA approval last fall. But despite these efforts, we had been supply constrained since early March, and we will only be able to provide a very limited supply of S-ICD in the second quarter. We are managing the supply shortage with our customers, and we continue to work diligently to expand our production capacity. We expect these efforts will put us in a position to resume our controlled launch of the S-ICD later this summer. Despite these near-term obstacles, the strong market for the S-ICD continues to highlight the strategic importance of this innovative technology to patients and to our CRM business.","As highlighted previously, we anticipate launching our S-ICD 1.5 release device in the fourth quarter. We expect that this release will enable BSC to meet the growing demand for the S-ICD platform. While the current shortage of the S-ICD product is unfortunate, we're encouraged by the performance of our core defib franchise in the quarter and look forward to building on these successes with resuming the controlled launch of S-ICD in the coming months.","So now turning to the pacer segment. We're now approaching the 1 year anniversary of the launch of our INGENIO family of pacemakers and CRTP devices. Over this time period, we've been pleased with the performance of this platform, which include a number of new design features, including a wireless telemetry and access to our recently launched LATITUDE NXT Remote Patient Management system.","With the recent launch of LATITUDE, we are now able to provide the customers a greater flexibility in how they receive, review and manage patient data and device data. And thanks to the benefit of this new family of devices, we believe our pacer business outperform the first quarter worldwide pacer market, which we estimated declined in the mid-single digits. And from a pricing standpoint, we continue to see relatively stable pacer pricing on a year-over-year basis.","So now turning to Left Atrial Appendage Closure. The WATCHMAN product line continues to show strong growth in international markets on both the sequential and a year-over-year basis, with international revenues growing by more than 30% as compared to the first quarter of last year. From a U.S. standpoint, we continue to work through our final statistical analysis of the PREVAIL data and we expect to submit the final PMA module to the FDA in the second quarter. We expect long-term efficacy results from the PROTECT-AF trial will be presented as a late-breaking trial at HRS next month.","Finally, our EP division's worldwide revenue did decline 5% during the quarter as compared to the prior year. However, we're making good progress on several internal AFib-focused projects, and we continue to be excited by the recent acquisition of Rhythmia Medical and its next-generation mapping and navigation solutions. We have submitted all the necessary regulatory filings and expect CE Mark approval of the Rhythmia platform in the second quarter of '13, with FDA clearance expected in the second half of '13 and a full U.S.-Europe launch expected in 2014.","So to wrap up. Overall, the results of the first quarter were in line with our expectations. While we're encouraged by our performance in the first quarter, we're certainly not satisfied. We continue to direct our investments toward meaningful innovation to drive clinical and economic value by improving patient outcomes, reducing the cost of health care and increasing patient access to therapies. We made progress towards the global execution in our core markets by driving de novo share gains in ICD and pacer markets and through successfully introducing new innovative platforms, including Promus PREMIER in Europe and Precision Spectra in neuromod in the U.S.","We are making progress on several of our key strategic initiatives to expand in the high-growth adjacencies. We continue to see improved performance from our Alair platform as we expand a number of centers. We've made good progress on our Lotus Valve program, including a favorable 6-month data from REPRISE I and completion of REPRISE II trial. We believe that we're on track to launch our Vessix Renal Denervation platform in Europe ahead of schedule, and we continue to expand globally with combined revenue in Brazil, Russia, India and China, growing 35% in the quarter. So as we further build our capabilities in these countries, we expect this growth trend to continue.","We also remained focused on margin improvement as evidenced by the expansion of our 2011 restructuring program. And lastly, we continue to make important operational changes that we believe will improve our execution and strengthen our customer focus. These changes include moving to a global operating structure across all of our business units during the quarter. We believe this structure is enabling us to operate more efficiently and effectively by improving our speed in global resource allocation. And as a result of this important change, we have now established new and different financial reporting segments, which Jeff will further discuss in his section.","So in the second quarter, we expect revenue performance to improve versus first quarter, with sales guidance of minus 2 to plus 1 on an operational basis. As we look forward to the remainder of 2013, we expect to stay committed to our productivity initiatives. We continue to be focused on continuous improvement and on executing on our restructuring initiatives to reduce costs and improve margins, while we prudently invest in our strategic initiatives for future growth. We expect to continue to generate strong cash flow, which enables us to fund more share purchases and to continue to look at appropriate acquisitions to improve our future growth profile. We continue to believe that we'll return to growth in the back half of 2013, with our full year sales guidance at negative 1.5% to positive 1.5% growth as we anticipate sequential quarterly growth improvement. We believe the steps we have taken are what is needed to improve our performance and return BSC to consistent revenue and EPS growth.","So now let me turn the call over to Jeff to review our first quarter results and to provide guidance for the second quarter. Jeff?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Thanks, Mike. Let me begin by providing some overall perspective on the quarter before getting into the details. Despite challenging year-over-year comparisons, we generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.16, which is at the higher end of our guidance of $0.14 to $0.17 and at consensus. This represents improved profitability from the prior year, which is driven by continued gross margin improvement, lower operating expense, a favorable tax rate and fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by a $0.01 impact from the medical device tax and increased investments in our strategic growth initiatives. In addition, we generated adjusted free cash flow of $166 million and used $100 million to repurchase approximately 13 million more shares in the quarter.","As noted in the earnings release and consistent with our strategic imperatives to focus on global opportunities, we completed the reorganization of our businesses from geographic regions to global business units effective January 1, 2013. As a result, we now have 3 reportable segments consisting of: Cardiovascular, which is comprised of our Interventional Cardiology and Peripheral Interventions businesses; Rhythm Management, comprised of our Cardiac Rhythm Management and Electrophysiology businesses; and MedSurg, which is comprised of Endoscopy, Urology\/Women's Health and Neuromodulation. We have restated prior-period segment information to conform to the current year presentation within the exhibits attached to this earnings release.","In conjunction with the interim goodwill impairment testing required following the change in composition of our segments and reporting units, we recognized an estimated $423 million pretax goodwill impairment charge associated with our new global Cardiac Rhythm Management business unit. It is important to note that our assumptions on the CRM market and our expected operational results remain unchanged from year end, and that the primary driver of this charge was the reorganization to global business units, which changed the composition of our reporting units including the amount of intangible assets, other assets and liabilities and the expected cash flows allocated to the new global CRM reporting unit. As a result of this charge, the remaining goodwill assigned to our global CRM business has been fully written off. As a reminder, this is a noncash charge with minimal tax consequences and has no impact on our expected cash flows or our bank covenant ratios.","We firmly believe our Rhythm Management business represents a future growth opportunity for the company given our new products and future technology offerings. We believe that over the past several years, we've invested in technology and acquisitions to improve the company's growth profile. Some of these investments have been used to revitalize our core CRM portfolio and to provide the EP with a comprehensive set of solutions, including differentiated platforms such as the S-ICD, the WATCHMAN device and the recently acquired Rhythmia mapping and navigation systems. As this focused strategy continues to gain traction, we believe we can drive Rhythm Management's profitability to levels more consistent with our other business segments.","Now I'll move to the detailed review of our business performance and operating results for the quarter. For the first quarter of 2013, consolidated revenue of $1,761,000,000 represents a decrease of 6% on a reported basis and a decrease of 4% on an operational basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange and the divested Neurovascular business. The actual headwind from foreign exchange on sales was approximately $35 million as compared to the prior year and was $25 million higher than what we had assumed in our first quarter guidance range.","On an operational basis, our sales performance was at the midpoint of our guidance range and somewhat consistent with the performance in the fourth quarter 2012 after adjusting for 2 fewer selling days in the first quarter '13. It is important to note that all revenue comparables this quarter have been negatively impacted by approximately 2 fewer billing days than the prior year.","In Interventional Cardiology, worldwide revenue came in at $514 million in the first quarter, representing a constant currency decrease of 14% compared to the first quarter 2012. Worldwide DES revenue came at $291 million, representing a constant currency decrease of 18% compared to the first quarter of 2012.","U.S. DES revenue was $117 million in the quarter, representing a decline of 34% compared to the first quarter of last year. This decrease was primarily due to a strong comparison to the prior-year quarter driven by the full launch of PROMUS Element Plus, lower share to competitive products, lower ASPs and continued softness in PCI volumes in a number of devices used per procedure. We estimate that our U.S. DES share was stable sequentially in the mid-30s in the first quarter.","International DES sales of $175 million represented a decrease of 3% in constant currency compared to the first quarter of last year, driven by over 60% growth in the emerging markets of China and India, primarily offset by pricing declines in Europe and Japan. Worldwide non-stent Interventional Cardiology was down 7% in constant currency. However, with upcoming launches of new products, along with the ongoing success of BridgePoint Medical suite of CTO devices, we expect to see improvement in this business over the course of 2013.","Moving on to CRM. Worldwide revenue was $478 million in the first quarter, representing a constant currency decrease of 4% compared to the first quarter of last year. In the U.S., CRM revenue of $283 million represented a 3% increase from the first quarter of 2012. International CRM sales of $195 million were down 5% in constant currency compared to the prior-year quarter.","On a worldwide basis, defib sales were 5 -- were $350 million in Q1, which was down 4% in constant currency from the first quarter of 2012. In the U.S., defib sales were $221 million. This was down 4% compared to Q1 last year. International defib sales of $129 million represented a 5% decrease in constant currency in the first quarter of last year.","Worldwide pacer sales declined 2% on a constant currency basis as compared to Q1 2012, driven by continued strong performance from our INGENIO family of pacemakers and CRTPs. In the U.S., pacer revenue was flat compared to the first quarter of last year, while international revenue declined 4% in constant currency for the quarter. Additionally, our worldwide Electrophysiology business declined 5% on a constant currency basis compared to the first quarter of last year.","Our Peripheral Interventions business continued to deliver growth, with worldwide revenue up 3% in constant currency compared to the first quarter of last year. Global growth was driven by strong performance in Asia, up 27% and 13% growth in Latin America. Our Endoscopy business continue to grow faster than the market and had another solid quarter, with worldwide sales up 5% in constant currency led by 7% revenue growth internationally.","In constant currency, our worldwide Urology\/Women's Health business was flat from a growth perspective during the quarter. However, sales growth was particularly strong internationally at 7% compared to the first quarter of last year. Our Urology business maintained its leadership position with 2% worldwide constant currency growth in the quarter driven by strong international revenue growth of 6%.","Our Women's Health revenue declined 7% on a worldwide constant currency basis as compared to the prior year. However, our international business had a 4% growth on a year-over-year basis. We continue to see pressure on elective procedures due to concerns around the use of surgical mesh for pelvic organ prolapse, specifically in the U.S. market.","Neuromodulation had another solid quarter with 6% worldwide sales growth, including 36% growth in our international revenue compared to the same period in the prior year. We expect to sustain and build on this momentum in the remainder of 2013 as we fully launch Precision Spectra in the U.S. spinal cord stimulation market.","Moving on from sales. Adjusted gross profit margin for the first quarter was 67.3% or 80% -- 80 basis points higher than the first quarter of last year. The increase was largely attributed to the mix shift towards self-manufacturing product in DES as a result of the launches of PROMUS Element in U.S. and Japan in the prior year, as well as benefits from our value improvement programs, partially offset by price erosion, mix and some product transition costs. Looking forward, we expect adjusted gross margins to be between 68% and 69% for the second quarter and to improve sequentially as the benefits from our value improvement programs are expected to increase as we progress through the year.","Adjusted SG&A expense was $626 million or 35.5% of sales in the first quarter of 2013 compared to $654 million or 35% of sales in the first quarter of 2012. During the first quarter of 2013, the impact from our cost-saving programs were offset by continued investments in our strategic growth initiatives and costs associated with expanding in emerging markets. In addition, SG&A expenses in Q1 '13 include the impact of approximately 100 basis points from the medical device tax under the U.S. Affordable Care Act. Currently, the accounting treatment for the medical device tax is not consistently applied across the industry. We expect to absorb the first full year impact of the medical device tax during 2013.","Looking ahead, we expect adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales to be between 35.5% and 36.5% in the second quarter of this year as we expect to accelerate investments in our strategic growth initiatives in preparation for the commercialization of several new technology platforms, plus continue to build our capabilities in emerging markets.","Adjusted R&D expenses were $204 million for the first quarter or 11.6% -- 11.6% of sales. This compares to $215 million in the first quarter of 2012. We expect R&D spending to be in the range of 11.5% to 12.5% of sales in the second quarter of this year as we continue to transform our R&D organization and refocus our spending to drive innovation and growth. Royalty expense is $41 million or 2.3% of sales compared to $48 million in Q1 last year. We expect Q2 royalty expense to be higher than the first quarter of 2013.","On an adjusted basis, pretax operating income was $314 million or 17.8% of sales, up 50 basis points from the first quarter of last year. The increase in adjusted operating margins was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins and lower operating expenses, partially offset by the impact of the medical device tax. It is very important to note that the medical device tax negatively impacted our operating margins by 100 basis points. Accordingly, our margin expansion would have been 150 basis points without this tax.","GAAP operating loss, which includes GAAP to adjusted items that had a negative impact of $643 million on a pretax basis, was $354 million in the first quarter of 2013. The primary GAAP to adjusted items in the quarter were: the estimated pretax goodwill impairment charge of $423 million that I just discussed earlier; a pretax net litigation charges of $130 million and pretax amortization expense of $103 million.","Now I'll move on to other income expense. Interest expense was $65 million in the first quarter, which is $4 million lower than the first quarter of last year, primarily due to the collection of Spanish government receivables and the refinancing of our revolving credit facility in mid-2012. Our average interest expense rate in the first quarter of this year was 5.7% or about 10 basis points lower than the first quarter of last year.","Our tax rate for the first quarter was 10.2% on a reported basis and 9.8% on an adjusted basis. The difference between our reported and adjusted tax rates for the quarter is attributable to the net benefit of restructuring, litigation and other net charges excluded in determining our non-GAAP results.","Our adjusted tax rate in Q1 included a net benefit of approximately $8 million for discrete tax items, primarily related to the retroactive extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit for 2012 that was recognized in the first quarter of 2013. We estimate our full year tax -- adjusted tax rate to be between 10% to 12%. This excludes any other discrete tax items that may arise during the year.","Moving on to the balance sheet. DSO is 63 days, improved 1 day compared to March 2012, primarily due to good performance in Japan and Europe. Despite lower inventory levels, days inventory on hand of 133 days was up 4 days compared to March of last year, primarily due to lower cost of goods sold primarily driven by the PROMUS Element transition and standard cost improvements.","Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $166 million compared to $177 million in Q1 2012. Capital expenditures were $53 million in the first quarter 2013 compared to $66 million in the first quarter of last year. We continue to expect full year 2013 adjusted free cash flow to be approximately $1.2 billion.","Turning to share repurchases. We repurchased 13 million shares in the quarter for approximately $100 million. Since July 2011, we have repurchased 200 million shares or approximately 13% of our outstanding shares. We announced in January 2013 that our Board of Directors authorized the company to repurchase an additional $1 billion of the company's stock. We continue to believe that our stock price is undervalued, and we currently expect to utilize approximately 1\/2 of our estimated available adjusted free cash flow for share repurchase in 2013, subject to business development opportunities, market conditions, our stock price, regulatory trading windows and other factors.","As a reminder, we announced on our Q4 earnings call in January the expansion of our 2011 restructuring program intended to build on the progress made under that program to strengthen our operational effectiveness and efficiencies and support new investments, which we expect will increase shareholder value. From a cost perspective, we expect a substantial portion of the total program savings will be reinvested in targeted areas for future growth, including our strategic growth initiatives and continue to build our capabilities in emerging markets.","Let me now walk you through our guidance for the second quarter as well as updated guidance for the full year. Looking ahead over the remainder of the year, we continue to expect dynamic market conditions with the risks of macroeconomic weakness, particularly in Europe, and softening procedural volumes in the U.S. As a result, we are carefully monitoring conditions and have applied what we believe is a reasonable level of conservatism in our guidance to account for these factors.","However, despite these uncertainties, we continue to believe there's reason to be positive. We have acquired new technologies and have launched key new products in most of our businesses as we remain focused on returning to top line growth in the second half of 2013. We also believe, despite the medical device tax, that we have the opportunity to enhance profitability and expect to continue to generate strong cash flow.","We expect Q2 consolidated revenues to be in the range of $1,740,000,000 to $1,800,000,000. If current foreign exchange rates hold constant, the headwind from FX should be approximately $30 million, around 170 basis points relative to the second quarter of last year. On an operational basis, we expect consolidated Q2 sales to be in the range of up 1% to down 2% compared to the second quarter of last year.","On a worldwide basis, we expect DES revenue to be in the range of $275 million to $295 million and CRM revenue to be in the range of $450 million to $470 million in the second quarter. We expect Q2 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $0.14 to $0.17 per share, and we encourage you to model to the midpoint.","We expect reported GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.07 to $0.10 per share, which includes an estimated $0.07 per share impact from amortization expense. We also wanted to remind folks to look at their models for Q3 and Q4 as historically Q3 has been our lowest quarter primarily due to seasonality, typically lower than Q2, and we expect Q4 to be our strongest quarter given seasonality and the timing of some of our expected new product launches.","Moving to the full year. We now expect the consolidated 2013 sales will be between $6,950,000,000 and $7,150,000,000. Assuming that current foreign exchange rates hold constant, we expect the full year headwind from FX to be approximately $140 million. On an operational basis, consolidated 2013 sales should be in the range of down 1.5% to up 1.5%, and we encourage you to model to the midpoint.","The range assumes that the IC and CRM markets continue to stabilize, and our revenue performance improves sequentially throughout the year, driven primarily by continued stabilization and improved performance in our IC and CRM businesses; more meaningful contribution from emerging markets and our strategic growth initiatives, plus benefits of new product launches across our divisions.","From an earnings standpoint, we expect adjusted EPS for the full year 2013 to be in the range of $0.65 to $0.70, and we encourage you to again model to the midpoint of the range. This range reflects the estimated impact of approximately $0.04 per share from the medical device tax. On a reported GAAP basis, we now expect EPS for the year to be in the range of $0.01 per share to a net loss of $0.06 per share.","That's it for guidance. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Michael, who will moderate the Q&A. Michael?","Michael Campbell","Thanks, Jeff. Tony, let's open it up to questions for the next 20 minutes or so. [Operator Instructions] Tony, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Rick Wise with Stifel.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So many questions here. Let me just start with 2 product questions, since that's key to the reacceleration story. SYNERGY and the S-ICD. SYNERGY in Europe, why the limited launch? The U.S. trial is enrolling ahead of schedule. Talk about, if you would, what accelerates the launch in Europe and the impact on -- of that accelerated enrollment on U.S. filing and potential approval, if you would.","Michael F. Mahoney","Yes. So thanks, Rick. Overall, we're pleased with where -- how we positioned SYNERGY right now. We have a 2 stent platform, as you know, at SYNERGY, and then we've also launched in Europe Promus PREMIER, which we think offers a differentiated portfolio. And with SYNERGY, we're rolling ahead of schedule in terms of our enrollment in the U.S. And in Europe, we believe we're being smart in terms of how we positioned the product. We do believe that this product deserves and warrants a pricing premium, and so we're being selective in terms of markets and customers that we're approaching with SYNERGY. And we will have a full-blown launch. We'll expand that launch in first quarter 2014 in Europe, and we'll continue to enroll. But we believe that two-tiered position is the way to go, and we'll launch in the first quarter 2014 and we'll continue to do the controlled launch in the appropriate markets that justify the premium price points that the product deserves.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes. On the S-ICD front, Mike, the demand ahead of supply. I understand that with gen 1 especially. But with gen 1.5 that you're going to launch this summer, it sounds like on track. Are you -- how quickly are you going to be able to supply the demand that's there? Is it going to take 6 months or 2 years? Help us understand how quickly gen 1.5 can launch.","Michael F. Mahoney","Sure. Well on the -- in Investor Day, we talked about the S-ICD in quite a bit of detail. And we expect to continue to deliver the revenue that we discussed at Investor Day in 2013 for S-ICD. The revenue will be more heavily weighted to what we delivered in the first quarter and more heavily weighted to the back half of '13 based on the supply, but we expect to deliver that. So the -- it's not an issue of demand. As you know, the product was approved early, and so for a number of months, since we've acquired the company, we've been focused on boosting the supply chain and the capabilities with this device, so we can deliver at quality and at the right quantities. And this 1.5 release really is focused on that. And as you said, this 1.5 release will occur during the second half of the year. And we believe that we'll be able to really deliver the demand that's needed in the fourth quarter of 2013 and clearly as we go into 2014. So we'll begin to take the foot off the brake a little bit more in the third quarter. But you'll see us be able to increase our capabilities to supply in fourth quarter and clearly in 2014. And we expect to deliver the overall S-ICD guidance that we provided at the Investor Day.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Jeff, just one interesting thing on guidance, we thought, was R&D. I thought that you had talked about R&D actually being heavier in the first half of the year. And now it looks like it's going to be lighter. And it sounds to us that, that trend probably continues. So can you just talk to us about what is a good number for R&D for the year? And specifically, is this is more of a strategic structural change with how the company's going to spend and organize innovation?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes. David, thanks for the question. So I'd say that in the first quarter, R&D was probably a little lighter than we anticipated. And a lot of that just has to do with kind of timing and when things happen in terms of trials and activities. Our guidance indicates that R&D, as a percentage of sales, will be between 11.5% to 12.5% kind of for the rest of the year. So that would be a bit of a step-up sequentially because we're at 11.6% in Q1. So I'd expect R&D would tick up here in the second and third quarters. Those tend to be slightly lighter quarters revenue-wise and then probably be kind of at the lower end of that 11.5% to 12.5% in '14 -- in Q4 as kind of revenue picks up in the fourth quarter.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, very helpful. And then, Mike, maybe a question on the outlook. I think the theme of the call, and I think the focus for investors is improving organic growth rates and constant currency rates throughout the balance of the year. I guess some skeptics would say you benefited from a couple of areas, specifically in CRM and Neuromodulation where some of your peers have been a little weaker. And as they begin to get a little stronger or recover from their issues in the back half of '13, it's going to be harder for you to get to that back half of the growth improvement. Maybe just kind of talk about what expectations you've made for competitors re-basing their businesses and how confident you feel that you can still get to these improvements into the back half.","Michael F. Mahoney","Yes, absolutely. We're actually pleased we delivered first quarter as we guided and the year looked -- we believe we're going to execute in 2013, similar to what we provide at the Investor Day were sequential quarterly growth. And we called the first quarter what we think will be our toughest growth, and improvement in the second quarter and a sequential improvement from there. The key factors of -- I don't want to go through the whole script, but the key factors, there's 4 of them, on why we believe we'll continue to improve the sequential growth. First one is our MedSurg and PI businesses. They continue to grow at or above market in markets that are healthier, led by Endo, the Spectra launch with Neuromod and the consistently growing PI and Urology business. And as a percent of overall BSC, that continues to grow slowly in terms of growth, in terms of the proportion of our revenue. So we think that will continue to make a positive impact each quarter in '13. The second big one, a wildcard, if you will, has been the performance of IC and CRM. And you saw a stabilization of share, we believe, in our global CRM business in the first quarter. And we expect that trend to continue, which is a strong turnaround from the previous years. Our IC business, we believe we had our worst quarter in the first quarter, and that will get better. We launched PREMIER in the second quarter in Europe. We had the full year for chronic total occlusion with our BridgePoint acquisition. And we believe a more efficient commercial organization to improve our performance in Interventional Cardiology. The adjacencies that you know about, we ticked through them during the call, the third point, are making progress in their milestones that we believe the adjacencies will deliver against the revenue that we called out at the Investor Day. And the fourth one is our BRIC. We continue to grow a solid 35% in that -- in those areas. So those are our 4-point plan there, and we believe we're executing to what we communicated at the Investor Day.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then Jeff, just a real quick follow-up. Would you say the revenue guidance revision is entirely currency? And if it's not, 90% -- 95% currency, was there some other dynamic that would have driven the revision?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes. So if you go back and look at our original guidance for the year, I believe it's $7,050,000,000 to $7,350,000,000. So we've lowered that by $150 million, both the high end and the low end for FX. The FX rates, obviously because of the yen, predominantly have just hit everybody. So we've taken $150 million off both ends of the ranges. And then, in essence, we added $50 million of revenue to the lower end of the range, and we took $50 million off the higher end of the range. So from a percentage basis, the guidance is predominantly affected by the FX, which affects everybody. So we still, as Mike laid out, are very focused and confident on our ability to kind of return to growth. And I think we've got a lot of positive things going for us in the back of the year.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I had a question on the CRM guidance for 2Q. I think you mentioned guidance would be $450 million to $470 million. And I think you just did $478 million for the first quarter. So is that conservatism or is there something in the markets that you're concerned about? Then I have a follow-up.","Jeffrey D. Capello","Well, thanks, Glenn, for the questions. So our -- the worldwide CRM business was down 4% on a constant currency, organic basis. And our guidance would imply a low of down 7% to a high of up 3%, so the midpoint somewhere around 4% or 5%, so somewhat consistent with the first quarter. So I think we expect kind of more of the same, Q1 to Q2, being off the market in S-ICD. Obviously, it hurts us a little bit, but we see a lot of positive things, particularly in the pacer area with the INGENIO launch. So the performance is expected to be similar to the first quarter. And as I said earlier, given everything going on in the markets, I think we've leaned a little bit more conservatively on guidance and hopefully, we can exceed that.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and just as a follow-up, just to flesh out the U.S. market a little bit more. You're actually -- your IC number came in better than we thought here in the first quarter. Is that a function of maybe the market doing a little bit better? Was pricing not as bad? Were there share gains? Can you comment on those?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes. So from a market perspective, Glenn, I think we continue to be somewhat optimistic about the pricing trends. As we identified back in mid-2012, we walked away from some business which was very price-sensitive. And given our portfolio and all the new technology we have coming to market that's differentiated, we intend to continue to be disciplined from a price perspective. We did see, in the first quarter, pricing activity that was better from a percentage basis than the fourth quarter and better than kind of the trend, so that's encouraging. So that's good news. The PCIs are kind of similar, kind of down, kind of low- to mid-single digits, so unchanged on that front. So overall, we were pleased with the sequential stabilization, if not, a slight uptick in share from Q4 to Q1. But the real interest is in the back half the year when we get Promus PREMIER and we continue to roll out our CTO devices and the rest of our technology kind of takes off.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then just one quick follow-up. The share comment that you thought you may have picked up sequentially, were you referring to ICDs and not enough pricing?","Jeffrey D. Capello","No.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So you think pricing -- share on ICDs is stable?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes. Well, on core ICDs, it's up I think we share -- from a share perspective. And my comment on pricing related to DES. I thought that's what you're referring to.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","No, I was referring to ICD pricing. Generally, the ICD pricing in the overall market's been down anywhere between 3% and 5%. And then as I look at your ICD results, they did come in better than we thought. So we're just trying to figure out, was it maybe pricing came in a little bit better, were there share gains or did the overall market come in a little bit better?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Just to clarify then, so the comments on pricing, I thought you'd switch to DES, my error. On the ICD side, the pricing is no different than what it was in the fourth quarter.","Michael F. Mahoney","Yes, I think on that, just to add some color to that. The pricing is similar, as Jeff said, in ICD. We believe we picked up some share in de novo ICD in the second quarter -- I'm sorry, in the first quarter, which helped our performance.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So just to follow up, I think David's question is relative to the revenue guidance. So the 2Q, I guess, difference from where you're guiding to the $1.740 billion [ph] with the $1.800 billion [ph] versus the Street. Do you -- what do you think that is? Do you think that's just more conservatism? What is it do you think that's in your model that's not in the Street?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Well, Mike, one of the biggest differences is probably FX. And I think when the Street set their models was when we set our guidance. And at that point, we're expecting, I think, FX to be negative $10 million, and now it's negative $140 million. So it's almost $150 million negative impact of FX, and that's spread through the quarters. So what I would encourage the analysts to do is go back and kind of look at their models relative to FX because it was a $25 million negative impact in the first quarter. And I think I've said in the script it was something like $30 million, a negative in Q2? And we originally set guidance that was supposed to be minimal in Q2.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, so you think the Street is lagging on FX?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes, I do believe that.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Let me ask about gross margin, because I think gross margin this quarter was a little bit lighter than I think we in the Street were looking for. And what's -- maybe just give us your thoughts on that. Is that -- is the decline or is just the -- let's call it the shortfall there, do you think is that a function just of mix and the weakness in the ICD side of the business? Is that in part because of what you sold on the S-ICD this quarter and that weighed on it? And how do we think about gross margin over the balance of the year?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes, sure. Thanks, Mike. So yes, so maybe the best way to do it is kind of bridge you off the fourth quarter to the first quarter, the fourth quarter of '12 to the first quarter. Why would margins be down 100 basis points? It's really 3 factors. One is a bit from a mix perspective. We had a slightly less rich mix of products, so that was about 1\/3 of the impact. Another 1\/3 was the Neurovascular distribution revenue that we had was actually higher in the first quarter than it was in the fourth quarter, and that was slightly unanticipated. So -- and again, as we've discussed before, that has -- basically, distributor's margin, very low margin. So that weighed on the margins. And then the third factor, which was roughly 1\/3 as well, was that we ended up kind of taking our inventories down, maybe a little bit lower than we had thought we would initially, and that had an absorption impact that rolls through the margins in the first quarter. So 1\/3 mix, 1\/3 Neurovascular distribution being higher than planned and 1\/3 absorption. If you look now, going forward, what do the margins do from a sequential perspective from the first quarter to the second, second to the third, is really kind of 3 factors. One is, we expect that our value improvement programs and our cost-saving initiatives will continue to be enough to offset from a margin percentage perspective price, and that mix will be less of a challenge. So we think those kind of neutralize, if not, slightly more favorable. What also happens is, from a Neurovascular perspective, our Neurovascular revenue, the distribution revenue, the striker drops off quite a bit from Q1 to Q2 and then again from Q2 to Q3. And in those step-downs, we get a margin uplift from those. So there's roughly a 50-basis-point benefit from Q1 to Q2 and then another 50 basis points from Q2 to Q3, from just basically taking that distribution revenue down from roughly $36 million in the first quarter to almost 0 in the third quarter. So you get a margin benefit from that. And the third factor is, from an FX perspective, with the rates are -- where they are today, that helps a bit from a margin percentage perspective.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. I think that's clear. One last question, and I'll let others jump in. The -- as you get ready to launch the Lotus Valve in Europe, can you just talk about what your plans are from a distribution standpoint? Obviously, you've got a very strong Interventional Cardiology presence, but you haven't called historically on the cardiothoracic surgeon. So how are you preparing for that, and what are you going to do differently?","Michael F. Mahoney","Yes, certainly, we're not going to provide lots of detail on our commercial strategy. As you said, we have a large Interventional Cardiology sales team and we have a clinical sales specialist that we have, not only for our Atritech program, but also for our Lotus program. So we'll leverage our clinical sales team's instructional hires and also the commercial presence that we have across our Interventional Cardiology team to commercialize Lotus. Does that help?","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from Matt Taylor with Barclays.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to just touch on the constant currency guidance. Just was curious, I'm hearing a lot of moving parts around new products, has your expectation for contribution from the new products versus kind of the core business changed at all versus prior guidance?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes, that's a good question. So if you go back and you look at what we've laid out relative at Investor Day in terms of expectation, the contribution of some of the adjacencies that we've entered, I would say that our expectation has not changed. We still feel pretty good about the expected contributions. And those really start to kick in, in Q3, and then, in a bigger way, in Q4. Certainly, there'll be some puts and takes, but overall, we feel pretty good about the contribution of adjacencies in addition to the new products that have been developed internally, the Promus PREMIER launch, the continued rollout of INGENIO and the other countless new products that come out within the MedSurg business.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then just real quickly onto the -- your launching and ramping here that you covered a little bit. Can we get more color on what the atrial appendage, given the data that you showed earlier in the quarter? And also, any color on maybe on the Asthmatx launch that you can give above and beyond what you talked about in the script would be great and your expectations there?","Michael F. Mahoney","Well, Ken, maybe you can provide some comments, additional mind on Atritech. So we had a nice sequential growth, year-over-year growth in Europe, with Atritech exceeding 30%. And we expect to file with the FDA in the second quarter. And we'll also be announcing that, hopefully, a late breaker here at HRS, the efficacy results of our PROTECT-AF trial. So, Ken, any other comments you want to make on Atritech?","Kenneth J. Pucel","Yes. I mean I would just say, just to reiterate, we were very encouraged by the PREVAIL data. It, to our thinking, goes a long way to resolving the concerns people had about safety of the device, particularly with new implanters showed comparable efficacy outcomes to our anticoagulation. Also, I just want to emphasize to everyone that when we do file with the FDA, it's not just the PREVAIL data, it's the totality of all of the date we have, what device, the pilot study, PROTECT-AF, the ASAP trial in contraindicated patients, as well as PREVAIL. And again, just to reiterate, as Mike said, we will be presenting the long-term follow-up data PROTECT-AF as a late-breaking trial at HRS, and that's going to be by far the longest experience that anyone's had in a large-scale randomized clinical trial with left atrial appendage closure.","Michael F. Mahoney","And with respect to -- yes, with respect to Alair, we had a few comments there in the script. We certainly want -- we're very optimistic about this program, and we're making steady progress. We yet don't have the final reimbursement numbers that we have, but we've seen sequential improvement. Our Asthmatx business grew about 70% in the first quarter. We're opening new centers. We're seeing the high renewal rates in terms of reordering rates amongst the physicians that are using it. We applied a grant today a Category I CPT code in the first quarter. And we continue to make efforts to drive a reimbursement strategy to open up this market. And we think a key -- the key deliverable will be our 5-year efficacy data that we'll present either late second quarter, early third quarter. And we are hopeful that will be a trigger to help unlock some of the reimbursement that's been clogging the channel for Alair.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from Matthew Dodds with Citigroup.","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","First thing on the U.S. stent market, it looks like the volumes, unless Medtronic has a big quarter, are going to be down about 10%. But I think you said in the commentary, stents per procedure might be off a little. So I just I wanted to see, a, why you think that might be? And what do you think -- what's happening with the volumes in the U.S.? Why are they still falling so fast?","Jeffrey D. Capello","So, Matt, it's Jeff. I'm not sure we would agree that the volumes are falling 10% from -- so exclusive of price, I think we would put that the PCI's probably down, probably kind of low- to mid-single digits. That's kind of our intelligence so far looking at what we track, what Abbott has tracked and, of course, we'll see what Medtronic reports. And price, obviously, is a negative on top of that. So we're more kind of low- to mid-single-digit PCI contraction year-over-year.","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then how about the stents per procedure? That comment, is that something new?","Jeffrey D. Capello","No, I think we've started to see that about 6 to 9 months ago. And that was kind of a dynamic that kind of maybe midpoint last year, and it was kind of reflected in our assumptions going forward for guidance and for the market.","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then, Jeff, one more thing for you. Given the high percentage of sales in Japan, the impact on the top line, why -- or is there an impact in the bottom line that you're covering or do you offset it through the P&L?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes, that's a good question. So we -- our hedging philosophy is to neutralize for FX. And so at any point in time, we are almost, pick a percentage, 90% hedged for the current year. And the next 12 months, depending on where you are in the year, the following 12 months, we're probably somewhere between 70% hedged and we're about 50% hedged for the third year. So when we see these types of dramatic changes in currencies like the yen, we're pretty much protected from an OI perspective. Now when we hedge operating income, we don't hedge at the revenue level. So you'll see fluctuations in our revenue, which is why the guidance comes down $150 million on the top line because we don't hedge the revenue. But it doesn't have a big impact from us -- for us from an operating income and an EPS perspective because we neutralize for that. You give up some of the upside, but you neutralize for the downside, which, in this environment, actually plays out pretty well for you.","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And are those hedges in -- all in the gross margin or are they also in other parts of the P&L?","Jeffrey D. Capello","The majority of them are -- run through the gross margin and some -- well, the impact hits you in kind of the gross margin and in some of the SG&A as well.","Michael F. Mahoney","[Operator Instructions]","Operator","We'll take that question from Bruce Nudell with Credit Suisse.","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess we've heard some, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but surprisingly nice things about Lotus, and that people really like, kind of the stress-free implant experience. Could you just opine on -- is this going to be, in your view, I know you need other sizes and all and the rollouts, controlled that you don't have transapical right away? But in the transdermal segment, how do you view this product in terms of market share?","Michael F. Mahoney","Bruce, it's Mike. Thanks for your high expectations you had on the product, man.","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","No, no, no. We've consistently heard very nice things from surprising sources, I'd say.","Michael F. Mahoney","Good. Well, why don't we first start off with Dr. Keith Dawkins who's on the phone. He was just at the Korea [ph] live event where Lotus was implanted live, so maybe he can make some comments.","Keith D. Dawkins","Yes. It's good to hear you surprised, Bruce, about a good product. Yes, I'm at TCT Asia Pacific and Seoul, and the first live Lotus Valve was done yesterday, no aortic regurgitation at all. And just a completely different experience compared with the competitor products. Early valve function, as you say, a relaxed procedure, predictable, retrievable and re-positionable. And I think the aortic regurgitation is the -- is really the Holy Grail. And you will have seen the SAPIEN XT results of ACC were 29.2% moderate and severe aortic regurgitation, which really, clinically, is completely unacceptable. So we're very excited about this product. And the operators that have now used it in the CE Mark trial in 4 countries, Australia, France, Germany and the U.K. have just been blown away, as have the core lab, the eco-core lab. And as you know, when you assess aortic regurgitation and compare products, it's important to use an eco-core lab, and some of the smaller players don't do that. So we are very excited and looking forward to discussions with the FDA, further discussions with the FDA around the IDE trial and commercializing after CE Mark in the back half of this year.","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And I guess my only follow-up is a small niggling question. How should we be thinking about revenue in the discontinued operations bucket for the rest of the year?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes. Bruce, it's Jeff. So as I said in responding to Mike's question on margins, we would expect that the distribution revenue to the Stryker would go from kind of the mid-30s down to -- which is what it was $35 million off the top of my head, in Q1 down, it's like $20 million in Q2, down to pretty much 0 in Q3.","Michael F. Mahoney","Tony, there seems to be a lot of interest in just looking at the queue. [Operator Instructions]","Operator","We'll take our next question from Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just wanted to see if you guys would be willing to give just the S-ICD contribution in the quarter, just to try to better understand what the base kind of ICD business is doing.","Jeffrey D. Capello","Well, Kristen, we're not going to get in to kind of contributions from each of the product lines. As I think Mike pointed out in his comments, we had a very strong result for the first quarter at CRM, despite the fact that we weren't on the market much with the S-ICD device. So I think we'll probably leave it at that.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just looking at the operating margins that you are now providing as well, I was kind of somewhat surprised by just how low the Rhythm Management margins were and they declined on a year-over-year basis, looks like now they're at 12%. Can you maybe just, I guess, explain why margins were down so much year-to-year and kind of where do you see those margins kind of going since you are substantially below kind of where we would expect Medtronic and St. Jude's margins to be? What are going to be the key initiatives do you have to basically moving that up? I'm not sure how much of an impact the S-ICD has with that on a year-to-year basis.","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes, it's a very good question, Kristen. So as you have noticed in the earnings release, we have -- as we've discussed, we've moved towards these global business segments. And now we will be disclosing the operating income profitability of Cardiovascular, Rhythm Management and MedSurg on a regular basis. I'm going to take you back and answering your question to the Investor Day. We clearly had outlined a game plan to improve our overall company operating margins by at least 600 basis points over the next 5 years. And frankly, the Rhythm Management business was a big piece of that. The reason why they are lower than we'd like them to be, and perhaps some of our competitors, one factor, obviously, has been the market declines and some of the historical issues we've had. But the second issue, which is pretty important is, we are investing aggressively in that business, both the Cameron acquisition, the Rhythmia acquisition, the Atritech acquisition have all added significant investments in research and development and commercial operations. So that's important to understand. Now why does it change? Certainly, what you're seeing now is kind of the weight of all of those investments and not much of the return. So as we finish the R&D programs and as we get through kind of the commercialization investment and the revenue starts to take off in the back half of the year and into '14, you're going to see a pretty dramatic change in the profitability because right now it's weighed down by all those investments and not much revenue. And into the back half of this year, starting in the back half of this year and into next year, you get the release of some of that investment because we're through some of those programs, and then you start to get the revenue at pretty good margins. So that in combination with the revitalized portfolio of our core business, which frankly is doing very well if you look at kind of our results relative to at least St. Jude's on the core CRM side, we had a pretty good quarter relative to them. And then you look at our differentiated platforms, S-ICD, WATCHMAN getting into higher growth markets. The EP space is a focus for us with the Rhythmia acquisition and all of the investment we're doing at EP, as well as all the productivity initiatives. In the second quarter, we announced -- of '11, a restructuring program. And at the end of January, we announced an expansion of that program. A lot of that benefit from a cost perspective flows through the Rhythm Management business. So we expect to be able to grow that business, and with these new acquisitions kind of taking off in the back half of the year and next year to lead a significant operating margin improvement. So as you come back to kind of the 600 basis points of overall company margin improvement, we would expect that the CRM -- the Rhythm Management segment would benefit disproportionately from those programs and from those activities.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just real quick and last on the WATCHMAN Device. Do you guys anticipate having to go back before a panel or -- for approval?","Michael F. Mahoney","Hey, Ken, do you want to comment on that?","Ken Stein","Yes. Well, we're prepared to go to a panel if we have to, but I'm not going to speculate on what the FDA is going to decide in that regard. Obviously, the device has already been through a panel previously that did recommend approval.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","One on the P&L, one product question. Similar to a question that was asked earlier on R&D, Jeff, can you talk about the SG&A spending from an absolute standpoint? Last year, it actually trended down through the year. And second, on royalties, it was a little bit higher than we expected this quarter. Do you expect that to trend down as we saw last year? And then I just have one follow-up product-related question.","Jeffrey D. Capello","Okay. Well, so from an SG&A prospective, you're right, it did trend down as we went through the year in 2012. We do expect it to trend up slightly in Q2 and Q3 based on some of the commercialization investments that we're making to bring the TAVR product to market, which we expect to hit the market in the back half of the year; the Vessix product to the market; as well as a unit kind of rollout of Promus PREMIER in Europe now, and in the back half of the year, for the U.S. So we expect it to uptick slightly in Q2s and Q3s from a percentage perspective, so hopefully that's helpful. So that's from an SG&A perspective. From a royalty perspective, we do expect it to trend down in the back half of the year because what happens is the percentages, those tiers and the royalty arrangements, where you get to a certain tier of revenue, and the percentage actually drops. So if you sell more, the percentage goes down. As a result, the overall average percentage drops down as you go through the year. And that's consistent with pretty much every year.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then on the product question, another one on the Lotus Valve. Like Bruce, we've also heard positive things on the valve. So two-part question. One is, can you remind us of the rollout plan on the different sizes? And second, in the first study, there was a relatively high pacemaker rate, but it was a very small study, 4 out of 11. Do you guys think that you guys have addressed that and we would expect to see the pacemaker rate probably in line with other self-expanded transcatheter valve, such as a core valve pacemaker rate?","Michael F. Mahoney","Yes, Keith, you can make some comments. What we'll be shooting for CE Mark approval will be 2 valve sizes, the 23 and the 27 that you're hearing the results on, and we'll continue to expand the portfolio of valve sizes over the future. With respect to the pacemaker rate, we'll be presenting some data at the upcoming PCR. But in general, we would assume that the pacemaker rate would be in line with the core valve product.","Keith D. Dawkins","I'll just add, Larry, as you said in REPRISE I, that was a 11-patient study and there were 4 patients who have paced, but 2 of the pacemakers had not been used. And then, as Mike says, in EuroPCR in the late-breaking trial, we'll present the 30-day data from the first 60 of the 120 patients in REPRISE II to the CE Mark trial, and that will include the pacing data. It's not strictly a self-expanding valve, just to correct you there. It's not the same as a balloon expandable valve or a self-expanding valve. It's a hybrid valve. It's between one and the other.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from Brooks West with Piper Jaffray.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I wonder, Mike, if I could steer you back to the emerging markets, specifically the BRIC comments, can you talk about the scale of that business? And then can you talk about kind of the key product mix that's driving growth there?","Michael F. Mahoney","Sure. Within our BRIC markets, we continue to increase, not in dramatic ways, but we continue to increase the percent of the overall mix of revenue for BSC from BRIC. Historically, we've been at 3%, we moved up to 4%, now we're more approaching 5%. So it certainly is an important growth driver for us, and we expect to continue that 35% growth throughout the planning period here. I won't go through each country. We're very strong in Brazil. We're getting much stronger in China. We're building solid bases of business in India and Russia. And most often, our Interventional Cardiology, Endoscopy and Peripheral businesses are our large contributors of growth and operating income to those regions, those 3 business units. So we're obviously advancing all of our business units, but those 3 provide the greatest contribution.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","That's helpful. And then just 2 quick ones for Jeff. Can you speak to pricing trends in DES? We've been picking up some signals that maybe the pricing headwinds, especially in the U.S., had been getting worse? And then would you say anything on your exposure to the pelvic floor litigation that's been talked about recently?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes. So on the pricing trends, I would say that the -- we weren't encouraged by the pricing -- we -- encouragement had happened to us in terms of pricing in the first quarter. So we've been very conscious and have conceded some share historically to kind of walk away from situations where the price was not commensurate with the value we were delivering. And we'll continue to kind of be pretty disciplined, and I think that is actually getting slightly better for us. So I'd say pricing -- so obviously, you make that comment with a little bit of hesitation because you don't know what's going to happen, but we were encouraged by what we saw in the first quarter from a pricing perspective.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","And then on the -- just on the pelvic floor litigation?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes, like all litigation matters, we wouldn't comment on that specifically.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jose Haresco with JMP Securities.","Jose T. Haresco - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Let's see here, just following up on the pricing. Do you have -- on DES here in the U.S., do you have a sense of what factors could be leading to a better environment on the pricing side here in the U.S.? And can you contrast that with what you're seeing in Europe?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Well, I'd say certainly product differentiation is pretty important, right? If you back up 1 year, 1.5 years ago, you had 2 products that are completely identical in PROMUS and XIENCE, just different boxes. And so now, we certainly feel that our PROMUS Plus stent in the U.S. is better than anything on the market, and we're marketing it as such. And when we come out with Promus PREMIER, we think that's another step forward from a product prospective. So -- and we intend to sell the product for its value, and so we think that's what's driving some better comparables from a pricing dynamic perspective. Europe's a little bit more of a challenge given the macro factors and the austerity measures, that pricing erosion is a little higher upper-single digit, if not kind of low 10% over the board than that, and that's just all driven by the austerity measures.","Jose T. Haresco - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","A follow-up question on another subject. You mentioned you slightly picked up some share in the de novo implants in the first quarter. Is that a sustainable trend? And could you point at 1 or 2 things that are leading to that?","Michael F. Mahoney","On the de novo front, we launched a new platform in 2012, the INCEPTA-ENERGEN platform, that has differentiated features and price points based on the customers' objectives, and that continues to make good progress. And there are many compelling features on it, the top 3: One, is we still believe it's the small, thinnest device that patients enjoy; secondly, the longevity of the device and our significant warranties to back that up; and third, the lead reliability. So those are 3 features that we think are differentiated and we believe are helping to contribute to some of the positive share gains we're seeing in de novo ICD implants.","Okay, with that, we would like to conclude the call.

Good morning everyone. Boston Scientific continues to grow above market to prove our profitability, invest for the long-term, to address unmet patient needs and deliver differentiated financial performance. In the first quarter, our team delivered 7.8% operational revenue growth and 6.3% organic growth with another quarter balance across our businesses and geographic regions.","In addition, we leveraged our first quarter revenue growth to deliver 7% adjusted EPS growth to $0.35, within our guidance range despite a $0.01 charge related to the [mass market] (Ph) withdraw while generating $437 million in adjusted free cash flow.","We have high visibility to high single-digit organic growth for 2019. Even with the recent unforeseen regulatory headwinds this year related to Paclitaxel, Transvaginal Mesh and sterilization in Men\u2019s health. While we work diligently to offset these issues the cumulative effect to make delivering on the high end or beating our original full-year 2019 revenue guidance of 7% to 8.5% organic growth a lower probability.","As a result, we are lowering the top end of our growth guidance range by 50 basis points and our full-year 2019 operational revenue growth guidance is now 8% to 9%. And organic revenue growth guidance is now seven to eight.","We are pulling up the bottom of our full-year adjusted EPS guidance from a range of $1.53 to $1.58 to a range of $1.54 to $1.58, which represents 10% to 13% year-on-year growth, excluding the benefit of the 2018 IRS settlements.","With this 2019 growth outlook, we are excited for the rest of the year and our plans to build upon our global strengths and drive sustainable long-term revenue gains, double-digit EPS growth and to continue our momentum in 2020 and beyond.","Although we are proud of our results this quarter, we are disappointed that our first quarter operational growth of 7.8 and organic of 6.3 were 70 basis points below our guidance range or approximately $15 million shortfall with $5 million of that related to the mesh.","I will briefly address where we had some revenue softness in the quarter versus our plans as well as our plans to accelerate growth from here. First, although our PI business had strong growth this quarter at 11% organic, we did feel the impact of the Paclitaxel concerns, particularly in the second half of the first quarter after the release of the FDA's Advisory letter.","While the Eluvia launches Japan remains on-track, we do expect the slower adoption of Eluvia to persist in the U.S. and Europe in second quarter, and potentially throughout the second half. The June FDA Advisory Committee panel meeting will be a key next data point and we will continue our dialogue with FDA on Eluvia's unique design characteristics, which includes controlled local release of low dose Paclitaxel from a safe and proven polymer as well as clinical superiority data.","However, we are assuming ongoing headwinds and cut in half our Eluvia revenue expectations for 2019 to reflect the current landscape. In Euro pH, we plan to overcome some of the recent headwinds, we delivered a decent quarter for Urology Public Health businesses at 14% operational and 5% organic growth despite two unanticipated events. In first quarter, we are impacted by an unexpected Illinois South - state mandated shutdown of a third-party sterilizer used for Men\u2019s health product lines.","Fortunately, the U.S. situation has been resolved and we did receive FDA approval late March to conduct sterilization of these products at our own in-house facilities. But we do expect softness in global supply during the second quarter and we will return to full supply by the end of the second quarter.","Regarding Transvaginal Mesh for organ prolapse. Last week news will result in a full-year 2019 negative impacts of $30 million to global revenue in a $0.02 charge to adjusted EPS. A portion of this was booked in first quarter including a five million sales reserve and related inventory write offs, for nearly a $0.01 impact to adjusted EPS.","The mesh market withdrawal represents a 30 basis point dragged to both first quarter and full-year 2019 organic growth and lastly we did see some softness in our U.S. SCS business versus our internal plans.","Global Neuroma delivered a strong quarter with 12% organic growth and we believe SCS remains a very strong and underpenetrated market in the second half of this year, we are excited to release new clinical data on WaveWriter, and launch additional enhancements to both SCS and DBS platforms.","I will now provide some additional highlights in the quarter and our full 2019 outlook. So recently, we delivered strong and balanced operational growth with Asia Pac up 10, Europe up eight and the U.S. up seven. Emerging markets revenue grew 22% operationally, led once again by strong China growth. We also delivered balanced organic growth across all our businesses, 7% in both med surge and cardiovascular, 6% in rhythm and neuro.","Turning to some of the businesses, we delivered 8% organic growth in endoscopy, which is broad based and fueled by infection prevention performance, as well as excellent results in a Biliary portfolio driven by the AXIOS Stent in the recent launch of SpyGlass Digital II.","In addition, the quarter reflects strong early launch results in ORISE Gel, a key component of our Endoluminal Surgery portfolio and our new Jagwire Revolution Guidewire and for the balance of the year we expect continuous strength in Endoscopy sales to the ongoing ramp of these new product launches as well as the ORCAPOD single use valve.","Importantly, we remain on-track for a year in 2019 launch of our Exalt-D Single-Use Duodenoscope, which is use in ERCP procedures. We believe the Exalt-D can help meet a significant unmet need for hospitals and patients.","And two weeks ago the U.S. FDA issued a safety communication regarding sculpt reprocessing. Preliminary results of the FDA report indicated higher than expected levels of contamination up to 5.4% of samples tested positive for organisms of high concern, such as E-coli and multidrug resistant pathogen.","The FDA also stated that there continues to be a need for improvement of the safety of reprocess Duodenoscope, and noted that in addition to its March 2018, warning letters to reusable scope manufacturers agency continue to encourage the development of new technology and design features.","The Exalt model D Single-Use scope has been designed to address this exact issue by eliminating scope disinfection challenges completely. This platform represents a significant opportunity in 2020 and beyond.","As mentioned, urology and public health grew 14% operationally and 5% organically in first quarter and reflects an approximate 200 basis point negative impact from mesh sales reserves, recorded in first quarter. LithoVue led sales in our Cornerstone portfolio, and - the urology acquisitions of Augmenix and NxThera are both executing the plan.","Resume results were reinforced by publication of four year trial data with a low 4.4% surgical retreatment rate and no newer adverse events noted between years three and four, as well as the initiation of a resume specific TPT code for physician reimbursement on January 1st.","As mentioned, we expect softer Uro PH revenue in second quarter given the Men\u2019s health sterilization impact, and the remaining 25 million expected negative revenue impact in Q2 to Q4 to the global removal of mesh products for public organ prolapse.","However, we do expect Uro PH revenue growth to be accretive to the company average in second half and full-year 2019 as core growth remains robust. The mental sterilization matters resolved and recent acquisitions of NxThera and Augmenix anniversary and become organic as of May and October respectively.","Within the Neuro grew 6% in the quarter led by 12%, growth in neuromod, 10 and EP and three in cardiac rhythm management, which are all organic. The 12% neuromodulation revenue growth was driven by continued gains in the U.S. by our WaveWriter Spinal Cord Stimulation, and Vercise Deep Brain Stimulation platforms.","Global FEF sales were up 7% as WaveWriter's unique ability to offer combination waveform therapies, both for Paresthesia and sub perception continues to resonate the physicians and patients. And we look forward to improve growth with upcoming new product enhancements and the presentation of updated one year real world data on WaveWriter at INS later this quarter. And in GBS, we anticipate to continue the precise momentum as we roll off a Cartesia Directional Leads in the U.S. and expect MRI labeling in the second half.","Global cardiac rhythm management sales grew above market at 3% organic led by mid single-digit growth in defib sales, against a double-digit comparison, reflecting ongoing uptake of our RESONATE platform and its heart logic heart failure alerts, as well as strong growth of Emblem SICD.","Our device replacement cycle is also tracking to expectations and we are now the number two global share player in the high voltage market. Pacer sales did decline mid-single-digits, which is a significant improvement compared to 2018 trends, which will low double-digit declines.","We anticipate a modest pacer headwind for full-year 2019 and importantly, we aim to more than offset this with continued global presentation of our defib portfolio in both CRT-D and ITD, resulting in another year of above market worldwide TRM growth.","EP sales grew 10% organic in the quarter led by the Arrhythmia HDX mapping and navigation platforms as well as uptake of our direct sense catheter in Europe and enthusiasm for RHYTHMIA LUMIPOINT points software.","In AFib single-shot market, we are excited about the progress made by both our Cryo and our balloon programs. We are working to secure CE mark approval for these technologies and begin U.S. IDE enrollments by year-end 2019, pending completion of program deliverables and discussions with FDA. Last month, presented compelling Apama data set, AF-FICIENT 1, demonstrating the excellent balloon performance, no adverse events and attractive procedure times.","Turning to cardiovascular the group, they grew 7% organic and first quarter 2019.Peripheral interventions grew 11% organic in the quarter led by the Eluvia DS launch in the U.S. and double-digit growth in interventional oncology and arterial.","We are also excited about the anticipated upcoming FDA approval and launching the Vici Viniti stent which comes from the VENITI acquisition of last August. And despite the Paclitaxel headwind, we also expect our PI business will deliver full-year 2019 organic growth that is well accretive to the Company's overall growth rate.","To update you on the BTG acquisition, we remain on-track for mid-year closing, have been received shareholder approval in February. And we are excited for the opportunity to expand our PI and interventional oncology portfolio.","And lastly, BTG reported results for the first 12 months ended March 31st. Oncology and vascular sales grew 15% to 17% in-line with BTG's guidance, spec pharma sales grew double-digit ahead of guidance and royalty revenues was probably flat versus the prior year period, reflecting the launch of U.S. generic competition for ZYTIGA.","Our interventional cardiology business grew 6% operationally and 5% organically in the quarter. Growth in Q1 was led by strong structural results in mid-teens growth and complex PCI products, offset by softness and drug-eluting stents.","We expect overall interventional cardiology growth to accelerate from first quarter on due to strong growth in complex coronary products, easing DES comps, the launch of Promus ELITE and U.S. approval LOTUS Edge and the continued momentum of structural heart with our broader portfolio, capabilities and scale.","WATCHMAN had another excellent quarter as we continue to increase utilization and to expand WATCHMANs international footprint and we are pleased with the March European launch of NextGen WATCHMAN FLX. We also received Japan approval of WATCHMAN during the quarter. To remain on-track for reimbursement approval and commercial launch in Japan during the third quarter for WATCHMAN.","Our ACURATE TAVR valve platform is the fastest growing valve in Europe and delivered nearly 30% growth in the quarter. We plan to begin enrollment in our US IDE for ACURATE neo2 around mid-year with similar European launch timing. We also began a controlled commercial launch of LOTUS Edge in Europe late in first quarter and also enrolling patients in REPRISE IV intermediate risk study and also received FDA approval last night for LOTUS.","We will begin to control the U.S. launch immediately and we believe LOTUS Edge is a differentiated value that will be sought after by physicians and operators both as a workforce valve as well as the valve that can be counted on to provide superior outcomes in complex cases, like heavy calcified native valves and bicuspid valves.","And finally, the SENTINEL cerebral embolic protection device continues to build excellent momentum. We are now in more than 200 accounts with SENTINEL where usage rate exceed 60% and we believe that protected TAVR is an emerging standard of care. So the combined strength of WATCHMAN, ACCURATE, LOTUS Edge and SENTINEL position us well to deliver on our guidance for 700 to 725 million in structural heart revenue in 2019.","For the close, I would like to share again my enthusiasm for our outlook in 2019 and beyond and we believe that Boston Scientific continues to be uniquely positioned to drive shareholder value due to our long-term growth profile, meaningful opportunity, improved margins, track record of recording double-digit adjusted EPS growth and our improving ability to deploy capital. So we are looking forward to discussing this outlook and our exciting technology pipeline at our investor day, which will be June 26th in New York.","I really want to thank again our employees once again for their winning spirit and their ongoing commitment to advancing science for life. And Dan will now provide a detailed review of our financials.","Daniel Brennan","Thanks, Mike. First quarter consolidated revenue of $2,493 billion, represents 4.8% reported revenue growth and 7.8% growth on an operational basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Our reported revenue reflects a $73 million headwind from foreign exchange, slightly unfavorable to the $60 million to $65 million headwind expected at the time of guidance.","Sales from the NxThera, Claret and Augmenix acquisitions contributed 150 basis points, roughly in-line with our expectations at the time of guidance, resulting in 6.3 organic revenue growth for the quarter. This 6.3% includes a negative 30 basis point impact from the mesh market withdraw.","Q1 adjusted EPS of $0.35 grew 7% over the prior year, and was within our guidance range. While there were several puts and takes to the P&L in the quarter, on balance they net to zero resulting in that $0.35 EPS number.","To summarize quickly, we had $0.02 in charges related to the mesh withdrawal and an investment impairment. And they were basically offset by the $0.02 net litigation benefit. While the costs of the make-hold call related to the February bond offering were offset by a lower tax rate. None of these items was included in the Q1, 2019 guidance.","The FX impact on adjusted earnings per share with immaterial as expected at the time of guidance. Adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 71.4%, below our guidance range of 72% to 73%. This represents a 90 basis point decline over the prior year, driven by product mix, particularly lighter sales in Men\u2019s health, neuromodulation and coronary drug eluting stents, as well as mesh related inventory reserves, and unfavorable manufacturing variances.","Adjusted SG&A expenses were $855 million, or 34.3% of sales in the quarter, down 120 basis points year-over-year, and outperforming our guidance range of 35% to 36%. The favorable result in SG&A was due to a combination of the operating expense reductions from ongoing optimization initiatives, as well as an approximate net $25 million non-recurring litigation related benefit in the quarter, including a portion of the Edwards Litigation Settlement.","Adjusted research and development expenses were $271 million in the first quarter, or 10.9% of sales at the high end of our range and up slightly year-over-year, due to additional mesh accruals related to the mesh withdrawal. Royalty expense was 0.6% of sales roughly flat versus the prior year.","As a result, Q1, 2019 adjusted operating margin of 25.6% increased 30 basis points year-over-year near the midpoint of our guidance range of 25% to 26%. If you normalize for the SG&A benefit from litigation, adjusted operating margin would have been approximately 24.6%, but then normalizing for the 40 basis point and negative impact from the mesh withdrawal places us back at the low end of our range. We are reiterating our full-year adjusted operating margin guidance of 26% to 26.5%, which represents a 50 to 100 basis point improvement over the 2018 rate of 25.5%.","Now, I will move below the line to interest another expense. Adjusted interest expense for the quarter was $83 million, this is a $22 million increase from Q1 2018 largely due to exercising the make-whole call to retire early are 2020 notes, given the favorable market conditions for our February public bond offerings.","Our average interest expense rate was 4.7% in Q1, 2019 compared to 4.1% in Q1 2018 and reflects the offering which totaled $4.3 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, the proceeds from which will impart be used to finance a portion of the proposed BTG acquisition. We remain committed to our BTG delivering goals targeting $1 billion in debt repayment with an 18 months post deal closing and a leverage ratio of 2.5 times debt-to-EBITDA within two years.","Adjusted other expense was $28 million in the quarter and includes a minor impairment related to one of our venture holdings. The remainder of adjusted other consists of dilution from our equity method investments and exchange losses related to our hedging program.","Our tax rate for the first quarter was 7.1% on a GAAP basis and 6.9% on an adjusted basis below our guidance range of approximately 11% for the quarter due to our higher than expected benefit from stock compensation accounting in the quarter, as well as a reduction in our estimated annual effective tax rate, which I will discuss as part of the full-year guidance.","Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $437 million, compared to $283 million in Q1 of last year. In the quarter, we used cash primarily to fund the closing of the Millipede acquisition. We continue to expect full-year adjusted free cash flow to be $2.2 billion.","We believe we are approaching the resolution of Mesh litigation with over 95% of all known claims now settled, or in the final stages of settlement. Our total legal reserve of which Mesh is included was $699 million as of March 31, 2019. In the quarter, the known claim count was essentially flat at 53,000. And we made cash payments of $2 million into the qualified settlement fund and still anticipate full-year payments into the fund to total $250 million, which would then resolve all significant existing contingencies. As a reminder, this liabilities released from our balance sheet as payments are made out of the qualified settlement fund to plaintiffs.","Capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2019 were $63 million. And we continue to expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $375 million to $400 million for the year as we build capacity, integrate acquisitions and position the Company for continued growth. We ended Q1 with 1,408 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding.","I will now walkthrough, guidance for Q2 and full-year 2019. And as a reminder, the guidance I'm providing does not include the proposed BTG acquisition, which is not yet closed. For the full-year, we expect 2019 reported revenue to be in the range of approximately 7% to 8%, with year-over-year growth of 7% to 8% on an organic basis, and an additional 110 basis points contribution from the NxThera, Claret and Augmenix acquisitions.","Given our Q1 results, and Q2 guidance, which I will discuss shortly, we fully recognize the implied acceleration in second half organic revenue growth to deliver on our full-year guidance. There are several significant drivers of this acceleration, including multiple anticipated key product launches, such as LOTUS Edge, which we received approval for last night, and VT in the U.S., Eluvia and WATCHMAN in Japan and Exalt-D globally.","We have continued momentum in our core, we will have enhanced supply in the Men\u2019s health and our SENTINEL products. We anniversary some of our 2018 acquisitions, which does turn organic in 2019. We have the April anniversary of the 2018 price cuts in Japan. And also the normalization of selling days in the first half versus second half of the year, also has a meaningful impact.","And while we expect the foreign exchange to be at $110 million to $120 million headwind to revenue for the full-year 2019. We continue to expect FX to be neutral to EPS for the year due to our hedging program.","There is no change to our expectations for adjusted gross margin as a percentage of sales to be in the range of 72% to 73% for the full-year. We expect a positive mix shift as Men\u2019s Health supply stabilizes SCS and DBS trends improve with new data and products and coronary the DES faces easier comps.","In addition, we will continue to execute on our ongoing standard cost reductions and also expect a positive full-year FX impact to adjusted gross margin of 50 basis points. We continue to expect full-year adjusted SG&A to be in the range of 34.5% to 35% of sales of 40 to 90 basis point improvement versus full-year 2018, but increasing slightly from Q1, due to the non-recurring litigation benefit in Q1. There is also no change to expectations for full-year adjusted R&D spend to be in a range of 10.5% to 11%. And the full-year royalty rate to remain at less than 1% of sales for 2019.","These target metrics imply a full-year 2019 adjusted operating margin in a range of 26% to 26.5% unchanged from prior guidance up 50 to 100 basis points versus 2018, consistent with the improvement goals, we outlined last September and positioning us well December and positioning us well to deliver on our long-term goal of 30% plus adjusted operating margin.","We now expect our full-year 2019 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 10%. This assumes an operational tax rate of approximately 11% before an approximately 100 basis points of benefit from the accounting standard for stock compensation, of which a significant portion was already recognized in Q1. This compares to our original full-year 2019 tax rate guidance of 12% after stock comp.","The 200 basis point improvement and our full-year adjusted tax rate reflects roughly 100 basis points of benefit from our current year geographic mix of profits, and another 100 basis points of benefit resulting from refined estimates following recently released proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations implementing Tax Reform.","We now expect below the line expenses which include interest payments, dilution from our venture capital portfolio and costs associated with our hedging program to be approximately three $325 million to $350 million dollars to the year, a slight increase from prior guidance, primarily due to the earlier than expected refinancing of the 2020 bonds in February to take advantage of favorable market conditions and a minor investment impairment both recorded in Q1.","Note that along with other relevant aspects of the P&L, we will update our below the line expense guidance after we close the BTG acquisition, as interest expense related to the acquisition is currently excluded from adjusted results. We also expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1,409 million shares for Q2 2019 and 1,410 million shares for the full-year 2019.","As Mike discussed, we are raising the low end of our full-year 2019 adjusted earnings per share guidance to $1.54, and maintaining the high end of $1.58. The go forward impact of reducing our Eluvia forecast by 50% basically offsets the Q2 to Q4 tax rate benefit. Minus $0.02 for Eluvia plus $0.02 for tax. And we have plans to offset the pain resulting from the loss mesh revenue in Q2 to Q4.","This $1.54 to $1.58 cent range represents 10% to 13% adjusted earnings growth, excluding the 2018 net tax benefits of $0.07 in the base. On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $1.09 to $1.13.","While there are a lot of moving parts and some noise in the quarter, our trajectory and targets for 2019 remains strong. 7% to 8% organic revenue growth, 50 to 100 basis points of margin expansion and double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth at all points in our guidance range.","Now turning to Q2 2019, we expect reported revenue growth to be in a range of approximately 5% to 7%.This represents year-over-year organic growth in a range of 6% to 7% with an additional 140 basis point operational growth contribution from NxThera, Claret and Augmenix.","Note that the NxThera acquisition anniversaries in April and therefore revenue from May and June is included in organic guidance. We expect the foreign exchange impact on Q2 revenue to be a $45 million to $50 million headwind.","For the second quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.37 to $0.39 per share, representing 6% to 12% growth, excluding the Q2 2018 net tax benefit of $0.6 in the base, and we do not expect any adjusted EPS impact from foreign exchange.","GAAP EPS for the second quarter is expected to be in a range of $0.23 to $0.25 per share. Please check our Investor Relations website for Q1, 2019 financial and operational highlights which outlines Q1 results as well as Q2 and full-year 2019 guidance, including P&L line item guidance.","With that, I will turn it back over to Susie who will moderate the Q&A.","Susan Lisa","Thanks, Dan. Kevin, let's open it up to questions for the next 30 minutes or so, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. Kevin, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator instructions] First question from the line of Bob Hopkins, Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Robert Hopkins","Well thank you, and good morning. So just one housekeeping item to start. Just to clarify, was there selling day difference in Q1?","Daniel Brennan","There was a slight selling day difference, we hadn\u2019t included in our forecast, but there was a slight selling day difference if you look at it. Like we did mention that is part of the acceleration into the second half, because there is a difference there where there is about a day fewer in the first half and a day more in the second half. So it\u2019s the reason for the acceleration, going first half to second half, but there was one in Q1, but we didn't mention it.","Robert Hopkins","Okay. Thank you for that. And then more importantly, just on the Q1 growth rate that was a little lower than your guidance. I think you called out stents and Men\u2019s health and neuromod, where they are kind of the primary culprits, if you will. I was just wondering if you could give a little more color on these issues, and whether or not these issues impacting growth in Q1 are temporary or lasting? Just a little more color on those three, please?","Michael Mahoney","Sure. Good morning, Bob. Yes, so obviously, don't take this slight revenue miss in first quarter lately. I think it\u2019s first time we've missed and - close to decades. And we pride ourselves in delivering our commitments and very excited about the future. But specific to a couple of those comments, one, intervention cardiology, you have seen that strong diversification with structural heart and complex coronary growing well, and DES has been softer for us.","We do anticipate some improvement in DES, as you look at the second half of the year particular based on improved comps for drug-eluting stents as well as new product portfolio with a product called the Elite, as well as really just the ongoing diversification, high growth markets for that basket in cardiology overall, so and then you obviously have the LOTUS approval.","Second one was Paclitaxel, we are seeing some usage in the U.S., but some IDNs are not using that based on the upcoming panels. If you saw some softness there, we took that revenue down for the full-year as highlighted. But today the Japan launch is right on-track.","You mentioned Men\u2019s Health, that issue has been resolved. That supply issues will be back to full supply, call it in mid June. So that will be strong for the second half of the year. And then the other one is spinal cord stim, we did grow nicely at 12% neuromod. We do feel like the market was a bit lighter in first quarter than we anticipated. But overall we see that as a strong growth market going forward and we continue to take share.","So there were clearly some one-time events in the first quarter. Dan mentioned the selling days impact as well. But we have full confidence in the second quarter guidance and the seven to eight organic for the full-year and we will be stronger Company as the year head into 2020.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from the line of David Lewis, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Lewis","Good morning, Mike and Dan, I will start with the forward outlook here. I think 2019 guidance is pretty consistent with our view. It's a second quarter, a lot of conversation this morning on second half, but if you think about the second quarter, how risk adjusted is the second quarter and you know what factors sort of provide the confidence given Eluvia and mesh get a little worse in the second quarter pretty significant momentum step up just into 2Q. So one, what is your confidence in second quarter? What are factors that drive that? And in 2019 guidance, broadly is the reflection or the reduction simply Eluvia and mesh or does it also reflect kind of a slower start to the year and then I have a quick follow-up?","Michael Mahoney","Yes, so just on the second one, in terms of the full-year guidance its simply, I said, in the words carefully. If you look at our history, we typically are in the higher end of the range, if not be on revenue really and of course, you guys track all that stuff.","And so we essentially lowered it to seven to eight, because we didn't feel the high end of the guidance or beating the 8.5 was as feasible as it was four months ago. So that is why we felt it was prudent to reduce the guidance of top end from seven to eight, so we can kind of carry on our tradition and the reasons for that were stated.","And we are confident that second half acceleration for Bob's earlier question. I think in terms of second quarter, we obviously have some visibility here. Its near the end of April, we spent a lot of time on our second quarter guidance, we don't plan on making this a habit, we plan on continuing a longer streak of hitting our guidance commitments.","But specific to second quarter, we do have good momentum across the regions. Our emerging markets are very strong. Dan mentioned there is a little bit of selling day favorability in second quarter as well.","But more importantly, launches. And we finally got FDA approval from LOTUS, which we are excited about Eluvia is beginning to sell in Japan, FLX in Europe, this Vici stent we have for PI. And we just have very good momentum with Accurate and Sentinel. And as I mentioned, also the DES comp.","So we spent a lot of time on second quarter as you could imagine, and on the full-year guidance even more than normal. Through that we had the right confidence conviction. So at the end of the year, we still believe that 7% to 8% and 8% to 9% operational, double-digit EPS is very good and sets us up for a bright future.","Operator","Thank you. Next question from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Rick Wise","Good morning. Hi, Mike, turning to LOTUS and talk to us a little bit about the LOTUS launch.","From two angles. I think if I remember correctly, there were 60 original pivotal U.S. sites. Is that where you start? Is that what you are targeting? Talk a little bit about, how you are going to address the U.S. market? And I will just go ahead and ask, separate related question. When might we see some more data on LOTUS Edge that specifically addresses where the technology is now? And last just on Sentinel, you say you are in 200 accounts? I mean, is this the place you start with LOTUS? Again, any color on the launch will be great, thank you so much.","Michael Mahoney","Sure. Thanks, Rick, and I will let Ian jump in on some of the data questions in a few minutes. We are really excited about getting LOTUS over the goal line here with the FDA and the LOTUS Edge. You know LOTUS Edge is a terrific platform, we have begun our launch in Europe, and essentially we will be primarily initially focused on many of the customers that were been involved in our clinical trials.","And they have more experience with LOTUS and LOTUS Edge is a lower profile delivery system. So obviously, we would spend quite a bit of time with those customers who have been part of the studies and are part of the current intermediate risk study and those represents a significant, slice of the of the tablet market.","So that will be our focus, and then we will expand out from there. We want to obviously do this very well, we think this is unique product. And we want to upgrade outcomes and so we will initiate there, then we will expand to the large centers beyond that and our clinical team and salesforce is obviously excited to bring this on.","SENTINEL is doing very well, quite frankly, our operations and manufacturing team has done a great job of increasing supply, we bought a smaller startup company. And we are significantly increasing the supply capacity, which has really been the limiter so far, because the demand of SENTINEL is quite high. And so we will continue to grow SENTINEL, likely at a faster rate in the second half given increased supply, and launch it a little bit more outside the U.S.","And as we talked about in the past, we have to win with the clinical benefits of our TAVR as a standalone platform with the safety and efficacy of it. And then we have all the other components surrounding LOTUS, which are compelling, like the Safari wire like SENTINEL, and our other products that meet the needs for interventional cardiologist.","But really excited about getting LOTUS approved. And Ian if you are unmute, maybe you could provide some views on the upcoming data.","Ian Meredith","Thanks very much, Mike, and thanks Rick for the question. So as you alluded to, we have the REPRIE IV study, which is the intermediary study, 896 patients, that trial is now underway in the U.S., and that will provide very important data to the safety and efficacy of the LOTUS Edge platform in intermediate risk patients.","That trial should recruit pretty quickly. It's a single arm study, there is a nested registry within NASH for 100 patients with bicuspid valve disease. And so we very much look forward to those results that probably be mid next year. As well as that we have the respond Edge trial, which be 200 patients in 16 sites in Europe, at trials just getting underway.","And of course, we have the REPRISE III registry, which was the U.S. initial experience with LOTUS Edge, which is underway and continues to recruit. So we should have towards the end of the year and next year, significant - data about the confirming the safety and efficacy that we've actually seen from the original LOTUS Edge 30 day data from the REPRISE, Edge and [FIMS A] (Ph) trials, of course, which showed as you know very good results on lower pacemaker rates.","Operator","And next question is from line of [Bruce Nadal] (Ph) of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question, I guess for Mike and Ian, I attended the CRT panel meeting in I think, February or January, and it really didn't - the Paclitaxel for vascular arguments really didn't seem to have a coherent mechanism of action. I was just wondering what your thoughts about that might be and secondly is the product family forever changes irrespective of the merits of the man analysis that really caused this whole thing and then I have a follow-up.","Ian Meredith","Mike, you are happy if I take it upon?","Michael Mahoney","Sure.","Ian Meredith","So thanks, Bruce. So I think it's an important question. It\u2019s disappointing to say really you know Paclitaxel has had a pretty still a 25 year history since their approval. And as you know from the taxes data we have an extraordinary body of data there in the coronary circulation where there were more than 5000 patients in randomized trials. 36,000 patients in registries, there was never an all course mortality signal at five and even the Sirtex trial after 10 years.","So there was from time-to-time signal for cardiovascular mortality related to stent thrombosis, but the overall mortality suggesting a non-cardiac cause just wasn't there and it doesn't seem to be a plausible explanation. So it is disappointing, but we will work very assiduously alongside the FDA and VIVA and NAMSA to make sure that we thoroughly analyze the signal in any available trials.","But we still have considerable confidence in the Paclitaxel as antirestenotic agent., and I think we should point out that the Eluvia in a sense a very differentiated product here is controlled focal relief at dose the 120 that is being used in DCB products. So we have site in this and we will work alongside the FDA, NAMSA and VIVA to elucidate this.","Unidentified Analyst","And I guess my follow-up is WATCHMAN, clearly the product has continued very strong momentum given the guidance. Could you just talk about the commercial factors, either reimbursement or marketing initiatives? Just kind of the stated play and what will take for really unlock the potential of what I think is a huge product opportunity.","Michael Mahoney","Sure. Yes, just again, just to reinforce Ian's point, we think Eluvia is a superior platform, we think it's different in the class. And so we are making the case on that. And obviously, we are supporting the industry in the whole Paclitaxel theme, with the upcoming panel. But we spend a lot on this platform, we feel like it's a unique device, for all the characteristics that Ian said, we will be pushing our point in that regard.","On WATCHMAN, it continues to do extremely well. In the U.S., we are increasing utilization rates. It's less about opening up new centers now in the U.S., because so many have been opened up, it's more about increasing utilization, its driving great outcomes. It's increasing physician awareness through our digital efforts and through working with the WATCHMAN coordinators at the hospitals. And so we are continuing to see WATCHMAN utilization expand with our commercial organization our clinical organization.","And then, in Europe, you are seeing WATCHEMAN Flex be launched which we are really excited about to gain share, not as big market in Europe, but also a lot of progress in China. And we are really excited about the launch, which will impact the second half in Japan.","And Ken, do you want to maybe speak to some of the clinical efforts with WATCHMAN extend the market the Option trial?","Kenneth Stein","Yes, thanks, Mike. That is, important to mention Bruce. What unlocks it, I think the next step, right, that unlocks it is indication expansion. And so we are launching a trial called Option, 1600 patient randomized trial at roughly 100 centers globally. And the trial is in patients following atrial fibrillation ablation, who have indications for stroke prevention. And will be randomized to WATCHMAN or NOAC. And this would change the indication, you know this will be the first trial where WATCHMAN would be used in patients who are explicitly candidates for either an oral anticoagulant or the WATCHMAN device.","Michael Mahoney","Thanks Bruce.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Jason Mills, Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","Jason Mills","Hi, Mike, thanks for taking the question. With respect to the organic growth profile you laid out in the acceleration that you are anticipating through the end of the year, the tenants of that premise seems like they would continue into the first half of next year. And I can appreciate that you are not ready to give guidance for next year yet. But as we digest that, coupled with the metrics you laid out with respect to BTG, I assume your expectations for the organic growth that BTG will generate haven't changed given their strong results recently. So it seems like it's setting up that this could accelerate further in the first half of next year, what I'm getting at is as we look at a forward 15 to 18 months. Can you give us any color or you willing to give us any color as it related to just beyond the end of this year where it seems like it could accelerate further.","Michael Mahoney","I want to give first quarter 2020 and second quarter 2020 guidance. But, you will not let me at this point especially after our little miss here on sales in the first quarter.","Dan laid out in his script clearly why we are confident in the second half momentum through the product launches that he rattled off the anniversary of the M&A activities. Another significant opportunity for us in second half is Japan.","Japan will return to strong growth in the second half because of new product launches, and less pricing cuts than we have experienced in the past, and the supply challenges are significantly better to some of those key products. And Dan has also mentioned the selling day. That is the second half acceleration.","And then I'm not going to comment really much beyond that, in 2020 what you will see is a full-year benefit in 2020 of many of these different product launches that are happening kind of a different quarters throughout the year in 2019.","But our goal would be continued to be a Top Tier revenue grower in the future to deliver double-digit EPS growth. And we are excited about BTG, they put up really nice results, very consistent with our thesis when we acquired the company. So we look forward to closing that likely in the late June, July timeframe.","Operator","And next question is from the line of Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Larry Biegelsen","Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. I will ask both of mine upfront. on Eluvia I can understand, the 50% cut implied in the guidance. But look, and hopefully the panel will go well. But the question I have, I guess is if things don't go as well as expected what is your ability to offset a further reduction in Eluvia, if things don't go well. And then just Secondly, you know, I heard your comment on SCS and your business in the market. But you are the second Company to report a meaningful deceleration in SCS growth. So could you just put a little bit more meat on the bone kind of around what is going on in the market and why you are confident that we won't see further deceleration in SCS, which you kindly gave in the slides today, grew about 7% year-over-year in Q1. Thanks for taking the questions, guys.","Michael Mahoney","Yes. So Eluvia is an important growth driver for PI. And we clearly aren't giving up on it, because we think it's a uniquely good product that helps patients. And we are seeing many customers in the U.S. continue to use it. Some have not, but many are. And in Japan, we are launching, essentially right now.","So we remain optimistic, but also smart. That is why you saw us take down the guidance for Eluvia in terms of that impact. But there is also many growth drivers within PI business on its own. For example, this new Vici stent we will be launching likely in the second quarter once the FDA approved and the full impact of BTG and all the synergies that come with that both revenue and cost.","So, we clearly want Eluvia to do very well. But there is many growth drivers within PI and across the Company that give us a confidence for the second half guidance that we - or full-year guidance that we gave, as well as outlook for 2020.","The second question is, yes. It was a bit softer than we anticipated in the first quarter, this traditionally been a strong double-digit growth market, and we believe that will be the case although first quarter was a bit softer. So we haven't seen any somatic reasons why SCS should be bit softer this quarter, given the unmet patient demand that we see out there.","One potential possibility where this - kind of fewer large product launches from BSC and our competitors over the past six months, I think you will to see a ramping up of that clearly from us on the second half of this year with new enhancements to wave riders and some more clinical data.","So we don't really have a great response. And then we feel like it's a long-term, at minimum high single-digit growth, but more likely, double-digit growth market, given the unmet patient need. And importantly, this is a lot of innovation in this space, which I think will continue to excite patients to one act.","Operator","Thank you. And next question from the line of Vijay Kumar, Evercore. Please go ahead.","Vijay Kumar","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. So Mike, maybe just, on Larry's questions. If I think about the first half versus second half, right it is I guess Sterigenics improved, the sterilization plant closure, do we know what the impact of fact in Q1 was? And I guess specifically, if the Adcom goes back, is there a chance that, maybe Eluvia needs to be cut again, in for the back half?","Michael Mahoney","Well, we gave guidance assuming bad things. So, we gave what we felt very conservative, we built in our model very conservative growth for Eluvia based on the Paclitaxel panel, that wouldn't be responsible to do otherwise. So, as I mentioned, we are seeing that the launch in Japan, we are seeing customers use it today. But we've assumed far less than planned Eluvia sales in our second quarter and full-year guidance.","Vijay Kumar","Thank you.","Michael Mahoney","And we are not going to quantify the specifics of the sterilization issue in Men\u2019s health in the quarter.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Matt Taylor, UBS. Please go ahead.","Matthew Taylor","Hi thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow-up on the earlier question on the LOTUS launch and sort of a two part thing, but wanted to understand how we should think about the pace of launch in Europe, in the U.S. and you didn't hit the timelines for the timing of launch in each region. I just wanted to make sure that you are still sort of on-track with where you thought you would be in the beginning of the year. And then can you characterize how the Sentinel supply to improve through the year, it sounds like where you can sell it you are seeing good uptake?","Michael Mahoney","Yes. So consistent with previous comments on LOTUS, we are selling our ACURATE valve extremely well in Europe, and we are also selling LOTUS, you are going to see that mix likely be higher with the ACURATE valve versus LOTUS in Europe, given the momentum that we have there. But there are many customers who want LOTUS in Europe.","So be able to sell in both places. But in terms of a mix, which we likely won't break out, it will be quite a bit higher in the U.S. versus Europe. And so that is why this FDAs approval is important for us. It's kind of unscheduled for our commitments, but you will see greater waiting in the U.S.","And SENTINEL simply just the Ops team has done a great job of enhancing supply, because we've been more limited in our ability to open up new centers. And so as this quarter goes on, and second half will be open up new centers and supply them with it.","And then we will be able to expand it more in Europe and other countries, which quite frankly, haven't had the benefit of using it given some supply capacity. So it's not - our Ops team did nothing wrong. They simply bought a small company and now there are significant increase in the capacity for it.","Operator","Thank you, next question is from the line of Chris Pasquale, Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Okay, that question dropped. The next question is from the in-line of Daniel Catenacci, SVB Leerink. Please go ahead.","Daniel Catenacci","Hey, guys, good morning. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Just a quick question - follow-up on some of the TAVR conversation you have been having. Can you talk about what you are seeing now that you relaunched LOTUS from a pricing perspective in Europe, and what you expect to see in the U.S. So now it\u2019s going from a two player market to a three player market, potentially since you are four player market here in the U.S. So we just love to get your high level thoughts and any color you can give on how you plan to price LOTUS Edge here in the U.S. relative to some of your competitors. Thanks so much.","Michael Mahoney","Yes. We are probably not going to give as much as you want on a question. I think, in the U.S., we are very confident that capabilities of LOTUS valve This is not a low tier segment offering and so you will see LOTUS priced at competitive race with a market in the U.S.","Daniel Catenacci","And just to follow-up on that. So is it priced competitively in Europe as well or is it priced at a discount?","Michael Mahoney","Well, we won\u2019t provide much thought there. Now with LOTUS we offer two different valves in Europe. And so they are both uniquely good and it provides us some contracting capabilities on the SENTINEL which are helpful, but at the end of the day, the valve does need to stand alone in terms of its clinical efficacy, the safety and the benefits.","You know, doctors typically aren't going choose a tidy valve just because it costs less money. And so we are delivering very good outcomes with ACURATE, you have seen a lot of clinical data there and also LOTUS. So pricing obviously is important, but it's a different environment to drug-eluting stent.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Matthew O'Brian, Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Two real quick here. In the past you said in the TAVR marketing side, you get the 20% share and you kind of back off that with LOTUS withdrawal and then now you have SENTINEL which is pretty differentiated. So as you think about where you are share can go over time with kind of this triple threat now would you like to revisit? Where do you think to share can get to? And specifically do you think you can get 20%? And then the second question is just on Ranger, as we think about the launch next year with all the Paclitaxel commentary just how should we think about that launch now, should be back by our expectations for it. Thanks so much.","Michael Mahoney","Yes, Ranger. Is a smaller revenue contributor historically in Europe. And Ranger will - I think the panel will certainly have an influence on the potential for Ranger. But again, I think our PI businesses blessed with many growth drivers across the board. And then also with BTG closing.","We wouldn't comment on share. Right now we just get zero in the U.S. so it's all upside. And so you know, with the indication expansions, and we've seen the clinical data and the size of this market, and the uniqueness of LOTUS in our breaths of commercial coverage. We feel like we can do a nice job in this area, but we are not going to provide a share goal publically.","Susan Lisa","Alright. With that, we would like to conclude the call.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ms. Susie Lisa. Please go ahead.","Susan Lisa","","Thank you, Linda. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q1 2014 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading, Financial Information.","The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Mike will begin our prepared remarks with an update on our business progress and his perspectives on the quarter. Dan will then review our overall Q1 2014 financial results as well as guidance for full-year 2014 and the second quarter of 2014. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Dawkins and Dr. Stein.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate and other similar words.

Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs and 8-Ks filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them.","At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike?","Michael F. Mahoney","","Thank you, Susie, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll begin today with some highlights regarding our first quarter performance and then provide some thoughts on our 2014 outlook. Dan will then review the financials and 2014 guidance and then we\u2019ll take your questions. So please note that in my remarks, all references to growth are on a year-over-year basis constant currency unless otherwise specified.","So, overall we had a very good first quarter and we\u2019re off to a strong start in 2014. Our plans for the year are to deliver full-year 2014 sales growth in the 3% to 5% range. Importantly, our sales growth will be leveraged to double-digit EPS growth. And we are increasing our full-year 2014 EPS guidance, for which Dan will provide further details.","I am pleased that we delivered continued revenue growth in first quarter, along with improved profitability. This represents the fourth straight quarter of operational revenue growth as we continue to build momentum and deliver on our commitments.","Our 4% operational revenue growth in first quarter and continued focus on margin improvement helped drive adjusted EPS of $0.20, which exceeded the high-end of our guidance and represents 21% growth. As we continue to execute on our strategic plan, I like to provide several key highlights from the first quarter and discuss key expectations for \u201814.","Starting with MedSurg, MedSurg had another excellent quarter. Our MedSurg businesses benefit from the continued high growth in Neuromodulation, as well as strong results in both Urology and Women\u2019s Health and Endoscopy. Within our Cardiovascular group, we are encouraged by the return to operational revenue growth posted by our global Interventional Cardiology team. We look forward to accelerating our IC growth given our strong pipeline and global commercial reach.","Our Peripheral Interventions business delivered another quarter of above-market growth, driven by strong international performance. Our Rhythm Management group benefited from C.R. Bard's EP acquisition. Yet, our worldwide Cardiac Rhythm Management business slowed in first quarter. We aren\u2019t satisfied with this performance and we believe results will improve given the momentum behind S-ICD globally, and the recent X4 CRT-D platform in Europe, as well as our recently approved ICD and CRT-D products in the U.S.","We also continue to execute on our strategic imperative driving global expansion. International sales were particularly strong, growing 8% as we continue to successfully broaden our portfolio and capabilities beyond the U.S.","To drill down a bit, we\u2019re very encouraged by our pan-BSC European results in the quarter with 10% sales growth. In addition, we delivered 22% revenue growth in the emerging markets. Our emerging markets are steadily increasing in scale and now represent 9% of total company sales. And we are well on our way to our goal of 15% of total sales generated in the emerging markets.","I\u2019ll now highlight the key drivers of our business unit performance for the first quarter and our \u201914 outlook. So, starting with MedSurg, our three businesses continue to grow operational revenue faster than their respective markets. These businesses are expanding globally and investing in meaningful innovation, which in combination, help accelerate the diversification of the Boston Scientific portfolio.","Urology and Women\u2019s Health posted a strong start to the year with high-single digit revenue growth, led by strong international sales. And our Urology growth has been fueled by investments we have made in physician training and expanded product registrations in urology. Endoscopy delivered solid performance in what has historically been our slowest quarter in Endoscopy. The division benefited from strong uptake of the endoscopic ultrasound slimline needle, continued demand for our hemostasis clips and biliary devices and strong emerging markets growth.","Regarding Alair, our bronchial thermoplasty platform for the treatment of patients with severe asthma, this continues to experience strong reorder rates and consistent case-by-case approvals by many large commercial insurers. However, Alair is not likely to contribute meaningfully to total company sales until we\u2019re able to gain positive coverage policies from major U.S. payers. Reimbursement has taken longer than we anticipated, but we believe that a robust data portfolio combined with increased usage will ultimately prevail. In the first quarter, we completed our first BT cases in China and our regulatory submission in Japan is receiving an accelerated review. ","Neuromodulation; this business had another terrific quarter. Our neuromod team continues to gain global share driven by the industry-leading Precision Spectra platform. Our Precision Spectra spinal cord stimulation system is designed to provide improved pain relief to a wide range of patients with chronic pain, and it\u2019s also easier for physicians and patients to use.","We anticipate that our neuromod business will continue to grow faster than the market and gain share throughout 2014 globally. However, due to changes in reimbursement and challenging year-over-year growth comparisons as we anniversary Spectra\u2019s launch, we anticipate that our growth rate in Neuromodulation will taper in the coming quarters.","Beyond spinal cord stimulation, we announced the launch of an important international clinical registry to evaluate both clinical outcomes and economic benefits of deep brain stimulation using our Vercise DBS System in Parkinson's disease patients.","So now let\u2019s turn to Cardiovascular. We\u2019re really pleased with our improved progress and a return to growth in the quarter. However, we have numerous opportunities to improve upon this performance. Our global IT performance was led by double-digit growth in Europe, which is encouraging given the recently expanded launch of our complex coronary care portfolio and our SYNERGY stent system. We believe we are well positioned to improve our global IC performance throughout the year due to a number of factors.","First is the U.S. launch of the Promus PREMIER drug-eluting stent, which has recently captured the leading number one market share position in the U.S; the upcoming launch of Promus PREMIER in Japan; and the expanded European launch of our SYNERGY stent system; and the recent launch of the REBEL bare-metal stent in Europe.","I\u2019ll also add that our Structural Heart franchise is really beginning to build momentum and strengthen internationally. It\u2019s still early, but we\u2019re seeing very positive momentum from our recent Lotus TAVR launch in Europe. The Lotus Valve is being well received by European physicians and we\u2019re planning to expand our launch and training capabilities throughout the year.","90-day follow-up from our Lotus REPRISE II CE Mark trial was presented at the recent ACC Conference and demonstrated excellent results with 85.4% of patients demonstrating zero or trace para-valvular aortic regurgitation. We also look forward to the presentation of the six months REPRISE II follow-up data on Lotus at the upcoming EuroPCR next month, as well as initiating the REPRISE III U.S. IDE trial later this year.","Also within Structural Heart, WATCHMAN, our left atrial appendage closure device, continues to build momentum in Europe. And in the U.S., our goal for WATCHMAN approval is mid-2014 and we look forward to expanding patient access to this truly innovative stroke prevention treatment.","Peripheral Interventions delivered solid growth yet again and continues to expand its global capabilities. The consistent success of our PI business is driven by leadership positions in balloons, stents and interventional oncology. We\u2019re excited about the upcoming launch of our drug-coated balloon in the second half of the year in certain European markets.","So, turning to resistant hypertension, we continue to receive positive feedback in the international markets on the unique benefits and differentiation of our second-generation multi-point platform. We continue to train physicians and sell Vessex to treat patients with resistant hypertension in those markets where Vessex is approved. However, we have seen a slowdown in the European resistant hypertension market post to SYMPLICITY HTN-3 publication.","In terms of our U.S. trial strategy, we\u2019re carefully examining the available data post the ACC meeting and we\u2019re working collaboratively with our scientific advisory boards and others to determine the best next steps for our clinical program. In addition, we are investing in the Vessex platform and other emerging opportunities, including atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure.","So, finally I move to our Rhythm Management group, which includes our Cardiac Rhythm Management and EP divisions. So starting with EP, we\u2019re continuing to enhance our portfolio and build capabilities to compete more effectively in this large and fast-growing market. The integration of the former Bard EP business is proceeding on track, and we completed the alignment of the global commercial teams.","We are excited about the potential of our IntellaTip MiFi therapeutic catheter platform, which features MicroFidelity sensors embedded at the tip of the catheters. The sensors provide high-resolution to assist physicians with better assessment of catheter tip location, tissue characteristics, and ablation feedback. MiFi XP recently launched in the U.S. and we expect to launch in Europe this quarter. ","Another important expected product launch is our Rhythmia Mapping System where we continue to see high levels of customer interest. We anticipate first commercial sales of Rhythmia in Europe later in second quarter and in the U.S. in third quarter. We expect to see improved performance in EP in the second half of \u201914, led by these new product launches and synergies from our broader rhythm management capabilities.","Turning to our Cardiac Rhythm Management business, it\u2019s been a very positive quarter in terms of S-ICD uptake and new product approvals that we believe will benefit our CRM business for the long run. However, in first quarter, our global CRM sales pulled back and declined slightly. We believe that we continue to gain share in de novo ICDs, but these gains were offset in Q1 due to continued headwinds from our CRT-D and quad in the U.S., Japan and Australia markets.","The uptake of S-ICD in the first quarter was very positive. The launch is proceeding ahead of plan and the physician training events continue to be at full capacity. We continue to roll out the technology globally and for the full-year 2014, we are targeting an S-ICD revenue contribution north of $75 million.","In first quarter, a positive interim analysis from our EFFORTLESS S-ICD registry was published with 456 patients and a mean follow-up of 558 days. This long-term large patient dataset demonstrated results comparable to trans-venous ICDs in terms of inappropriate shock rates of6.4% and a 100% conversion of spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias.","Finally, on S-ICD, from a reimbursement standpoint, we are pleased this quarter to receive the positive coverage decision from the multi-state commercial insurer, Health Net, and we expect others to follow shortly. In pacing, overall, our pacing franchise posted essentially flat sales in a market that we believe was down slightly.","Our global CRM team is executing on a number of very important product approvals that will further strengthen our rhythm management portfolio. During the quarter, we launched new MRI compatible products in Japan and Europe. In Europe, we launched two key CRM product lines; our quad line of X4 CRT-Ds and ACUITY X4 leads, as well as our next-gen pacemaker lead, INGEVITY, which is MRI conditionally safe.","In Japan, we launched our MRI-compatible INGENIO and FINELINE II system with promising early results. Importantly, we\u2019re very excited about to have recently announced the approval of a new defib platform in the U.S. We\u2019re launching a brand new product called the MINI ICD Platform, which now offers physicians and patients, the smallest and thinnest ICD available in the market. So, MINI has a total cam volume of just 26 CCs, which is 13% to 20% smaller than the best competitive devices.","We also received approval of our X4 quad pulse generator. This new CRT-D generator will be successfully coupled with competitive quad pole leads to offer patients and physicians new and unique CRT-D therapy benefits, including a thinner profile, more pacing vector options, and industry-leading battery longevity.","And, so in summary our team is delivering upon a comprehensive portfolio that offers EPs and their hospitals meaningful solutions for their patients at risk of sudden cardiac arrest. We look forward to discussing our rhythm management technology with you in more detail at the investor events we\u2019re hosting at May 8 in San Francisco in connection with the Annual Heart Rhythm Society Meeting.","So, to wrap up the first quarter, overall we\u2019re off to a very good start and we\u2019re pleased with our first quarter performance. We\u2019re competing in a challenging and dynamic marketplace, but we\u2019re encouraged by our growth opportunities in front of us.","In addition, we believe there is ample room for improved operating performance across many of our businesses and regions. We\u2019re expanding our global capabilities and further diversifying the business. And as highlighted by our recent CRM approvals, we are delivering meaningful innovation that provides both unique value and economic savings to the healthcare system.","We continue to expect to generate strong cash flow which we believe will support an allocation of capital that is aligned with our strategic priorities while enabling us to maintain sufficient flexibility. So, again to summarize, our plans are to deliver full-year 2014 sales growth in the 3% to 5% range. Importantly, our sales growth will be leveraged to deliver double-digit EPS growth and we are increasing our full-year 2014 EPS guidance. Finally, I\u2019d like to thank our employees for their winning spirit and their commitment to Boston Scientific.","Now, let me turn our call over to Dan Brennan, our CFO, for a more detailed review of our financials and \u201814 guidance. ","Daniel J. Brennan","","Thanks Mike. I\u2019ll start with some overall perspective on the quarter before diving into the details. We generated adjusted EPS of $0.20, compared to $0.16 in Q1 of 2013, and ahead of our guidance range of $0.16 to $0.18. Similar to the Q4 results, the improved profitability in Q1 was driven by operational revenue growth and continued gross margin expansion, which was up 260 basis points year-over-year. ","In addition, this quarter saw lower R&D spend, which was down 80 basis points year-over-year, due to the timing of some projects and a focus on R&D efficiency. These improvements were partially offset by SG&A spend on investments in our strategic growth initiatives and our core product launches. Overall, we posted an adjusted operating margin of 20%, which represents 220 basis points of improvement year-over-year and 140 basis points quarter-over-quarter.","We\u2019re encouraged by this level of profitability in Q1 as we remain focused on delivering our goal of 25% adjusted operating margin by 2017, and view these results as a signal that our strategies and programs are working. We believe we remain on track to achieve our profitability goals.","Below the operating income line, a $7 million gain on investments and a slightly lower-than-expected effective tax rate, along with a 1% reduction in shares outstanding from a year ago, resulted in adjusted EPS of $0.20 or 21% year-over-year growth.","In addition, we generated adjusted free cash flow of $168 million in the quarter and operating cash flow of $198 million. We used $125 million or 63% of that operating cash flow to repurchase approximately 10 million shares in the quarter.","While we are pleased with the execution against these goals, particularly with respect to continued operational revenue growth, which we\u2019ve now posted for four straight quarters, as well as improved profitability and a 20% adjusted operating margin, we believe we still have substantial future operating leverage and remain focused on delivering our 25% adjusted operating margin goal by 2017.","Now, I\u2019ll provide a detailed review of our Q1 business performance and operating results. For the first quarter of 2014, consolidated revenue of $1,774 million, represented operational growth of 4%, compared to the prior-year period, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange and the divested Neurovascular business and 1% growth on an as-reported basis.","The acquisition of C.R. Bard\u2019s Electrophysiology business contributed 140 basis points of growth in the quarter. The foreign exchange impact on sales was a $25 million headwind, compared to the prior-year period, and about a $5 million higher than the $20 million impact we assumed in our guidance range.","I would now look to provide more details on the revenue results for our seven divisions which roll up into our three business groups. I\u2019ll start with MedSurg where the total group sales of $548 million, grew 9% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. Each division within MedSurg grew faster than its respective markets and group operating income increased 280 basis points year-over-year to a Q1 2014 adjusted operating margin of 30.5%.","To dive into the details just a little bit, Urology and Women\u2019s Health worldwide sales grew 8% on a constant-currency basis compared to the prior-year quarter. This represents the fastest quarterly growth rate for Urology and Women\u2019s Health in over five years. This performance was driven by strong international sales with all regions up double digits due to our balanced product offering and physician training efforts.","Endoscopy sales grew 5% worldwide year-over-year on a constant-currency basis with six of our eight franchises in this division posting mid-single digit growth or better on a constant-currency basis. Emerging markets growth in Endo was a highlight, increasing more than 30% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis, driven by strong execution and an ongoing conversion to single-use products. ","To close out the MedSurg highlights, we are pleased to report a third straight quarter of 20-plus percent year-over-year sales growth on a constant-currency basis in Neuromodulation with 23% worldwide growth in the first quarter. Significant changes to Medicare reimbursement for physician office trialing of spinal cord stimulation systems went into effect January 1 of this year, resulting in slower trialing volumes, which are typically a leading indicator of total SCS market growth. We continue to believe Precision Spectra\u2019s ease of use and patient pain relief will help Boston Scientific gain share and drive market growth.","Turning now to the Cardiovascular Group, which consists of the Interventional Cardiology and Peripheral Interventions divisions, global sales for the group totaled $700 million and grew 2% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis, led by Peripheral Interventions growth of 5% and a return to growth in Interventional Cardiology. Cardiovascular group adjusted operating margins for the quarter of 24.3%, represented 140 basis point improvement year-over-year.","Within Cardiovascular, worldwide Interventional Cardiology sales of $497 million grew 1% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis on the strength of the Promus PREMIER DES launch, we believe we regained the DES leadership in the U.S. with $118 million in sales and an estimated mid-30s market share. Globally, DES sales declined 3% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. U.S. DES sales grew 1%. Sales internationally were down 5% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis.","Europe was down just slightly as we continue to regain traction in terms of contracting and tenders in Germany after settling our patent litigation there in September of last year. Asia\u2019s DES results lagged the other regions, down low-double digits year-over-year due to the weakness in Japan, but we believe we can regain share with the upcoming launch of Promus PREMIER in Japan. And for some perspective, the 3% decline in worldwide DES sales this quarter compares to a 10% year-over-year decline in Q4 of 2013.","So, to summarize our DES performance in Q1, we are pleased with the U.S. performance of the Promus PREMIER launch and strong European growth outside of Germany. This has been offset by continued weakness in Japan. Going forward, we are optimistic that Promus PREMIER can maintain market leadership in the U.S. and we look forward to establishing PREMIER as a global standard in all major markets.","Worldwide Other Interventional Cardiology grew 5% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. We believe our strategy to surround the interventional cardiologists with the broadest portfolio of technology required to treat the most complex coronary cases that are starting to take hold as we\u2019ve now enjoyed two quarters of our other IC or non-DES business growing faster than the market.","In Structural Heart, which includes our Lotus percutaneous valve and WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure devices, our Lotus launch is off to a solid start and WATCHMAN of a small base grew revenue in the early 50% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis.","Peripheral Interventions continues to deliver highly-consistent above-market growth, posting a 5% gain in revenue over the prior-year period on a constant-currency basis. Our growth was broad-based driven by our leading portfolio and continued expansion into the international and emerging markets. U.S. growth was also broad-based driven by the Epic stent, a self extending Nitinol stent ideal for the iliac's that launched in 2012, the carotid wall stent and the direction micro catheter for the delivery of diagnostic or therapeutic material which was launched in Q4 2013 in our Interventional Oncology franchises.","Finally, I\u2019ll discuss our Rhythm Management group, which consists of our Electrophysiology and Cardiac Rhythm Management divisions. Worldwide Rhythm Management sales in Q1 of $524 million, grew 3% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin for Q1 of 12.6%, represented a 140 basis point improvement year-over-year.","Within Electrophysiology, the quarter\u2019s 68% year-over-year revenue growth on a constant-currency basis includes approximately $24.5 million of sales from the acquired Bard EP business. Excluding this contribution from the acquired EP business, global EP sales were down 4% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis.","The legacy EP franchise struggled with longer-than-expected sales cycles for certain products. Looking ahead, we\u2019re excited about the potential of several new EP products, including the MiFi XP therapeutic catheter and our Rhythmia Mapping System.","The expected Rhythmia launch and the Bard EP acquisition significantly expand our product portfolio and commercial capabilities and we anticipate improved results in this newly strengthened franchise in the second half of 2014 and beyond.","For the Cardiac Rhythm Management division, Q1 worldwide sales declined 2% on a constant-currency basis year-over-year. Overall CRM sales of Asia grew slightly. Europe was flat. And our U.S. business declined mid-single digits, driven by market price erosion, a difficult replacement cycle, and continued uptake in the market of Quadripole CRT-Ds. Partially offsetting this, worldwide S-ICD sales were ahead of our internal expectation as we continue to see very strong demand for the product in the quarter.","In addition, European sales of our AUTOGEN X4 quadripolar pulse generator and ACUITY X4 quadripolar lead enjoyed a solid launch. So while Q1 CRM sales were not what we had hoped, we do have several ongoing product launches that lead us to believe that we can be a net share gainer in worldwide CRM for the full year.","On a worldwide basis, defib sales of $339 million were down 3% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. Again, S-ICD globally and the quad launch in Europe were strong, but this was offset by U.S. share losses driven by a lack of quadripolar offering in CRT-D and our continued headwinds in the replacement market.","Worldwide pacer sales were up 1% on a constant-currency basis year-over-year totaling $127 million. We continue to see strong adoption of our INGENIO family of pacemakers and believe we are gaining market share internationally.","Turning now to the P&L, adjusted gross profit margin for the first quarter was 69.9% or 260 basis points higher than Q1 2013. The increase was largely attributable to benefits from our value improvement programs and favorable product mix, partially offset by price erosion. Foreign exchange continued to have a fairly minimal impact upon gross profit margin as a result of our hedging program.","Adjusted SG&A expenses were $654 million or 36.9% of sales in Q1 2014. This represents a 140 basis point increase in SG&A spending as a percent of revenue, compared to Q1 2013, but a 140 basis point decline from the Q4 2013 rate.","Adjusted research and development expenses were $191 million in the first quarter or 10.8% of sales. As a percent of sales, this represents an 80 basis point decline in year-over-year spending due to some efficiency gains but primarily to the timing of some projects. We expect to return to a more normalized rate of R&D spend in Q2 and for the balance of the year.","Royalty expense was $40 million in the quarter or 2.3% of sales, flat year-over-year, but up 100 basis points sequentially as we reset to the higher tiers in some of our royalty agreements at the beginning of each year. On an adjusted basis, pre-tax operating income of $354 million in the quarter or 20% of sales, up 220 basis points from Q1 2013 despite continued investments in our strategic growth initiatives which were offset with targeted cost reduction initiatives, higher gross margins, and lower R&D spending.","GAAP operating income, which includes GAAP to adjusted items, was $196.5 million in Q1 2014. The primary GAAP to adjusted items included in operating income for the quarter were pre-tax restructuring charges of $19.8 million, pre-tax litigation gain of $7 million, pre-tax gain on the Neurovascular divestiture of $11.5 million, pre-tax intangible asset impairment charge of $55.2 million, pre-tax contingent consideration benefit of $22.4 million, and pre-tax amortization expense of $108.9 million.","The $55.2 million intangible asset impairment charge is the result of our interim impairment analysis. In conjunction with our ongoing analysis to determine next steps for our Vessex clinical program, we revised our expectations of the renal de-nervation market size and thus recorded this Q1 pre-tax impairment charge to in process R&D of $9.4 million and a core technology charge of $45.8 million related to Vessex.","Now, I\u2019ll move on to other income and expense, which primarily consisted of interest expense. Net interest expense for the quarter was $53.1 million as compared to $63.6 million in Q1 last year, due primarily to the refinancing of our public debt in Q3 last year. Our average interest expense rate in Q1 2014 was 4.8% or approximately 90 basis points lower than Q1 2013.","Our tax rate for the first quarter was 8.9% on a reported basis and a 11.9% on an adjusted basis. The difference between our reported and adjusted tax rates for the quarter is attributable to charges excluded in determining our non-GAAP results.","Finally, adjusted EPS of $0.20 per share represents 21% year-over-year growth. As mentioned, included in the adjusted EPS calculation is an approximate $7 million gain on an investment, which coupled with a slightly lower-than-expected tax rate in aggregate added approximately $0.01 to adjusted EPS.","On a reported GAAP basis, Q1 2014 EPS was $0.10, and included an intangible asset impairment charge, acquisition and divestiture related net credits, litigation-related credits, restructuring- related charges, discrete tax items and amortization expense totaling $1 35 million after-tax. This $0.10 of GAAP EPS in Q1 this year compares to a GAAP loss per share of $0.26 in the prior-year period that was driven primarily by a goodwill impairment charge in Q1 2013.","Moving on to the balance sheet, DSO of 62 days decreased one day compared to March of last year, due primarily to strong collection in the U.S. and Europe. Days inventory on hand of 155 days was up 22 days compared to March of last year and up 6.5 days compared to December 2013 due to higher inventory in advance of launches, primarily S-ICD, Promus PREMIER and the European quad launch and lower cost of goods sold, driven primarily by standard cost improvements and a favorable product mix. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $168 million, compared to $181 million in Q1 of last year. Capital expenditures of $59 million, compared to $53 million in Q1 last year.","Turning to share repurchases, we repurchased approximately 10 million shares for $125 million in the first quarter of 2014. Since July 2011, we\u2019ve repurchased 248 million shares or approximately 16% of our outstanding shares. We currently have $535 million of capacity remaining under our share repurchase authorization. We value returning cash to shareholders, and as always continuation of our share repurchase program in 2014 is subject to business development opportunities, market conditions, our stock performance, regulatory trading windows, and other factors.","I\u2019d like to conclude with guidance for Q2 and full-year 2014. For the full-year 2014, we continue to expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $7.3 billion to $7.5 billion, which represents growth of 2% to 5% year-over-year on a reported basis and growth of 3% to 5% operationally.","We continue to expect foreign exchange to be a net neutral for the full-year 2014. Included in this revenue guidance is an estimated 100-plus basis point full-year contribution from our adjacencies, primarily driven by the WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure device, the Lotus percutaneous valve and the Alair system for bronchial thermoplasty.","We now expect adjusted EPS for the full-year 2014 to be in a range of $0.77 to $0.82 and we encourage you to model for the midpoint of the range. On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.36 to $0.41. Although it will be necessary to make trade outs within the P&L in any given time period, we remain focused on achieving our goal of at least 100 basis points of annual adjusted operating margin improvement and reaching an overall 25% operating margin by 2017. We believe that our strategies and programs to improve profitability are working and we remain on track to achieve this goal.","Now turning specifically to Q2 2014, we expect consolidated revenues to be in a range of $1,840 million to $1,890 million. If current foreign exchange rates hold constant, the tailwind from FX should be approximately $5 million or 25 basis points relative to Q2 last year.","On an operational basis, we expect consolidated Q2 sales to grow year-over-year in a range of plus 3% to plus 5%. For the second quarter, adjusted EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.18 to $0.20 per share and reported GAAP EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.06 to $0.08 per share.","For the detailed Q2 P&L, our expectation is for gross margin in a range of 70% to 71%, SG&A spending in a range of 36.5% to 37.5%, R&D spending in a range of 11.5% to 12% and royalties in a range of 2% to 2.5% of sales, resulting in a targeted operating margin of 19% to 20%. Our tax rate expectation for Q2 is consistent with our full-year 2014 expected tax rate in the range of 13% to 15%.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Susie who will moderate the Q&A.","Susan Lisa","Thanks, Dan. Linda, let\u2019s open it up to questions for the next 30 minutes or so.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We have a question from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Rick Wise - Stifel Nicolaus","Let me start if I could with CRM. Obviously, Mike, you said not what you hoped. And, but during the quarter, since the quarter you continue to roll out all these new products. Do you have what you need in hand now to get this more on a positive growth track in the second half? And maybe, Dan, you could talk about do we return, does the business return to positive growth as we proceed through the year? How do we think about that?","Michael F. Mahoney","So, overall and if you look at CRM more broadly, we certainly like our full quarter trend that we\u2019ve had in CRM and we\u2019re really pleased how we\u2019ve positioned ourselves from a portfolio perspective going forward and I\u2019ll touch on that in a minute. We are disappointed in the Q1 results. It\u2019s really driven in the U.S. because we had some excellent performance outside the U.S. where we likely gained share in defib outside the U.S. and also at minimum held share globally in pacer.","So our challenge really for the quarter only was in the U.S. and we think we were impacted likely. We don\u2019t have a CRT-D device yet in the U.S. and so we\u2019re likely impacted by headwinds in CRT-D and also ongoing replacement challenges that we have in the business, but offset by a de novo -- continued de novo share gain in the U.S.","So in the U.S., we particularly are excited about the new launches that we have. So as you saw in the press release and you read, we had a number of really big approvals that will help this business going forward for the long term. We have a new MINI platform which is 15% to -- or 13% to 20% smaller than our competitive devices. We have the approval of our new X4 quad can and we have really been out of the CRT-D game globally for a long time.","So, we will not only launch this device including the lead in Europe from now on, but also have the quad can available to launch with competitive lead devices in the U.S. So we think the combination of this in Europe and in the U.S. will clearly provide some enhanced revenue in CRT-D which has been the troubling segment within CRM.","So you combine that with our S-ICD device and now our longevity story as well as a device that provides the smallest profile, we think we do have a highly differentiated portfolio and we are positioned to improve our performance moving forward.","Daniel J. Brennan","And so Rick to follow up, as I said in my prepared comments, I do expect that we would be a net share gainer for the rest of the year based on the portfolio that Mike has just mentioned in terms of S-ICD, the quad system in Europe, the quad can in the U.S. and then MINI in the U.S. and Europe.","From a profitability perspective, the good news is that despite going backwards in sales, we still were able to add 140 basis points in operating margin year-over-year, and we\u2019ve been very public about the fact that we have plans in place to do that within the Rhythm Management group without growth and that growth could be upside. So, we are looking forward to the rest of the year relative to sales and obviously very focused on profitability every quarter.","Rick Wise - Stifel Nicolaus","","One quick follow-up on the S-ICD, our survey work suggests you have trained roughly half the docs in the U.S., I don't know if that is representative of the larger market. Do you hope to train everybody on the S-ICD this year? And maybe talk a little bit about reorder rates if it is not too soon. Thanks.","Michael F. Mahoney","Yes, in terms of the training, I\u2019ll turn that question -- that comment over to Ken Stein, Dr. Ken Stein in a second. We did provide guidance in the call today for the first time in terms of revenue projections. We guided towards at minimum $75 million or exceeding $75 million in sales for the full year of S-ICD. So we want to provide that guidance. We\u2019re not going to provide quarterly actual results, but we feel we\u2019re certainly on track to deliver in excess of $75 million for the year. But, Dr. Stein, if you want to comment on the training?","Ken Stein","Your order of magnitude right in the rough proportion of cardiac implanting physicians who we\u2019ve trained already. We, again as Mike said during his prepared remarks, we really continue to be fully subscribed in all the training courses that we offer and we are going to continue to train folks on this device through the end of this year and next year.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","So also want to focus a little bit on U.S. ICDs. So if S-ICD was ahead of plan, I am just wondering what specifically in the quarter was worse than you expected on U.S. ICDs. And did pricing change relative to what it has been the last couple quarters? Do you think the market was a little soft? Just wondering if you could give a little bit more color. And as part of that, I am curious as to what percentage of your U.S. ICD sales are CRT-D and how that has been trending?","Michael F. Mahoney","Overall, again, I\u2019ll answer your question specifically on ICD, we felt it was a very strong quarter comprehensively for BSC with our sales growth on track and also increasing the full-year guidance for the year and double-digit EPS with a broad portfolio. But specific to U.S., again, we are much stronger outside the U.S. in ICDs, but in the U.S. really the two categories continue to be the CRT-D, which we think is a segment and we haven\u2019t broken out the exact percent, but we think it\u2019s a segment that has been growing more quickly and we\u2019ve also been had a headwind in our replacements.","And in particular, we offer a leading battery longevity platform. And we think that\u2019s excellent for patients and physicians particularly moving forward in this new environment, but it also does provide us a headwind with our replacement cycle.","So, really those two factors have hampered us in the U.S., the CRT-D, which is a segment that is growing and also the headwind that we have with our battery longevity which we think will ultimately be a tailwind for us given the economics of the health care system.","Again, we think this will improve with the new launch that we have of our quad-enabled CRT-D device, which we think is very innovative and it will offer physicians and patients the choice. With the quad solution in the U.S., we think it\u2019s clinically differentiated from St. Jude for the reasons discussed earlier.","On pricing, we didn\u2019t see anything dramatically different in price, kind of consistent with our fourth quarter. And we also -- we can verify, but we also feel there may have been some larger competitive balking in the quarter, in the first quarter of 2014.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","Okay, that is interesting and helpful. I will let others follow up on that. I just want to ask Dan one other quick one. I know the EPS guidance went up by $0.02 relative to your previous guidance. You rattled off a bunch of other categories. Dan, did anything else change in terms of the moving parts of your guidance say on operating margin or tax rate or anything like that? Or is it all consistent with what you said previously?","Daniel J. Brennan","For which period, Bob?","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","Sorry, for the full-year 2014.","Daniel J. Brennan","No, I think for the most part if you go back and look at the full-year guidance ranges for the P&L that we gave at our Q4 call and now they are relatively consistent.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","Okay. Anything change though at all?","Michael F. Mahoney","Nothing. Nothing of any materiality. If you look at the ranges we gave for gross margin and SG&A and R&D and tax rate, they are all very consistent.","Operator","We have a question from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Mike, I appreciate it's a lot of questions on CRM this morning. I guess we sort of looking at the math here in this quarter, your growth rate on a comp adjusted basis into this quarter decelerated virtually identically to your other competitor that has already reported. So I know we are talking about new dynamics in the quarter. Maybe you could sort of talk about in the -- that from a market perspective it does appear that two different providers are down materially fourth quarter to first quarter. So how much of this in your mind is simply market? And if there were sort of pull-through effects in the fourth quarter that we haven't seen here in the first quarter, do you have any sense of how those trends have looked here in the early part of the second quarter?","Michael F. Mahoney","Yes. We\u2019ll see when Medtronic reports in a few months here, little bit more in the first quarter in terms of the market, but overall in the first quarter, we didn\u2019t see a significant shift really from third quarter, fourth quarter of 2013.","Globally, we\u2019re still calling the CRM market kind of flattish to slightly negative. We\u2019ve talked about price being in the kind of negative 3% to negative 5% range globally and really almost essentially offset by volume. So we haven\u2019t seen a significant market change in first quarter.","And I think in terms of our performance again, ex-U.S. defib, our business globally performed quite well and we had a number of promising launches and we discussed likeliness and competitive balking as well as some of the headwinds in CRT-D replacement. And some of the new launches that we have we believe will offset some of those trends as we move forward in \u201814. No big market shifts that we saw in the first quarter.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","And then, Dan, obviously across your segment reporting here in the first quarter, the biggest relative change obviously was in CRM, which I think those margins almost doubled here in the quarter. As you think about the balance of the year, Dan, and we think about MedSurg and Cardio versus CRM, can you just talk about how you think those general trends -- how much relative improvement can we see in CRM versus some of the other segments and should we assume the majority of the improvement here in 2014 is going to come out of the CRM division versus the other two lines?","Daniel J. Brennan","And I think just to be clear, you\u2019re talking about a doubling from Q4?","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","","That\u2019s correct.","Daniel J. Brennan","So looking at Q4 Rhythm Management to Q1, yes, that\u2019s correct, and we had talked about it on our Q4 call some one-time items that were included in Q4. So very pleased with what we saw in Q1 from a Rhythm Management perspective. So just quickly as you go through the three segments, we expect to see the Rhythm Management segment produce more relative to the others because obviously there is more room for that segment to go.","But the other segments, both in MedSurg and in Cardiovascular should leverage the growth that\u2019s anticipated in there, and as I mentioned earlier, Rhythm Management, we have plans in place to do that without growth and growth would be upside for that. So, all three will contribute, but I think to your point, Rhythm Management will contribute more overall since it\u2019s coming from such a lower position than the other two.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open Mr. Weinstein. Okay. I\u2019m not hearing anyone. I believe we\u2019ll go on to the next. We have a question from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","I wanted to talk about the stent business which is back on track. In the U.S. you called out Promus PREMIER and it performed very well. I'm wondering if you can call outside the U.S., talk to us about how SYNERGY is launching? A lot of our channel checks suggest SYNERGY is a very differentiated stent and I know it is just getting launched in Europe. But can you give us some feedback in terms of how many countries have been launched, what the pricing dynamic, anything that you can give us that tells us that this differentiated product is going to be a share gainer for you in Europe this year?","Michael F. Mahoney","Absolutely, Glenn. Overall, we\u2019re really pleased with our performance in Intervention Cardiology and we think we have a lot of room to grow in this one. It\u2019s the first quarter that we\u2019ve grown this segment of our business, which is critical for us given its high profitability in probably four to five years. And we have a lot of room to improve that. ","Just breaking down on the IC performance quickly, we talk about our IC Other business as well, which is becoming quite meaningful for us in terms of its size from 5%. The DES business globally was down. We had a very strong performance in Europe and we\u2019re challenged a bit more in Japan. And the good news in Japan we expect from a Promus PREMIER launch sometime over the next 90 days, which will really change our trajectory in Japan.","So as you look forward with the Japan approval of Promus PREMIER, the momentum that we have in Europe and the -- retaking the number one share position without dramatically changing pricing trends, we like our position. Specifically with SYNERGY in Europe, we continue to follow this kind of three segment strategy in Europe, because we want to establish SYNERGY which we have successfully as a premium product due to its clinical characteristics, and so at future meetings, we will provide more detail in terms of the specific mix of SYNERGY.","But we don\u2019t sell it in all markets, we sell it in four to five countries in Europe that can justify a premium pricing. So in those markets, we have a much higher market share of SYNERGY -- much higher mix. In a market that can\u2019t support premium pricing, we don\u2019t even launch SYNERGY. So in those markets, we lead with our Promus PREMIER brand and then we also have a Promus for a low-end product.","So we feel like our portfolio is positioned extremely well combined with our complex coronary and imaging business. And those products will be launched in Japan, the PREMIER device as we get into the third quarter and eventually SYNERGY likely the fourth quarter of \u201815 in the U.S. So we think our DES portfolio is uniquely positioned to manage price effectively and to gain share responsibly and complemented with our complex coronary strategy.","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","And just one quick follow-up. You mentioned Promus PREMIER Japan being launched in 90 days. It is a little bit sooner than we thought. Is that going to be launched also with reimbursement in place?","Michael F. Mahoney","Yes, we don\u2019t see any issues with the reimbursement with Promus PREMIER in Japan. So the answer is yes.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan","I apologize, we missed the last few minutes of the call, so if this was asked. But I wanted to ask on two end markets, Mike. One was peripheral vascular and that\u2019s because your performance was so strong this quarter and you have had competitors who have made comments, Bard in particular, that the market has gotten worse, that there has been incremental pricing pressure in particular in Europe and that is where you guys felt the strength. So, could you talk a little bit about that market and your own success there? And then second, I don't know if this was covered in the last minute, but Neuromodulation where we've had this discussion about the impact of the reimbursement change and what that would mean to your business. You seem to suggest that while you expect it to continue to grow above market that the spread between you and the market would narrow over the balance of the year. So could you add a little bit more meat to the bone there? Thanks.","Michael F. Mahoney","Sure. Thank you. The first one on our peripheral business globally, we grew that 5% ahead of market for a number of quarters in a row. And it\u2019s really not one particular product, we have a very well-balanced portfolio there, very strong commercial team and a nice pipeline. In terms of the market, we haven\u2019t seen a dramatic reduction in pricing in our peripheral business. So there are some pricing challenges there, but we didn\u2019t see a hiccup or a catalyst of price declines in the quarter.","And so we continue to see very low single-digit price declines in peripheral, offset by volume, gets us to about 5% growth globally. So, overall, we think it\u2019s a relatively healthy market and that will still pay for innovation. So we like our cover progress in PI globally and we will be launching our drug-eluting balloon in Europe in the future here.","Regarding Neuromodulation, this has really been a gem with - or it is a gem with Boston Scientific and we did guide towards slower growth the remaining three quarters. We are confident we\u2019ll continue to gain share. That business has a lot of momentum, a very differentiated platform, but the headwinds you called out one, the reimbursement changes in the outpatient settings and also the anniversary of a launch and very strong comps, plus 20% growth comps that will be entering the second quarter.","So we didn\u2019t provide guidance as to what our growth would be in the second, third and fourth quarter, but it will be slower, it will taper from what it has been the last four quarters, really driven by both of those factors, but we still believe it will be a healthy contributor to the top line and faster to market.","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan","One last follow-up. Dan, on the 140 basis points of margin expansion in the CRM business this quarter which you (indiscernible) what you guys thought. How much of that came from R&D reduction versus gross margin expansion or SG&A reduction, do you have that? ","Daniel J. Brennan","Yes. I think the majority of it would -- more of it would come from gross margin than would come specifically from R&D. But the point is, it\u2019s really - it\u2019s all throughout the P&L. It won\u2019t be just one area of the P&L that will drive the improvements that we\u2019re going to make in that segment. All will contribute, but the gross margin should be the largest contributor of the line items.","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan","","And overall the R&D, you saw this quarter for the company as a whole, do you expect that to balance out over the balance of the year to be less of a driver of the earnings growth?","Daniel J. Brennan","Yes. That\u2019s fair Mike. So I think we were sub-11% for the quarter in R&D as a percentage of sales in Q1 and we\u2019ve guided for a 11.5% to 12% for Q2. So there is a little bit of timing. We still expect probably to be driving some efficiencies in R&D but there is some timing in Q1 that will come back in Qs two, three and four exactly.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Josh Jennings - Cowen and Company","Just first I wanted to go back to the drug-eluting stent franchise in the U.S. and returning to growth mid-30s share. Can you just talk about the sustainability there, is there upside in terms of share gains from here versus some of the potential trialing that your competitors have called out?","Michael F. Mahoney","Yes. So one is, we\u2019re pleased that we\u2019ve kind of recaptured the number one share position. We\u2019re also very sensitive to the pricing in this marketplace. So this is not a hold a number one share position at all cost position. We think we have a stronger portfolio and we can maintain price discipline and increase our market share with our portfolio.","So if you look at the, one, we\u2019ve got a very strong commercial team. We have capabilities with our chronic total occlusion and imaging business that physicians are interested in that helped complement our DES portfolio. And we think, as you look for the future here, with our Promus PREMIER launch, which really is in full launch mode now and call it 18 months from now, potential launch of SYNERGY in fourth quarter \u201815 that we really are well positioned to have a - we\u2019re planning on a increasing gap in terms of our leadership in the U.S. with our portfolio.","Josh Jennings - Cowen and Company","Great, and just one follow-up on the CRM side. Just with -- in terms of your high-voltage lead strategies with the recent announcement of U.S. ID for 7-French lines 4-FRONT, how are you thinking about building out that portfolio and any timelines in terms of when that lead could be approved?","Michael F. Mahoney","So, this question regarding the new lead in the U.S.?","Josh Jennings - Cowen and Company","","Yes.","Michael F. Mahoney","So specifically around the new ICD, that\u2019s an 8-French lead, not 7. And that is being investigated as part of our NAVIGATE clinical trial, which is enrolling patients both to investigate our family of quad pole CRT-D leads, the ACUITY X-4 leads as well as the 4-FRONT device and that trial launched a little bit earlier this quarter and expect to complete enrolment in that trial around the end of next year.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Bruce Nudell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse","Mike, just looking at the dynamics around the S-ICD. In one sense it\u2019s very positive in that you are expecting over 1% worldwide market share on a revenue basis. But just looking more granularly at the US, it looks like the MRG data says you are about 2 points under-represented in can share in the CRT-D segment relative to the overall share, but 5 points over-represented in the single chamber share. And so, is one of the moderating influences regarding the impact of S-ICD on overall share that people will just keep your single chamber share about the same but give you more representation in S-ICD, with a revenue uptick of course. But that\u2019s like kind of this share allocation strategy that these hospitals may have, if you could just comment on that?","Michael F. Mahoney","Well, I think physicians and patients ultimately like to think we will choose the best product for the best patient. And we think that\u2019s what\u2019s driving our de novo share gains, which really is the hallmark of which platforms are most innovative. I think the new implants are being selected and we are being selected at an increasing rate because of our S-ICD capability.","And we think we have a lot of momentum. We believe we\u2019ll gain a lot of momentum with this new MINI platform, which provides the thinnest device. So the notion of a physician rewarding us for that and then maybe hurting us or de-tracking us in CRT-D as a result of that gain, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a big play.","I think the fact we\u2019ve had some portfolio gaps, we haven\u2019t had a CRT-D device, which is the premium priced product in the segment, we haven\u2019t had one and now we have it in Europe and we\u2019re able to provide a solution now in the U.S. and although it\u2019s not a solution, we\u2019re are offering the quad pole lead as well, we believe a number of physicians will mix and leverage our X4 can capability in CRT-D procedures. So there is a lot of service components embedded within the CRM business but we think ultimately a leading that\u2019s innovative will win and we are building that over time.","Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse","And on a strategic basis, one of the things that\u2019s really kind of surprised me is the strength of TAVI results generally where it\u2019s proving superior to surgery in elderly, higher-risk patients. And that has connotations for its ultimate market size. And I think the skeptics of the market were pegging it more in the $2 billion range, the optimists were $3 billion. But it looks like there could be even upside to that. Have these results made you sit back a little bit and really think about the level of investment that Boston should be appropriating towards structural heart generally, especially given success -- early success at least in the mitral front?","Michael F. Mahoney","Yes. Well, I\u2019ll turn that over to Dr. Keith Dawkins.","Keith Dawkins","Bruce, I think we remain very bullish about the segment, particularly after the favorable superior ACC results recently presented. As you know, Lotus is a differentiated second-generation product and as you also know peri valve elite drives both early and late mortality and morbidity.","We think the leak results from REPRISE II the CE Mark trial best-in-class and the six-month data from the REPRISE II will be presented next month at EuroPCR. So this is an area where we are investing heavily. The additional third valve size, the 25 millimeter valve, will be launched shortly and will be available for the REPRISE III U.S. pivotal IDE trial. So in answer to your question, we appreciate the increasing potential size of the market and are investing appropriately in this space.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Matthew Dodds with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Matthew Dodds - Citigroup","For BP, it looks like the Bard business, I know you talked about the legacy business declining, but I think the Bard business declined 10% as well, is that right and is that integration issues?","Michael F. Mahoney","We have to get that exact number to you. The standalone Bard business declining 10% doesn\u2019t appear correct to me. So we will to verify with the group here. So our information was saying that the Bard integration has gone well, that the revenue gains are consistent with our financial model and more in the flattish range year-over- very.","Quite frankly, the challenge has been more in the legacy EP business within Boston Scientific, which ex-Bard, was down slightly for the quarter. So I would tell the Bard business more flat and the legacy BSC business is low single digits.","So I think overall that integration has gone well. As I mentioned the commercial teams have pulled together and we\u2019re really still in the very important time where we are pulling the key pieces there together. We\u2019ve talked about our IntellaTip MiFi therapeutic catheter, we\u2019ll gain an impact as we move towards the second half of the year. And we will have our first implementations of our Rhythmia navigation system. So that business will strengthen particularly in the second half of 2014 and be a more meaningful contributor in \u201815.","Matthew Dodds - Citigroup","Just a quick one on emerging markets, if that\u2019s all right. You did better than peers this quarter. It sounds like in the commentary, Endoscopy, Urology, Other Interventional Cardiology were the big strengths, is that - are those the majority of it, or is there something I missed that also did really well?","Michael F. Mahoney","We are putting increased emphasis on the diversification of our portfolio in the business you just mentioned in those emerging markets. There is less pricing pressure, there is excellent opportunity to train more physicians and to increase access and the three that you mentioned there are growing quite nicely. And so it\u2019s helping diversify our cardiovascular mix in those markets.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Brooks West with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Brooks West - Piper Jaffray","Mike, I wanted to push you a little bit on the strategy with your quad generator in the United States, just to make sure I'm thinking about expectations correctly. Do you see that -- is there an opportunity to call on competitive accounts in your mind with that generator and actually try to take some share based on the differentiated features? Or is it primarily a protector for Boston Scientific labs against potential -- you know, you've got St. Jude and you've got Medtronic coming to the market in the near future.","Michael F. Mahoney","I think it\u2019s both. We haven\u2019t offered, there hasn\u2019t been a competitive quad offering in the U.S. And physicians like -- in most hospitals like choices. So I think it will be - we\u2019ll target that customers who are users of BSC products broadly and customers who may not be users of BSC products, so I think it\u2019s great for the market to have a second offering.","And this strategy has been really well proven out. There has been a number of cases in the past where even recently that we\u2019ve seen some competitive companies have some lead issues and you see companies or physicians that will mix and match say our leads with competitive devices or our device with competitive leads.","So that is not a new phenomena within this business and it\u2019s been approved through rigorous testing and clinical performance by the FDA and I think the market will embrace a second choice in the quad offering and we will take it immediately to competitive accounts and to our current users.","","Brooks West - Piper Jaffray","","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on other Interventional Cardiology, can you call out, is that mainly your imaging products and then remind us again your pipeline there? Don't you also have an FFR product coming to market soon?","Michael F. Mahoney","Sure. The key drivers of our IC Other business would be our imaging business, our IVUS imaging business for sure and we\u2019ll be expanding into FFRs. I think -- I believe the first quarter of 2015 is the timing for our FFR launch, so that\u2019s a nice catalyst.","The second one is our chronic total occlusion, which is the acquisition we did at BridgePoint a number of years ago, a couple of years ago and also we had a positive ruling legally and we\u2019ll be able to re-launch our Guidezilla guide catheter as we enter our second quarter here. So that should provide some additional tailwind to the Other Cardio business.","Susan Lisa","Linda, we have time to take one more question please.","Operator","Okay, thank you. We have a question from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","Just wanted to double check I guess your guidance for the full year including about 100 basis points plus from adjacencies, just in terms of whether or not -- I know that is what you said from last quarter as well but your confidence around that given what seems to be still a very slow progress on Alair and then the change in assumptions with Vessex. Then I have a follow-up after that.","Daniel J. Brennan","Christian, it\u2019s Dan. Yes, I think as we called out in the prepared comments, the three biggest contributors to that 100 basis point, 100-plus basis points of growth will be Lotus, WATCHMAN and Alair, and that\u2019s still the plan and still that\u2019s included in our $7.3 billion to $7.5 billion guidance for the year.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","And then just on the margin front, you guys have commented that you still feel very confident in getting to the 25% operating margin goal in 2017. This quarter you saw a lower tax rate. It sounds like you didn't really change the tax rate guidance for the full year. But can you give us some level of appreciation in terms of the longer term if you can get to the 25% operating margin goal in 2017? What does the tax rate look like in that year?","Daniel J. Brennan","So I think we\u2019ve gone out both this year and next year with 13% to 15%. I\u2019m very comfortable with that in terms of tax rate and actually we don\u2019t really give much guidance for \u201815, but we feel like the tax rate is an important one to give for that next year. Still feel good about the 25% operating income in 2017 and that would include whatever tax rate we\u2019re at at that point as well.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","What\u2019s the risk I guess that that nice improvement in operating margin over the next several years is really offset by a significantly higher tax rate?","Daniel J. Brennan","I think if you look at the -- our comfort with the 25%, again, I wouldn\u2019t give anything beyond 2015 relative to any parts of the P&L, but still feel that the 25% is our goal for 2017 with all areas of the P&L contributing.","Susan Lisa","Okay. With that, we\u2019d like to conclude the call. Thanks for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Boston Scientific.

[Operator Instructions] Also as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Sean Wirtjes. Please go ahead.","Sean Wirtjes","Thank you, Perky. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Hank Kucheman, Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Capello, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q1 2012 results, which included key financials and reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in the release. We posted a copy of that press release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in today's conference call to the comparable GAAP measures and other supporting schedules to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financial Information.","The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Hank will begin our prepared remarks with an update on our business progress and his perspectives on the quarter. Jeff will then review our Q1 financial results and business performance, as well as Q2 and updated full year 2012 guidance. We'll then open the call up to questions.","During today's Q&A session, Hank and Jeff will be joined by our President, Mike Mahoney, as well as our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Dawkins and Dr. Stein.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, project, believe, plan, estimate, intend and similar words.","These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding our growth; market share; markets for our products; product pipeline and quality systems; new product approvals, launches and performance; clinical trials; cost reduction and growth initiatives; investments in emerging markets and business development opportunities; the timing and volume of share repurchases; free cash flow and its uses; our future financial performance including sales, margins, earnings and other guidance for the second quarter and full year 2012; and future tax rates, R&D spending and other expenses.","Actual results may differ materially from those discussed or implied in these forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them.","At this point, I'll turn it over to Hank for his comments. Hank?","William H. Kucheman","Thank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'll begin today with some comments on the first quarter financials and then move on to update you on the progress we continue to make on our key initiatives to drive revenue and EPS growth.","First quarter revenue of $1.866 billion was down 3%, both on a reported basis and in constant currency and excluded the Neurovascular divestiture. This was in line with both Street consensus and the midpoint of our guidance range. Our PI, Endoscopy, Urology and Neuromod businesses all delivered mid- to high-single-digit growth in the quarter. We expect to see continued good growth from these businesses and improvement in our other businesses over the balance of the year.","We continue to see global pricing pressure in our IC and CRM businesses and lower defib procedure volumes in the U.S. compared to a year ago due to the factors you are already aware of by now.","However, the positive signs we saw in the U.S. last quarter suggesting possible stabilization in de novo implant volumes in the defib market and some easing of the pricing pressures in DES continued in the quarter. With significant new products coming into the market in both of these businesses in 2012, we remain optimistic about our future outlook.","From an earning standpoint, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.15 in the quarter. This was above Street consensus and exceeded the high end of our guidance range of $0.11 to $0.14 and was driven by good gross margin improvement, continued cost control and lower-than-expected tax rate.","Let me now move on to the progress we're making with new products. We continue to be excited about our rejuvenated product pipeline, which we expect will help us return to growth later this year and support continued revenue growth after that.","In Peripheral Interventions, our increased investment in new products over the past few years is now paying dividends, and we believe that this will contribute to continued attractive growth moving forward. We have regained our #1 PTA balloon position in the U.S. on the strength of our recently launched Mustang, Gladiator, Charger and Coyote devices, which continue to see strong acceptance in the marketplace.","We also began the full launch of our TruePath CTO crossing device in the U.S. in the quarter. We expect to move to full launch of TruePath in Europe and other international markets this quarter and to begin the full launch of our OffRoad CTO Re-entry catheter in approved markets this year.","In addition, we are seeing strong sales of our Epic self-expanding stent outside the United States, which, by the way, just received FDA approval last week. As a result, we now will be able to operate complete line of advanced iliac solutions with both balloon expandable and self-expanding stents in the U.S. market commencing next month. We believe these product introductions will contribute to continued above-market growth in this business.","In our EP business, we continue to leverage our expertise in catheter and ablation technology as we execute our global AFib strategy and progress on our internally approved AFib-focused projects. We recently began launching our heart span [ph] fixed sheath and Z Flex-270 Steerable Sheath, which are designed to facilitate the introduction and placement of catheters for AFib within the heart.","We also recently filed an IDE with the FDA for our AFib clinical trial, 0 AF, utilizing our Blazer Open-Irrigated catheter.","In Endoscopy, we began in both the U.S. and international markets the full launch of our WallFlex Biliary Transhepatic Stent System for malignant strictures as well as our Expect 19 Flex Ultrasound Aspiration Needle, which is used for tissue acquisition to diagnose GI malignancies. Again, we expect these product launches to bolster our already strong Endoscopy above-market growth profile.","In Urology and Women's Health, we began full launch of our BackStop Gel designed to prevent stone migration during stone management procedures. We continue to believe this business has considerable above-market growth potential and are planning to introduce several new and differentiated technologies in both our pelvic floor repair and sling product lines later this year to help realize that potential.","In Neuromodulation, our unique Smoothwave technology platform and consistent flow of innovative additions to our product set continue to help differentiate our offerings from those of our competition with physicians and patients and drive above-market growth. Physician reaction to our recently launched Infinion Lead, the industry's first and only 16-contact percutaneous lead, is exceeding our expectations.","In drug-eluting stents, our Platinum Chromium Element drug-eluting stent series is now available in all major markets worldwide, and we believe we are on track to realizing the benefit of the gross margin opportunity associated with the conversion from PROMUS to PROMUS Element and our return to 100% self-manufactured stent margins. Looking forward, we also anticipate receiving FDA approval for the 32-millimeter and 38-millimeter sizes of PROMUS Element mid-2012, which will complete our available size matrix and should enhance our current market share position.","From a clinical standpoint, our DES business had several important developments during the quarter. At ACC, Dr. Gregg Stone announced that the positive outcomes reported at 12 months in the PLATINUM trial comparing PROMUS Element to XIENCE PROMUS continued out to 2 years. In addition, the landmark analysis Dr. Stone presented demonstrated superior efficacy of PROMUS Element as compared to XIENCE PROMUS during the second year of follow-up. These new data further enable our ability to clinically differentiate our platform and sets the new gold standard for DES performance.","In addition, based on the results of the HORIZONS-AMI trial, our ION and TAXUS Liberte Paclitaxel-Eluting Stent Systems recently became the only DES systems in the U.S. with an approved indication to treat patients with an AMI or heart attack. The DES market is a large and profitable market where we expect to continue our strong leadership on the strength of the solid clinical data and differentiated product performance of the Element platform. We also expect Element to be a growth driver for us in emerging markets where the combination of strong underlying market growth and the potential to increase our current market share positions provides a significant opportunity.","Moving on to CRM. We expect our new defib and Pacer platforms to improve our ability to compete more effectively in all CRM markets. In defib, the U.S. launch of our INCEPTA, ENERGEN and PUNCTUA ICDs and CRT-Ds is well underway, and we are very pleased with the rollout based on the positive feedback we receive from customers. We are leveraging our advantage in size and shape, our LATITUDE heart failure management system, our LHFM capability, our 4-SITE DF4 universal connector system built off our highly dependable RELIANCE lead platform and our market-leading battery longevity warranties of up to 10 years to differentiate this unique platform.","With heart failure management in the forefront of both physician and economic customer minds, including the LHF system with all our high-voltage devices has really resonated with our key customer segments. Our ability to offer the only solution that is in line with industry guidelines is quickly gaining traction and providing us with a unique opportunity to grow our high-voltage business.","Before I move on from defib, let me make a few comments on the emerging issue of tachy lead or shock [ph] Reliability. It should be noted that our RELIANCE family of tachy leads remains the industry gold standard for reliability and survivability with a 99 success rate out to 8 years as documented by several peer-reviewed publications. We feel this level of tachy lead reliability, performance and history is a strong competitive advantage for us in the current environment as evidenced by the significant recent growth we've seen in RELIANCE sales and expect it to become even stronger with the addition of Cameron S-ICD technology.","Now turning to the pacing side. We began launching our Infinion family of pacemakers and CRTPs in Europe last week and expect U.S. approval this quarter. INGENIO builds on our unique capabilities around the treatment of chronotropic incompetence and is designed to be RF enabled, support remote patient monitoring, have advanced heart failure diagnostics and be compatible with MRI systems. MRI compatibility is expected to be available in Europe by mid-2012 and we plan to start a related U.S. trial later this year.","INGENIO is our first new Brady platform in many years, and as such, we believe that its potential to drive share gains in the worldwide pacer market is underappreciated.","My final CRM-related comment relates to a recent announcement by one of our CRM competitors that they are going to ramp up monitoring of their medical devices in order to catch potential safety problems. That announcement surprised us because we've been doing that for a long, long time. Our post-market performance monitoring system provides us with early warning signals to take necessary corrective action to ensure product safety. We then use these data to improve overall product quality and reliability and convey important information to patients, physicians and regulatory agencies. That is our responsibility and is nothing new for us.","Let me now move on to emerging markets where we continue to make solid progress on our plan to expand and accelerate profitable growth. For example, in the first quarter, combined sales in our largest emerging markets of China, India and Brazil experienced strong double-digit growth compared to a year ago. We have made significant progress in building out our regional leadership, sales forces, clinical and marketing teams, distributor networks and infrastructure in those countries and are also seeing increased productivity from the commercial resources we added in 2011.","In China, we recently received government approval and signed a lease for our planned manufacturing operation. From a product standpoint, we've completed the PLATINUM China trial and we continue to roll out PROMUS Element, which was featured prominently at the CIT Conference in Beijing last month. Importantly, we also initiated the launch of our TELIGEN ICD, which is now the smallest and thinnest high-energy device available in China.","In India, we supported another very successful India Live conference, which included live cases with PROMUS Element. We also continued patient enrollment in the TUXEDO trial to access the TAXUS Element or ION Stent in diabetic patients. More than 700 patients have now been enrolled from 40 participating centers.","In short, we continue to make significant progress on emerging market strategy of introducing innovative, leading technologies backed by a global respected brand, and we believe we have major growth opportunities driven by underlying market growth and the potential to increase our below-average market share positions in key emerging countries.","Looking beyond 2012, let me start by outlining recent progress made with 7 key technologies, the combination of which, we believe, have the potential to make a meaningful contribution to revenue growth starting in 2013. In both the U.S. and Europe, we continue to focus on driving commercialization and increased awareness of the Alair Bronchial Thermoplasty or BT procedure.","Just last month, 2 private payers in the U.S. issued the first public postings of positive insurance coverage policies providing their eligible members access to BT. Just after these policies were posted, the California Technology Assessment Form, or CTAF, announced that BT meets its assessment criteria, indicating that the procedure improves net health outcomes. We view these recent developments as significant milestones and believe they will lead to additional payers establishing BT reimbursement and thus accelerated BT revenue growth.","In structural heart, we continue to expand the commercial presence of our WATCHMAN Device outside the United States while in the United States, we remain on track to complete enrollment in the PREVAIL trial and submit our PMA by the end of the year. This would set us up for expected FDA approval and launch in the second half of 2013, which we expect will allow us to be the first to market in the United States with this novel technology for a considerable period of time.","In the aortic valve replacement, we expect to complete the REPRISE Lotus Valve feasibility trial in Australia this Friday, and we anticipate presenting the early results at EuroPCR in Paris next month. We expect to begin REPRISE II, our CE Mark trial for Lotus, in the third quarter of this year with European approval, and launch is expected in the second half.","We are developing multiple approaches to the device-based treatment of hypertension and are planning for the first human use of one of our renal denervation devices in the third quarter of this year with CE Mark Approval and commercialization expected in Europe next year. We also continue to expect CE Mark Approval on our fourth-generation Synergy DES stent as early as late 2012 and anticipate completing our VANTAGE trials studying deep brain stimulation for the treatment of Parkinson's disease in Europe as planned. We expect both of these technologies to begin contributing revenues next year and do so meaningfully in 2014.","Finally, as most of you know, sudden cardiac arrest is one of our Priority Growth Initiative areas, and we view the Cameron acquisition as strategically important addition to our CRM business. We also believe that it demonstrates our commitment to the CRM field by bringing in innovative technology to physicians in planning high-voltage devices today.","We expect Cameron's unique S-ICD technology, when combined with our recently launched family of new defib products, our highly reliable RELIANCE lead portfolio, our new INGENIO family of pacemaker products and the WATCHMAN Device to create a compelling and unique portfolio of arrhythmia management products that will strengthen our ability to differentiate our value proposition to physicians, their patients and health care systems around the world and allow us to accelerate the commercial expansion of the S-ICD device in the global marketplace. We also believe S-ICD will offer us the potential to expand in the ICD market overall, as well as achieve above-market growth rates in our traditional ICD business over time. Subject to customary conditions, excluding relevant antitrust clearance, we expect to close the Cameron transaction later this year.","To summarize, we are excited about the future growth potential of the products I have just reviewed. Add in the momentum we are building with new product introductions as well as in emerging markets, and you can see why we believe that we are positioned to drive top line growth in 2013 and beyond.","In closing, we continue to demonstrate progress in the execution of our business strategy to return to sustainable revenue growth and to deliver double-digit adjusted EPS growth. We expect revenue growth to be driven by our pipeline, through acquisitions and in emerging markets, and we made solid progress in all 3 of these areas during the quarter.","We also continue to achieve key milestones relating to our cost-reduction opportunities, to drive earnings growth and maintain the flexibility to balance investments in new markets and growth technologies, along with return of capital to shareholders, all of which Jeff will detail next along with an updated guidance.","That's it for my comments. So let me turn the call now over to Jeff. Jeff?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Thanks, Hank. Let me begin by providing some overall perspective on the quarter before getting into the details.","We generated adjusted EPS of $0.15 in the first quarter. The solid earnings performance in the quarter was driven by higher gross margins due largely to the launches of PROMUS Element in the U.S. and Japan, continued strong attention to cost control and a lower-than-expected tax rate. As a reminder, the adjusted EPS of $0.22 we reported in Q1 last year included $0.10 in positive onetime items, including a true-up on our PROMUS supply agreement, bad debt recoveries in Greece and discrete tax benefits.","Consolidated revenue in the first quarter of $1,866,000,000 represents a decrease of 3% on both a reported basis and an operational basis, the latter of which excludes impacts from foreign exchange and the divested Neurovascular business. The actual headwind from foreign exchange on sales was $6 million compared to the $10 million headwind assumed in our first quarter guidance range. And the divested Neurovascular business contributed $5 million less in sales in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same quarter last year.","Let me now move to the detailed review of our business performance and our operating results in the quarter, Starting with DES, I'd like -- I'd first like to remind you that our results for the first quarter last year included a $10 million negative impact from a sales returns reserve related to the launch of TAXUS Element ION in the U.S. In comparison, DES sales for the first quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2011 included a $6 million positive impact and an $8 million negative impact, respectively, related to the launch of PROMUS Element Plus in the U.S. These reserves impact comparisons of worldwide and U.S. DES revenues and market share between these periods.","Worldwide DES revenues came in at $353 million in the first quarter. Excluding sales returns reserves, this represents a constant currency decrease of 8% compared to the first quarter of 2011. Our worldwide DES revenue included $79 million for TAXUS, $79 million for PROMUS and $205 million for PROMUS Element. Following its recent approval in Japan, our self-manufactured PROMUS Element stent is now available in all major countries, and we continue to see strong customer adoption of our broader Element platform. In addition, we are building upon our momentum in the emerging markets of India and China, which we believe represents a significant opportunity for us.","Excluding sales returns reserves we once again held clear DES market share leadership in the first quarter with an estimated worldwide share of 34%.","U.S. DES revenues were $176 million in the quarter. Excluding sales returns reserves, this represents a decline of 12% compared to the first quarter last year. This decrease was primarily due to lower ASPs, slightly lower share due to recent competitive product launches and some continued softness in PCI volumes.","U.S. DES revenue in the quarter included $80 million of PROMUS Element Plus, $50 million of TAXUS and TAXUS Element and $46 million of PROMUS. The launch of PROMUS Element Plus has been extremely well received in the U.S. marketplace, and we expect our conversion from PROMUS and return to self-manufactured DES margins in the U.S. to be substantially complete by the end of the second quarter.","We estimate that our U.S. DES share was 46% excluding sales returns reserves, which was down approximately 100 basis points from the fourth quarter of last year due mainly to the launch of a competitor's product in the first quarter, which was earlier than we anticipated. From a pricing perspective, we were pleased to see some relief in the rate of ASP erosion continue again this quarter and are hopeful that it may be sustainable going forward. Either way, we are focused on leveraging the unique value proposition that the differentiating features of PROMUS Element now allow us to bring to all major markets worldwide.","International DES sales of $187 million represented a decrease of 3% in constant currency compared to the first quarter of last year. Q1 revenue included $29 million in TAXUS, $32 million in PROMUS and $126 million in PROMUS Element sales.","In Japan, we initiated the launch of PROMUS Element in early March, and its acceptance in the marketplace has been extremely positive. In the first 4 weeks alone, we converted over 75% of our PROMUS volume to PROMUS Element and increased our estimated market share from 32% to 42%.","We are also continuing to build momentum with our Element platform in emerging markets including India, Brazil and China and expect this to accelerate through the year as we anticipate gaining additional important pricing approvals in India and expanding the ongoing launch of PROMUS Element in China.","In CRM, worldwide revenue was $501 million in the first quarter, representing a constant currency decrease of 10% compared to the first -- excuse me, compared to the first quarter of last year. We estimate that we maintained our worldwide CRM share on a sequential basis at close to 19%.","In the U.S., CRM revenue of $292 million represented a 14% decrease from the prior year quarter. On a worldwide basis, defib sales were $368 million in the first quarter, which was down 11% in constant currency from the first quarter of last year.","In the U.S., defib sales were $229 million. This was down 14% compared to the first quarter of last year due primarily to continued year-over-year market declines, replacement headwinds in our business and a lower level of bulk sales. However, these factors were partially offset by a significant increase in sales of our highly reliable RELIANCE defib lead platform in the quarter. We began aggressively launching our new line of defibrillators in the U.S. in the first quarter, and we believe that this innovative new tiered product offering helped drive a sequential increase in our defib share in the quarter. We also believe that there are opportunities to secure additional share gains based on the features of these products and plan to promote them heavily as we continue the launch.","Looking at the broader U.S. market, de novo defib implant volumes continued to show signs of stabilization in the first quarter. Based on the data we have so far relative to the first quarter, it appears market de novo implant rates have continued to be relatively stable sequentially now for the past 2 quarters. However, we want to see how the rest of the market reports and plan to continue to monitor market conditions carefully before calling the bottom on implant rates.","International CRM sales of $209 million were down 4% in constant currency compared to the prior year quarter despite a 3% constant currency increase in international pacer revenue off a continued strong double-digit growth in Japan, boosted by our partnership with Fukuda Denshi. International defib sales of $139 million represented a 6% decrease in constant currency from the first quarter of last year. We are launching new products in many countries outside the U.S. and expect improved performance as we move through the year.","Our Peripheral Interventions business continued delivering strong growth, including double-digit increases in key regions of the world such as Japan and the rest of Asia Pacific.","Worldwide revenue was up 8% constant currency in the first quarter with 7% growth in the U.S. and 9% constant currency growth internationally. We continue to drive higher growth from our refresh pipeline in all 3 PI franchises, and sales growth came from the continued strength of multiple products including stents, balloons and peripheral embolization devices.","We recently launched 2 new CTO devices and new below-the-knee accessories and have several other key product launches planned that we expect to help continue to drive growth in 2012 in this $700 million-plus business.","Worldwide non-stent Interventional Cardiology was down 4% in constant currency as procedural softness and ASP erosion persisted in the quarter. However, this business grew sequentially, and year-over-year performance improved in every geographic region. We plan to launch new products in vascular access, balloons and IVUS later this year and expect to see continued improvement in this business as a result.","Worldwide Electrophysiology was up 1% in constant currency during the quarter, as some softness in both the small tip and large tip business was more than offset by growth in other segments.","Our Endoscopy business had another solid quarter with worldwide sales up 5% in constant currency, led by 9% growth in the U.S. This performance was a result of growth across several of our key product franchises: our biopsy business; our biliary device franchise, driven by continued growth in our Expect EUS needles and access products; our Metal Stent franchise, led by our industry-leading WallFlex product family; and our Hemostasis franchise on the continued adoption and utilization of our Resolution Clip for GI bleeding.","In constant currency, our worldwide Urology and Women's Health business was flat versus Q1 last year, but was up 5% internationally. The Urology business maintained its leadership position and delivered 7% worldwide constant currency growth, driven by an 8% increase in our core stone management business. Our Women's Health business declined 11% on a worldwide constant currency basis as continued pressure on elective procedures due to the weak macroeconomic environment and concerns around the use of surgical mesh for pelvic organ prolapse more than offset strong double-digit growth of our next-generation Genesys HTA System for the treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding in the quarter.","Outside of the U.S., our international Women's Health business experienced excellent growth and was up 22% in constant currency, driven by new product introductions, increased sales investments and the penetration of new therapies.","In Neuromodulation, we continued our momentum from 2011 and grew our worldwide business 8% in constant currency during the first quarter, with 8% growth in the U.S. market and 21% international growth. These sales increases were driven by a differentiated product portfolio including our recently launched Infinion lead and strong commercial execution strategies.","Moving on from sales. Adjusted gross profit margin for the first quarter was 66.5% or 130 basis points lower than the first quarter of last year. It is important to note that gross margins in the first quarter of last year were positively impacted by approximately 270 basis points due to a $50 million true-up adjustment recorded during that period related to our third-party supply arrangement for PROMUS. Excluding this benefit, gross margins were higher in the first quarter of this year, primarily due to the continued mix shift toward self-manufactured product in the U.S. as a result of the recent launches of PROMUS Element in the U.S. and Japan. This was partially offset by pricing pressure, although the negative impact of pricing was less than expected during the quarter.","Looking forward, we expect gross margins to be between 67% to 68% over the remaining of the 3 quarters of the year as we complete our transition back to self-manufactured products in DES and the benefits from our Plant Network Optimization program continue to take hold.","Adjusted SG&A expenses were $654 million or 35% of sales in Q1 2012 compared to $592 million or 30.8% of sales in the first quarter of last year. The increase was primarily due to the release of approximately $20 million in bad debt reserves relating to fully reserved accounts receivable collected in Greece in the prior year quarter as well as increased costs in the first quarter this year, resulting from our recent investments in commercial resources and infrastructure to support our emerging markets initiative and to expand the rollout of recently acquired products including Alair and WATCHMAN, as well as litigation-related charges.","We continue to expect adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales to be between 33% and 34% for the full year, which -- with much of the increase compared to 2011 due to onetime benefits realized in the prior year as well as commercial investments related to emerging markets and new products made over the past year and litigation-related charges. Based mainly on the estimated timing of spending within the year, we expect to be near or above the high end of our SG&A guidance range in Q2 and within the range in the third and fourth quarters.","Adjusted research and development expenses were $215 million for the first quarter or 11.5% of sales. This compares to $212 million in the first quarter of 2011. We continue to expect R&D spending to increase slightly each quarter as we progress through the year and to be between 12% and 12.5% of sales for the full year as we ramp spending in several of our Priority Growth Initiative areas.","Royalty expense was $48 million or 2.6% of sales compared to $51 million in the first quarter of last year. Consistent with the prior year, we expect royalty expense to be relatively consistent from Q1 to Q2 and then decrease in the second half as we reach lower per-unit royalty rate tiers under our annual volume-based arrangements.","On an adjusted basis, pretax operating income was $323 million or 17.3% of sales, down 610 basis points from the first quarter of last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income was primarily the result of lower gross margins and higher SG&A expenses and was largely attributable to several positive items in the first quarter of last year including the PROMUS supply agreement true-up and bad debt recoveries in Greece that I mentioned earlier.","GAAP operating income, which includes GAAP to adjusted items that had a negative impact of $127 million on a pretax basis, was $196 million in the first quarter.","Now I'll move on to other income expense. Interest expense was $69 million in the first quarter, which was $6 million lower than the first quarter of last year, primarily due to our prepaying $1.25 billion of debt in the first half of last year. Our average interest expense rate in the first quarter of this year was 5.8% or about 50 basis points higher than the first quarter of last year, primarily due to prepaying short-term debt with lower interest rates than our long-term public bonds.","Our tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 8% on a reported GAAP basis and 12% on an adjusted basis. Our adjusted tax rate in the first quarter reflected a decrease in our expected full year operational tax rate from 17% to 15%. Our Q1 adjusted tax rate also reflected $8 million discrete tax benefits recognized from the first quarter, which primarily related to the release of tax reserves following a favorable court decision, as well as certain timing items during the quarter.","We expect our adjusted tax rate to be slightly higher than 16% over the remainder of 2012 as the Q1 timing items reverse.","First quarter EPS was $0.15 on an adjusted basis and $0.08 on a GAAP basis, both of which were above our respective guidance ranges. GAAP EPS for the first quarter included about $0.01 per share of restructuring-related costs, amortization expense of $0.06 per share and less than $0.01 per share of both acquisition- and divestiture-related charges.","Stock comp was $27 million in the first quarter, and all per share calculations were computed using approximately 1.45 billion shares outstanding. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately 1.43 billion shares outstanding.","Moving on to the balance sheet. DSO of 64 days was up 2 days compared to the first quarter of 2011 due to the continued weakness in EMEA, partially offset by strong U.S. collections. Days inventory on hand was 128 days in the first quarter of both this year and last year.","On a reported GAAP basis, operating cash flow was $212 million compared to a $97 million outflow in the first quarter of last year. Q1 2012 cash flow included $39 million of restructuring payments. Q1 2011 cash flow included a $296 million payment to settle a legacy GUIDE legal claim, $31 million in tax audit settlements and $33 million in restructuring payments. Excluding these items, adjusted operating cash flow was $251 million in the first quarter of this year compared to $262 million in Q1 of last year.","Capital expenditures were $66 million in the first quarter, comparable to last year.","In the first quarter, we returned to full investment-grade status when Moody's raised our credit rating to Baa3 with a stable outlook. This marks the first time since 2007 that all 3 rating agencies assessed our credit profile as investment grade.","We also strengthened our financial flexibility by putting in place a new 5-year $2 billion revolving credit facility yesterday, which replaces our previous facility. We believe these developments further support our ability to invest in innovative technologies for use by physicians and their patients, as well as to fund other shareholder value initiatives.","Turning to share repurchases. We repurchased 23 million shares for approximately $140 million in the first quarter. During the past 9 months, we have now repurchased approximately 7% of our outstanding shares. At our current stock price, we estimate we have almost $600 million of authorized capacity remaining under our share repurchase programs. We continue to believe that our stock price is undervalued, and we expect our full year 2012 share repurchases to be in line with our prior guidance, subject to business development opportunities, market conditions, our stock price and regulatory trading windows and other factors.","We remain very confident that we can balance our priorities of investing in growth and returning capital to shareholders over time, all while improving our investment-grade metrics on the strength of solid cash flow.","Let me now walk you through our guidance for the second quarter as well as updated guidance for the full year.","We expect Q2 consolidated revenues to be in a range of $1,850,000,000 to $1,950,000,000. If current foreign exchange rates hold constant, the headwind from FX should be approximately $40 million or around 200 basis points relative to the second quarter of 2011.","On an operational basis, we expect consolidated Q2 sales to be in a range of up 1% to down 4% compared to the second quarter of last year. On a worldwide basis, we expect DES revenue to be in a range of $345 million to $370 million and CRM revenue to be in a range of $500 million to $525 million.","We expect second quarter adjusted EPS to be in a range of $0.14 to $0.17 per cent -- per share and reported GAAP EPS to be in a range of $0.06 to $0.09 per share.","Moving to the full year. We now estimate that consolidated 2012 sales will be between $7.35 billion and $7.65 billion. Assuming that current foreign exchange rates hold constant, we expect the full year headwind from FX to be approximately $106 million.","On an operational basis, consolidated 2012 sales should be in a range of up 2% to down 2% with year-over-year growth rates improving sequentially as we benefit from new product launches, increasing contributions from emerging markets and continued stabilization and easier comps in the U.S. defib market as we anniversary the significant declines we experienced last year.","From an earnings standpoint, we continue to expect adjusted EPS for the full year 2012 to be in a range of $0.60 to $0.70 and would again encourage you to model the midpoint of the range. Excluding any onetime items that may arise, we continue to expect adjusted EPS to increase sequentially as we progress through the year due to increasing level of benefits from several key components of our $650 million to $750 million in cost-saving opportunities.","On a reported GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.25 to $0.38. As a reminder, we expect the pending acquisition of Cameron Health to be approximately $0.01 dilutive to 2012 EPS on an adjusted basis and more dilutive on a GAAP basis. However, we do not plan to incorporate expected impacts from this acquisition into our guidance until the transaction is closed.","That's it for guidance. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Sean, who will moderate the Q&A. Sean?","Sean Wirtjes","Thanks, Jeff. Perky, let's open it up to questions for the next 20 minutes or so. [Operator Instructions] Perky, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First, a guidance question and then maybe a follow-up. I think the one thing in the guidance that kind of caught me was you guided to a sequentially down CRM performance in the second quarter. You did $535 million. You guided to $500 million to $525 million, and that's despite your comments about potential stabilization in the ICD market and obviously, more importantly, all of your product launches in ICDs and pacers. Could you just maybe walk us through that? And why would CRM revenues be down sequentially?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Well, Mike, let me go back and clarify. So we did $500 million in the first quarter, and we're guiding to a range that's higher than that, so I'm not sure what...","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I apologize. So you're -- when you guided to that, you were excluding your -- the EP business.","Jeffrey D. Capello","That's correct.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, so you're excluding the -- so you're looking at it, okay. So that makes more sense to me. That's perfect, that's fine. Let me ask you a couple of pipeline questions, if I can. You gave a little bit more clarity on the pathway for a couple programs. One was Synergy, you said approval late this year. Could you just talk a little bit about the time line between approval and actually launching Synergy and what the factors might be there?","William H. Kucheman","Mike, this is Hank and I'll ask Dr. Dawkins to comment as well, but we expect approval earliest late '12 on Synergy. Then we'll go into what we refer to as a limited launch for a period of time in Europe, and then from there a full launch. Now the exact timing of how long the limited launch would be and when we do full launch is to be determined and would be driven by the clinical protocol. Keith, do you have anything you want to add to that?","Keith D. Dawkins","Just add to that even with a limited launch, which will be limited to certain accounts, we will have the full matrix of Synergy products, both in terms of length and diameter of stent. And that will then be followed by a formal investigation of a short DAT regimen 3 months against 12 months in a very large trial.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then one other pipeline question, and I'll let others jump in. On the Lotus program, the CE Mark trial that you'll move into, could you just or tell us what sizes you'll be evaluating and whether that will just be a transfemoral study or will there be a transapical component?","Keith D. Dawkins","Yes. So REPRISE I, that's the feasibility trial we'll complete tomorrow. And the result of the 23-millimeter valve used in that trial will be reported at EuroPCR next month. REPRISE II, which is the CE Mark trial, will commence in Q3 this year. And we'll be investigating the 23- and 27-millimeter valves using the transfemoral approach in 4 countries: Australia, U.K., France and Germany. That will lead to CE Mark in the second half of 2013.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Leerink Swann.","Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","I also wanted to focus on the pipeline a little bit, if I could. Hank, you sort of provocatively said that the INGENIO launch, maybe the opportunity is underappreciated. Can you just remind us where your share is now, in your opinion? And where can a strong INGENIO launch take share over the next couple of years?","William H. Kucheman","Yes, Mike Mahoney's been spending a lot of time focused on the CRM business. So Mike, I'm going to let you take that one.","Michael F. Mahoney","Sure. On the INGENIO launch, we're excited about that. It just got launched in Europe very recently, and this is our first pacer platform launch in about a decade. And this is really an important market for us given our low share position, as you said about 15%, and also the growth of the pacer business along with our investments in emerging markets. So as you know, it's about a $4 billion market, and we have a number of platform products that will continue to come out over the next 3 years. We'll be launching new pacer platform along with a new CRT platform, CRTP platform, and also incorporate remote patient monitoring. And also MRI compatibility will be available in Europe in the second half of 2012. And also we're looking for a U.S. launch later in the second quarter of 2012, when the MRI clinical trial will also take place. So this is a big market. It's our first meaningful launch, significant investment. And with the commercial capabilities that we have in Europe and in emerging markets in the U.S., we expect to take share in this market with the product.","William H. Kucheman","And, Rick, the only thing I would add to that is the appetite for our commercial team to get their hands on this product is high.","Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","I bet. If I could follow up on Cameron. Of course, I'd love to ask you whether you think the panel will be positive and when approval will come. But I'll skip past that and ask, can you frame the opportunity -- I just had a recent doc call who -- the doc said he thought initially once approved, that Cameron could take 8% of the market and long term maybe more like 10% to 12% of the market. So do you think that this expands the opportunity -- the ICD market opportunity? Does this cannibalize existing sales? Just frame that just with your latest thoughts.","Michael F. Mahoney","Yes, in Cameron -- that's a great question. We view the defib market today at about $6.5 billion. The team from Cameron has reported in their announcements that they believe the S-ICD, given its unique characteristics, can potentially address up to 40% of that market. And as you said, when you spoke with your EP physician, he believed it was 5% to 10%. The Cameron team would say it's up to 40%. So we believe that this will be clearly a $1 billion market opportunity for us because we believe it meets unmet patient needs with young patients, patients who have difficulty with their venous system, patients prone to infection. And also with the growing concerns of a lead reliability, which thankfully, as Hank articulated, we do have the most reliable lead in the business today. But having a solution that has a S-ICD platform that does not have the lead dropping into the heart, combined with our new platform, really positions us very strongly in the ICD marketplace. So the marketplace overall, we're calling, at minimum, a $1 billion market opportunity going forward.","Operator","And our next question goes -- comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Jeff, I wonder -- there's a dramatic number of dynamics going on right now in the DES market, from discussion around obviously PROMUS Element conversion, stent impression, pending RESOLUTE as well as kind of pricing. As you think about your business across the quarters, is it safe to assume your guidance basically sticks kind of flattish DES growth in the second quarter, flattish absolute dollar growth? Is it safe to assume that, that quarter in your mind will represent a trough for your DES business? Or is that not as visible right now?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Well, I think we came into the year, David, kind of knowing that with Medtronic, Integra, RESOLUTE coming into the market, it was going to be a quarter or 2 where we would have some disruption in terms of share. And I think that's happening earlier than we anticipated. We originally anticipated that to hit the market in the second quarter. So we're going through kind of that air pocket, so to speak, earlier. That'll probably kind of take us the next couple of quarters to kind of see where all the share shakes out. But ultimately, look at the back half of the year. We feel pretty good about our product and its attributes and think we can kind of be in a good position from a share perspective. But we'll have to see how that plays out.","William H. Kucheman","And David, this is Hank. The other thing I would add to that, which I agree with entirely in terms of what Jeff just said, is don't underestimate the impact of the long stent, the 38s and 32s. Those are sizes that aren't available to all competitors. Now once we have those in our hands, I think that will enhance, as I said in my script, our share position.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Very, very helpful. Maybe just 2 more quick ones. The first is just on Cameron. I know we've had some questions about market sizing. But in terms of margins, obviously critical component of the Boston story, in the first several quarters of launch or first year or 18 months of launch, do you think that Cameron can be gross margin accretive? And -- or conversely, can Cameron still be EBIT margin accretive when you consider potential cross-selling? And maybe just one quick follow-up.","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes, that's a multipronged question because Cameron in and of itself, given its start-up nature, smaller company procuring components on its own, doesn't have the leverage that we have. So when their product comes out, the margins will not be at our corporate margins. However, I think as Mike clearly laid out, we think this would benefit, not only with that product but follow-on sales as well. So there's not only kind of the impact of getting their margins up higher, which we plan to do, and they have successive product generations in their pipeline to do that to address their gross margins, but we think we're going to get into incremental accounts we're not in today and get follow-on business. That will come at our variable margins, which will be accretive to our overall margins. So there'll be a mix issue. Net-net, that's going to be a pretty good deal for us. We're pretty excited about it.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great, Jeff. And lastly, just on Asthmatx. I may have missed it, but can you give us any sense, absolute quantification, of what the contribution of Asthmatx can be either in terms of percent of growth or absolute dollars in '12?","Jeffrey D. Capello","I think we've been very clear from the beginning that we're very excited about Asthmatx. And Hank, in his script, laid out some of the positive reimbursement milestones. We expect those to accelerate as we go through this year, to pick up steam. I'm not going to be able to share with you an explicit dollar amount at this point in time, but we continue to believe that, that technology, in and of itself, has the capability in 2013 to nosebleed move the top line of the company. It's one of 7 technologies we have coming out in the next 2 years which we think can kind of move the top line of the company.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two questions, guys. One, on U.S. ICDs. Your ICD number beat our expectations, and I'm curious how your business performed in the quarter. The reason I'm asking is, is a lot of the Riata noise really resurfaced in the month of March. So did you see a lot of growth coming in March because of the Riata issues? Or was growth just steady throughout the quarter? And then I had a follow-up on stents.","Michael F. Mahoney","Glenn, it's Mike Mahoney. We have seen a increase over the past 30 to 60 days in the selling of our RELIANCE leads. So as we look -- we track our can [ph] sales as well as our lead sales, and over the past 45 days we have seen an uptick in our lead sales. One, based on the attributes and strength of the reliability and survivability of those leads, I think, given the public pressures of some of our competitors and the confidence that EP doctors have in our lead reliability. So we have seen an increase there and we continue to anticipate that lead performance will continue to grow in the second quarter. And combined on the heels of that, we'll continue the rollout of our new platform launches in the U.S. as we scale the operations up for that.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then, Hank, you mentioned the importance in the stent market of the 38-millimeter and the 32-millimeter sizes. Can you remind us what percentage of the market are these longer stents? And will these stents be launched at a premium to help pricing in the second half of the year?","William H. Kucheman","I don't know off the top of my head, and we can get it to you, Glenn, what percentage of the market the longs represent, but we'll follow up with you on that. And we're right in the middle of determining our pricing strategy for that, and I don't want to let the competition who's on the line know what we intend to do.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Jeff, it would be helpful, I think, to get an update from you on the $650 million to $750 million in cost savings cut by program and the timing of each, and then I just had one follow-up.","Jeffrey D. Capello","Okay, Larry, so let me go through each of the pieces. The first piece is PROMUS Element. So very we're very encouraged by 6-month earlier-than-expected approval in the U.S., full quarter earlier approval in Japan and a full year earlier in Canada. So that $200 million that we feel very good about. I think I said last quarter that we thought 2\/3 of it would fall in 2012. I think that's probably a pretty good estimate, with the other 1\/3 following in 2013. The next category is manufacturing VIPs, which is our plan to take out 5% of standard costs every year. That's on track. We have a world-class manufacturing group, and so we continue to do very well there. So that's $200 million spread over the 5 years pretty equally, and we're on track with that, and that will happen every year, the $40 million of that. Net corporate SG&A, we had $100 million to $200 million of savings in the $650 million to $750 million, as you'll recall. We announced a restructuring plan to take out $225 million to $275 million of costs in the second quarter of last year. So we actually have a plan to kind of exceed that by $25 million to $75 million. That's going well. I suspect we may even come up with incremental costs on top of that, that we can take out as we continue to kind of work on our cost structure. So we feel very good about that. Not much of that really benefits this year. Most of that benefits '13 and '14. So that's benefit ahead of us, which is good news. Project transformation is running the R&D function more efficiently. There's about a $200 million savings as we grow the top line of the company. We're on track for that. That's a multiyear approach, more '13 and '14 and '15. And then the last component is the Plant Network Optimization, and there we had a plan to save $100 million of costs, all hitting the gross margin line. We closed the last of the plants, the largest plant in Miami, at the end of the fourth quarter of last year. So those savings -- a lot of those -- some of the savings are already kind of occurred in 2011. There's a big chunk in 2012 and there's a small tail that happens in '13. And then, of course, we have the med tech tax going the other direction, and unfortunately that looks like it'll probably continue to be a challenge for us all unless something different happens. But we'll plan as though we have to work our way through it.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Jeff, lastly, could you remind us of your expectations for the U.S. ICD business growth in 2012? I mean, I think [ph] in the past, you've said you expect sequential improvement by quarter. Is that still the case?","Jeffrey D. Capello","So are you talking market? Or are you talking our business?","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Your business.","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes. So I'll do both because I think it's important for people to understand that -- just to reiterate what happened to the market as we look at the defib market last year, and the real air pocket happened relative to the market in kind of the back half of last year, Q3, Q4 where the market was down kind of the mid-teens. So as we look at our business, we've seen stabilization from a market perspective now for 2 quarters, almost 7 or 8 months in a row now, which is great news. What we expect to have happen is as the market stabilizes and we reach easier comparables with the back half of '12 compared to the back half of '11, we think that the market will kind of be down kind of mid-single digits to low single digits on a dollar basis and we think we can actually be flat to slightly positive on that on the benefit of taking some share with our new project in line.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with Credit Suisse.","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Last year was such an awful year in the ICD market and -- but the JAMA article really kind of talked about 6% of overall units, like a 20% or 30% of primary prevention ICDs. And we looked at some data, and it really looked like a hidden factor in last year's market dynamics was destocking. Could you kind of put that in framework for us?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes, I think it's a good comment, and it's something that, I think, the whole -- looking at competitors' reactions and their commentary, they seemed to experience the same thing. So clearly, I think, what's happening is hospitals are being run differently from a working capital perspective, and they're not nearly as interested in carrying inventory they don't have to carry. And that has an impact on those that bulk or ship inventory at the end of the quarter. So that definitely has an impact. We have seen a decline in our bulk sales the last 2 or 3 quarters. It's had an impact on our growth. However, I will point out, though, that we have a fairly conservative approach where anything over a 30-day supply we defer from an accounting perspective, we don't count as revenue. That's not the same for the competitors. So when you're talking bulking and you're talking across the sector, you have to be very careful in terms of what's actually shipped versus what's recognized from a revenue perspective. But clearly, the customer group, it seems to be moving away from that concept, which is fine for us because we don't bulk a lot to start with, but we have seen less bulk sales in the past couple of quarters.","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Perfect. And then turning back to Cameron. Like if 30% of the ICDs are primary prevention ICDs, we -- our survey said like about 25% of those patients really have low therapy burden, another 5% to 10% have high infection risk. So this is like just first pass is at least 10% of the market. So the question I have is, is the first-gen device optimized enough in terms of size and maybe SVT discrimination to really reach full potential? And where are you in the kind of design stages of next-gen devices that further optimize the concept?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Bruce, this is Jeff. Because the transaction hasn't closed, we're going to stay away from any more further detail relative to the transaction. But we certainly would be more than willing to kind of answer those questions after the transaction closes.","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess then a follow-up is to Keith, is PCI volumes have really suffered since COURAGE, and it sounds like the FAME II trial is almost a anti-COURAGE trial, where it says if a lesion's physiologically important, it should be stented. What's your feeling about PCI volumes and maybe the import of FAME II?","Keith D. Dawkins","Well, I mean, obviously, Bruce, we don't have the FAME II data yet. My personal feeling is that the pendulum has swung too far, seeing recently some cases where there's sort of 99% lesion and people measuring FFR on the assumption that they need another test to justify the treatment. It's always difficult to predict volumes and hit rates in different geographies. I think the FFR pendulum will swing back, and I think volumes will pick up, but it's very difficult to predict that. And it certainly is different in the U.S. compared with Europe and other markets. Clearly, we are emphasizing a lot of our growth opportunity in India, China and Brazil in markets that previously we've underpenetrated, where PCI volumes and PCI growth is in double digits.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I wonder if I could ask a bit on price. You mentioned a couple of times, I think both in relation to drug-eluting stents, but then also broadly as it impacted gross margins, that pricing was a little bit less impactful in the quarter. Perhaps you could give us a little more commentary around that.","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes, Raj, this is Jeff. So we exited last year encouraged that pricing in the DES space in the U.S. was down mid-single digits versus down upper single digits, but it was kind of too early to kind of call the pricing dynamic. So we entered the year with the assumption that price was still kind of the upper single-digit compression for the DES business in the U.S. We saw a better performance, once again, in the first quarter, which is very encouraging. And we hope that, that would continue going forward. So that is encouraging. I would say pricing outside the U.S. was relatively unchanged in the DES world, kind of upper single-digit compression. And then pricing within the CRM market was pretty consistent with what it was in the fourth quarter.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. On the product portfolio, you mentioned your renal denervation product you're moving into first-in-man, I think you said third quarter with a launch next year. When might we see some more detail around your program, what the technology is, any more detail?","William H. Kucheman","We'd be more than happy to give you some of that detail. I think we're probably about a quarter away from uncovering that in more specifics, let's call it. So I'd say the next -- our earnings call we'll talk a bit more about specifically what that program is and some of the product features and benefits associated with.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And just one last, if I could. It was very helpful to lay out kind of all the cost-saving plans you have outlined, the SG&A savings in '13, '14 and beyond. But I'm curious how you think of that net of the additional investments that a lot of these new programs are going to require and also the expansion internationally. Is there a chance that the costs for these programs could be offset in a sense to the benefits you think you'll see? Or are those numbers you're providing really net numbers?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes, that's a good question, Raj. It's important for people to understand those are gross numbers. Those are gross savings. And against that, we have kind of our planned investments relative to the emerging markets and new technologies and the acquisitions we've done. But to be clear, our expectation as of the Investor Day and as it stands today is to expand operating margins and to grow EPS of the company double digits, and we feel with this strong lineup of cost-saving opportunities, we have the capability to do that.","Sean Wirtjes","Okay.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will connect a question and answer session. Instructions will be given at that time.","As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ms. Susie Lisa, please go ahead.","Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Brad. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q3 2015 results which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release, as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the investor relations section of our website under the heading Financial Information.","The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Mike will provide strategic and revenue highlights of Q3 2015, Dan will review the financials for the quarter and then Q4 2015 and full-year 2015 guidance, and then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers Dr. Keith Dawkins and Dr. Ken Stein.","Before we begin I'd like to remind everyone that on the call organic revenue growth is defined as excluding the impact of sales from divested businesses, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and sales from the acquisitions of interventional businesses of Bayer AG, Bayer and the American Medical Systems AMS Male Urology portfolio over the prior year period.","Also note this call contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share, new product approvals and launches, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance including sales, margins, earnings and other Q4 and full-year 2015 and 2016 guidance, as well as our tax rates, R&D spend, and other expenses.","Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause these differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Q and 8-Ks filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them.","At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike?","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well done, Susie. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, Boston Scientific posted another quarter of strong results, as we continue to execute against our near-term goals and longer-term plans that were detailed at our May Investor Day meeting.","We outlined plans to drive mid-single digit organic revenue growth and consistent adjusted operating margin expansion, which in turn will drive double-digit adjusted EPS growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We delivered against these plans in third quarter with worldwide organic revenue growth of 5% and operational revenue growth of 9%, including the impact from the Bayer and AMS acquisitions.","We also continue to make progress on our efforts to improve our adjusted operating margin profile and during the quarter, we delivered a 260 basis point year-over-year improvement to 23.1%. This solid revenue growth and differentiated margin expansion drove very strong 18% adjusted EPS growth. This quarter's results reflect the high performance of our global teams, the continued diversification of our portfolio into higher-growth end markets, and the balanced growth across our businesses.","Looking forward, we remain committed to achieving double digit adjusted EPS growth, and are updating our full-year 2015 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $0.90 to $0.92. This updated EPS guidance brings up the lower end of the range of our initial guidance in February of $0.88 to $0.92, and that's despite an estimated $0.08 foreign currency impact for the full year. We're also raising our full-year 2015 organic revenue growth estimate from 3% to 5%, to now 4% to 5%.","Now a few key highlights for the quarter. In my remarks, all references to growth are on an organic year-over-year constant-currency basis, unless otherwise specified. We delivered broad-based global organic revenue growth of 5% despite a challenging 5% comparable in Q3 2014. We're pleased to see all seven of our businesses deliver year-over-year sales growth either on par or ahead of Q2 growth rates, led by compelling new product launches, increased traction from our Structural Heart business, continued international expansion, and synergies from our acquisitions.","Momentum continues to build in our MedSurg segment and for the second consecutive quarter, each business accelerated year-over-year revenue growth. Endoscopy's year-over-year growth rate improved from 4% in Q1 to 6% in Q2 and now 7% in Q3, and this growth was fueled by our new SpyGlass DS launch. SpyGlass is an exciting new platform that is used to diagnose and treat complex disorders of the pancreas and bile ducts. SpyGlass is also an enabler that helps pull through the core Endo portfolio. In Endo, we've also seen strong reception for our AXIOS endoscopic ultrasound technology, and we continue to drive strong double-digit growth in the emerging markets.","In Neuromodulation, revenue accelerated in Q3, growing 11% after being up 9% in Q2 and 6% in Q1. We delivered strong growth in all regions for Neuromod, with the U.S. up 8%, Europe growing double digits and additionally, EMEA grew at 9%, fueled by emerging markets. This growth was led by continued adoption of our market-leading Precision Spectra spinal cord stimulation platform, which helps provide relief from debilitating pain. In Europe, we're off to a solid start with Precision Novi, our first product for the primary cell non-rechargeable SCS space.","Moving to Deep Brain Stimulation, we began the launch of Vercise, our new primary cell platform in Europe. In addition, we are advancing our strategic alliance in neuronavigation with Brainlab, all in an effort to help improve the quality of life for patients suffering from Parkinson's, dystonia, and essential tremor.","Neurology and public health also improved its top line performance, growing 9% in Q3 after 7% in Q2 and 3% in Q1. The acceleration in the quarter was driven by our comprehensive portfolio, particularly guide wires and laser fibers. We also benefited from our ongoing international expansion efforts, with sales up 7% in the U.S. and 11% internationally. After closing the AMS Male Urology portfolio acquisition on August 3, we have stepped up the important work of quality remediation at our AMS Minnetonka plant to progress towards lifting of the FDA warning letter.","Also, the sales force integration is progressing as planned, and we're excited about expanding the industry's largest commercial team. Importantly, we remain on track to realize our adjusted EPS accretion goals of at least $0.03 in 2016 and $0.07 in 2017.","Our Cardiovascular group grew 6% in Q3, with Interventional Cardiology outpacing our market growth estimates with another 6% increase in year-over-year sales. Most of our IC franchises grew mid-single digits or significantly better, and the U.S., Europe, and EMEA were all up mid to high single digits.","Importantly, we recently earned U.S. approval of our SYNERGY bioabsorbable polymer drug-eluting stents. We are thrilled about the ongoing U.S. launch of SYNERGY, a premium and differentiated workhorse stent that is designed from the ground up to promote healing. We look forward to building upon our strong clinical evidence with the start of the EVOLVE short DAPT study in first quarter 2016, and we remain on track for a Japan launch of SYNERGY in first half 2016. In Europe, SYNERGY continues to grow, and now represents more than 30% of our European DES revenue mix, and over 50% of our mix in our top ten markets.","Our PCI guidance business continues to deliver, with mid-teen growth in the quarter. We recently began the U.S. and European limited market release of our integrated FFR imaging system. Revenue from our broad-based portfolio of accessory products for complex PCI also grew high single digits in the quarter.","Finally, the IC performance was fueled by our strength in the Structural Heart business, which includes our Lotus percutaneous aortic valve and WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure device. We believe that we are uniquely positioned for the long term to assist hospitals and physicians with the growing Structural Heart demands due to the unique capabilities of the Lotus and WATCHMAN platforms.","Lotus continues to penetrate the European market and we are executing on the pipeline that we detailed at Investor Day. Our clinical evidence continues to build with its best-in-class paravalvular leakage rates, and we remain on track to complete enrollment in both our REPRISE III IDE and RESPOND post-approval European study by year-end 2015.","Finally, we're really pleased with our differentiated Lotus Valve including its innovative adaptive seal and the ability to uniquely fully recapture and reposition the valve. The adaptive seal is a crucial contributor to Lotus best-in-valve PVL rates and we have successfully built an extensive patent portfolio to protect that innovation.","Also in the Structural Heart, the U.S. WATCHMAN launch continues to progress well. We are pleased with implant success rates and the high quality of patient outcomes thus far, which reflect our controlled rollout and proven training program. Multiple WATCHMAN presentations at TCT by key opinion leaders demonstrated continued clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness. Dr. Vivek Reddy of Mount Sinai, New York, presented an analysis at TCT of the PROTECT AF and PREVAIL clinical trials that showed a 59% relative risk reduction in disabling strokes. Dr. Reddy also highlighted an economic analysis comparing WATCHMAN with both warfarin and novel oral anti-coagulants, which we hope will be published soon in a major cardiology journal.","WATCHMAN provides protection against stroke while avoiding the long-term bleeding and complications of anti-coagulant drugs and their attendant cost. As a result, we expect that the analysis will show that compared to both warfarin and the novel oral anti-coagulants, WATCHMAN can save the healthcare system money in the long run while also providing outstanding results for patients.","So overall, we're very excited about our progress in Structural Heart. We continue to expect to deliver full year 2015 Structural Heart revenue at the high end of our $75 million to $100 million goal that we provided at our May Investor Day.","Moving to Peripheral Interventions, we have a number of good things happening here. The core PI business continues to execute and we are very pleased with the integration of the legacy Bayer business. After growing double digits in Q2, Bayer Peripheral accelerated and grew 20% in Q3 as we continued to grow share in the atherectomy market.","We're also pleased with our commercial relationship with C. R. Bard in the Lutonix Drug Coated Balloon technology. The combination of Lutonix DCB, two SR platforms (10:58) and the broadest portfolio in PI is helping drive 5% organic growth in our legacy PI business. In PI, we're also encouraged by early feedback on the U.S. launch of our Innova Bare-Metal stent for the SFA and the global launch of our Zelante deep vein thrombosis catheter.","Finally, the MAJESTIC 12 month data was recently announced at CIRSE [Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe] for the ELUVIA DES platform which showed a 96.1% patency rate at 12 months. Excitement is building for the CE Mark for ELUVIA and launch in first quarter 2016 and we expect enrollment for the ID trial to begin this quarter.","Now I'll provide a few comments on CRM. On our first quarter earnings call, we predicted a slowdown in the worldwide CRM sales for the balance of 2015 due primarily to replacement cycle headwinds and competitive launches in the U.S. We have seen that trend develop with global CRM sales flat for the quarter and we continue to anticipate some softness in U.S. CRM sales through first quarter 2016 as we await the launch of key new products in the U.S. such as the launch of our Brady MRI safe system in first quarter 2016 and full X4 Quad system in first half 2016.","Pacemaker sales did grow 2%, led by share gains for our recently launch X4 CRT-D Quad device and while ICD sales declined 1% we continue to be pleased with our de novo (12:16) ICD performance driven by ENDURALIFE battery technology and our second generation S-ICD EMBLEM. However, the EMBLEM S-ICD gains are being offset in the near-term by replacement cycle headwinds.","It's important to highlight that our European CRM business delivered low to mid-single digit for the sixth consecutive quarter. In Europe, we estimate we're taking share with a differentiated portfolio including full X4 CRT-D and CRT-P Quad systems, 3T MRI safe pacemakers, EMBLEM S-ICD and our industry-leading ENDURALIFE battery technologies. These consistent European CRM results are encouraging as we look forward to our anticipated key product approvals in the U.S. in 2016.","In EP, we continue to build momentum with 13% growth in Q3. This encouraging sequential growth is being driven by Rhythmia, our differentiated high density, high resolution mapping and navigation system as well as a solid quarter in our recording devices. We also look forward to the upcoming launch of our IntellaMap Open-Irrigated Ablation catheter in Europe.","In terms of our regional performance in Q3, the U.S. grew organic revenue, up 4%, while Europe and Asia posted 7% growth. Emerging market sales improved to 13% growth, up 12% from Q2, led by mid-20% revenue growth in India and mid-teens revenue growth in China. So stepping back, our 5% organic revenue growth reflects the strong diversification of our portfolio, our focus on meaningful innovation and our ongoing globalization efforts. Importantly, we believe that we're well positioned to continue our performance track record, and I would like to thank our employees for their winning spirit and their commitment to Boston Scientific.","Now let me turn the call over to Dan for a more detailed review of our financials.","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Mike. I'll start with some overall perspective on the quarter before getting into the details. We generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.24 in the quarter, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.21 to $0.23 and representing 18% year-over-year growth. Excluding the $0.03 unfavorable foreign exchange impact, Q3 adjusted earnings per share grew 31% year-over-year. The strong performance in Q3 was driven primarily by operational revenue growth and gross margin expansion.","Our Q3 2015 adjusted operating margin of 23.1% exceeded the high end of our guidance range and represents improvement of 260 basis points over Q3 of last year. In each of the first three quarters of the year, total company adjusted operating margin expanded by at least 200 basis points over the prior year quarter and despite significant FX headwinds, the high end of our $0.90 to $0.92 adjusted EPS range for full year 2015 still represents double digit adjusted EPS growth.","Now for the P&L highlights. For the third quarter of 2015, consolidated revenue of $1.888 billion represented operational revenue growth of 9%, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange and the divested Neurovascular business. Excluding an approximate 110 basis point contribution from the Bayer Interventional acquisition and 310 basis point contribution from the AMS Male Urology portfolio acquisition, organic revenue growth was 5% in the quarter. On an as-reported basis, revenue grew 2% year-over-year.","The foreign exchange impact on sales was a $135 million headwind compared to the prior year period, which was about $10 million worse than we had assumed in our Q3 guidance range. Adjusted gross margin for the third quarter was 72.5%, achieving the high end of guidance and increasing 140 basis points year-over-year.","Cost improvements, driven by our value improvement programs and our FX hedging program, positively impacted adjusted gross margin by 150 basis points and 30 basis points, respectively. This was partially offset by 40 basis points of negative price and mix. Q3 adjusted gross margin was also helped by favorable manufacturing variances, driven by the earlier-than-expected launch of SYNERGY in the United States. Adjusted SG&A expenses were $697 million, or 36.9% of sales in Q3 2015. Our Q3 2015 adjusted SG&A rate was down 110 basis points from Q3 of last year, and we continue to believe our full-year 2015 adjusted SG&A rate will be approximately 37%.","Adjusted research and development expenses were $220 million in the third quarter or 11.7% of sales. This adjusted R&D rate is up 80 basis points sequentially, consistent with our guidance which signaled a higher rate of R&D spend in the second half of 2015 versus the first half. For Q4, we expect a slight uptick sequentially in our adjusted R&D rate, particularly related to clinical trial activity, with a guidance midpoint of 12%. For the full year 2015, we still believe our adjusted R&D rate will be approximately 11.5%. Royalty expense was $17 million in the quarter which was just below 1% of sales.","On an adjusted basis operating income was $436 million in the quarter or 23.1% of sales, up 260 basis points year-over-year and 100 basis points sequentially. Adjusted operating income growth was balanced with all three reportable segments posting more than 20% year-over-year growth. All three segments also grew adjusted operating margin sequentially, with Rhythm Management and MedSurg improving more than 300 basis points each.","Rhythm Management's adjusted operating margin in Q3 was 17.8%, which is up 370 basis points both year-over-year and sequentially. From a gross margin perspective, Rhythm Management benefited from the favorable gross margin profiles of new technologies such as the EMBLEM S-ICD and the ACCOLADE family of pacemakers. Rhythm Management's Q3 gross margin was also helped by favorable manufacturing variances which we do not expect to recur in Q4. Importantly, however, we expect second-half Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin to average 17%, consistent with the guidance given on our Q2 call, and even with an expected sequential downtick in Q4, second half 2015 Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin is expected to increase by more than 200 basis points over the first half of 2015, reflecting the strong gains we're making in this area. We remain confident in the 20%-plus adjusted operating margin for Rhythm Management in 2017 and expect a fairly linear annual progression in terms of that improvement.","To conclude on Q3 adjusted operating margin, it's important to note that while we are very pleased with our rate of 23.1% in the quarter, we believe that roughly 50 basis points of benefit can be attributed to the aforementioned favorable manufacturing variances related to SYNERGY and reserves and variances in Rhythm Management. Excluding this favorability Q3 adjusted operating margin would have landed closer to our guidance midpoint of 22.5%.","GAAP operating income, which includes GAAP to adjusted items of $735 million was a loss of $299 million in Q3 2015. The primary GAAP to adjusted items for the quarter included restructuring related charges of $21 million; acquisition-related SG&A expenses of $23 million; pension plan termination charges of $36 million; contingent consideration expense of $40 million; amortization expense of $131 million; and litigation-related charges of $457 million.","Let me provide a little more detail on the litigation charge in the quarter. The $457 million in litigation-related net charges were related to increases in our transvaginal surgical mesh product liability reserves. Every quarter, we assess all four components included in calculating the reserve and make any necessary adjustments for all probable and estimable charges: one, the volume of known claims; two, the estimated cost to resolve each claim; three, an estimate of future claims; and four, the cost to defend each claim.","The vast majority of the increase in the reserve was driven by the first three items, although all four contributed to the increase in the reserve. Although the pace of newly filed claims has slowed over time, our known claim count is now in excess of 30,000 and we now have reached conditional settlement agreements with certain plaintiffs' counsel throughout 2015 to resolve over 6,000 cases and claims. Our total legal reserve, of which mesh is included, was $1.559 billion as of September 30, 2015, and we believe it reflects our best estimate of what is probable and estimable.","With respect to other income and expense, interest expense for the quarter was $58 million, compared to $54 million in Q3 of last year. The increase was primarily due to the incremental debt raised in Q2 of this year to finance the AMS Male Urology portfolio acquisition. Our average interest rate was 3.9% in Q3 2015, compared to 4.7% in Q3 of last year. The lower interest expense rate in Q3 of this year was primarily due to lower average cost of debt resulting from the senior notes refinancing completed in Q2 of 2015. Other expense was $10 million, and this consisted primarily of foreign exchange losses incurred during the quarter. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 45.9% on an as-reported basis and 11.5% on an adjusted basis. Our Q3 adjusted tax rate includes $4.5 million of favorable discrete tax items, and we now expect our full year 2015 adjusted tax rate to be 13%.","Finally, as mentioned, Q3 2015 adjusted EPS of $0.24 includes approximately $0.03 of unfavorable FX and represents 18% year-over-year growth, or 31% growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange.","On a reported GAAP basis, Q3 2015 earnings per share was a loss of $0.15 and includes net charges and amortization expenses totaling $524 million after tax. A loss of $0.15 compares to earnings per share of $0.03 on a GAAP basis in the prior-year period.","Moving on to the balance sheet, DSO of 62 days increased one day compared to September of last year, and days inventory on hand of 186 days was up 21 days compared to September of last year, due primarily to the acquisition of the AMS Male Urology portfolio. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $394 million, compared to $330 million in Q3 of last year. This increase was primarily due to higher adjusted operating profit and a continued focus on working capital management. We continue to expect our full year 2015 adjusted free cash flow to be approximately $1.3 billion.","Capital expenditures were $69 million in the quarter, compared to $57 million in Q3 of last year, and we still expect CapEx to be roughly $260 million for the full year 2015, and expect Q4 to be our highest CapEx quarter, due to the timing of projects.","There were no share repurchases in the quarter, consistent with our decision to temporarily suspend the share repurchase program following the announcement of the agreement to acquire AMS's Male Urology portfolio. Near term, our capital allocation priorities are debt repayment, maintaining flexibility, and tuck-in M&A; and our M&A strategy prioritizes targets that are a strong strategic fit with compelling financial returns.","We ended Q3 2015 with 1.364 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect our share count to increase by roughly 5 million per quarter through the end of 2016, as we plan to keep the buyback suspended for some or all of 2016, as we had previously announced.","I'd like to conclude with guidance for Q4 and the full year 2015, which now includes the recently acquired AMS Male Urology portfolio. For Q4 2015, we expect consolidated revenues to be in a range of $1.970 billion to $2.010 billion. If current foreign exchange rates hold constant, we expect the estimated headwind from FX should be approximately $80 million to $90 million, or 410 to 460 basis points, relative to Q4 of last year. On an operational basis, we expect consolidated Q4 sales to grow year-over-year in a range of 9% to 10% and on an organic basis, we expect Q4 sales to grow year-over-year in a range of 4% to 5%. We expect adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter to be in the range of 72.5%, plus or minus 25 basis points, and an adjusted operating margin of approximately 22.75%, also plus or minus 25 basis points. Finally, adjusted EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.23 to $0.25 per share, and reported GAAP EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.10 to $0.13 per share.","For the full year 2015, we now expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $7.470 billion to $7.510 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 8% operationally, and a range of 4% to 5% organically. If current foreign exchange rates hold constant, we expect the FX headwind to be roughly $475 million to $485 million for the full year 2015. We continue to expect our full year 2015 adjusted operating margin to be approximately 22.5%, and this would represent an improvement of roughly 230 basis points over the full year 2014.","Finally, we're raising the low end of our full year adjusted EPS guidance range, and now expect a range of $0.90 to $0.92. We expect the unfavorable FX impact on full year 2015 adjusted EPS to be approximately $0.08, up from the initial guidance of $0.04 issued in February. So despite an incremental $0.04 of unfavorable FX, we've not only held our guidance throughout 2015, but are now raising the midpoint from $0.90 to $0.91.","The high end of our adjusted EPS guidance range represents double-digit growth, and based on current rates, 18% growth at the midpoint when you exclude the impact of foreign exchange. On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.02 to $0.05.","Before I conclude, I'd like to give some visibility on the expected impact of foreign exchange in 2016. If foreign exchange rates hold constant, we expect there to be approximately $0.05 of unfavorable FX impact on 2016 adjusted EPS. As we've done so far this year, we will make every effort to offset this impact and deliver on our adjusted EPS growth targets. We'll issue the remainder of our 2016 guidance on our Q4 earnings call in 2016.","I encourage you to check our Investor Relations website for Q3 2015 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q3 results as well as Q4 and full year 2015 guidance, including P&L line-item guidance.","So with that, I'll turn it back to Susie, who will moderate the Q&A.","Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Dan. Brad, let's open it up to questions for the next 30 minutes or so. In order to enable us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one quick related follow-up. Brad, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question will come from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thank you. Can you hear me okay?","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We can hear you.","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We can hear you fine, Bob.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Good morning and congratulations on a really strong third quarter.","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Bob.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, I have two questions, one regarding the fourth quarter guidance on the revenue side, and the other just on 2016 and your comments about FX. So to start with the Q4 guide, you grew a really solid 5% in the third quarter. The fourth quarter guidance of 4% to 5% organic is slightly lower than the third quarter growth despite SYNERGY and a lot of good momentum in the business. So I'm just curious, in Q4 versus Q3, what deteriorates in terms of growth or is this just simply conservatism built into the guide?","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, let me give you a sense of that, Bob. So I think as you said, we're guiding 4% to 5% organically for the fourth quarter. Certainly, very pleased with the organic growth performance year-to-date, which is about 4.7% and expect organic growth of 4% to 5% both in Q4 and for the full year, which is a raise from our previous guidance of 3% to 5%. And a quick tailwind and headwind summary, I think you're right. SYNERGY, obviously, is the largest tailwind in Q4. It does have, obviously, a slower ramp than traditional DES launches, as there's a contracting element to it and it's a premium product. And it does face pretty tough comp year-over-year when you think back to last year, DES grew 12% globally for the company. So it's a tough comp for SYNERGY. And then \u2013 but continued launch and roll out of WATCHMAN as well \u2013 is another tailwind.","On the headwinds side, and I think Mike covered this in his prepared remarks, the CRM headwinds persist. Which as we indicated on our Q1 call, we do have some portfolio gaps in the U.S., primarily around MRI-safe technology and Quad. Good news is we filled those gaps in Q1 with Brady MRI in the U.S. in the first half with Quad. And then we have the replacement cycle headwinds which have been persisting, but those will wane as we go through 2016 and 2017. And then, again, we have another 5% overall organic growth comp for the company versus Q4 of last year.","And then lastly, if you look at MedSurg, very pleased with MedSurg. MedSurg overall, 8% growth in the third quarter, as Mike had mentioned and very pleased with that, but those are the highest growth rates in the past 12 months for each of those businesses. So it would be hard to count on that performance every quarter at the midpoint of guidance.","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'll also add, we delivered a strong quarter this quarter. We expect to deliver a strong one again in fourth quarter. And we've always made the commitment, even at the low end of a range which we clearly don't aim for, we'll deliver on operating income margin improvement targets. So I think the company is focused on high performance. We believe we did it in third quarter; we're giving strong guidance again for fourth quarter and even if we deliver at the low end of the range, we're committed to the margin improvement.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. That's very helpful. I just wanted to make sure we had a sense for the moving parts, so thank you for that answer. So I guess, I'll let others focus on 2016, but I guess to follow-up, I just want to be clear on CRM. Previously, you had said you expect in the back half CRM to be roughly flat year-over-year. And that's what you delivered in the third quarter. Is that what you roughly expect for the fourth quarter as well, implicit in this guidance, is CRM to, again, be kind of roughly flat year-over-year?","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would say that's \u2013 we won't give \u2013 carve out specific guidance for CRM for fourth quarter, but I would say that trend is consistent. You know we called a softening of CRM back in first quarter. We're seeing that. The great news, we're seeing offset in Europe with consistent, I think six quarters in a row, of strong growth in Europe. And those products will be improved in the first half. So, we anticipate an ongoing softening in CRM kind of where we are today, flattish, that we delivered this quarter. And we expect that through first quarter 2016 consistent with the script.","The great news is we're offsetting that flattish growth with strong growth across the enterprise. And more importantly, or as importantly, we're delivering strong growth in Europe with our CRM portfolio. And so, we're anxious for that to come to the U.S., which would further propel 2016.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Perfect. Congrats again.","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And then Bob, did you have a question on FX for 2016 as well?","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Well, I just \u2013 you guys gave some guidance there and a $0.05 headwind \u2013 and that's much appreciated. And I just wanted to kind of get your sense for other puts and takes because the Street is modeling roughly 16% earnings growth for next year. And it was just \u2013 with a $0.05 FX headwind \u2013 just wondering if you had any other comments and other considerations for 2016 relative to what you said previously.","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think I'm not going to get into a full 2016 guidance review, obviously, today, but just given the FX landscape of the year and a lot of questions we get relative to FX going into 2016, felt like it was prudent to give folks a sense of what we see relative to that in 2016. As we did this year, we were able to offset all of that. Our goal obviously is to offset as much of that as we can, but in terms of specific line item and headwind and tailwind guidance for 2016, I'll save that for the call in February.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning.","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, David.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Mike, I wonder if you could give us some high level thoughts on 2016. As you remember, back at the Analyst Day, you talked about 100 basis points of acceleration in the LRP sort of heading into next year. And when I consider Quad, SYNERGY and WATCHMAN, is there any reason that we should not expect acceleration in 2016 relative to the numbers you're putting up here in 2015, which looks like they're going to come in pretty close to 5%?","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning. We really don't want to provide any ongoing guidance to 2016 till after our fourth quarter close and our call. So I would just say we give pretty specific guidance that we've delivered on for many years in a row now during our Investor Day meeting. So we called for some accelerated growth in 2016 at that Investor Day, and so we continue to execute against that plan, both in top line and margin improvement, Bob (sic) [David] (35:12) but we likely won't get into any additional guidance until later.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then Dan, maybe kind of another quick question. You gave us the currency for next year. I'm just thinking about the fourth quarter guide. You're averaging about 230 basis points of margin expansion year-to-date. Obviously, the fourth quarter revenue guidance, at least versus our model, is pretty solid. Your margin guidance for the fourth quarter's also very solid, 200 basis points of year-on-year expansion. But your earnings number, $23 million to $25 million, is a little low based on the margin and revenue performance. Is there anything non-op to call our attention to in the fourth quarter? And kind of same question for 2016, Dan, other than currency, is there any non-operational stuff we should be considering in our models for 2016? Thank you.","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, I don't think anything of a material nature from a non-op perspective. I think if you look at what we drive from an operating margin perspective and the improvements there, the flow-through to EPS is \u2013 save for the FX commentary that I have \u2013 the flow-through is pretty consistent and standard. So and...","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And any case for 2016?","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","...that's for Q4, and then for 2016, same thing. I wouldn't \u2013 again, I'm not going to get into specifics \u2013 but I wouldn't look at anything from a non-op perspective that would derail the ability for the operating margin to translate into EPS improvement.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay.","Operator","And our next question will come from Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Chris T. Pasquale - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. This is Chris Pasquale here for Mike. Mike, the sequential acceleration in Neuro and EP over the first nine months of the year's been encouraging. Can you just go into some more detail on some of the drivers there? What are you seeing in Neuro, and where do you think you are at this point in the Rhythmia launch?","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Neuro, the business grew really well in the quarter, 11%. So the business continues to do well. We're the number one share player in the rechargeable market in the U.S., and we recently launched our primary sell product in Europe and in the Asia market. So that's a category that we hadn't played in, which is a little over $250 million market outside the U.S. So we've got a leading platform in the U.S. that we continued to expand. We launched Novi to expand the addressable market for spinal cord stim.","And also, another big part of our strategy in Neuromod's is expanding beyond pain. We've been investing for a number of years in our deep brain stimulation platform, and I said in my prepared comments, we have a primary sell DBS launch called Vercise that we're really excited about, because that's the primary \u2013 focus is on primary cell (37:36) rather than rechargeable for DBS. We're also unrolling our DBS trial in the U.S., which we'll provide additional guidance on in the future. So, that business continues to expand. We have very differentiated technology in the markets also; we think are consistent, strong mid-single digit growth markets.","On EP, we're really pleased with the success here. We've had three quarters of sequential growth. We've put up 13% this quarter. And we continue to put the building blocks in place to have a very powerful EP business and Rhythm Management business combined with our CRM business in the future. And that's, as I mentioned before, that's really being driven by our Rhythmia, our mapping system, which gives the physicians lots of speed in terms of capture of the imaging; and also recording devices and we're launching our therapeutic catheter line in the fourth quarter in Europe and we'll extend that to the U.S. in 2016.","Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President-Investor Relations","Ken, do you want to add any comments?","Kenneth Stein - Senior Vice President & Chief Medical Officer-Cardiac Rhythm Management","Just to say in terms of the Rhythmia launch itself, again, very pleased with how it's going. We've seen it used now in multiple different geographies. It's been used in all four chambers of the heart successfully, and getting very consistent feedback from physicians using it, that it's enabling them to successfully treat arrhythmias that they never ever would have been able to approach before.","Chris T. Pasquale - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. And then, sorry if I missed this, but could you tell us how the DES business performed this quarter? I don't think I heard any comments there and just wanted to get a baseline ahead of the U.S. SYNERGY launch; maybe globally, and in the U.S. if you can.","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. We're not breaking out the growth rate specifically for DES. Interventional Cardiology business grew 7%. Essentially, think of our DES growth in line with the market as we approach the SYNERGY launch in the fourth quarter and the Europe and the Japanese launch later in 2016.","Chris T. Pasquale - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question will come from David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I wanted just to start with WATCHMAN and then certainly I appreciate your comments, again reiterating the Structural Heart business likely to come in at the high end of the range that you had provided back at the Investor Day in May. But maybe you could help us go into just a little bit more detail on how WATCHMAN is performing. Any sense on reorder rates and how we should just think about the ramp in that business, particularly in light of some of the data that were presented positively at TCT?","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Good morning. And I'll let Ken Stein comment as well. Just on a couple of the figures, we're not providing any additional guidance on WATCHMAN in terms of our revenue update or reorder rates. We continue to, what I will comment on is the business is doing quite well. We discussed hitting the high end of the range of $75 million to $100 million, WATCHMAN being a key contributor to that. We're really well on track of our goal of opening 100 centers this year. So we'll deliver against that and then we'll open up new centers in 2016. And the team has done a really good job of managing the controlled launch and providing excellent training. Ken, any other additional comments you want to provide on WATCHMAN?","Kenneth Stein - Senior Vice President & Chief Medical Officer-Cardiac Rhythm Management","Yes. Thanks, Mike. David, I just want to reiterate, we're really pleased not just with the rates that we're seeing of implants in the U.S. post-commercialization, but the success and fantastic safety profile that we're seeing, which again, as Mike, I think, has said previously, that's what's (41:09) been a really rigorous approach that we're taking of training and to account selection. Again, as you said, we had some great data out at TCT; going to have a featured presentation at AHA in a few weeks on our European post-market experience, a 1,000 patient trial called EVOLUTION.","And again, as Mike said, really looking forward to seeing publication of a cost effectiveness paper at some point in the near term, which we really hope is going to show that, in addition to giving great patient outcomes, that this is a device that is also very likely to save the healthcare system money over the long run.","David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just on the Rhythm Management franchise, you did provide some detail around duration of replace and market headwinds, and when we should potentially see a turn there next year. But if you kind of take a step back and look at the overall Rhythm Management portfolio, it would seem like you're moving from a position of potentially playing a little bit of defense, given the replacement market dynamics, to being much more on your front foot with the X4 launch, Rhythmia ramping up the next generation line of pacemakers, EMBLEM, et cetera. Are you at a point now where you feel like that business can move into an accelerating growth mode? And to what extent do you think that's a sustainable trend, versus this is just sort of the normal horse trading of market share that occurs here?","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I actually think we're playing offense in CRM rather than defense, for a couple reasons. One, we talked about six quarters of consistent growth in Europe, where they have our \u2013 really, many of our leading products \u2013 and growing quite well in Europe, despite a replacement cycle headwind in Europe. And also, in more on the offensive mind, we continue to gain share in de novo implants. So physicians are choosing Boston Scientific more often than not. A lot of that's being driven by our EMBLEM S-ICD platform, which is growing sequentially very impressively. But as you said, the headwind is more on the replacement cycle headwind, which will abate as we approach the end of 2016.","So, we are positioned well for 2016 once we get out of the first quarter, which I mentioned in the prepared comments, with the anticipated product approvals. And you'll see a ramping down of this replacement cycle headwind in fourth quarter 2016 as we get into 2017.","David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. Two questions on SYNERGY. First, with respect to the U.S. strategy, should we assume the strategy will be similar to Europe, in the sense that you'll take a multi-tiered pricing strategy? And would the goal be to \u2013 I assume \u2013 to capture more of the U.S. market than you've done in Europe with SYNERGY? And then as a follow-on, specific to pricing, a lot of our survey work suggests that you could probably get a 10% premium, and that would be accepted by the interventional market. So maybe talk about what you guys are thinking in terms of premium pricing, and what your market intelligence is suggesting, in terms of what the market would bear with respect to a premium price? Thanks.","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we do thank you for your insight on the survey. That helps. I think overall on SYNERGY we will continue to, as we said consistently, continue to have a tiered portfolio in drug-eluding stents. We had that in the European market with SYNERGY priced at a premium. In the ten markets where SYNERGY's launched in Europe, it represents over 50% of our market share. And in the U.S., we also will have that same tiered portfolio with SYNERGY; the premium end, Promus PREMIER, which is the market-leading stent in the U.S., will be at a price discount versus SYNERGY. So we won't provide the specific premium that we're going to charge. I think it is important to note that this is a premium product, but as Dan indicated in his comments, this is a product that we will need to go through a contracting process with hospitals, given our pricing strategy. So we do anticipate excellent results in 2016, but we need to also work through that contracting process with hospitals.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Can I just add...","Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President-Investor Relations","Keith, do you want to add anything?","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Can I just add one quick follow-up? As you've launched this into the marketplace today and into your hospitals, what's been the overall reaction to the product, from a pricing point of view?","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","From a pricing point of view, clearly, many hospitals would desire no price premium. We don't believe that's warranted, based on the acute performance of the stent and also the experience that we've seen in Europe, and we also have a terrific alternative for hospitals with our Promus PREMIER. So, it's our job to prove the unique benefits of the platform that justify the premium. We've done that in Europe ,and that will be our plans as well in the U.S.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President-Investor Relations","Keith, you want to comment?","Keith D. Dawkins - Global Chief Medical Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, Glenn. We're also excited, obviously, about the post-approval study, the short DAPT trial with SYNERGY. Normally a post-approval study is a rather vanilla study, but on this occasion, with the agreement of the FDA, we can explore the unique properties of SYNERGY with this early and synchronous elution of the drug and polymer. Many patients, as you know, in the big DAPT trial were not randomized. Many patients spontaneously discontinued DAPT. So we put ourselves in a position, if the trial is acceptable, of having a unique product in the U.S. in relation to a short DAPT, which we and the agency, the FDA, think is very relevant.","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks for the question, Glenn.","Operator","And our next question will come from Brooks West with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Wanted to switch gears back to Urology, if I could. Can you talk about, what is in the guidance for AMS? Is that about \u2013 we've got about $167 million in our model for 2015 \u2013 is that about the right number? And then as a follow-up to that, I think that business, when you acquired it from Endo, was growing at about 3%. Obviously, you're putting up much higher growth in your Urology franchise. As you roll those revenues out into the broader footprint, should we be thinking about that 3% accelerating to more of 8% or 9% going forward?","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thanks for the question. We had a real strong quarter for our Urology business and our core business as we called out in the highlights here. Also, very excited about the integration. We're very committed to the $0.03 accretion in 2016 and $0.07 the year after. And we've really talked about the strong strategic fit with the company, particularly in the commercial channels and the portfolio fit between the two companies. It's just I've made a couple of high-level comments and Dan can provide some additional insights.","In terms of the actual integration itself, we've planned for some minor commercial disruption in the fourth quarter and likely in the first quarter of 2016 given the size of the integration, some of the commercial moves that we're making and also to ensure that we have an appropriate level of stocking with our distributors in terms of inventory.","So all that's in our model. So we believe that as we end 2016, as we've said before, that the AMS portfolio will be at least accretive to the BHC (49:04) overall business, and our core legacy business, pre-AMS in Urology, has actually grown accretive to our growth rate. So overall, we're very pleased with the progress that we're making. And Dan, any other insights on that?","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Nothing I'd really add to that. We're not going to break out the specifics of AMS that's in our guidance number for Q4. It's included in the 4% to 5% organic number that we have. So I think Mike's comments cover it well.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. And just a follow up on CRM if I could. I know Ken's there. What's the timing on getting an MRI-safe TACE device in the U.S.? And then as we parse through your comments about your European growth versus your U.S. growth, as you get on cycle with everything in the second half of next year in the U.S., should we be extrapolating the growth you're putting up in Europe right now to the U.S. market in kind of late 2016 into 2017? Thanks.","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, a couple things. In terms of some of the key approvals, it's tough to pin down precisely, but we project a first quarter \u2013 probably likely a late first quarter 2016 approval for our patient MRI \u2013 and a first half approval for our TACE \u2013 I'm sorry, our Quad device. So, again those are the key enablers for the U.S. getting back to positive growth in 2016. And without giving any additional guidance to 2016 in the U.S., that portfolio's performing very well in Europe. We'll bring it to the U.S and then we'll take it to some other markets like Japan. So, Ken, you have any insights on the clinical front on those areas?","Kenneth Stein - Senior Vice President & Chief Medical Officer-Cardiac Rhythm Management","Yeah. Yes, Mike. Brooks, I can fill in a little more. So on TACE MRI, I think U.S., to begin with, let's remember one of the major products gaps our competitors have which is subQ ICD. And we are hoping to be able to launch an MRI-safe S-ICD TACE device, both in Europe and in the U.S. at some point during 2016. In terms of older generation ICDs, trans-venous ICDs, we're really pleased with the reception in Europe with our MRI-safe labeling because we've been able to make it backwards compatible to our current generation of devices, EL and mini devices, as well as having an MRI conditionally safe, X4 Quad Pol CRT device. And we will be beginning U.S. clinical trials of those devices during calendar year 2016.","Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","That's very helpful. Thanks, Ken. Thanks, Mike.","Operator","And our next question will come from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question; just one on the tax rate and one on emerging markets. So, Dan, just starting with the tax rate, can you confirm that if the R&D tax credit is renewed, it's worth about 200 basis points or $0.02 in 2015? And so if it is renewed and the 2015 tax rate comes in at 11%, should we be thinking about 2016 about 100 basis points higher from that and 100 basis points higher in 2017? And I understand your philosophy, Dan, on the tax rate and being conservative until it's renewed. But just, can you just set expectations, if it is renewed, what the benefit would be?","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Larry. So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, 13% for this year. I think when the R&D tax credit, if it is renewed, is renewed, it depends what comes with it. A lot of times it doesn't just come as a one-sentence thing. There are other pieces that are attached to it. So I would say \u2013 I'd be comfortable saying \u2013 it's between 100 and 200 basis points. I don't think it's guaranteed to be 200. So we'll see if it is renewed and if it's renewed for 2015 and potentially 2016, we'll see what impact that has on our tax rate, but I'd say between 100 and 200 basis points. And then going forward, I'd look for our guidance in the late January, early February timeframe for 2016 tax rate guidance, but as you know, what we had said before is 100 basis points increase annually for the next few years.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. And then on emerging markets, it looks like your growth there this quarter was pretty steady, I think 13% organic, similar to last quarter. So Mike, could you give us a little bit more color on what you're seeing in emerging markets? Obviously, there's been some \u2013 it's been in the news a lot in the last quarter or so \u2013 and how sustainable you think that growth rate is that you put up this quarter? Thanks a lot.","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Certainly as you indicated, some challenges in many of the emerging markets. The good news is we're growing consistently. So it's not quite the growth rates we delivered in 2014, but we put up a 13% in Q3 and I think it was at 12% or 13% in Q2. And so we really don't see that trend modifying. Really, the growth for us in the emerging markets continues to be on the heels of China, where we're growing strong mid-teens growth in China. We're also growing strong in India and we target about 10 emerging markets that we won't go through all of them on the call here that we put additional emphasis on. We continue to invest in additional training centers; we continue to invest in R&D capabilities outside the U.S., particularly in China and India; and we continue to expand our distribution reach in these key markets.","So although the market's slowed a bit from our previous year's performance, we feel comfortable with our performance in Q3 and that trend going forward.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the questions, guys.","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yep.","Operator","And we'll go on to the next question in line. It'll come from Matt Taylor with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Matt C. Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Can you hear me okay?","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, Matt. Yes.","Matt C. Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. So my first question is obviously you're closing the AMS deal here and talking about getting back to normalized leverage levels. I guess just with the kind of M&A landscape that's out there, I think there's been a lot of smaller assets that have really come down in value, and I was just wondering how you're thinking about M&A in that context and what kind of leverage levels you'd be comfortable with if there's things out there where you can be opportunistic?","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think our answer there really stays the same. We always look for \u2013 we're always looking for appropriate M&A activity. We've guided that we'll continue to look at tuck-in acquisitions that deliver strong ROIC, that exceeds our cost of capital ideally by year three. And so we'll continue to look. I know the market's been very volatile, but in the quarter itself we did a number of early stage venture investments, one being in mitral and a few others that we won't discuss \u2013 disclose publicly. So we always look and the markets have made, maybe the market's a little bit more ripe for M&A activity. Dan, any other comments there?","Daniel J. Brennan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I wouldn't comment on a specific leverage level, Matt, except to say that we're still committed to delevering as we had announced at the time of the AMS acquisition, to get back to our pre-AMS leverage metrics by the end of 2016, which is why we suspended the share repurchase program and prioritized some debt payment here in 2015 and 2016 as well.","Matt C. Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. And a couple of people have asked around this question, so I apologize if it's a little bit redundant, but I was wondering if you could just give us a flavor for how you see some of the different factors in your Rhythm Management group in terms of what the contribution could be once you lap some of these headwinds? Meaning, could you talk a little bit about the magnitude of the replacement headwind and how that abates? And then what you expect from MRI-Safe and Quad? Which of those is the biggest catalyst of the three and if you could talk a little bit about the timing, I think that might be helpful.","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So really at this call, we're not going to provide any additional insights into our 2016 CRM guidance. We've reinforced a few times that our European business is performing mid to low single digit growth six consecutive quarters; bring those portfolios to the U.S. In 2016, we'll be faced with that replacement headwind for a big part of the year in 2016, but that'll abate more in fourth quarter 2016 into 2017. So, we're clearly positioned for improved performance going forward, given the product portfolio and the eventual reduction of the replacement cycle headwind. And we'll get more insights on that as we provide 2016 guidance.","Matt C. Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President-Investor Relations","Last one, Brad.","Operator","And that'll come from the line of Matt Keeler with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Matthew J. Keeler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just first on SYNERGY, I'm wondering if you can give us some color on how you're thinking about the ability of that product to drive unit share in the U.S.? Do you see the potential for that or is this more of something that gets you benefit on the price side?","Michael F. Mahoney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, we clearly are working that equation. We're confident that if we didn't drive a price premium that we could gain share quickly, but we don't think that's the right thing for the business for the long term. So we've been pretty consistent on that. We do believe we have the ability to gain share with SYNERGY despite a price premium, given the unique characteristics of the platform combined with the comprehensive other solutions that we offer including Chronic Total Occlusion, the WATCHMAN device and others in Interventional Cardiology. So, Keith, any other comments there?","Keith D. Dawkins - Global Chief Medical Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. I think the superior acute performance of SYNERGY resonates with cardiologists in countries that we've launched the product in, and also obviously confirmed by the pivot \u2013 U.S. pivotal EVOLVE II trial \u2013 it has best-in-class stent thrombosis rates of 0.4% at 12 months. So I think the safety and the early healing characteristics of the device are appreciated, both by cardiologists and their patients.","Susan Vissers Lisa - Vice President-Investor Relations","Okay.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Michael Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Campbell","Thank you, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Hank Kucheman, Chief Executive Officer; Mike Mahoney, President; and Jeff Capello, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q3 2012 results, which included key financials and reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that press release, as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in today's conference call to the comparable GAAP measures and other supporting schedules to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financial Information.","During this morning's call, we will be approximately 1 hour, Hank will begin our prepared remarks with an update on our business progress and his perspectives on the quarter. Jeff will then review our Q3 financial results and business performance, as well as Q4 and updated full year 2012 guidance. Hank and Mike will then make some final comments before we open the call up to questions and answers. During today's Q&A session, Hank, Mike and Jeff will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Dawkins and Dr. Stein.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities law, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, project, believe, plan, estimate, intend, should and similar words.","These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding our growth; market share; our products and markets for them; new product approvals, launches and performance; procedural volumes and pricing; clinical trials and data; cost savings and growth opportunities; cash flow and its uses; foreign exchange rates; our financial performance, including sales, margins, earnings, losses and other guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2012; goodwill impairment; tax rates; R&D spending; and other expenses.","Actual results may differ materially from those discussed or implied in these forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs and 8-Ks filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them.","At this point, I'll turn it over to Hank for his comments. Hank?","William H. Kucheman","Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone, and thanks again for joining us. Let me begin today with some comments on our third quarter performance, which Jeff will cover in more detail later.","Our third quarter revenue of $1.735 billion was down 7% on a reported basis and down 5% on constant currency, excluding the neurovascular divestiture, and resulted in us coming in at the lower end of our third quarter range. But despite challenging economic and competitive environment, we remain keenly focused on our strategy of returning to top line growth in the near term and building on that over time. And I'll outline our progress against that here in a minute.","On an adjusted basis, our earnings performance was a positive in the quarter as we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.16 driven primarily by continued gross margin improvement and cost control. This was in line with street consensus and at the higher end of our guidance range of $0.14 to $0.17. Adjusted operating cash flow remained strong at $295 million. We used a portion of our cash flow to buy back approximately 46 million shares of stock in the quarter. We continue to believe our stock price remains undervalued, and we expect that this belief will continue to influence our balance capital allocation strategy moving forward.","From a business performance standpoint, another significant positive in the quarter was the continued constant currency growth we saw in several of our businesses. Our Endoscopy and Neuromodulation businesses delivered mid- to high-single digit sales growth in the quarter. Even more impressive was the performance of our PI business, which grew U.S. sales by 12% and worldwide sales 7% compared to third quarter last year. And in the emerging markets of Brazil, Russia, India and China, we also grew at approximately 30% on a combined basis contributing close to 100 basis points of growth to the company as we begin to see some returns on our investments. In total, 7 of our 12 business units grew greater than market. We expect to see continued above-market growth from these businesses and regions, which is a key element of our expected path back to top line growth for the company.","The U.S. CRM market continues to be challenging and volatile. We have upgraded -- we have updated our future expectations in this market and realigned elements of our business, which resulted in an estimated $809 million noncash goodwill impairment charge within the quarter, which Jeff will further outline in a few moments.","On a worldwide basis and the Interventional Cardiology or IC market, global PCIs continue to grow mid-single digits with growth in international markets offset by declines in the U.S., which combined with global pricing dynamics are yielding a global market that we believe is declining in the low- to mid-single digits in dollar terms. This market continues to be strategically important for Boston Scientific despite end-market challenges and the competitive pressures we have experienced, particularly in the last few quarters.","We now have successfully converted substantially all of our worldwide PROMUS share to our Element platform, which is one of the reasons we see improved gross margin performance. In the U.S., our PROMUS Element Plus long lengths have been well received and we expect them to continue to provide access to more competitive accounts as those accounts come up for contract renewal. We estimate our third quarter U.S. DES share to be in the mid- to high-30s.","In terms of our DES pipeline, our next-generation Synergy Stent continues to progress according to plan, and we continue to expect both CE Mark and the commencement of our IDE trial, EVOLVE II, by the end of this year. In our core IC business, we launched the Emerge PTCA balloon catheter, the Convey 5 fringe range for guiding catheters during the quarter, and have received positive feedback from customers.","In addition, we acquired BridgePoint Medical with a suite of coronary CTO devices that add to our unique and clinically differentiated portfolio of IC products such as Rotablator, IVUS cutting balloon, all of which enable us to be a one-stop shop for complex PCI procedures. In short, we are leveraging the play book we use to successfully rejuvenate the Peripheral business and as result, we expect the portfolio of IC core products to grow faster than market and help support Boston Scientific's return to top line growth.","On the structural heart front, we are excited by the Lotus Valve and look forward to the REPRISE I 3-month data, which will be presented next Tuesday at TCT. In addition, we achieved another important milestone last week with the first patients enrolled in our CE Mark study REPRISE II, which we expect to be completed in the first half of next year. We continue to expect the use of data from that trial to support CE Mark approval and European launch of the Lotus Valve in the second half of 2013.","In Peripheral Interventions, we expect to continue strong above-market growth in the U.S. as we execute the launches of key products including Epic Self-Expanding Vascular Stent, TruePath CTO Device, Victory guidewire and PTA balloons. We continue to see growth around the world with certain countries in Asia Pac and Latin America showing impressive double-digit growth during the quarter. In addition, our launch of the INNOVA Self-Expanding SFA stent in Europe is contributing to PI growth internationally.","In Endoscopy, we continue to expect the recent product launches to bolster our already strong Endoscopy above-market growth profile. During the quarter, we experienced broad growth across several of our key product franchises. Our biopsy business, our Biliary device franchise driven by continued growth in our Expect EUS needles and access products, our Metal Stent franchise, led by our industry-leading WallFlex product family and our hemostasis franchise on the continued adoption utilization of a resolution clip for GI bleeding, which has been a significant market share gainer.","In the quarter, we were pleased with the American Medical Association, CPT editorial panel's decision to sign Category 1 CPT codes specifically for our bronchial thermoplasty therapy beginning January 1, 2013. Category 1 CPT procedure codes are recognized by all public and private health insurance payers in the U.S. This is a major reimbursement milestone for bronchial thermoplasty, and we believe it also reflects the strength of the clinical evidence and the tremendous support for the procedure amongst pulmonary physicians. These codes should provide greater access to treatment for patients with poorly controlled severe asthma, facilitate easier claims processing and accelerate private payers' coverage of this much-needed treatment option.","We are very close to surpassing our year-end goal of establishing 200 worldwide treatment sites. We're experiencing good reorder rates, as well as consistent rates of cases being approved by large payers as predetermination.","In Urology and Women's Health, we launched the AccuTrac and Flexiva TracTip Laser Fibers. Both products are designed to improve the scope trackability of the laser fiber during kidney stone lithotripsy procedures. In addition, we continue to expand the commercial launch of our BackStop Gel, which is designed to prevent stone migration during stone management procedures. We continue to believe this business has considerable above-market growth potential and expect to introduce several new and differentiated technologies in both our pelvic floor and urology franchises over the next couple of quarters to help realize that potential.","In Neuromodulation, we launched the Vercise Deep Brain Stimulation System for Parkinson's disease in Europe. The Vercise System leverages our differentiated technology platform and is designed to enable physicians to selectively stimulate targeted areas in the brain. Vercise also offers the longest battery life and the smallest footprint of all stimulators currently in the DBS market. Over the next few years, we expect that DBS opportunity will enable us to enter a $0.5 billion global market and to contribute significantly to the growth of our international Neuromodulation business. This is yet another example where we have introduced clinically relevant innovations that allow physicians to offer more treatment options to their patients.","Now let me move to CRM, where we believe that the worldwide CRM market will continue to be challenged in 2012, declining to low- to mid-single-digits in dollar terms for the full year on a constant currency basis. In the U.S., we're starting to see the easing year-over-year comparisons as we sense that significant 2011 market declines. In the U.S., we estimate the defib market decline in the mid-single digits in dollar terms in the third quarter. From a share perspective, we estimate that overall U.S. defib share would stable sequentially. Our highly reliable RELIANCE lead continues to sell very well in the market, further driving our defib lead report ratio to higher levels. On the pacing side, we believe we are taking share, both in the U.S. and internationally with our INGENIO family of pacemakers in CRTPs. In addition, pacemaker pricing was stable versus last year and sequentially our pricing was up. We believe this reflects us having upgraded our pacer offering significantly, including a wireless, RPM-enabled device along with significant new features like light rate and respiratory rate trend.","As you would anticipate, we are extremely pleased with the early FDA approval of the unique Cameron S-ICD technology and congratulate our colleagues from Cameron for this most significant achievement. Based upon recent customer visits, we believe now more than ever, that this technology is strategically important to our CRM business and that the S-ICD technology provides us with the opportunity to both take share in existing ICD market and to expand the market over time.","Let me reinforce 3 key beliefs for why we feel so strongly about this growth potential. First, with the S-ICD, we will establish the first new category of CRM devices since the introduction of CRT. The S-ICD is the world's first and only commercially available completely subcutaneous ICD that leaves the heart and vascular untouched while providing protection as transvenous ICDs. The new subcu category provides physicians and their patients with a new alternative that only BSC can offer. Second, we expect the ICD to capture de novo share in the ICD market. In addition to de novo share, we also expect to take share in complex ICD replacements as evidenced by market research where EPs surveyed said they would choose the S-ICD to manage complex replacements more than 50% of the time. For example, 2 of the first 4 U.S.A. commercial implants came from competitive changeouts. Finally, we believe the S-ICD will be the preferred device among referring cardiologists who have indicated in their research that they would preferentially refer patients for the S-ICD. Furthermore, referring cardiologists also indicated that they would actually increase the number of ICD referrals they make as a result of the S-ICD, which could help expand the market.","We have initiated a controlled rollout of the S-ICD technology that has Medicare reimbursement in place under the existing national coverage policy for ICDs. We continue to believe that the S-ICD has potential to be the major, what's next in this market. More importantly, many in the EP community agree as well.","Turning to Left Atrial Appendage Closure or LAAC, we continue to roll out the WATCHMAN Device both commercially and clinically. The WATCHMAN product line continues to show strong growth in both sequential and year-over-year comparisons. Specifically, third quarter WATCHMAN implants grew by over 60% year-over-year, and we expect full year 2012 sales to be more than double from last year. In addition, we received an expanded indication in Europe for patients who do not tolerate anticoagulants. We continue to expect our FDA PMA submission around year end with approval anticipated by the end of 2013.","We believe the combination of WATCHMAN and the S-ICD, coupled with a newly rejuvenated pacing platform and a very competitive ICD platform gives us for the first time in some time a truly differentiated CRM offering that is expected to translate to an improved CRM growth profile.","Finally, in our EP business, we continue to leverage our expertise in catheter and ablation technologies, we execute our global AFib strategy and progress on our internal AFib focused projects. Our core business in EP is centered on solid tip catheters for cardiac ablation. Over the last few years, our strategic investments have been focused on entering the open-irrigated catheter category. We have a CE Mark for our Blazer Open-Irrigated Catheter, and we market that device in Europe and other international markets. We are currently enrolling 2 IDE trials for approval of the open-irrigated catheter in the United States, one for AFlutter, the study is called BLOCk-CTI, and one for AFib, the study is called ZERO-AF. Future RF catheter investments are expected to build on the core Blazer and Blazer Open-Irrigated platform to bring additional sensors and intelligence to the tip of the catheter. In addition to catheters, we're investing in other large growing segments within the AFib space specifically, Intracardiac Ultrasound imaging for atrial septal crossings, durable sheets and other components that facilitate these cases. In addition, we are excited by the recent acquisition of Rhythmia Medical and its next-generation mapping and navigation solutions for using cardiac catheter ablations. This acquisition is a decisive step forward in Boston Scientific's commitment to the EP business and better positions the company to participate strategically in the fast-growing EP market.","Treating complex cardiac arrhythmias, including AFib and AFlutter represent a key growth area for the company. Rhythmia Medical technology is expected to add tremendous strength to our current suite of solutions to better manage these conditions and provide synergies with the common customer across electrophysiology, cardiac rhythm management and Left Atrial Appendage Closure businesses.","In summary, we are encouraged by the progress we have made on our strategic initiatives, the early FDA approval of the Cameron S-ICD device and the positive feedback that we have received on our recently announced acquisitions. We also grew above market, 7 of our 12 business units. We continue to achieve key milestones relating to our cost-reduction opportunities to drive earnings growth and to generate strong cash flow. And we continue to believe there is a clear path back to near-term sales growth and achieving our objectives through share gains from new and recently introduced products and improved sales execution, as well as increased penetration in emerging markets.","That's it for my comments, so now let me turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Thanks, Hank. Let me begin by providing some overall perspective on the quarter before getting into the details. Despite challenging global economic and end-market conditions, we generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.16, which was at the higher end of our guidance range of $0.14 to $0.17 and in line with street consensus.","This solid profitability was driven by higher gross margins due largely to the transition to PROMUS Element in the U.S. and Japan and continued strong attention to cost control. In addition to our solid adjusted earnings performance, we also generated $271 million in operating cash flow and repurchased approximately 46 million more shares in this quarter.","During the quarter, we recorded an estimated $809 million impairment charge to write down goodwill associated with our U.S. CRM reporting unit, primarily driven by the reduction in the estimated size of the U.S. CRM market and related adjustments to our business, which led to lower projected U.S. CRM results over the mid- to long-term compared to prior forecasts.","It is important to note that given the size of our goodwill balance in this business unit, even small changes to expectations can have an impact on these carry-in amounts. We still believe CRM represents a future growth opportunity for the company given our new products and future technology offerings. The amount of the goodwill impairment charge is subject to finalization and is expected to be within a range of $700 million and $900 million when finalized. As a reminder, this is a noncash charge with minimal tax consequences and has no impact on our expected cash flows or our bank covenant ratios. We will continue to monitor all of our goodwill balances for potential impairments as required.","Consolidated revenue for the third quarter of $1,735,000,000 represents a decrease of 7% on a reported basis and 5% on an operational basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange and the divested Neurovascular business. The actual headwind from foreign exchange on sales was $48 million and in line with what we had assumed in our third quarter guidance range.","Now I'll move to the detailed review of our business performance and operating results in the quarter. Starting with Interventional Cardiology, worldwide revenues came in at $494 million in the third quarter, representing a constant currency decrease of 17% compared to the third quarter of 2011. Worldwide DES revenues came in at $283 million in the third quarter, representing a constant currency decrease of 22% compared to the third quarter of 2011. U.S. DES revenues were $123 million in the quarter, representing a decline of 35% compared to Q3 last year. This decrease was primarily due to a strong comparison to the prior year quarter driven by the launch of ION in the second quarter of 2011, lower share due to recent competitive product launches, lower ASPs and continued softness in PCI volumes. We estimate that our U.S. DES share was in the mid- to high-30s for the third quarter. We expect over time to leverage our PROMUS Element Plus long sizes to enter competitive contracts within previously locked [indiscernible].","International DES sales of $160 million represented a decrease of 7% in constant currency compared to the third quarter of last year, primarily driven by the clients in EMEA and Japan, partially offset by strong market growth in the emerging markets. As expected, sales were lower in Japan as we've lost some share due to recent competitive product launches. We expect this decline to abate and to gain share in the fourth quarter with the launch of PROMUS Element Plus long lengths and small vessel. We are also continuing to build momentum with our Element platform in the emerging markets including India, Brazil and China and expect this to continue to accelerate through the end of this year and into 2013.","Worldwide non-stent Interventional Cardiology was down 7% in constant currency. However, with recent launches of new products and vascular access and balloons along with the acquisition of BridgePoint Medical suite of CTO devices, we expect to see a continued improvement in this business.","Moving on to CRM. Worldwide revenue was $462 million in the third quarter, representing a constant currency decrease of 6% compared to the third quarter of last year. In the U.S., CRM revenue of $273 million represented a 8% decrease from the third quarter of 2011. International CRM sales of $189 million were down 2% in constant currency compared to the prior year quarter.","On a worldwide basis, defib sales were $327 million in the third quarter, which was down 7% in constant currency from the third quarter of 2011. In the U.S., defib sales were $205 million. This was down 9% compared to the third quarter last year due primarily to overall market declines and replacement headwinds in our business.","However, these factors were partially offset by continued success of our highly reliable RELIANCE defib lead and Progeny platforms in the quarter.","Looking at the broader U.S. market, de novo defib implant volumes look like they continued to be relatively stable sequentially, based on the data we have so far for the third quarter. International defib sales of $122 million represented a 3% decrease in constant currency from the third quarter of last year. Finally in pacer, the launches of our INGENIO pacemaker family in both the U.S. and Europe are going very well, and we have received positive feedback from customers. In particular, in the U.S. we received price uplifts that stabilize our ASPs year-over-year with sequential prices up, which is great news.","Moving on to our Peripheral Interventions business, PI delivered another very strong quarter, driven by 12% growth in the U.S. and double-digit increases in certain countries in Asia Pacific and Latin America. Worldwide revenue was up over 7% in constant currency, again, in the third quarter, making it the third straight quarter of 7% global growth. Again this quarter, we drove higher growth from new product launches in stents, balloons, CTO devices, and we expect this growth to continue.","Worldwide Electrophysiology was flat in constant currency over the previous year due to do some softness in both the small tip and large tip U.S. businesses, offset by growth in other segments including capital equipment, cooled ablation and diagnostics.","Our Endoscopy business had another very strong quarter with worldwide sales up 7% in constant currency led by 8% growth internationally and 6% growth in the U.S. This performance was the result of broad growth across several of our key product franchises. In constant currency, our worldwide Urology\/Women's Health business grew 1% versus the third quarter last year but was up 11% internationally. The Urology business maintained its leadership position and delivered 6% worldwide constant currency growth driven by strong international growth of 11%.  Our Women's Health business declined 11% on a worldwide constant currency basis, primarily due to continued pressure on electric procedures and concerns around the use of surgical mesh for pelvic organ prolapse. Outside the U.S., however, our international Women's Health business experienced excellent growth. It was up 13% in constant currency driven by new product introductions, increased sales investments and the penetration of new therapies.","In Neuromodulation, we had a good quarter with worldwide sales up 5%, driven by 3% growth in the U.S. and 60% growth in international markets through a very strong sales execution.","Moving on from sales. Adjusted gross profit margin for the third quarter was 68% or 380 basis points higher than the third quarter of last year. The increase was largely attributable to the continued mix shift towards self-manufactured product in DES as a result of the launches of PROMUS Element in the U.S. and Japan, as well as benefits from our Plant Network Optimization plan and value improvement programs partially offset by price erosion. Looking forward, we expect adjusted gross margins to be between 67% and 68% for the fourth quarter.","Adjusted SG&A expenses were $586 million or 33.8% of sales in the third quarter of this year compared to $626 million or 33.4% of sales in the third quarter of last year. During the third quarter of this year, benefits from cost saving initiatives were partially offset by weaker sales than expected. Looking ahead, we expect adjusted SG&A to be between 33% and 34% as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter of this year.","Research and development expenses were $220 million for the third quarter or 12.7% of sales as compared to $229 million in the third quarter of last year. We expect R&D spending to be in the range of 12% to 13% of sales in the fourth quarter of this year. Royalty expense was $29 million or 1.7% of sales compared to $36 million in the third quarter of last year. We expect royalty expense as a percentage of sales to be relatively flat as compared to the third quarter.","On an adjusted basis, pretax operating income was $344 million or 19.9% of sales, up 330 basis points from the third quarter of last year. The increase in adjusted operating margins was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins, which were partially offset by the impact of lower sales.","GAAP operating loss, which includes GAAP to adjusted items that had a net negative effect of $946 million on a pretax basis was $725 million in the third quarter. The primary GAAP to adjusted items in the quarter were the estimated pretax goodwill impairment charge of $809 million that I discussed earlier, pretax net litigation-related charges of $50 million and pretax amortization expense of $99 million.","Now I'll move on to other income expense. Interest expense was $65 million in the third quarter which was $3 million higher than the third quarter of last year due primarily to a one-time benefit associated with terminating fixed to floating interest rate swaps in the third quarter of last year. Our average interest expense rate in the third quarter this year was 5.5% or about 20 basis points higher than last year.","Our tax rate for the third quarter was a negative 0.1% on a reported GAAP basis and 19.7% on an adjusted basis. The difference between our reported and adjusted tax rates for the quarter is attributable to the net benefit of restructuring, litigation and other net charges excluded in determining our non-GAAP results. Our adjusted tax rate in the third quarter included a net charge of approximately $10 million for discrete tax items, primarily related to an unfavorable court decision in a foreign jurisdiction. Excluding this charge, our operational tax rate for the third quarter was slightly lower than our expected full year operational tax rate of 16% due to timing items that were reversed in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, we expect our adjusted tax rate in the fourth quarter to be slightly higher than 16% as these timing items reverse.  Furthermore, our expected full year tax rate does not include any benefit for the U.S. federal R&D tax credit. If this credit is reenacted with retroactive effect before the end of this calendar year, then the benefit of the full year's credit will be recorded in the fourth quarter.","Moving on to the balance sheet. Days sales outstanding of 63 days was up 2 days compared to the third quarter of last year due to continued weakness in Europe with good performance in other major geographies. Despite lower inventory levels, days of inventory on hand of 150 days was up 19 days compared to the third quarter last year, primarily due to  lower cost of goods sold driven by the PROMUS Element transition.","Reported operating cash flow for the quarter was $271 million compared to $366 million in the third quarter of last year. Q3 2011 operating cash flow included an $82 million benefit primarily related to the $850 million fixed to floating rate interest rate swaps on our public bonds. We terminated these interest rate swaps during the third quarter of last year.","Q3 2012 reported operating cash flow included $24 million of restructuring payments compared to $25 million in last year. Excluding restructuring payments, Q3 2012 operating cash flow was $295 million compared to $391 million in the third quarter of last year. Capital expenditures were $46 million in the third quarter this year compared to $69 million last year. We continue to expect our full year 2012 adjusted free cash flow to be approximately $1.1 billion.","Turning to share repurchases, we repurchased 46 million shares in the quarter for approximately $250 million. Year-to-date, we have now repurchased 87 million shares for approximately $500 million. Since July 2011, we have now repurchased 169 million shares or approximately 11% of our outstanding shares. At our current stock price, we estimate we have over 200 million of capacity remaining under our authorized share repurchase programs. We continue to believe that our stock price is undervalued, however, we expect to use most of our cash flow generated in the fourth quarter primarily to cover upcoming acquisition-related obligations.","Let me now briefly provide some prospective on our outlook and walk you through our guidance for the fourth quarter, as well as updated guidance for the full year. Looking ahead, over the remainder of the year, we expect to continue to face a challenging competitive environment and dynamic market conditions. We believe the risks of increasing macroeconomic weakness, particularly in Europe, and softening procedural volumes are real. As a result, we are carefully monitoring conditions and have applied what we believe is a reasonable level of conservatism in our guidance to account for these factors.","However, despite these uncertainties, we believe there's a reason to be positive. We have recently acquired new technologies and launched key new products in most of our businesses and are seeing mid-single-digit or better sales growth in several of them. As a result, we remain focused on returning to top line growth in the near term. At the same time, we also believe we have significant incremental opportunities to enhance profitability and expect to continue to generate strong cash flow.","With that background, we expect consolidated fourth quarter revenues to be in the range of $1,740,000,000 to $1,815,000,000. If current foreign exchange rates hold constant, we estimate that the headwind from FX will be approximately $10 million or around 50 basis points relative to the fourth quarter of last year.","On an operational basis, we expect consolidated fourth quarter sales to be in a range of down 2% to down 6% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. On a worldwide basis, we expect DES revenue to be in the range of $275 million to $295 million and CRM revenue to be in the range of $445 million to $470 million. We expect the fourth quarter EPS on an adjusted basis to be in a range of $0.15 to $0.18 per share and reported GAAP EPS to be in a range of $0.07 to $0.10 per share.","Moving to the full year, we now estimate that consolidated 2012 sales will be between $7,170,000,000 and $7,240,000,000 assuming that current foreign exchange rates hold constant. We expect the full year headwinds from FX to be approximately $115 million and the Neurovascular divestiture to be approximately $15 million. On an operational basis, consolidated 2012 sales should be in a range of down 3% to down 4%. From an earnings standpoint, we now expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year to be in a range of $0.63 to $0.66 and would again encourage you to model the midpoint of that range. On a reported GAAP basis, we expect the net loss for the year to be in a range of $2.86 to $2.89 per share.","That's it for guidance. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Hank, who will make some closing remarks. Hank?","William H. Kucheman","Thanks, Jeff. Finally, let me close with a couple of personal perspectives. First despite continued pressure on global health care costs, I clearly believe the opportunity in this industry continues to be significant. Economic realities dictate that companies like Boston Scientific not only continue to develop technology that improves health care but do so in ways that contribute to reducing the overall episode of treatment cost, the frequency and or need for patient reintervention or hospital readmission, or even potentially the co-pays that patients incur from their insurance carrier. These are technologies that will be truly differentiated. These are technologies like Alair, like Synergy, like S-ICD, like BridgePoint, like Lotus and WATCHMAN, all of which spell opportunity for revenue growth. And we, as a company, remain focused on capitalizing on this opportunity in the months and years to come.","Finally, we as a company are fortunate to have a very experienced and capable executive team and have Mike Mahoney as our incoming CEO. Mike and I have worked closely and very effectively together in our respective roles over this past year. Together we embrace the philosophy of 1 plus 1 equals 3, and focus on those imperatives which we collectively believe will return Boston to growth. Some of these are known today, others will manifest themselves in the future. Simply put, Mike Mahoney is the right leader at the right time to return BSC to its rightful place in the medical device marketplace, period.","So that's my final and most important perspective. And I'll now turn the call over to Mike for a few comments. Mike?","Michael F. Mahoney","Thank you very much, Hank, for those very kind words. And with the expected CEO transition date fast approaching on November 1, I would like to thank Hank on behalf of our employees for his tremendous dedication, commitment and leadership during his tenure as CEO. Hank has made a significant leadership contribution to the company for a number of years, and I want to thank Hank for his collaboration and your excellent support over the last 12 months. I truly appreciate it.","So I was able to celebrate my 1 year anniversary yesterday, and I feel more strongly than ever that I made the right decision in joining this company. I have great respect for what Boston Scientific represents today, and I have tremendous optimism for our future.","I have complete confidence in the company and the senior leadership team and in our employees around the world. This health care industry is certainly dynamic. It is under challenging cost pressures. However, for Boston Scientific, the global opportunity continues to be significant. And I'm excited and committed to lead Boston Scientific over the long term. So I look forward to leading the fourth quarter earnings call in January and to our upcoming Investor Day conference, which we expect to hold in February 2013.","So with that, I would like to turn the call back over to Michael and go on with the questions and answers.","Michael Campbell","Thanks, Mike. Brad, let's open it up to questions for the next 20 minutes or so. [Operator Instructions] Brad, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So a little bit -- a little question here, first, on the CRM business. You are guiding a little bit below -- if I look at the midpoints, a little bit below what you've done in the third quarter. And usually you get a little bit of a seasonality bump in the fourth quarter. So is that just being extra conservative given that the market is still uncertain? And then I have a follow-up on stents.","Jeffrey D. Capello","So, Glenn, it's Jeff. So, if you look at the midpoint of our guidance from a CRM perspective globally, it's down about 5% year-over-year. That's more or less what we're calling the market. So from a market perspective, I think you kind of have to kind of do the year-over-year comparables from a market perspective. And I think as Hank kind of laid out, I think we're quite optimistic with the new technology we have coming in, the Cameron S-ICD launch which is now ramping up in the U.S., that we're going to see some strength in that market, of course.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then just a follow-up on stents. As stents came in light again, and again as I look at your fourth quarter guidance, the guidance actually, if you take the midpoint of that guidance, it suggests a sequential uptick. So what are your expectations there? Have you really kind of stabilized the U.S. business and then have more confidence in the o-U.S. business?","William H. Kucheman","Glenn, this is Hank. As I said earlier, I think in the U.S., we estimate mid to high 30s in terms of share position today and, obviously, that needs to be once Medtronic announces true DAP. We believe the competitive launch environment is essentially complete, and we expect to be in a position to drive our share position higher growing -- going forward. And that's going to be with better sales execution, quite frankly. And as I think we both, Jeff and I, alluded to, the longs, I think, will help us in some of the accounts that we've been locked out. The thing I'm really feeling good about is that we have successfully converted substantially all of our worldwide PROMUS share to the Element platform. So in a nutshell, obviously we lost some share this past quarter. The sales organizations in the U.S. and Europe are very much focused on this. And at the end of the day, in terms of how we perform in fourth quarter is going to be a function of how well we execute.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just as a follow-up, is the confidence because you saw a share recovery throughout the quarter, in other words, September coming back strong, which is giving you the confidence that things can be better in the fourth quarter?","William H. Kucheman","I think my confidence relies in the -- this is a U.S. -- more of a U.S. comment, but in the tenure and experience of the U.S. team. We've recently had them in and talked to them about the current situation. I think the confidence is also a function of the fact that we believe that the competitive launch environment is essentially complete. So we can now focus on getting back to clinically differentiated selling and do that in a way that we have been known to do it traditionally.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then one last one just for Jeff, the gross margin guidance is 68% in 4Q. So that's a little bit below where you were in the third quarter. Is some of that FX? If you can give us anymore guidance, that'd be helpful.","Jeffrey D. Capello","Well, I think what we did is we ranged it 67% to 68%, be disappointed if we weren't close to the high end of that range which is more or less where we were in the fourth quarter -- third quarter. So if you look at kind of the gross margin performance for the third quarter, it was actually very strong. If you look at the benefits we got from the PROMUS Element conversion and some of the cost actions, the Plant Network Optimization, the VIP programs. I mean, these programs are really starting to pay off and so those benefits offset but by some price at a 300 basis -- 380-basis-point expansion. And that expansion will be as big, if not bigger in the fourth quarter. So I think 67% to 68%; I'd lean a little bit more to the higher end of that range. And I would just say that you could imagine where we'd be if we had a better performance in the DES business.","Operator","We do have a question from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Mike, I wonder if you appreciate your preamble comments and just thinking about things we've seen from Boston in the last couple of months. I mean it seems as if the message heading into next year is going to do reinvest for growth. But if you think about the last several quarters for Boston, the leverage stasis in light of a weaker top line has actually been at the highlight for a lot of investors. So kind of help us understand, as we go into 2013, if you're going to reinvest to drive this top line back in the positive territory, how confident do you feel that you can still execute on the positive leverage and earnings momentum that you've seen in the bottom line?","Michael F. Mahoney","Well, a couple comments. As Jeff has indicated and we've talked about at a number of analyst calls in terms of how we utilize our cash, we're committed to looking at using about 1\/2 our cash for share repurchase, another 1\/2 for acquisitions that make strategic sense for the company. And so with that as a backdrop, if you look at our business today, as Jeff outlined and Hank did in the call, we have about 45% of our business today that's growing quite well, in our PI business, our Endo business, our Urology business and our recent EP acquisition. So we believe with the pipeline that we have in that -- in those businesses which are representing the higher concentration of our overall revenue, that'll be a big -- the nice platform for us to grow off of. And we need to work really hard, as Hank just talked about, to stabilize our core market share in DES. That'll come through once the long size launch that we talked about, the acquisition of BridgePoint which will put us in a unique position with complex lesions and then continue to improve our momentum in CRM. And I think as you've seen with the portfolio, we've done quite a bit in that area with the S-ICD launch and the new INGENIO and Progeny launch. That, combined with the lot of efforts that we have on globalizing the company more effectively. So we've hired new leaders in key markets. We're aligning our organization to be more nimble and more globally oriented to take advantage of that. At the same time, there's a lot of cost structuring -- restructuring initiatives in place. So there's a number of things we're working on, but if you look at that formula, the pieces of our business that are growing will continue to grow with our pipeline, and we have a lot of efforts to improve our execution and share position in CRM and DES and to leverage those global opportunities. And you've heard about the acquisitions we've made.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's very helpful, Mike. And just maybe a quick follow-up. Obviously, I think the company wanted to be more successful perhaps in taking share in high-voltage ICDs in light of competitor pressures. But now you have Cameron, and there's some optimism about maybe driving your share gains. Can you just help us understand, in the first 12 to 18 months, so what's the strategy for Cameron in terms of number of centers, pricing, share expectations? Anything you can share would be helpful.","Michael F. Mahoney","Sure. What I've learned so far in a year here, share gains in CRM is -- maybe the marathon is a bad example, but it's more of a marathon than a sprint here. And I think what you're seeing in the CRM is just a -- the strength of the portfolio that we're building and the appeal that it has to electrophysiologists, in our defibrillator line, our pacer line, Atritech, S-ICD, as you mentioned, and the recent acquisition of Rhythmia for mapping for RF ablation. So our reputation and clout within the EP community will continue to grow. And, yes, you leverage our reliability of our leads, and the S-ICD, which is just recently FDA approved. And I think you'll see us build momentum in the future in the overall CRM and EP business. And with the S-ICD, we'll do with this very smartly with important physician training in select sites. And we expect to continue to increase the penetration level of the current sites that are using S-ICD in EMEA.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a couple quick follow-ups here. First, just on the fourth quarter gross margin guidance. Jeff, I know you said on the 2Q call that second half gross margins would be in the 68%, 69% range, you came in at 68% here. You guided at 67%, 68% for the fourth quarter. So is the difference there between what you thought a quarter ago and today, is that just the performance in the DES business?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes, Mike, as Glenn asked earlier, I think it would lean more towards the higher end of that range, 67% to 68%, and we're -- year-over-year the DES performance is still going to be down more than the market. And anytime you lose that type of gross margin, it has a mix implication for the business. So that's the biggest factor, differential factor.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And, Jeff, so help us out a bit if we're trying to go forward here. Let's assume that your DES share basically stabilizes at or around the current level, say, it's plus or minus where it is today. What's your ability to grow gross margins in 2013 assuming no changes in your net market share amount to DES or CRM and the current market environment remains as it is with pricing pressure and some volume pressure as well?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes, I think that's a fair question. We're not in any position to be able to share guidance, we're still working through our plan. But what I can tell you is as we step through the infamous $650 million to $750 million that we laid out a couple years ago, maybe I can help you from that perspective. So if you look at the PROMUS Element transition, it was deemed to be a $200 million benefit. I've said along about 2\/3 of that would be consumed in '12. I'd say another 1\/3 probably is left for '13, maybe a little bit smaller given our share is going to be a little bit smaller. So there'll be some margin expansion based on what's left of the PROMUS Element transition. The Plant Network Optimization program is mostly done but hasn't fully rolled through, so we'll get some benefit from that in '13 as well. That was $100 million, probably a smaller portion will hit in '13. I think you'll find from a value improvement program, our cost initiatives. We continue to do very well. We kind of targeted 5% as kind of the number to take out of our standard cost of goods sold every year. I think our manufacturing group will overdeliver on that next year, which will provide some uplift from gross margin perspective. So those are the 3 from a margin perspective that give us some tailwind going into '13, offset obviously by price. However, from an operating margin perspective, I wouldn't want you to lose focus of the SG&A programs we have, as Mike highlighted, and I mentioned and I think Hank did as well. We were originally in the $100 million to $200 million range when we kind of did the Investor Day 2 years ago. In the second quarter of last year, we said it's more like $225 million to $275 million and I've been saying pretty clearly all along, it's going to be north of $275 million. And most of those benefits, you haven't seen yet. So there's going to be a good-sized benefit that comes through '13 and a piece in '14 as well. And then you got project transformation in which you're seeing a little bit lower R&D levels today. And then the final piece is the med tech tax. We had kind of put that at $150 million 2 years ago with a higher revenue. That number is slightly under $100 million. So if you put all those components together, I still don't think any of our competitors have those types of cost improvement programs lined up. Some of them are scrambling to put some in place as I kind of dissect as I've kind of watched what they're doing. But we have a number of them that are in place that have been in place and in movement now for a couple years. And now against that, we've got weaker end markets, so we'll just have to kind of sort everything through.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got you. So let me just ask a couple -- just some really quick follow-ups here. The WATCHMAN performance this quarter and the expectation on the PMA submission to the FDA, when do we get to see the PREVAIL data?","William H. Kucheman","Ken, you want to answer that one?","Ken Stein","Yes, very much. So we finished enrollment in PREVAIL in June of this year. Last end point is at 6 months, so we expect to have a data in hand and analyzed early first quarter next year. And at that point, submit to FDA, as well as present it at one of the major scientific meetings.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, and then last one is, maybe Ken can try and answer this one as well. Given the state of the current drug-eluting stent market and the share loss that's occurred in the U.S. a few times this year, why not accelerate Synergy? Not only in its launch in Europe but its path to the U.S. I know you're still waiting to start the U.S. trial. Why isn't that a bigger priority?","William H. Kucheman","Well, I think it is a high priority for us. And I think Dr. Dawkins, Mike, can walk you through kind of what the strategy is from a clinical perspective. So Keith, why don't you just walk Mike through what the plans are here in the coming months?","Keith D. Dawkins","Yes, sure, Mike. As you know, the EVOLVE first human use trail was presented 12 months ago at TCT. EVOLVE II, which is the pivotal IDE trial, will start within a few weeks, which is both U.S. and out of U.S. And then in the first half of next year, the EVOLVE short DAP trial will be a global trial, 8,000 to 10,000 patients comparing 3 to 12 months dual-antiplatelet therapy. Of course, we think this is a truly differentiated product, which will allow short DAP, which we plan to confirm in a formal trial. So once we have CE Mark, which we anticipate within a few weeks, then we'll roll out the Synergy launch in countries where the CE Mark is applicable starting in 2013.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Jeff, a question for you on capital allocation and M&A plans going forward. You guys have been very busy acquiring technologies, and I'm just curious as to where you think you stand with that process. Is that something that we're going to continue to see over the next 12 months, is more of these technology deals? Or as we look out the next 12, 18 months, are we more in integration mode and we'll see maybe fewer of these types of technology deals that you've been putting forward?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes, a lot of that's going to depend on kind of what's available in the marketplace. I think as we've outlined, we're very positive about the technology we've brought in. And we're making good strides to kind of finish the products or get the commercialization efforts moving along. And I would characterize our capital allocation process as very balanced, having used roughly 1\/2 of our free cash flow to buy back shares this 1.5 years to do technology acquisitions. I think it's just going to depend on kind of what's available, a slight bias for bringing in companies that have revenue today. That can be helpful on the top line, in the operating income and EPS line right away. Given that we've got a number of technologies already brought in there that were earlier in their maturity cycle, let's say. So I think I'd look for us to kind of do a bit of both, both strong commitment to share repurchase will continue, good cash flow will support that and then a part of the cash flow will go to bring in companies with a bias towards more operational entities.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just so I understand the free cash flow generation this quarter. I think you said x restructuring, you had $290-plus million in cash flow, but there's maybe an $82 million one-time benefit in there and then CapEx in the $40 million. So free cash flow was below $200 million, if I'm doing the math correct. And I'm just -- I just want to gauge -- is that wrong?","Jeffrey D. Capello","No. No, that's all right, Bob. So let me clarify it for you. So the point we were making was adjusted operating cash flow before CapEx was $290 million this quarter compared to $380 million last quarter, but last quarter had an $80 million benefit in it for the termination of a swap agreement. So the $380 million, the $80 million was in the last year, so the comparables aren't really comparable. If you look at them from a comparable perspective, the cash flow is more or less equal year-over-year.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So, okay. So you're still on a run rate generating free cash flow of close to $1 billion right now and you're still comfortable with your guidance. And so I guess my question there is, one, for how long do you anticipate you'll have free access to both your U.S. and o-U.S. cash? And your comments today about the stock price seemed to suggest to me at least that the bias would be towards more buybacks as a percentage of total free cash flow relative to history as we look going forward, given the comments you just made about the stock price.","Jeffrey D. Capello","Well, with regard to the trajectory of the cash flows, this business has always thrown off very strong cash flow and we continue to do so even in an environment where performance in the top line is frankly disappointing, there's no other way to put it. And I think there are -- and if you look at kind of our cost saving initiatives, when I was speaking to Mike kind of laying -- Mike Weinstein, laying out kind of the different cost savings programs, those are all going to improve the profitability of the company, right? Now there'll be some investment against those, but those should help drive more cash flow. Our CapEx has been high historically. I think we'll relook at that, and then working capital-wise, this company has carried a lot of inventory, and I think inventory and receivables are a source. So it will depend, to a certain extent, on kind of where the guidance goes and where the end markets go, but I think we're pretty comfortable that $1 billion -- it'll be $1.1 billion this year in terms of free cash flow. We'll continue to generate strong cash flow. And we're going to be committed to buying back shares. I think the senior team and the board is committed, given where the stock price is that, that's a pretty good investment for shareholders.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then, just lastly, you guys are in a unique position relative to a lot of your peers in that you do have access to your U.S. and o-U.S. cash. And I guess my question is I just want to make sure that you think that, that will continue going forward for the foreseeable future.","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes, sorry about that, Bob. I forgot that part of the question. Yes, so by virtue of the fact that when we did the guidance acquisition, the way it was structured, we have intercompany loans set up between the foreign affiliates and the domestic affiliates, which allows us to bring back cash at least for the next couple of years without any impact from either a FX perspective or tax perspective. So not terribly worried about it for the next couple of years at least.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Bruce Nudell from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I realize that Synergy is the next play in drug-eluting stents for you, and it's clearly important to maintain that franchise. We've been calling around Europe, and we've been very surprised to hear that the bioabsorbable stents getting something like EUR 3,500, and the doctors, even though they acknowledge it's going to be hard to prove a clinical benefit, have an intuitive bias towards using it in young patients especially in easier lesions. And so my question to you guys is do you feel that -- do you still maintain your position that, that genre of devices is simply too expensive and mechanically not flexible enough to really garner measurable share even at a level of 10% to 20%?","William H. Kucheman","Bruce, this is Hank, and then I'll let Dr. Dawkins comment on your question as well. But I think I have said publicly several times that at least in my opinion, that BVS will not be a commercially viable platform, and what I mean by that is a workhorse platform. A workhorse platform has to deliver in today's environment the same safety and efficacy result that you're seeing from the current generation DES. A viable platform has to have the same matrix size that current stent platforms have today. A viable platform has to have the same acute performance that the current stent platforms have today. And it also has to be, in today's environment, I think economically competitive. So I think from that dimension, if BVS makes it across the goal line here in the U.S. or rolls it out in Europe, I see it to your point being probably a device for large bore vessels or perhaps younger patients. But I'll let Dr. Dawkins comment as well. Keith?","Keith D. Dawkins","Thanks. And thanks, Bruce. Interventional cardiologists like acute performance and they like safety and efficacy. And as you know, the data around BVS are very limited. In fact there are no published data in what you might call workhorse lesions, bifurcations and so on. And we feel therefore that metallic stents and now thin strip metallic stents that have been with us for 20 years will prevail in terms of workhorse lesions. Also you will have seen now there are recent circa intervention paper published this week which showed this late last strip with BVS, 16 millimeters to 27 millimeters over 24 months. And this is another watch out. We need to see the long-term data. We know that the stent takes 2 or even 3 years BVS to disperse. And therefore, this negates any potential benefit of short dual-antiplatelet therapy, whereas in Synergy, the polymer and the drug have gone essentially by 3 months. So we're very confident with Synergy as it will combine acute performance and will be applicable to long-term, to complex day-to-day patients that the average interventional cardiologists sees all the time.","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And my follow-up question is another clinical question. There was a guideline change in CRT-D where the guidelines are basically now saying for all classes of patients, if you lack both a very wide QRS complex and\/or a left bundle branch block that really CRT and CRT-D, therefore -- or CRT is really not highly recommended. Do you think that this will have a measurable drag on the U.S. market where I think certainly a small minority of patients lack both of those elements?","William H. Kucheman","I think, Dr. Stein, we're going to let you answer that.","Ken Stein","All right, I'm happy to take that one, Bruce. And the short answer is no. I don't think that's going to have any impact. If you look at the guidelines, typically physicians follow not just what are Class 1 guidelines but what are called Class 2A guidelines where the weight of the evidence supports the indication. And those guidelines are really fully in-line with our labeling for our CRT-D devices where we have labeling for use in patients with all of New York Heart Association classes of congestive heart failure and left bundle branch block and a wide QRS complex.","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So you feel that the QRS -- that a very small minority of patients lack both a QRS over 150 or a left bundle branch block?","Keith D. Dawkins","That's right.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Derrick Sung with Sanford Bernstein.","Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I wanted to just follow up on your U.S. DES share position because that's such a critical piece to both your margin and top line performance moving forward. On this call last quarter, you had expressed sort of similar confidence in the stabilization of your share and you'd actually pointed out to improving share performance throughout sort of May and June. Obviously, that must have reversed itself given your further share loss. Can you maybe, in hindsight, talk about what changed over the months kind of to reverse that stabilization trend kind of last quarter into this quarter? And what gives you confidence that we won't see the same sort of reversal next quarter?","William H. Kucheman","Derrick, this is Hank. That's a fair question. And if you recall what happened in the quarter, and I think Mike and Jeff mentioned this on another call, is we did a little bit of a reorganization within the CRV Group where we realigned some of the senior sales management people to have a stronger connection with our corporate sales team. And that happened over the course of third quarter. So obviously, whenever you do something like that, there's a little bit of a distraction that's associated with. And I think that was a part of what happened. That's behind us. You now have the team, as I alluded to earlier in my comments, completely focused on interventional cardiology, DES sales and they were in here recently. And I, for one, expect better sales execution in the months ahead.","Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about your launch strategy for your S-ICD because that seems like that is the significant growth driver for you and ICD is moving forward in back half of this year, back end of this year and to next. Our understanding is that the gross margins on that device, and correct me if I'm wrong, are significantly lower than your margins on your current ICD product. And so my question is, first off, how do you prevent sales of your ICD from cannibalizing your existing ICD sales in a -- particularly in this environment where most hospitals are doing -- are working with multiple vendors and they're just allocating a share of their product to one vendor or the other? And then kind of related to the margin question, how do we think about a successful S-ICD launch and its impact on your gross margins moving forward?","Jeffrey D. Capello","A couple of points. One, on the S-ICD, we think it'll be a -- it'll open up new markets and as well as be a share taker. And so in the U.S., in our recent post-FDA approval, our initial launches were actually competitive x plants where there were lead issues with some competitive products. So clearly there potentially could be some risk of cannibalization of our own share, but we don't have the larger share in the U.S. in ICDs, so we see this as a way to position the S-ICD to take competitive share with changeouts. And we also see it as a -- to grow the market. So we've seen a number of patients come in with primary care patients who have elected to choose the S-ICD because of their age. So we think it'll expand the market and be a share enabler for us in terms of the growth profile of it. That's one of the big reasons why we did the deal. In terms of gross margins, we have a lot of focus on this and a lot of it will be based on volume. So post the acquisition, our teams are working on integrating the manufacturing capability into our proven battery manufacturing at [indiscernible] Minnesota, as well as in Ireland, and so you'll see us transfer the manufacturing processes into our more high-volume CRM capabilities over time, which will drive gross margin improvements. You'll see us over time drive new releases that will improve gross margin to get the cost profile of the product down, and also, thirdly, with volume. As we continue to sell this, the volume will help with the gross margin. So in the short term, within the CRM family it will be slightly dilutive to gross margins, but we'll see that improve over time.","William H. Kucheman","The other dimension I would just add is that we expect there to be to be pull-through revenue, so we expect to get into accounts, and we're already seeing doors are being opened that were not opened to us previously. When we get into those accounts, not only will we sell the S-ICD, we will sell the ICD and we'll also sell the pacemaker. And that all comes through at our variable contribution margin. So you kind of have to look at it as a bundle, and as a bundle, we're happy to kind of get that revenue. That's good revenue for us from a profitability perspective.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Jeff, just quickly for you. The R&D tax credit, could you please remind us of how much that's worth in 2012?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes, so that's not insignificant, Larry. It's about a 200-basis-point reduction in our rate overall for the year, if it passes. And given the activities happening with the election and the expected transition period of the government, the lame duck government that'll exist, our assumption is that, that does not get passed. So if does get passed, our tax rate overall will go down a couple hundred basis points for the full year, which will have a more dramatic impact on the fourth quarter.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Great. And then I just wanted to ask a follow-up question on Synergy, and I did have one question after that. I just wanted to clarify, Dr. Dawkins, is the launch in 2013 still considered a limited launch in your view? And if so, why? I mean, are you still -- are you waiting for the 3 to 6 month dual-antiplatelet therapy data? Is that why it's a limited launch in 2013? And again, I just have one follow-up after that.","Keith D. Dawkins","Sure, Larry. So in 2013, it'll be targeted accounts. It'll be accounts that are involved in the EVOLVE II IDE trial. And it'll be accounts involved in the short DAP trial. And so it won't be that limited. It won't be limited like the BVS launch was limited, to answer that question. So it'll have a good profile in Europe and other CE Mark countries.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And, Jeff, at the Analyst Meeting in 2010, I think your near-term revenue goal was 2% to 4% growth. Has the environment changed such that those goals are no longer realistic looking ahead to 2013? Recognizing, of course, you haven't given guidance but just directionally, any color would be helpful.","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes. So say 2% to 4% 2 years ago, that's where it was. Pick the midpoint, 3%. So the markets were growing 3%. I think as we look at kind of the composite of our market growth today as we stand here, it's probably flat to negative 1%. So it's definitely changed. There's definitely more headwind than there was before, which is going to be more challenging for us. And we're working through our plans with the business leaders today around the world to figure out what implication that has.","William H. Kucheman","With that, we will conclude the call.

Thank you, Susie. Good morning, everyone. Boston Scientific finished up a strong 2019 as we significantly strengthened our portfolio and capabilities for the future by delivering strong revenue and EPS growth. Consistent with preliminary results we announced on January 14th, we delivered 14.1% operational revenue growth and 7.3% organic revenue growth for the fourth quarter of '19. This represents excellent growth, yet was below our organic revenue guidance of 8% to 9% due primarily to our US high-voltage and US EP businesses. Importantly, operational growth outside of the US in both CRM and EP were solid as were worldwide result in five of our other divisions, which all grew at or above market and three posted double-digit growth, Interventional Cardiology, Urology, Pelvic Health and Endoscopy.","With today's results, we disclosed adjusted EPS of $0.46 in Q4, exceeding the high end of guidance due largely to a 3% tax benefit. For the full year 2019, we delivered 11.1% operational revenue growth, 7.3% organic revenue, a 60-basis-point improvement in profitability to 26.1% and adjusted EPS of $1.58, which is up 13% over the prior year, which is also normalized for the $0.07 tax settlement benefit in 2018.","We delivered these results while also generating approximately $2 billion in adjusted free cash flow. Our 2019 financials continue a five-year trend of excellent results and provide solid evidence that our strategy of category leadership in key markets and portfolio diversification into higher-growth adjacencies continues to deliver differentiated results.","Our goal is to continue to execute against our strategic plan objectives, further increase our organic growth profile and deliver top tier sales and EPS growth results over the next five years. Boston Scientific brings a combination of long-term consistent above-market revenue growth, margin expansion, targeted double-digit adjusted EPS growth and a greatly improved ability to deploy a strong free cash flow and that is what we believe position Boston Scientific to continue to drive compelling shareholder value.","We are excited about our plans to build upon our momentum in 2020 and beyond. We're targeting in 2020 operational revenue growth of 10% to 12%, which includes approximately 350 basis points of growth from the Vertiflex and BTG acquisitions, resulting in the full year 2020 organic revenue growth guidance of 6.5% to 8.5%.","Similar to the trend in 2019, given the ramp and timing of 2020 product introductions, acquisitions that will turn organic in the second half, as well as an expected negative first half impact in China procedure growth from Coronavirus. We expect to see organic revenue accelerate in the second half of 2020 in comparison to the first half of the year by approximately 200 basis points. We're guiding to adjusted EPS of $1.74 to $1.79, representing 10% to 13% adjusted earnings growth, which includes a $0.04 to $0.05 of accretion from the BTG acquisition, as well as approximately $2.3 billion in adjusted free cash flow.","I'll now provide some highlights of our fourth quarter and '19 results along with our thoughts on 2020 outlooks. Our revenue growth in this quarter was broad-based across businesses and regions. But most notably this quarter by 13% operational revenue growth in the US, 12% in Asia-Pac and 10% in Europe, Middle East, Africa. Emerging markets had another outstanding quarter, growing operation revenue 16% in the quarter and 19% for the full year and now represents 12% of total company sales.","So turning to each business, our MedSurg segment represents 31% of our revenue mix in '19 and continues to deliver excellent results with sales growth of 11% in the fourth quarter and 9% for the full year. Endo sales grew 10% in the quarter and 9% for the full year, with fourth quarter sales led by double-digit growth at our biliary franchise and infection prevention franchises.","Endo sales also are expected to decelerate slightly in first quarter 2020, where we are targeting a full year growth acceleration in endo, given the breadth and strength of our category-leading portfolio, as well as more significant contributions from the Exalt-D single-use scope launch in second quarter and beyond. I'm also pleased to announce that Exalt-D received CE Mark in late January, we began the limited launch later this quarter.","Our Endo business is also advancing additional pipeline opportunities including the resolution ultra-hemostasis clip and the next-generation launch of our therapeutic imaging portfolio call the Spyglass Discover, which is a single-use surgical scope. We continue to believe our therapeutic imaging portfolio represents a differentiated opportunity in '20 and an incremental $2 billion market opportunity by 2024.","Turning to Neuro and Pelvic Health [ph]. This franchise also continued its excellent performance growing organic sales 12% in the quarter and 8% for the full year 2019, with 15% full year operational growth and that's despite 170-basis-point headwind from the mesh withdrawal. Fourth quarter strength was led by double-digit growth in our single-use LithoVue scope, core stone, Rezum minimally invasive therapy for BPH and almost doubling of SpaceOAR revenue. As a reminder, SpaceOAR Hydrogel diminishes the risk of local undesirable side effects of prostate cancer, radiation therapy and continues to resonate in the marketplace and with patients resulting in $100 million in sales in 2019.","In addition, the Rezum system recently obtained expanded commercial coverage wins this year including Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield and Cigna. We expect Neuro and Pelvic Health to deliver double-digit revenue growth in 2020 and the continued progress of our broad portfolio and globalization efforts.","Turning to global Rhythm and Neuro sales, which were 1% in the fourth quarter and 3% for the full year and they represent 29% of our total mix in '19. Neuromodulation delivered fourth quarter organic revenue up 8% and operational revenue up 19%. The full year organic sales were up plus 7 and operational sales were up 13. As detailed last month at our investor update on the recent NAND's Annual meeting, we remain very bullish on our comprehensive portfolio and exciting pipeline in both pain and brain modulation.","Neuromod results for the quarter were led by doubling in sales of our Vercise DBS system, which offers unique directionality with our cartesia lead. The ability to provide precise neural targeting with this lead allows physicians to optimize therapy and help reduce unwanted side effects for patients. This in addition to the CE Mark approval of Neural Navigator 3, which integrates enhanced visualization with clinical programming to simplify and accelerate physician program. We expect continued strong momentum in DBS in 2020.","Our global spinal cord stimulation sales also improved sequentially from third quarter to fourth quarter in '19. For the full-year, SCS sales were down low-single digits. But we believe the SCS market will return to growth in 2020 given low patient penetration rates, as well as new product launches and clinical data from our team and industry more broadly.","In SCS WaveWriter the only platform approved by the FDA to provide simultaneously paresthesia based and subperception therapy, which targets two different mechanisms of action at the very same time not alternating them for patients suffering chronic pain. In our combo randomized clinical trial three-month data presented at NANS last month, WaveWriter combination therapy demonstrated an 88% responder rate, which is one of the highest responder rates reported among other comparable SCS clinical studies.","Also, our Vertiflex acquisition complements our RF Ablation and SCS portfolio in pain and represents an important therapy for patients with moderate lumbar stenosis. Vertiflex performed well in the quarter and exceeded its full year pro forma '19 sales goal of $60 million.","Turning to CRM. CRM sales fell 3% in the fourth quarter after growing above-market in Q1 to Q3 may end up 1% for the full year. The weakness in the fourth quarter was caused primarily by mid-single-digit declines in the US ICD revenue with global ICD sales declining low-single digits. Fourth quarter patient revenue as expected was down low-single digits worldwide. And we believe that global ICD softness in the fourth quarter was largely related to the tough comps we faced with a global mid-single-digit growth comp in fourth quarter '18. In addition, while we don't have all the fourth quarter inputs, our best estimate is the fourth quarter '19 worldwide CRM market which excludes implantable cardiac monitors likely declined low-single digits.","In 2020, we'll aim to continue to deliver above-market growth in defib due to our longevity benefits, HeartLogic heart failure diagnostic and EMBLEM S-ICD. In 2020, we remain on track to launch LUX-Dx, which is our implantable cardiac monitor by mid-year, but we do expect limited revenue contribution due to the revenue recognition policies. Overall, we expect worldwide CRM revenue to be more in line with the market in 2020, potentially flat to down low-single digits.","EP sales grew 4% in the fourth quarter and for the full year 7%, and US sales grew 8% in the quarter. Importantly, international sales continued to be very strong up 15% in the fourth quarter and up 16% for the full year led by the launch of our DIRECTSENSE catheter in Europe and Japan, as well as continued double-digit growth in major markets for our RHYTHMIA HDx mapping system.","We also continue to enjoy strong response to LUMIPOINT, which is the next-gen HD mapping algorithm that illuminates critical areas of the heart by utilizing user-defined inputs to assist and map interpretation. We continue to answer our pipeline globally in EP and we're pleased to announce that we've just received CE Mark for a POLARx single-shot pulmonary vein isolation technology in Europe. We look forward to bringing POLARx to the market in Europe, as well as beginning enrollment in our US IDE trial. So, overall, we do expect EP sales growth to accelerate in 2020 as we're excited to enter the single-shot market, while continuing to increase our mapping and navigation footprint, and also expanding the launch of our NAV enabled catheter portfolio and adding new features to RHYTHMIA mapping.","Turning to cardiovascular, this segment grew sales in fourth quarter 19% operationally and 10% organically. For the full year 2019 growth was 14% on an operational basis and 9% organic, and accounted for 39% of our total company sales. Peripheral Interventions grew 4% in the quarter and 8% for the full year on an organic basis and 34% for the quarter and 19% for the full year operationally, with the BTG Interventional Medicine acquisition. Legacy PI growth was driven by strong double-digit growth in Asia-Pac offset by a slight decline in US sales due to tough comparisons from the US launch of Eluvia, as well as a competitor's manufacturing issue one year ago.","The Interventional Medicine business performed in line with expectations, growing plus 7% pro forma with high single-digit growth in Interventional Oncology. We expect similar global organic growth trends in PI in the first quarter of 2020 with acceleration thereafter on the integration of BTG, as well as important new product approvals such as Ranger DCB, which is supported by great new head-to-head data from the Compare trial, which we just released last week at LINC.","Interventional Cardiology continues to grow nicely above market, delivering 13% organic and operational revenue growth in the quarter. For the full year IC organic sales grew 10%, which is a 50 -- 550-basis-point increase versus '18, while operational sales were up 11% for the full year. We delivered coronary therapies growth of 1% in the fourth quarter and 2% for the full year.","Synergy Megatron is an important line extension to our market-leading Synergy bioresorbable polymer stent platform as its purpose-built for large proximal vessels. Megatron will be -- is launching in Europe now and is on track for a second half 2020 US launch. Strong structural heart sales then drove the IC sales of 13% overall in the quarter. Strong growth across our structural platforms led the achievement at the high end of our '19 revenue guidance of $700 million to $725 million, which is up over 50% versus '18.","WATCHMAN achieved its strongest quarterly growth rates of the year and fourth quarter as we continue to focus on four important areas, market development and education, continued pursuit of clinical evidence to understand the benefits of WATCHMAN and broader patient populations including lower risk patients to be enrolled in the head-to-head CHAMPION-AF study, number three product enhancements such as the next-gen WATCHMAN FLX, which is expected to launch in the US in the second half of this year, and fourth and lastly, geographic expansion in Japan and other countries..","Turning to TAVR, we continue to be pleased with the launch and progress of LOTUS Edge and remain on track to open 150 accounts in the first 12 months post approval. We also recently received LOTUS Edge reimbursement approval in Japan. It will be in a limited market release over the coming months. Our super annular valve offering ACURATE neo grew mid-teens in the quarter and we look forward to the launch of the next-generation ACURATE neo2 in Europe mid-year.","In Sentinel, which is the only cerebral embolic protection device is now in over 600 US hospitals. We estimate that Sentinel is approaching 20% of the overall US TAVR procedural penetration. We believe that definitive evidence focused on a stroke endpoint will continue to elevate Sentinel to become the standard-of-care for all patients and will help influence future clinical guidelines. To that end, we look forward to beginning to enroll at this quarter in the Protected TAVR randomized clinical trial.","Finally, in the mitral field, we are pleased to have entered the clinic in December in Australia with our Millipede full annuloplasty range for mitral valve repair. We're targeting enrollment in our early feasibility study in the US by the end of 2020. So with our portfolio of WATCHMAN, ACURATE, LOTUS, Sentinel and Millipede, we're excited about our Structural Heart capabilities and long-term growth prospects. And we target combined revenue of $900 million to $1 billion in 2020.","And also outside of three reporting segments I detailed, fourth quarter BTG spec pharma revenue of $58 million brought full year pro forma sales to $250 million, which is down slightly year-over-year and also in line with our expectations.","So to wrap up, we have an extremely exciting future and believe that we're well-positioned to continue and strengthen our performance track record in 2020 and beyond. And for that, I'd like to thank our employees and their winning spirit and commitment to patients.","Now, I'll turn things over to Dan for a detailed review of our financials.","Daniel Brennan","Thanks, Mike. Fourth quarter consolidated revenue of $2.905 billion, represents 13.4% reported revenue growth and reflects an $18 million headwind from foreign exchange, slightly less than the $20 million to $25 million headwind expected at the time of the guidance. On an operational basis, revenue growth was 14.1% in the quarter.","Sales from the Vertiflex and BTG acquisitions, partially offset by the divestiture of our legacy embolic beads portfolio contributed a net 680 basis points of growth at the high end of our acquisition contribution guidance range. Of the 680 basis points, BTG contributed 610 basis points split between Interventional Medicine contributing 380 basis points and Specialty Pharmaceuticals, 230 basis points. The resulting 7.3% organic revenue growth in the quarter was below our organic guidance range of 8% to 9%, as Mike detailed.","Despite the mix, we delivered Q4 adjusted earnings per share of $0.46, above our guidance range of $0.42 to $0.45, representing 16% year-over-year growth and 19% growth excluding the $0.01 net tax benefit in Q4 2018. Earnings were driven by healthy P&L metrics across the Board, as well as an approximate $0.03 tax benefit, higher than expected at the time of our preliminary fourth quarter and full year results announcement. The tax benefit is related to both discrete tax items within the quarter, as well as the lower full year operational tax rate, which I will detail shortly. The FX impact on adjusted earnings per share was immaterial as expected at the time of guidance.","Our full year 2019 consolidated revenue of $10.735 billion grew 9.3% on a reported basis and 11.1% on an operational basis, which includes 380 basis points of growth related to the acquisitions of NxThera, Claret, Augmenix, Vertiflex and BTG, net the divestiture of the beads portfolio. Operational growth was in line with our guidance as the contribution from acquisitions was slightly higher than our expectations and organic growth of 7.3% was slightly below our guidance of approximately 7.5%.","Full year 2019 adjusted earnings per share of $1.58 represents 8% growth or 13% excluding the 2018 net tax benefit of $0.07 in the base. Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 73.1% just above the midpoint of our guidance range and an improvement of 30 basis points over the prior year due to manufacturing improvements, favorable FX and mix driven primarily by strong sales in our WATCHMAN franchise.","For the full year 2019, adjusted gross margin was 72.4% within our guidance range and represents a 10 basis points improvement over 2018. The full year impact of FX to adjusted gross margin was a positive 70 basis points in line with our expectations and along with manufacturing improvements was offset by price erosion, primarily in coronary drug-eluting stents and pacers.","Adjusted SG&A expenses were $1,026 million [ph] or 35.3% of sales in Q4 above our guidance range, primarily due to the lower sales, but an improvement of 40 basis points over the prior year period. Throughout the year, we balanced the need to fund initiatives related to key commercial launches and recent acquisitions, with our commitment to operating expense control and optimization. As a result, we were able to achieve our full year 2019 guidance and decreased adjusted SG&A spending by 30 basis points year-over-year to 35.1%.","Adjusted research and development expenses were $297 million in the fourth quarter or 10.2% of sales, which is down 60 basis points from Q4 2018, primarily due to the timing of certain investments and we're also gaining traction within our R&D efficiency efforts. For the full year 2019, adjusted R&D expenses were $1,138 million or 10.6% of sales, compared to 10.7% in 2018. Royalty expense was 0.6% of sales in Q4 and the full year 2019, which was roughly flat year-over-year for both periods.","As a result, Q4 2019 adjusted operating margin of 27% improved 150 basis points year-over-year and is within our guidance range of 27% to 28%. We also met our full year 2019 adjusted operating margin commitment with a rate of 26.1%, representing an improvement of 60 basis points over the full year 2018.","I'll now move below the line to interest and other expense. Adjusted interest expense for the quarter was $93 million, compared to $62 million in Q4 of 2018. Our average interest rate expense was 6.6% in Q4 2019 or 3.4% excluding the bond repurchase costs related to our Eurobond offering, compared to 3.5% in Q4 of 2018. Adjusted other expense for the quarter was $17 million, compared to adjusted other income of $4 million a year ago, primarily due to a net gain on certain of our available for sale investments in Q4 2018 and both periods include expenses related to our foreign exchange hedging program.","For the full year 2019, adjusted interest expense and adjusted other expenses were $325 million and $65 million, respectively, resulting in total below the line expenses of $390 million. This is in line with guidance and an increase from 2018 largely due to the acquisition of BTG, as well as the make-whole call exercised in Q1 of 2019 to execute the early retirement of our 2020 notes.","Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 4.5% on an adjusted basis below our guidance of approximately 11% due to discrete tax benefits within the quarter, as well as a lower full year operational tax rate. Our full year tax rate was 7.3% on an adjusted basis also below our guidance of approximately 9% due to the lower operational tax rate.","On a GAAP basis our tax rate for the fourth quarter and full year included a deferred tax benefit of $4.1 billion related to transfers of certain intellectual property rights among our various wholly-owned subsidiaries. These transactions more closely align the global economic ownership of our intellectual property rights with our current and future business operations.","We ended Q4 2019 with $1.413 billion and full year 2019 with 1.411 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $638 million, compared to $659 million in Q4 2018. In the quarter, we used cash primarily to pay down $900 million of BTG-related debt, executing on our plan to achieve a debt leverage ratio of approximately 2.6 times EBITDA by the end of 2020. As of December 31, 2019 we had cash on hand of $217 million.","Our full year 2019 adjusted free cash flow of $2 billion is lower than guidance and down slightly year-over-year as a result of the timing of capital expenditures and increased working capital requirements, mainly in inventory to support upcoming new product launches. We continue to target double-digit adjusted free cash flow growth for the future and our goal for full year 2020 adjusted free cash flow is $2.3 billion, which would represent 15% growth over 2019.","On a GAAP basis, we recorded a net litigation-related charge of $223 million in the fourth quarter, primarily related to litigation with Channel Medsystems. This drove $129 million sequential increase in our total legal reserve to $697 million as of December 31, 2019, which otherwise would have decreased sequentially as we continue to work to fully resolve the mesh litigation.","Over 95% of all known claims are settled or in the final stages of settlement and we expect to pay the remaining $115 million of anticipated payments into the qualified settlement funds in 2020, which will then resolve all significant existing contingencies related to mesh. As a reminder, this liability is released from our balance sheet as payments are made out of the qualified settlement funds to plan.","Capital expenditures for the full year 2019 totaled $461 million above the high end of our range of $375 million to $400 million, primarily due to timing and some pull-forward from 2020 in manufacturing capacity in anticipation of certain 2020 product launches. We expect capital expenditures to be in a range of $450 million to $475 million for 2020, as we continue to build capacity, integrate acquisitions and position the company for growth.","I'll now walk through guidance for Q1 and the full year 2020. For the full year, we expect 2020 reported revenue growth to be in a range of approximately 10% to 12%, which corresponds to 6.5% to 8.5% on an organic basis, with an approximate 350-basis-point contribution from the Vertiflex and BTG acquisitions net the divestiture of the beads portfolio. As a reminder, Vertiflex is included in organic guidance for 2020 as of June and BTG as of August, at which time the divested beads portfolio will also no longer have an operational impact.","We expect foreign exchange to be a headwind of approximately $30 million to $40 million for the full year 2020. However, as I'll detail shortly, due to our hedging program, we expect the FX impact to EPS to be neutral for the year.","We expect our adjusted gross margin for the year as a percentage of sales to be approximately 72% for the full year with no FX impact. We do not anticipate material improvement over full year 2019, as manufacturing improvements will be offset by pricing declines, which are expected to be slightly higher than usual due to biannual Japan price cuts and China tenders, in addition to mixed challenges from our new high-growth products that are initially dilutive to total company gross margin such as Exalt-D, POLARx and LOTUS Edge.","We expect full year adjusted SG&A to be in the range of 34.5% to 35%. This assumes, up to 60 basis points of improvement over 2019, as we continue to execute on our cost optimization initiatives and also recognize the benefits of programs currently underway. Full year adjusted R&D is expected to be in a range of 10% to 10.5% and we expect our royalty rate to remain at less than 1% of sales for 2020.","This implies a full year 2020 adjusted operating margin of approximately 26.7%, which represents 60 basis points of improvement over 2019, consistent with our previously outlined goal of 50 basis points to 100 basis points of annual improvement. We continue to make progress towards our long-term goal of 30% adjusted operating margin.","We forecast our full year 2020 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 10%, consistent with our disclosure in January. This assumes an operational tax rate of approximately 11% with an approximately 100 basis points of benefit from the accounting standard for stock compensation. We expect adjusted below the line expenses which include interest payments, dilution from our VC portfolio and costs associated with our hedging program to be approximately $400 million to $425 million for the year.","And we expect fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.417 billion shares for Q1 2020 and 1.421 billion shares for full year 2020. As a result, we expect full year 2020 adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.74 to $1.79, representing 10% to 13% adjusted earnings growth and we expect FX to be neutral for the year if rates hold constant. On a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share to be in a range of $0.95 to $1.","Now turning to Q1 2020, we anticipate reported revenue growth to be in a range of approximately 10% to 12%, which represents 11% to 13% operational growth and an approximately 600-basis-point contribution from the Vertaflex and BTG acquisitions, net the divestiture of the beads portfolio.","On an organic basis, we believe our business without the impact of the Coronavirus would be in a range of 6% to 7.5% growth year-over-year. However, while we're still in the very early stages of assessing the impact and highly focused on supporting our patients and employees in China, we believe it is prudent to include a potential impact to our Q1 revenue related to the Coronavirus.","Our best estimate at this time is a preliminary $10 million to $40 million potential negative impact to revenue as a result of deferred procedures, supply chain and other disruptions. Although, it is early, the Chinese healthcare system is highly focused on containing the spread of the virus, and thus, we expect to see a reduction in volume for all non-emergency medical device procedures as it will not be business as usual in China, in February and March.","This $10 million to $40 million potential negative impact results in Q1 2020 organic growth guidance of 5% to 7%. Full year organic growth of 6.5% to 8.5% contemplates our ability to recapture some of the lost procedure volume in China during the year, as well as other offsets throughout the remainder of the year. Note that given the leap year, Q1 includes an extra selling day over prior year, but this equates to roughly one-half of a day sequentially based on the weighted average of selling days globally. We expect the foreign exchange impact on Q1 revenue to be an approximate $25 million to $30 million headwind.","For the first quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.37 per share to $0.40 per share, representing 6% to 15% growth and GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.16 per share to $0.19 per share. Please check our Investor Relations website for Q4 2019 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q4 and full year results, as well as Q1 and full year 2020 guidance including P&L line item guidance.","So with that, I'll turn it back to Susan, who will moderate the Q&A.","Susan Lisa","Thanks, Dan. Greg, let's open it up to questions for the next 25 minutes or so. In order to enable us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. Greg, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Mahoney","Robbie, can you hear us?","Robert Marcus","I can hear you. Can you hear me?","Michael Mahoney","We hear you now.","Daniel Brennan","We can hear you.","Robert Marcus","Great. Maybe you could just start with the top-line guidance for 2020. The range is a little wider than we've seen from you historically. You have a lot of new product launches into new markets in 2020. Maybe just walk through the rationale for the wider guidance range and any important cadence issues to pay attention to?","Michael Mahoney","Sure, yes. So, the full year guidance organic. You heard in the script there 6.5 to 8.5. We think 200 basis points wide range isn't crazy for a company our size. So we think that makes sense. Similar to '19, in '19 we saw 6.3% organic in the first half, 8.3% organic the second half. And so we expect a similar trend in 2020. As I mentioned, you'll see second half acceleration as mentioned due to the product cadence and we can talk about the various products, if you'd like, as well as the M&A train organic. And also we expect hopefully, we aim for a resolution of the potential impact in China as we enter the second quarter.","So we'll see second half acceleration and we expect many of our businesses to grow double-digit. We expect UroPH and Endo, as well as EP all to accelerate in 2020. We expect PI to put up a first quarter similar to fourth quarter. We expect nice acceleration due to important product launches in PI, as well as the integration going on plan. And we've also given the Structural Heart guidance $900 million to $1 billion, which is a significant increase over 2019. So we're very confident in the product launches that we have across all the divisions. And the execution, our aim will be to accelerate organic revenue growth in '20 faster than we did in '19.","Robert Marcus","Great. And maybe just the follow-up on CRM at the JP Morgan Conference when you pre-announced, you thought that some of the softness in fourth quarter was due to replacements and high power. Have you been able to dig into that any further and come up with why maybe replacements were softer in December versus expectations?","Michael Mahoney","Yes. So we don't have all the market data yet. It's still too early to receive kind of unit volume across the industry. Similar to what I mentioned before, we think primarily the impact in Q4 was due to our comps. We had mid-single-digit positive comps. Our competitors had negative comps and so we don't see a -- we don't believe that we lost market share in defib in fourth quarter. We think we faced a tougher comp than our competitors did. And also we don't have the ICM loop recorder yet and some competitors include that in their sales. So in a pure like-for-like basis, we think we held share and we do think the market is a bit softer though. We think the market in 2020, we project global CRM to be flat to declining low single-digit. And we expect -- we obviously aim to continue to grow faster than the market, like, we have for many years in defib, but we think the market growth is probably zero to negative 2% for the full year.","Robert Marcus","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Robert Hopkins","Thank you and good morning. So first question just wanted to ask about the guidance you're providing for the first quarter that 5% to 7% and if you use the midpoint of your assumptions on Coronavirus maybe 6% to 8% excluding that. My question is that, even excluding the slower China growth in Q1, it does feel like a deceleration from what you've been experiencing over the last couple of quarters, given the selling day and an easier comp in the first quarter. So what do you assume slows in Q1 relative to the last couple of quarters or is this just you guys being conservative?","Michael Mahoney","Sure. Good morning, Bob. So, again, we're very comfortable in the quarterly guidance we provided as well as the full year and we aim to accelerate in '20 over '19 organic growth, which I think is the most important piece here. We look at first quarter there is an extra what Dan calls a half day, when we look at all the global selling days and so forth. So there's a slight benefit there. But as mentioned in the script in a few areas, we do expect to see in first quarter Endo decelerate a little bit from first -- from fourth quarter, as well as PI being soft again in first quarter similar to fourth quarter. So those kind of are in line. And we also see some challenges in drug eluting stents with Japan price cuts, as well as the overall pricing environment in drug-eluting stents. So we anticipate that in the first quarter and we talked about the CRM market kind of zero to negative 2% range. But importantly, we have some nice mixed launches in DBS to support the full year and we expect to see continued complex coronary growth do well.","And then all the other businesses across the company should do extremely well with Structural Heart [ph]. But in first quarter the combination of some of those pricing pressures we're seeing in DBS combined with the Coronavirus issue that Dan outlined and really moving through that BTG integration that was the guidance of the 6 to 7.5 pre-Coronavirus and we estimate the impact, as I mentioned, 10 to 40 from China which brings our first quarter guidance down to 5 to 7.","Robert Hopkins","Okay. And then maybe as just a sort of an obvious follow-up on that. What do you assume in Endo slows a little bit in Q1? And then also I'd love to see hear your comments on Exalt-D in terms of what you're expecting for the year out of that product? Thank you.","Michael Mahoney","Yes. So Endo is one of our more predictable businesses, I would say, in the company. Very good execution against our plans. And it's not uncommon for them to have a slightly softer first quarter. So slightly soft is going to be above the BSC average and likely above market. So their definition of soft there is probably not fair. But as we see -- as we look at the full year, they have a nice set of product launches with new hemostasis clip, improvements to digital SpyGlass and the big one the Exalt-D. And we've had our first few cases take place over the past week and they want -- they're very, very encouraging. And so you're going to see a kind of more of a controlled launch in the first quarter to make sure things are going well.","A lot of the contracting in terms of the capital placements are being organized now and we're very confident in acceleration really each month in Exalt with a much bigger impact in second quarter and a significant impact in the second half of the year, and then the surgical scope coming. So I think we're really on track with Exalt-D launch and couldn't be more excited about the early results.","Robert Hopkins","Great. Thank you.","Daniel Brennan","And then just to give you a little bit of the math on the ranges. So the 6% to 7.5% is the range without Coronavirus for Q1 in terms of organic revenue growth. Just to let you know how we got to the 5 to 7. So the low end of 5 is basically the midpoint of 6.75 and we took the high end of the risk of 10 to 40 for the Coronavirus and took that off to get to the 5. And then, saying, similarly for the high end of 7 it's the 7.5 high end less the low end of the Coronavirus of 10 million, which brings you to the 7%. So just to give you a little bit of that math as to how it came to 5 to 7 from the 6 to 7.5.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Lewis","Good morning. Just two questions for me. Dan I want to come back to Coronavirus just to sort of set expectations. So by our quick math, China is kind of 5% of the company. Maybe it was a point of growth to 2019. I appreciate the focus in the first quarter. But picking those numbers, it seems like you're implying for first quarter that China business is either a 10% grower kind of half what you grew last year 20% or maybe slightly declined. Is that kind of roughly accurate? And what's actually in the annual guidance for impact from China given it drove a point of growth from last year? Then I had a quick follow-up.","Michael Mahoney","Sure. I mean, as we talked about at our Investor Day, China was about a $500 million business growing 20%. That would imply about a $600 million business in 2020. So rough math $50 million a month. The 10 and the 40 are simply the impacts our China team that's obviously very close to the issues in China on the ground. That's how they size it today and so that's why we included that in the Q1 guide. For the full year, as you saw, the 6.5 to 8.5, we assume that we can get some of those procedural volumes back and that other parts of the company could kick in and keep that 6.5% to 8.5% organic revenue growth range intact. But it's just the ability to react within Q1 with the acute nature of what we see as the potential in China that's why we raised it.","David Lewis","Okay. And then you are seeing that impact. You have seen that impact here in the early part of January into February?","Michael Mahoney","As you look at China, I mean, everybody sees it on the news and such. There just -- the number of procedures for medical device procedures in Q1 is not going to be what was expected 90 days or 180 days ago. So, certainly, we are planning to see an impact in that business in Q1.","David Lewis","Okay. And then just for the guidance for the year, just two things maybe for Dan or for Mike. One, obviously, you talked about second half acceleration. Maybe just help us understand the key drivers of that second half acceleration from a product perspective? And kind of related to that, your two big products from a revenue perspective absolute dollar contribution are Augmenix and LOTUS maybe just sort of talk to your confidence in those two products and what drives that back half acceleration? Thanks so much.","Michael Mahoney","Sure. We have a number of things we could talk about. But just to hit on the biggest -- the bigger ones. The biggest growth driver contributor is going to be Structural Heart that $900 million to $1 billion. And the big impacts there are excited about led by WATCHMAN, with the new WATCHMAN FLX launch will happen in the US in the second half of the year and that's doing extremely well in Europe and we have a number of big clinical trials. So we expect very strong growth on a WATCHMAN.","LOTUS is doing very well in the market. It's kind of on plan for 150 accounts. So you'll see a full year impact of LOTUS and we expect to see each quarter greater impact there. Our Symetis valve, ACURATE is doing well. It grew above the company average and grew about mid-teens in the fourth quarter and we expect to see neo2 launching in the second half. So the whole basket of Structural Heart will be big. EXALT will be a meaningful new incremental revenue driver with stronger second half impact. And then in PI, I would say, we're confident in quarterly improvements as we settled in on the BTG integration and you have new products being launched from legacy BTG, as well as potentially Ranger in the second half of 2020, which will put our position there. And EP, I mentioned, POLARx, you'll see a nice impact from that particularly in the second half of the year as we ramp that up.","And Neuro continues to do well with, as you mentioned, Augmenix which did over $100 million and is growing very, very well, as well as NxThera, which also is doing well and we'll expect five-year data shortly, and new reimbursement approvals from Cigna and Blue Cross. So this is really across the portfolio. There's a number of exciting things. That's why to reinforce Dan's comment, despite some of the near-term issues in China we're very comfortable with 6.5% to 8.5% full year range.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Wise from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Frederick Wise","Hi. Good morning, Mike. If we could focus -- if I can focus on Exalt-D. Obviously, you're excited, we've had a bunch of in-depth doctor conversations lately. Happily, all of them want to try it and we're interested, some very interested. But they highlighted usability and sort of comparability to their current reusable technology. And they were all seemed uncertain about pricing and cost. Can you talk to us about your confidence that Exalt-D equals current reusable technology? Talk to us about pricing and how you're going to go at making the economic case to the docs and the hospitals? And maybe last just talk about the manufacturing ramp and how that ties into the acceleration as you move toward full launch? Thanks so much.","Michael Mahoney","Thanks, Rick. So the teams have -- as you know this has been a multi-year program built off of the capabilities we've learned with LithoVue in digital SpyGlass. Those capabilities leveraged for Exalt-D and you hit the key criteria. The number one criteria, if this is to be a blockbuster product, which we think it will be -- it will -- to be -- have comparable, usability and functionality as existing scopes that require the sterilization expense of processes. And so that is the spec that the team has been focused on over the past three years or four years. And so the good news is, we've had done a number of procedures. We've had a number of key positions around the globe involved with the product for multiple years and we're quite confident in the design elements and the visualization capabilities of the product.","Also, I think what's important with this with the FDA-approved device and the capabilities of the team, we'll be able to make improvements to the platform within each year. And so just like we've done with digital and with LithoVue, expect to see probably a once-a-year enhancements upgrade, if you will, to the platform. And so it's not as if this is a stagnant product and which sometimes you get with the reusables for many years. This is a product that we'll be able to enhance at least once per year throughout the next year period whether it be smaller handles, left-handed, right-handed, different user features that the competition doesn't have. So I think that cadence will allow us to please physicians and the spec is to make it as good.","On the manufacturing side, we have a lot of experience with this. We've been investing ahead of it. That's one reason why you saw the increase in our capital investment in '19 and '20 as to manage the volume that we expect. So we're comfortable with the ramp that we have laid out with acceleration in the second quarter and beyond.","On the economics of it, it's a complicated topic. We do believe there's ample room in the existing reimbursement within patient at roughly $4,000 to $12 -- to $11,500 and outpatient $3000 to call it $5000. And we're also, as you know, we did receive FDA kind of the breakthrough status, which potentially could help with additional potential reimbursement tailwinds. In terms of the pricing itself, we have lots of flexibility within our Endo business to price it on its own and potentially look at contracting capabilities leveraging our portfolio across the business there.","Frederick Wise","Thanks so much for all that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Vijay Kumar","Thanks for taking my question. So Mike maybe one follow-up on the guidance and then I had one for Dan. On the guidance the comments around the cadence first half versus second half. If I recollect last year you had the days impact in second half. I mean, I appreciate all the comments on Structural Heart but shouldn't Structural Heart cadence to be similar to last year? So the real incremental for our new products, which should step up in second half. Is that the right way to think about that [ph]? And just on the range itself 6.5% to 8.5%, are you comfortable at the midpoint of the range or -- and I appreciate the wider range just given Q4 and market factors, but just want to get a sense whether you're comfortable at the midpoint?","Daniel Brennan","Sure. This is Dan, Vijay. So on the Structural Heart piece, I think, that's fair that as you look at the LOTUS launch that's obviously a very controlled rollout that we've had and that should gain momentum over time as should Sentinel. Mike mentioned that neo2 comes out in the second half. So I think that's fair relative to Structural Heart. We obviously wouldn't give a specific number within the guidance range of 6.5% to 8.5% organic for the full year. But then you heard in Mike's commentary that our goal is to accelerate in 2020 off 2019.","Vijay Kumar","That's helpful Dan. And then one on the margins here, Dan, I think, I heard you mention in a China tender, Japan biannual price cuts. What specifically is the impact from those factors on gross margin? And on the operating line, does it have any impact on the mix just given BTG is coming in because it looks like you're implying 50 basis points margin expansion? Thank you.","Daniel Brennan","Yes. Actually on that prior question from my WATCHMAN team friends here. I want to make sure I include WATCHMAN FLX in the US as well, because that's a huge launch for the WATCHMAN team, who has done a fantastic job since inception. On the price impact, as I look at it, the summary would be, we just have a little bit more price across the enterprise this year in a couple of those areas, as we mentioned, the biannual Japan price cut and the China that will not allow the normal manufacturing cost improvements to poke their head above that and have gross margin go north.","The normal equation is you have your manufacturing cost improvements then you have pricing and mix, and the net of those three normally has gross margin increasing. This year the pricing is a little bit higher with China and Japan, and potentially some acceleration on the DES front there, as Mike mentioned. So that really just all netted out where margin -- gross margin should be in that approximately 72% range we set. That's not a surprise to us. It's what we've been saying all along for the last two years is that gross margin, which has paid a lot of the builds over the last five years or six years would slow in terms of its ability to contribute to operating margin improvement, and then SG&A and R&D would pick up that slack. You saw that in 2019 and you should see the same thing in 2020.","Vijay Kumar","Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Lawrence Biegelsen","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions guys. One on complex PCI, one on Neuromodulation. So your complex PCI business continues to do really well. But that's a business that we don't have a lot of visibility on. So my question for you Mike or Dan is, how are you feeling about the sustainability of growth in that business in 2020 and what are the drivers? And I had one follow-up.","Michael Mahoney","Sure. That business as we've mentioned is larger than DES and continues to do very well around the globe and it's really maybe our most important business in Asia-Pac. So that strategically is a very big business for us. It requires more clinical orientation, which is also helpful and more in our sweet spot and also it is under less pricing pressure, I would say, compared to drug-eluting stents. So the innovation there is really important. And you see a big focus on our Ivis and rural later platform, as well as WOLVERINE and maybe Ian can touch on some other key products. But it's really a key cadence of new products that we have, as well as a big focus on complex PCI training that we have around the globe and how our portfolio matches that.","Ian Meredith","I think you've said most of it Mark. I think the thing I'd say, Larry, it's most important is the population is aging. And so the burden of disease is appearing later. And so we're seeing more patients with more complex due to the later age with more comorbidities, less suitable for surgery. So just the sheer demographic change is actually driving the burden of complex coronary disease in late age. So it requires more complex interventions.","Lawrence Biegelsen","That's helpful. And just on Neuromodulation, Mike and Dan, you gave a lot of helpful color on the different businesses for 2020. But I wasn't sure if I heard your expectations for Neuromodulation for 2020 relative to 2019. So how do you see that business in 2020 relative to 2019 on an organic basis? Thanks for taking the questions guys.","Michael Mahoney","Sure. Yes. We're hopeful that -- we aim for that business, I would say, to accelerate versus '19. If you look at '19 our SCS business was slow, the market was slow and we had extremely difficult comps the prior year. And so we would expect our global SCS business to improve over '19 and 2020. And also you heard at NANS, as well as detail out in some of the script, some of the clinical benefits we have with that portfolio. So, I think truly on a comp basis and expectations for the market to improve somewhat, we would expect that to improve. And in DBS we just have a lot of really good momentum there. Excellent share taking is taking place in Europe and in the US and you'll see some additional clinical studies being presented with that platform and we touched on some of the product differentiation there. So, and then you have Vertiflex, which will go organic in the second half of the year. So we think broadly speaking Neuromodulator will grow faster in '20 than '19.","Lawrence Biegelsen","Thanks for taking the questions guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Josh Jennings","Hi, good morning. Thanks. And just two questions, first on China, I understand you provided nice details around the 1Q potential headwind. But can you help us get a little bit more granular? And any help just in terms of your exposure in China by business unit? I mean, its Cardiovascular Interventional Cardiology most exposed or is it more broad-based? And then on the second question just WATCHMAN FLX. Many comments today just on it being a driver. Can you help us understand the boost that you'll get from WATCHMAN FLX launch? Is that premium pricing are there accounts out there that are waiting for WATCHMAN FLX to get over the hump to start a WATCHMAN program or is it just deeper penetration to current accounts as WATCHMAN FLX will open up kind of more procedures in different risk categories of patients? Thanks for taking the questions.","Daniel Brennan","Sure, Josh. I can start on the first one, and I think, Mike, can take the second one. The good news is we do have, as you mentioned, a very well-diversified portfolio in our China business. It's not reliant on one particular business within the mix. But as our team reflects on all of what's going on there. It's pretty clear that a vast majority of the healthcare resources in China are focused on diagnosing, treating and preventing the spread of the Coronavirus and that all of the procedures are at risk of being delayed. So as we look at it, we don't say its particular division or another and that 10 to 40 contemplates the whole market basket of Boston Scientific business and the impact that we could see here in the first quarter.","Michael Mahoney","Yes. And on WATCHMAN FLX, Ian or Dr. Stein can comment on it as well. But I think in terms of what we've seen in Europe, it's been more of a share taking capability that we have in Europe. And in the US, we haven't seen centers not opening, because we don't have WATCHMAN FLX. So we don't think it's going to drive the sort of new center openings that we wouldn't already receive with current WATCHMAN. I think it's -- and they can speak to the safety profile and the confidence that physicians have with FLX, which will give them more confidence to continue to increase our utilization rates, which are -- so our key metric for WATCHMAN broadly is utilization rates. We'll continue to open more centers in the US. We're expanding in Japan. We're expanding in other countries. But in the US it's all about turning on and continue to ramp up utilization, which we're seeing or we believe WATCHMAN FLX will further enhance that.","Ian Meredith","I'd just add to that. I'd say the key drivers to utilization or our awareness and we're driving that through education strategies and direct to patient, direct to physician education strategies, which is highly effective. And then procedural enhancements actually increased utilization and WATCHMAN FLX is a substantial procedural enhancement in terms of being simpler to use, easier to recapture and physicians immediately recognize the some of the valuable procedural enhancements. And the third part of increasing utilization is building evidence. And I think the mere fact that we've let -- announced the CHAMPION trial a major doc [ph] versus WATCHMAN FLX trial helps to build the awareness and therefore the utilization. So I think things will be very positive.","Susan Lisa","Great. With that we'd like to conclude the call. Thanks for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in BSX.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Susie Lisa. Please go ahead.","Susan Lisa","Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us. With me on today's calls are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q4 2018 results which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading, Financials and Filings.","The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Mike will provide strategic and revenue highlights of Q4 \u201818. Dan will review the financials for the quarter and then Q1 2019 and full year 2019 guidance and then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Ian Meredith and Dr. Ken Stein.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, organic revenue growth is defined as year-over-year growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and sales from the acquisition of NxThera, Claret, Augmenix, and Symetis in the relevant period to which there are no prior period related net sales. Also of note, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share, new products approvals and launches, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance including sales, margins, earnings and other Q1 and full year 2019 guidance as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses.","Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the risk factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them.","At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike?","Michael Mahoney","Thank you, Susie. Good morning, everyone. Boston Scientific finished up an excellent 2018 where we delivered on our financial commitments and significantly strengthened our portfolio and capabilities for the future.","In fourth quarter \u201818 we delivered 8% operational revenue growth, 7% organic, roughly flat adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS of $0.39, which includes a $0.01 net tax settlement benefit in the quarter.","Our category leadership strategy continues to deliver strong results in the fourth quarter six of our seven businesses grew faster than the underlying markets. These Q4 results echo our performance in \u201818 overall and for the full year 8% percent operational revenue growth, 7% organic, a 50 basis point improvement or profitability, and adjusted EPS of a $1.47 or 11% adjusted EPS growth to a $1.40 when normalized for the $0.07 tax element benefit for the year. We delivered these results while also generating $2 billion of free cash flow.","2018 results also extend our track record of excellent performance over the five year 2014 to \u201818 period, where BSC has grown sales at the average rate of 8% operational and 7% organic, improvement adjusted operating margin 530 basis points and levers that to drive an average 14% growth in adjusted EPS over the five year period. And this excludes the net tax benefit in 2018.","We believe this five year results provide solid evidence that our strategy of category leadership in key markets and portfolio diversification into higher growth adjacencies continues to deliver differentiated results.","Our goal is to continue to execute against our strategic plan objectives and deliver top tier sales and EPS growth over the next five years. The combination of long-term consistent above market revenue growth, operating margin expansion, targeted double-digit EPS growth and now coupled with the improved ability to deploy our strong free cash flow is what we believe uniquely positions BSC to continue to drive shareholder value.","We're excited about our plans to build upon a global momentum in \u201819 and beyond. We're targeting 2019 operational revenue growth of 8% to 9.5% which includes approximately 110 basis points from acquisitions, resulting in organic revenue growth guidance of 7% to 8.5%. We\u2019re guiding to adjusted EPS of a $1.53 to $1.58 representing a 9% to 13% earnings growth and approximately $2.2 billion in adjusted free cash flow.","I'll now provide some highlights on Q4 \u201918 results, along with some thoughts on our \u201819 outlook. Our Q4 - in Q4 8% operational and 7% organic revenue growth continue to be broad-based across our businesses and regions, but most notably this quarter by 9% operational growth in Europe\/Mideast Africa, as well as 7% operational growth in both the U.S. and Asia Pac.","Latin America and overall emerging markets had outstanding quarters growing operational revenue 28% and 27% respectively. The MedSurg businesses now are 31% of our revenue mix and they continue to deliver. MedSurg grew 8.9% operationally and 6.2% organically in Q4 and for the full year sales were up 9.3% operational and 8.2% organic.","In Endo we posted 6.6% operational and organic in Q4, and our hemostasis franchise continues to grow double digits in infection prevention and pathology also continue to be very strong. Endo delivered 8.3% operational and organic in \u201918 and we expect continue to strengthen our global Endo business in 2019.","Endo has a very rich pipeline and we're launching four new products, including Orca pod single use valves, Orise gel for endoluminal surgery, and SpyGlass DS II with a broader portfolio of solutions for pancreatic biliary procedures. We also remain on schedule for a Q4 launch of our single use duodenoscope Exalt-D, which represents this exciting new phase of our strategy in the therapeutic imaging market.","Our uro and public health franchise also continues excellent performance growing Q4 12% operationally and 5.6% organic. LithoVue, our Single-Use Digital Ureteroscope helps drive double-digit growth in our core stone franchise. Full year \u201818 Uro\/PH organic sales grew 6.1%, the additional 250 basis points from M&A for operational growth of 10.6% and importantly the integration work for our tuck-in acquisitions in NxThera, Augmenix, nVision are all tracking as planned.","The Rezum system for the minimally invasive treatment for BPH, had a CPT code take effect January 1st of this year and we just recently published very compelling four year data and durability of symptom relief with a very low 4.4% rate of surgical re treatment and no new adverse events noted between years 3 and 4.","The October acquisition of Augmenix in a SpaceOAR hydrogel which is used to diminish the side effect risks from prostate cancer radiation is off to a strong start and we expanded - as we continue expand market presence and awareness.","Turning to global Rhythm and Neuro, operational and organic sales grew 6.6% in Q4 and 7.6% for the full year. Neuro modulation operational and organic revenue growth grew an impressive 18.9% in Q4 and 22.5% for the year and the continued strength of our portfolio and global commercial execution. We remain very positive on the outlook of the neuromod business in \u201819 due to the continued strength at underlying markets and our innovative portfolio.","In Spinal Cord stimulation WaveWriter is the only platform approved by the FDA to simultaneously provide paresthesia based and sub-perception therapy targeting two different mechanism - mechanisms of action at the same time for patients suffering chronic pain.","This is translated into excellent real work - real world results with 312 patients at the last follow up, 285 were pain free which is a zero pain score and 67% had minimal pain scores of 2 or less. We also look forward to WaveWriter randomized clinical trial data from the COMBO study in the second half of \u201919.","Also in DBS, we're excited that we recently received key FDA approvals for our Vercise platform in primary cell and Cartesia Directional Leads and Vercise has now offered in both primary cell and rechargeable systems.","CRM grew both operational and organic sales 1.7% in the quarter and 2.1% for the full year. Q4 growth reflects above market, mid single digit growth in defib, offset by high single digit declines and pacing. Our portfolio in defib continues to drive share gains due to the continued rollout of our RESONATE platform with a HeartLogic, heart failure alert, multipoint pacing and best-in-class longevity within EnduraLife battery technology.","Also Emblem S-ICD also continues to perform very well and grew double digits globally for the full year. And overall we see continuous strength in our defib results in \u201919, albeit against tougher comps and some improvement in pacing trends.","In EP we grew sales 8% in the fourth quarter and for the full year up 10.9% operational and organic and the strength of our Rhythmia HDx mapping platform. We continue to enhance our catheter pipeline globally and importantly our two single shot platforms, Cryterion and Apama are on track to launch in Europe by the end of this year, as well as begin enrollment in their IDEs for U.S. approval.","Our cardiovascular group in Q4 grew 8.6% operationally and 7.7% organically. For the full year \u201818 growth of a 7.4% on an operational basis and 6% organic. PI grew 11.2% in the quarter and 9.2% for the full year operational and organic.","The U.S. launch of Eluvia was a driver of the double-digit growth in the quarter. And we also grew double digits and Ranger DCB and interventional oncology. Regionally Asia Pac was a standout in the quarter with mid teens growth in the region.","2019 will really be exciting year for PI as we\u2019re launching multiple new products and also integrating both VENITI and BTG post closure. We continue to see strong physician interest in Eluvia due to its compelling IMPERIAL trial data that was presented at TCT.","Recall the IMPERIAL study demonstrated that patients treated with Eluvia stent experienced half the rate of target lesion revascularization at 12 months versus compared to the Zilver PTX stents and 88.5% patency R rate. Significantly there were no patient deaths in either arm of the study at 12 months. We believe this is a relevant - very relevant considering the recent questions generated by the Katsanos meta-analysis regarding the use of paclitaxel and peripheral balloons and stents.","We believe the FDAs recent letter stating that the benefits of paclitaxel coated devices outweigh the risks, as well as compelling patient level datasets from BSX and others at the LINC conference an ISIS Symposium will serve to reassure physicians and their patients regarding the safety and efficacy of our DCB and DES platforms.","We\u2019re also preparing for the upcoming U.S. launch of our VICI VENOUS STENT, which will be the first on label VENOUS STENT in the U.S. market, and remain on target to close the proposed BTG acquisition in the first half of \u201919. With BCG we look forward to enhanced category leadership positions in interventional oncology, arterial and venous therapies.","interventional cardiology continues to grow above market delivering 7.5% operational revenue growth and 6.15 organic in the quarter. For the full year IC revenue grew 6.6% operational and 4.5% organic. IC growth was led worldwide by continued strength in structural heart with WATCHMAN, ACURATE and SENTINEL and double-digit growth in both our complex PCI and PCI guidance portfolios. And this more than offset continue weakness in the drug eluting stent market.","2018 Structural Heart revenue exceeded our guidance of $475 million for the year, an outperformance across the franchises. We target continue strong WATCHMAN growth in \u201819 via increasing utilization with existing customers, as well as geographic expansion where Japan anticipates a Q3 launch and China represents a significant growth opportunity.","In the U.S., WATCHMAN recently received an increase in its primary DRG reimbursement starting last October and we're also pleased that WATCHMAN was just recently included in the new AFib guidelines update, recommending percutaneous LAAO therapy, as a Class 2B therapy for patients with AFiB. At increased risk of stroke, we have contraindications to long-term anticoagulation.","Turning to the WATCHMAN pipeline, we expect a limited market release of the next gen WATCHMAN FLX in Europe in the first half of this year. We also continue to invest in WATCHMAN clinical evidence to support and expand the market, including the recent FLX IDE, the ASAP-TOO study, and the new Option trial.","The Option trial would begin enrollment in the second half of this year and is a head to head study of WATCHMAN versus NOAC in patients following AFib ablation. Study endpoints target noninferiority and stroke rates and systemic embolism with additional superiority endpoint in long-term bleeding.","We're also really pleased with the ACURATE TAVR valve performance in \u201818 and look forward to launching in France with the recent reimbursement approval.","We're targeting launch of the next-generation ACURATE neo2 in Europe in the second half of 2019 and we expect to begin enrollment in our US IDE around midyear.","Our cerebral embolic protection device SENTINEL delivered as planned in Q4 on the back of continued market adoption of protected TAVR and aided by the recently granted New Tech Add-on Payment.","Turning into our LOTUS Edge TAVR platform, we\u2019ll begin a limited release in March in Europe and then the U.S. pending FDA approval. We anticipate initiating a controlled launch in early Q2. We recently began enrolling the LOTUS REPRISE IV study in intermediate risk patients and plan to complete enrollment this year.","Finally in Structural Heart we recently closed on the acquisition of Millipede, a company that's developing an innovative mitral repair platform to treat patients with severe mitral regurgitation. Now with our portfolio of WATCHMAN, ACURATE, LOTUS and SENTINEL and IRIS we're excited about our structural heart capabilities and long-term growth prospects. For 2019 we target structural heart revenue of $700 million to $725 million which represents approximately 50% growth.","So to wrap up, we truly have a very exciting future and believe that we are well-positioned to continue and strengthen our performance track record in 2019, \u201820 and beyond. And for that, I really like to thank our employees and their winning spirit and commitment to patients.","Finally, I'd like to announce that our 2019 Investor Day will be held on June 26th in New York. So please look for additional details to follow in the coming months.","Now, I'll turn things over to Dan for a detailed review of our financials.","Daniel Brennan","Thanks, Mike. Fourth quarter consolidated revenue of $2,561 billion represents 6% reported revenue growth and 8% growth on an operational basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Our reported revenue reflects a $43 million headwind from foreign exchange, slightly more than the $30 million to $40 million headwind expected at the time of guidance.","Sales from the NxThera, Claret and Augmenix acquisitions contributed approximately 120 basis points which was in line with our expectations at the time guidance, resulting in 7% organic revenue growth for the quarter at the high end of our organic guidance range of 6% to 7%.","Strong performance for the quarter was once again delivered across the majority of our businesses and regions. On this robust top line we delivered Q4 adjusted earnings per share of $0.39, which represents 14% year-over-year growth, but importantly includes a net tax benefit of $0.01 related to IRS settlement.","Excluding this $0.01 net benefit, our adjusted earnings per share for the quarter would have been $0.38. This $0.01 net benefit in the quarter which I will detail in a moment compares to an expected $0.06 charge related to our tax free investment strategy that was assumed in our Q4 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $0.30 to $0.32.","However, when normalizing for all tax settlement related benefits and expenses, our underlying adjusted Q4 earnings per share guidance would have been $0.36 to $0.38 for the quarter on which we delivered at the high end of the range, driven primarily by strong revenue growth. This result reflects neutral FX for the quarter.","The $0.01 [ph] Q4 net tax benefit is comprised of a $0.05 charge related to our previously communicated tax reinvestment strategy of the Q2 IRS settlement benefit and a $0.06 benefit in the fourth quarter from settling the IRS stipulation of settled issues for the 2011 through 2013 tax years that had not been assumed in our guidance ranges.","Our full year 2018 consolidated revenue of $9,823 billion grew 9% on a reported basis, 8% on an operational basis and 7% organically, which excludes 80 basis points of growth related to the acquisition of Symetis, NxThera, Claret and Augmenix. This growth was right in line with our full year guidance of approximately 7% and represents strong performance on a 7% comp year in 2017.","Full year 2018 adjusted earnings per share of $1.47 represents 17% growth, but importantly includes $0.07 of net tax benefit related to IRS settlement. This $0.07 benefit for the full year compares to our expectation that the tax settlement would be neutral to EPS for the year, so excluding this $0.07 net tax benefit, our underlying adjusted earnings per share would have been $1.40, which is at the high end of our guidance range of $1.38 to $1.40.","This $0.07 net tax benefit is comprised of first, the previously disclosed $0.06 benefit in Q2 from settling the IRS stipulation of settled issues for the 2001 through 2010 tax years. Second, the $0.05 charge in Q4 related to the reinvestment of this Q2 benefit. And lastly, the additional $0.06 benefit in Q4 related to the final resolution of the 2011 through 2013 tax years.","We're pleased to deliver a $1.40 at the high end of our EPS guidance range, while offsetting a $0.04 FX headwind and $0.02 to $0.03 of M&A dilution through operational savings and initiatives.","Turning to the detailed P&L metrics, adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter of 72.8%, an increase of 20 basis points over the prior year and slightly above the high end of our guidance of 72% to 72.5%, primarily due to the benefit from manufacturing cost improvements with pricing largely as expected.","Q4 adjusted gross margin includes a 70 basis point tailwind from foreign exchange basically in line with the 60 basis point expected at the time of guidance. For the full year 2018 adjusted gross margin was 72.3%, slightly exceeding the approximately 72% adjusted gross margin guidance for the year and representing 20 basis points of improvement over 2017.","We were able to offset 80 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange with manufacturing cost improvements and a mix benefit from strong performance particularly in our Watchman and Neuro modulation businesses.","Adjusted SG&A expenses were $915 million dollars or 35.7% of sales in Q4, flat compared to Q4 last year and slightly above our guidance range of 34.5% to 35.5%. We remain committed to and continue to realize the benefit of our targeted initiatives focus on reducing SG&A like end to end business process streamlining and automation, including the use of robotic process automation, functional expansion of global shared services and optimizing back office centers of excellence.","These initiatives, plus a strong focus on expense control and improving P&L leverage and Neuro modulation allowed us to decrease our full year 2000 adjusted SG&A rate of 35.4% by 20 basis points compared to adjusted SG&A of 35.6% for full year 2017, all while absorbing dilution from M&A and investing in and launching key products for durable long term revenue growth.","Adjusted research and development expenses were $278 million in the fourth quarter or 10.8% of sales, which is up slightly from Q4 \u201917, primarily due to clinical requirements for recent acquisitions and other key pipeline projects.","For the full year 2018, adjusted R&D expenses were $1,52 [ph] billion or 10.7% of sale compared to 10.8% of sale in 2017. Royalty expense was 0.7% of sales in Q4 and the full year 2018, roughly flat year-over-year for both periods. As a result, Q4 2018 adjusted operating margin of 25.5% was roughly flat year-over-year and it was within our guidance range of 25.25% to 26%.","We've also met our full year 2018 adjusted operating margin commitment with a rate of 25.5%, representing an increase of 50 basis points over the full year 2017. We believe this sets us up well to deliver on our additional commitments of 50 to 100 basis points of improvement in both 2019 and 2020, while still investing in acquisitions and key product launches for durable above market revenue growth.","Below the line, adjusted interest expense for the quarter was $62 million compared to $56 million in Q4 of last year and was $239 million for the full year 2018 compared to $229 million for 2017.","Our average interest expense rate of 3.5% in Q4 \u201818 and 3.6% for the full year compared to 3.8% in Q4 last year and for the full year 2017. The increase in interest expense dollars related to additional debt in 2018.","Adjusted other income for the quarter was $4 million compared to adjusted other expensive of $31 million a year ago, primarily due to a net gain uncertain of our available for sale investments in Q4 2018, compared to a net loss a year ago. And both periods also include expenses related to our foreign exchange hedging program.","For the full year 2018 adjusted other expense was $55 million resulting in total below the line expenses of $294 million, which is consistent with our 2017 total below the line expenses of $286 million.","Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was negative 30.5% on a reported basis and 7.3% on an adjusted basis. On an adjusted basis, the favourability in our tax rate was driven by the $0.01 net tax benefit I mentioned at the start of my remarks. This net benefit is comprised of first, the $0.05 charge related to our previously communicated tax reinvestment strategy of the Q2 tax benefit. And second, the $0.06 benefit in Q4 related to the 2011 through 2013 tax years that had not been assumed in our guidance range.","As previously disclosed, we intended to and did reinvest substantially all of the $0.06 Q2 benefits relating to settling the 2001 through 2010 tax years to reduce our operational tax rate in 2019 and beyond by optimizing our structure and leveraging differences in tax rates by jurisdictions. As announced earlier this year, we expect our long-term tax rate before the impact of any stock compensation accounting to be approximately 13% compared to our previously expected rate of 15%.","As I noted, in addition to the benefit received in Q2 and the subsequent reinvestment in Q4, we received a $0.06 benefit in Q4 related to settling the 2011 through 2013 tax year with the IRS. This settlement resulted in a $93 million payment to the IRS in the quarter and a corresponding reserve release that resulted in the $0.06 benefits.","This effectively concludes the IRS transfer pricing case and we do not anticipate any additional payments related to that matter. We encourage you to exclude both tax settlement benefits and related reinvestments when looking at adjusted EPS trends and thus model $0.38 earnings per share for Q4 and $1.40 for the full year","Our full year tax rate was negative 17.5% on a reported basis and 6.8% on an adjusted basis. For the full year, the adjusted tax rate includes a net $0.07 benefit as a result of the $0.06 benefit in Q2 related to the 2001 through 2010 tax years, the $0.05 charge in Q4 related to the reinvestment of that Q2 benefit and the additional $0.06 benefit in Q4 related to the 2011 through 2013 tax years.","Excluding these amounts, our tax rate was approximately 12%, which includes a roughly 100 basis point stock compensation benefit for the year. Throughout 2018, we successfully reduced the approved tax liability on our balance sheet from nearly $2 billion as of December 31 2017 to just under $700 million as of December 31 2018 of the remaining $700 million liability, a little over $400 million relates to the transition tax reserves resulting from US corporate tax reform which is payable over the next seven years. Excluding this reserve, a little more than $300 million remains relating to all tax controversies global.","Finally, Q4 2018 adjusted earnings per share of $0.39 includes the aforementioned net $0.01 tax benefit or a normalized result of $0.38. On a reported GAAP basis which includes net charges and amortization expenses totaling $166 million after tax Q4 earnings per share was $0.27.","For the full year 2018, adjusted earnings per share of $1.47 for $1.40 after normalizing for the $0.07 net tax benefit reflects the high end of our guidance range of $1.38 to $1.40 and a 11% percent growth over the prior year. Notably this 11% growth was achieved while operationally offsetting $0.04 of unfavorable FX and absorbing $0.02 two $0.03 of M&A delusion.","On a reported GAAP basis 2018 EPS was $1.19 compared to full year 2017 GAAP income per share of $0.08 [ph] We ended Q4, 2018 with $1,406 billion and full year 2018 with $1,401 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. On a GAAP basis, we recorded a net litigation related charge of $85 million in the fourth quarter related primarily to our mesh litigation.","To date, we settled or are in the final stages of settlement with approximately 95% of all our known claims. We believe that the incremental legal reserve recorded in the quarter will allow us to finalize the remaining cases and claims and we continue to target resolution of the mesh litigation during 2019. Our total legal reserve, of which mesh included was $929 million as of December 31, 2018.","In the quarter, we made cash payments of $180 million into the qualified settlement fund for a total of over $600 million for the full year, which is shown as restricted cash on our balance sheet. Our current balance of restricted cash, which is primarily related to the qualified settlement fund is $655 million. As a result for 2019 we have only approximately $250 million left to fund during 2019 and the remaining balance sheet liability will be released as funds are released out of the qualified settlement fund to plaintiffs, which will complete the process.","Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $591 million compared to $685 million in Q4, 2017. In the quarter we used cash primarily to fund previously agreed upon legal settlements, as well as business development activities, namely the Augmenix acquisition.","As of December 31st, 2018 we had cash on hand of $146 million. Our full year 2018 adjusted free cash flow of $2.2 [ph] billion, represents 16% year-over-year growth. A very nice leveraging of our 8% operational revenue growth and a 11% adjusted earnings per share growth, excluding the current year net tax benefit.","Our 2018 adjusted free cash flow exceeded our full year guidance of $1.9 billion by approximately $100 million due to a focus on working capital metrics and the timing of certain capital expenditures. We now believe that our 2019 full year adjusted free cash flow will be approximately $2.2 billion, representing 10% growth over 2018 and slightly ahead of our revised goal given earlier this year.","With the proposed BTG acquisition which has not closed, we continue to believe that we have ample capacity to pay down acquisition related debt and continue to pursue business development activities. We'll look to pay down over $1 billion in debt in the 18 months post close of the BTG acquisition, which we believe will put our leverage metrics at approximately 2.6 times EBITDA by the end of 2020, consistent with the2.6 times at the end of 2018. And even with the debt pay down because of our strong cash flow generation profile, we believe that gives us capability of about $1 billion or more in terms of M&A to continue to evolve our category of leadership strategy and do other tuck-in acquisitions, such as the recently closed Millipede acquisition.","As it relates to the BTG purchase price, as you would expect with an exposure to British \u00a3, we put in a hedging strategy in place, largely in line with our deal model. As a reminder, we've suspended the share repurchase program for 2019, as a result of the pending BTG acquisition.","Capital expenditures for the full year 2018 totalled $316 million, slightly below our $350 million target. We expect capital expenditures to be in a range of $375 million to $400 million for 2019, as we continue to build capacity, integrate acquisitions and drive continued growth.","I'll now walk through guidance for Q1 and full year 2019. As a reminder, the guidance I am providing does not include the proposed BTG acquisition, which has not yet closed. Upon closing, we'll provide revised guidance.","For the full year, we expect 2019 reported revenue to be in a range of approximately 7% to 9%, which corresponds to year-over-year growth of 7% to 8.5% on an organic basis and we expect an additional 110 basis points contribution from the NxThera, Claret and Augmenix acquisitions.","To be clear, this is the only inorganic contribution of each acquisition and once the acquisition reaches one year post close it is then included in organic. As a result, we expect and have included in our organic guidance range an additional 40 basis points of growth from NxThera post its April anniversary, Claret, post the July anniversary and Augmenix post the October anniversary. This 110 basis points, plus the 40 basis points is equal to 150 basis points of acquisition related revenue which we had been expecting for 2019.","We expect foreign exchange to be a headwind of approximately $80 million to $90 million for the full year 2019. However, as I'll detail next to our hedging program, we expect FX to be neutral to earnings per share for the year.","We expect adjusted gross margin for the year as a percentage of sales to be approximately 72% to 73% for the full year, which assumes a positive FX impact of 40 basis points.","We expect full year adjusted SG&A to be in a range of 34.5% to 35% of sale as we continue to see benefits of the programs currently underway. Full year adjusted R&D is expected to be in a range of 10.5% to 11% and we expect our royalty rate to remain at slightly less than 1% of sales for 2019.","This implies a full year 2019 adjusted operating margin in a range of 26% to 26.5% which is consistent with the improvement goal of 50 to 100 basis points we outlined last September and sets us up well to deliver on our long-term goal of 30% plus adjusted operating margin.","We forecast our full year 2019 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 12% [ph] This assumes an operational tax rate of approximately 13% consistent with our disclosure earlier this year, plus an approximately - approximate 100 basis points of benefit from the accounting standard for stock compensation.","We expect adjusted below the line expenses, which include interest payments, dilution from our VC portfolio and costs associated with our hedging program to be approximately $300 to $325 million for the year. This represents an increase from 2018 adjusted below the line expenses of $294 million as a result of slightly higher debt balance.","We expect fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1,409 billion shares for Q1 2019 and $1,410 billion shares for the full year 2019 [ph]. As a result, we expect full year 2019 adjusted EPS to be in a range of $1.53 to $1.58 representing 9% to 13% adjusted earnings growth using 140 as the base, and we expect the FX to be neutral for the year if rates were to hold constant.","On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of 113 to 118. Included in our GAAP EPS guidance is our estimate for the Edwards litigation settlement announced in January, though it is subject to change as we finalize the accounting in the court.","Now turning to Q1, 2019, we expect reported revenue growth to be in a range of approximately 6% to 7%. This represents year-over-year organic growth in a range of 7% to 8%, plus an additional 160 basis point contribution from NxThera, Claret and Augmenix. We expect the foreign exchange impact on Q1 revenue to be an approximate $60 million to $65 million headwind.","For the first quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.35 to $0.36 per share, representing 8% to 11% growth and GAAP EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.32 to $0.33 per share.","Similar to the full year GAAP EPS guidance included in our Q1 GAAP EPS guidance is our estimate for the Edwards litigation settlement subject to change as we finalize our accounts.","Please check our Investor Relations website for Q4 2018 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q4 and full year 2018 results, as well as Q1 and full year 2019 guidance including P&L line item guidance.","So with that, I'll turn it back to the Susie who will moderate the Q&A.","Susan Lisa","Thanks, Dan. Greg, lets open to questions for next 20 minutes or so. Please limit yourself to one question, given the short timing this quarter. Greg, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Lewis","Good morning. Congrats on the quarter and very constructive guidance to start the year. I guess, I'll limit myself to one question and you'll never get to hear my second. But Mike, I'll start with you on strategic activity. So the M&A pace in \u201919 or sorry in \u201918 was probably the biggest debate on Boston, so as I think about \u201819 and beyond, why should investors not be concerned about the ability to integrate multiple transactions this year, some large some small. And how should we think about the pace of further M&A here in 2019? Thank you.","Michael Mahoney","Sure. Good morning, David. One, I think - I think we've demonstrated very good track record of our ability to integrate acquisitions for Bayer to AMS to Cameron S-ICD and so forth, and you could also throw ACURATE in there. So we deliver on the - our deal models and our team executes them very well. So that\u2019s historically.","Now going forward, we're on track. So this year we have three or four deals that will drive contribution this year with Augmenix, Claret and NxThera. And I'm pleased to say that all those are going as planned. The operations team is doing a great job of ramping up supply. We're driving the appropriate synergies.","And then we have a couple that are a little bit farther out in the pipeline that are doing great clinical work this year, again they're on track Cryo and Apama. And we anticipate Q4 approvals for both those platforms as the clinicals readout. And we have two that are earlier stage nVision and Millipede, which are really early stage still in the R&D phase.","So I think a couple of things. One is they're sequenced in terms of, call it, their maturity. They're distributed across our businesses. And we have the infrastructure in place in our operations supply chain, IT, quality to manage these very effectively.","So you know, I have more confidence now than I did three months ago, given the progress that we continue to make and also we are excited about the potential for BTG closing sometime in second quarter and a lot of efforts I'm planning for that have taken place.","So I have zero concerns about our ability to integrate these deals, while continuing to fuel the growth in our core business. We will see the pace of M&A slow for us in \u201919, as we stated before we do have capacity to do some tuck-in acquisitions. But you won't see the volume of activity in \u201819 that we had an \u201818.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Glenn Novarro","Thanks for taking my question. Good morning, guys. Sounds like the LOTUS launches is right around the corner with Europe next month and U.S. a few months out. So I'm hoping you can talk a little bit about how you're going be positioning LOTUS given you just have a high risk label, your launch of intermediate risk is probably still a few years away and of course, you've got Edwards and Medtronic launching a low risk in the second half of this year. So maybe talk to us about how you market LOTUS to cardiologists, including pricing strategy and willingness to bundle with Claret? Thanks.","Michael Mahoney","Good morning, Glenn. It's Mike here. First of all, we're excited. This has been a journey for us with LOTUS. But the product characteristics are very unique and we're excited about the long-term growth prospects of this platform.","So in Europe, we've got a terrific momentum currently with ACURATE. We're also implanting SENTINEL and there's many physicians in Europe who have been waiting for LOTUS for quite a while. Who in part of various clinical trials and registry programs and are excited to implant LOTUS.","So we've got a winning formula w believe in Europe with both ACURATE and LOTUS and we'll be able to segment those products appropriately and physicians are waiting for LOTUS in Europe.","In the US, we obviously don't have ACURATE, so our 100% focus in the U.S. will be with our protected TAVR with both Claret and also LOTUS and similar to previous comments, we think the differentiated features, the reposition ability of it, the best PVL in the marketplace and also just the clinical experience of those who are involved in clinical trials.","So we believe there will be adequate demand for LOTUS in the marketplace and we want to obviously focus as we begin to launch this product in the second quarter on delivering excellent outcomes and strong experiences, this will be a key platform for us for many years.","So we think the markets there and as you look forward with Boston having Claret and the ACURATE platform where we have a number of new enhancements coming and ongoing enhancements to our LOTUS platform in the pipeline, we are uniquely positioned in this marketplace where we're just now entering the U.S.","We're also in the midst of enrolling our intermediate study today, actually started a couple months ago and we'll finish enrollment without LOTUS by the end of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bob Hopkins","Thanks and good morning. So if okay, I just actually want to follow up on LOTUS Edge, given your comments, you're obviously offering some more specific timelines here. So I guess I'm curious what drives the sort of increased specificity on the timelines for approval both and OUS?","And then you mentioned a couple of times sort of a limited launch. And is there something that will hold you back a little bit when you - from a capacity perspective on LOTUS Edge once you get approval. Just curious why it isn't a - you know a full blown launch immediately upon approval? Thank you.","Michael Mahoney","Sure. Morning, Bob. Yeah. So we do have more insight. We think the approval will likely happen potentially early in the second quarter versus midyear. So that's good. And that's very good. And our team deserves it. And that's reflected in the full structural heart guidance we gave and to 700 and 725. And simply speaking with our - with the Lotus valve we want to ensure that we deliver this exceedingly well to get off the - out of the gate strong, to build up a strong reputation for the product in the U.S.","And so like we've commented in the past, this is very unlike, it's not like a DES launch. It's similar to what we did with WATCHMAN, similar that we've done ACURATE in Europe where a key training and proctoring will be part of it. And so we\u2019re not going to launch in - you know hundreds of centers out of the gate, like we would with the DES launch.","So it'll be smartly planned, delivering excellent outcomes, building greater confidence with the physician community, leveraging Claret with protected TAVR the only company that can do that and building momentum. And so you'll see us much like the WATCHMAN launch continue to open centers over time, deliver great outcomes and similar to WATCHMAN we've increased utilization rates each quarter by doing so.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Larry Biegelsen","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So Mike you grew about 7.2% organically in 2018 and you're 2019 guidance implies about 7 - 7.8% let's call it the midpoint which is quite bullish. So what's giving you the confidence to guide to an acceleration this early in the year. And any color on which businesses get better, which businesses might slow a little bit in 2019 versus 2018? Thanks for taking the question.","Michael Mahoney","Sure. So we just have a lot of confidence in our team's ability to deliver. I think we demonstrated that over the past five years, I kind of highlighted that in our results. And I think the first thing is we have strong momentum really across the company, MedSurg last year, 8 rhythm and neuromod 8 [ph] it's all organic, cardio 6.","And so we have we have broad based strength across the divisions. We also have very distributed strength across each region. So we're not relying on one region, so we have very good momentum across each region. And we anticipate Japan will be a stronger performance force well in 2019. So I think having that momentum and that diversity of strength across businesses and regions is difficult to do and we have it and we want to continue to pour fuel there.","And then secondly the big thing we have this year is just a lot of momentum in the businesses. Our structural heart guide $700 million to $725 million will drive a lot of growth. Our neuromod business has a lot of momentum and now with the approval of DBS we like that, all though we have tough comps in spinal cord stim.","PI has an exciting future ahead, and in \u201919 with the new launches, as well as the pending BTG acquisition. Endo and uro have a lot of portfolio launches and then as well in EP we're excited about single shot capability coming and the ongoing strength of our defib platform.","So I think we just have a lot of momentum there. New product launches and as to David's question earlier, we're very confident we'll deliver on the integrations and that sets us up for a really exciting 2021 and \u201922, with those acquisitions and pipeline we're entering into about $20 billion of unserved markets, where today we have about a $1 billion in sales. So I think this M&A that we've done on top of it helps fuel the long-term growth that's differentiated for the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Chris Pasquale","Thanks. Mike, could you remind us what's your sales strategy will be for LOTUS in the U.S., are you going to have a separate group that is responsible for LOTUS and SENTINEL? And if so where are you in the process of building that out?","Michael Mahoney","Yeah. We\u2019re not going to dig into our commercial strategy in the U.S. We have as you know, a very broad portfolio and lots of capabilities to leverage where appropriate and also to provide unique clinical specificity where needed. You know, we have a large sales team on core DES, on complex PCI, as well as clinical people involved there.","We clearly have dedicated a strong focus on WATCHMAN with clinical. And you'll also have a lot of focus with dedicated people in TAVR and Claret. So they all come under the umbrella of intervention cardiology segments differently based on you know location, but there is a lot of commercial leverage there, synergies with the group, but also maintaining unique clinical focus where needed for those specific types of products.","So I would say in general we're there. We have the commercial team in place. We'll continue to add resources like as we have in structural heart with WATCHMAN and TAVI as we grow it, but the foundation of all that's already in place in the U.S. and in Europe.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Wise from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Rick Wise","Good morning, Mike. And yes, congrats on another fabulous quarter. Maybe a topic we haven't touched on a little bit, Rezum. You've highlighted all the products that are going to continue to drive growth into - really into the next decade. I'd be curious where does the Rezum stack up on the scale of you know the incredible number of growth enhancing portfolio options. Is it at the higher end of opportunities, where are we now. You have a great four year data in hand. You know, where does it rank, what could it do, what should we expect from this opportunity? Thank you.","Michael Mahoney","Thanks, Rick. Good morning. I think, I know Rezum\u2019s doing - we're very - the team is very committed to Rezum and we had equity investment via an acquisition and I think the team smartly acquired Rezum and recommended it versus a competitor a while ago, on the belief that the stim [ph] based ablation would provide longer term more durable results. And I think that's exactly what the four year data showed. And at the end of the day you know, many had long term results and high safety and efficacy and that's what that that data represents versus its primary competitor.","So I think with a marketplace with the ability to be less invasive and to grow the pie for BPH is extremely unique and then you tuck that into our full portfolio of laser capabilities, as well as our urology sales force with other products, its a very compelling contractual opportunity for us as well.","So I think the product stands alone versus competition. And then you wrap around at the complementary portfolio for contracting is very helpful. So this will be a - make a big impact for our UroPH business. It's -- I don't want to rack and stack them, but we anticipate this will deliver strong growth for us in 2019 and urology will certainly be accretive to our overall BSX growth profile in \u201919.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Vijay Kumar","Hey, guys congrats again and thanks for taking the question. So one products and one on cap deployment. DBS Mike, you know, you sounded optimistic. Can you quantify on what this means to share gain? So on the spinal cord stim side we've seen 10, 20 points of share shifts. Any comments would be helpful.","And then on the cap deployment side, $2 billion plus of free cash I think, you said a $1 billion of debt pay down. Are we to assume another $1 billion if that is left off for M&A? Thank you.","Michael Mahoney","We'll do Dan's question first. He's lonely here. So we're going to turn over to Dan.","Daniel Brennan","Sure. Thanks for the question Vijay. Yeah, the $1 billion of M&A spend in \u201819 is just the basic math of saying if we did $2.2 billion, little bit of that goes to the qualified settlement funds for finishing out mesh, $1 billion debt pay down, at least $1 billion for M&A. So just simple math that as Mike said allows us to do a small handful of tuck-ins, obviously much less than we did in \u201819. But nice to be able to - still do some M&A \u2013 in \u201918, nice to still be able to do some in \u201819.","Michael Mahoney","And your first question was on DBS, is that, what it was?","Susan Lisa","Next question, please, Greg\u2026","Michael Mahoney","I have to make a comment on DBS. So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the full portfolio is recently approved of the directional lead. And so we just started implanting patients over the past 30 days. So we think that will be a terrific platform for us, it will complement us, yes. We've got tougher comps in SCS this year, so we think the uniqueness of our SCS platform plus DBS will continue to drive neuromod results accretive to the company.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Josh Jennings","Hi, good morning. Thanks a lot. I just want to ask Dan a question on operating margin guidance, 50 to 100 basis points. Just curious and also on the bottom line, just can you call what the impact of acquisitions are, what the M&A headwind is in terms of what you have to absorb on the margin line and also on the EPS line in \u201919? Thanks a lot.","Daniel Brennan","Sure Joshua. As you'd expect there is a little bit of dilution in \u201819 from M&A and obviously since the majority of acquisitions are at our overall adjusted operating margin rate there is dilution at the OI margin rate as well.","I am not going to call the specific, except to say, it's all included within what we think is very strong guidance at 9% to 13% adjusted earnings per share growth off the 140 base and then included in what we think is again very strong operating margin guidance at 26% to 26.5% which is 50 to 100 basis points off of the base in 2018 and it's very consistent with what we've been saying over the last few quarters. So feel good that the whole entire slew that we have adds up to that and feel like that's very strong guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor from UBS. Please go ahead.","Matt Taylor","Hi. Thank you for taking the question. So I know you didn't address this explicitly today, but you know obviously with the stronger organic guidance for 2019, you're talking about growth at the upper end of your kind of two year range, that 7 to 10 operational and formally you know 5.5 to 8.5 organic. You did talk about some qualitative things that give you confidence in 2020 and 2021.","Can you say with this kind of a guidance \u201819 does that just give you more confidence in the high end of the range in \u201820 and beyond? Or can you update us on what we should expect for organic and operational growth over the next couple of years?","Michael Mahoney","Morning, Matt. Yeah, we're not going to comment on kind of expanding our guidance beyond \u201819. So something we'll consider in the future for Investor Day. But confident in the \u201819 growth rate we gave and certainly hold true to the \u201819 and \u201820 CAGR growth of 7% to 10% operational that we gave historically.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from BMO. Please go ahead.","Joanne Wuensch","Good morning, everybody and thank you for taking the question. It sounds to me like you are likely to have LOTUS at the booth at ACC. Could you please confirm if that's you're thinking and what else we should see from ACC? And then as a secondary, now that Millipede is part of the family what are your thoughts on mitral? Thank you.","Michael Mahoney","So - we do anticipate LOTUS approval as I mentioned likely early second quarter, maybe Ian you can help me specifically at ACC we often showcase WATCHMAN at ACC and we'll certainly showcase our TAVR portfolio, as well as our protected TAVR strategy with SENTINEL. Ian, any other comments on ACC\u2026","Ian Meredith","No, no\u2026","Michael Mahoney","Then maybe comments on Millipede.","Ian Meredith","The answer to Millipede is yes, we see that Millipede is an important foundation for functional mitral regurgitation. Obviously it's part of a bigger strategy, but it's a critical part of the strategy, being the first and most important step in develop - in functional mitral regurgitation repair.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Matt Miksic","Thanks for taking the question. So a lot of positive drivers on the top line that you've talked about and we've heard here in Q&A queue. I wanted to follow up with one of the question, one of the comments that you made earlier Dan, in terms of the drivers of your leverage and operating margin improvements, you know, in the past and currently around shared services and robotic process automation.","Can you maybe speak to in round numbers, of course, sort of what that does you know, on a gross basis, we can see what your guidance is for 2019, but what kind of benefit are you seeing from that?","And then maybe which of the acquisitions - recent acquisitions you know, thinking of robotic process automation, some of the back office changes that you're making. Where does that position you to benefit the most as you go through these integrations, maybe also looking ahead to BTG and what the opportunities are there?","Michael Mahoney","Sure, Matt And I would really just ground in guidance for 2019. So if you look at 2018 SG&A was for the full year was 35.4% of sales, the guidance for 2019 is 34.5 to 35. So at the midpoint call that kind of 70 basis points of improvement there. Gross margin obviously contributes, it was 72.3 [ph] in \u201818 and the midpoint is 72.5 [ph] in \u201919, so that's kind of the math of how we get to that 50 to 100 basis points of margin expansion.","Specific SG&A, we have a lot of different initiatives going across the divisions, regions and function. I would say that RPA is more of a legacy Boston Scientific thing at this point. We don't descend upon the new acquisitions with RPA. It's more of a back office, things like finance and IT and other functions where we put that in.","It is a big piece of what we're - what we're doing relative to reducing our overall SG&A spend, but it's just one of the components in a lot of initiatives and activities and a roadmap that we have to reduce SG&A as a company over the next two to three years.","Susan Lisa","All right, Greg, we\u2019ll take one more question please.","Operator","Okay. Your final question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Isaac Ro","Good afternoon or good morning, guys. Thank you. Hey, Dan a question for you on the tax rate guidance. There is some new regulations coming through that have a varying degree of impact on companies in the space. I was curious if you could maybe try and quantify for us number one what's assumed in your tax rate guidance for the year as at least in some of these changes. And if you could quantify it in any way that would be awesome? Thank you.","Daniel Brennan","Sure, Isaac. I think I'm going to give you the short answer on that one, both given time and the magnitude of what would be required to go through things like GILTI and hybrid and BEAT and all that. All of what we know today relative to tax reform is included in our 13% operational and 12% all in tax rate for 2019.","Susan Lisa","All right. We'd like to call now. Thanks for joining us. We appreciate your interest in Boston Scientific. And before you disconnect, Greg will give you all the pertinent details of the replay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you.

Welcome to the Boston Scientific Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and answer-session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Susie Lisa. Please go ahead.","Susan Lisa","Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q4 2017 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Filings.","The duration of this morning's call will be just under one hour. Mike will provide strategic and revenue highlights for Q4 2017 and full year 2017; Dan will review the financials for the quarter, and then Q1 2018 and full year 2018 guidance; and then, we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Global Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Ian Meredith; and Chief Medical Officer for Rhythm Management and Global Health Policy, Dr. Ken Stein.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that, on the call, operational revenue growth excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. And organic revenue growth is defined as excluding the impacts of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and sales from the acquisitions of EndoChoice and Symetis over the relevant prior year period.","Also note, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate, goals and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share, new product approvals and launches, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance, including sales, margins, earnings and other Q1 and full year 2018 guidance, as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses.","Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them.","At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike?","Michael Mahoney","Good morning. Thanks you, Susie. Thanks for dialing in. Boston Scientific delivered excellent financial results in fourth quarter 2017 with 8% operational revenue growth, 7% organic revenue growth, 190 basis point improvement in profitability and 14% adjusted EPS growth to $0.34.","These fourth quarter results closed out a very strong 2017. For the full year, we delivered 8% operational revenue growth, 7% organic, against the 10% comp in 2016, which represents a 90 basis point improvement in profitability and 13% adjusted EPS growth to $1.16. Similarly, 2017 closed out a very strong three-year period for BSC, with an average operational revenue growth of 9%, organic growth of 7%, combined with a 480 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin, which leveraged that growth 2-times to an average 14.5% growth in adjusted EPS over the three-year period.","So our strategy of category leadership in key markets and diversification in the high-growth adjacencies continues to deliver. Our goal is to continue to execute against our strategic planned goals, and execute similarly strong sales and EPS growth results over the next three years. It is the combination of long-term consistent above-market revenue growth, margin expansion and targeted double-digit EPS growth, now coupled with an improved ability to deploy strong free cash flow, that we believe uniquely positions Boston Scientific to deliver shareholder value.","Accordingly, we are excited about our plans to build upon our global momentum in 2018 and beyond. We're targeting full year 2018 organic revenue growth of 5% to 6%. We're guiding to adjusted EPS of $1.35 to a $1.39, which represents 7% to 10% earnings growth.","Importantly, this EPS growth includes an expected $0.02 to $0.03 negative impact from foreign exchange, which we'll seek to offset and deliver another year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. I'll now provide some highlights in fourth quarter and 2017 results along with thoughts on our 2018 outlook. All growth figures highlighted are on an organic basis over the prior year, unless otherwise noted.","Our fourth quarter organic revenue growth of 7% continues to be broad-based across businesses and regions, led by our strong and diversified portfolio, continued global expansion and execution of our category leadership strategy. The ongoing diversification of our portfolio has helped drive excellent results with sales growth of 11% in MedSurg, 5% in cardiovascular and 3% in Rhythm Management. Four of the seven businesses grew revenue double digits, and we believe five of our seven businesses grew faster than the market.","We also delivered another quarter of balanced global growth, led by 8% revenue in both the US and EMEA, and 4% growth in Europe. Emerging markets revenue grew 13%, led by 19% in China. The MedSurg business has continued to deliver. MedSurg grew 13% operationally and 11% organically in fourth quarter and now represents 39% of the revenue mix in the quarter.","In Endo, we posted 10% organic and 13% operational growth in Q4 fueled by biliary, hemostasis and continued strong growth in the EndoChoice acquisition, which has now been part of the BSC team for over a year now and is fully integrated. Endo delivered 8% organic and 12% operational growth in full year 2017 sales, and we expect continued strength in our global Endo business in 2018.","Uro and Pelvic Health also continued its excellent performance, growing sales 11% in fourth quarter, which is the eighth straight quarter of double-digit sales growth and 12% for the full year 2017. Our single-use digital ureteroscope, LithoVue helped drive double-digit growth in our core stone franchise.","Prostate health also grew double-digits, while Men's Health grew single-digits. And also, the Minnetonka plant warning letter now has been lifted. And we anticipate a stronger new product cadence in our Men's Health business going forward. Boston Scientific continues to build the single-use market for ureteroscopy, while LithoVue now had over 700 accounts in the US and over 1,300 worldwide.","Neuromodulation revenue grew 15% in the fourth quarter. We're excited about the future for this business in 2018 and beyond, with fast growing markets and new innovative product launches in both the spinal-cord stimulation and deep-brain stimulation franchises. Our WaveWriter SCS System is currently launching, and is the first and only platform approved by the FDA to simultaneously provide a paresthesia-based and sub-perception therapy for patients suffering chronic pain.","We're also launching in the US our Vercise DBS platforms to treat Parkinson's disease. Vercise, is a rechargeable platform with a multiple independent control to offer more adaptable delivery of stimulation. Our Cardiovascular group grew 7% operationally in fourth quarter and 5% organically in both fourth quarter and full year.","Our PI business Peripheral Interventions grew 7%, both in the quarter and for the full year. From a product sales standpoint, drug-eluting technology has led the away, but many franchises grew double digits, including stents, atherectomy, IVUS, and our CeloNova microspheres for interventional oncology procedures.","We're seeing expanded use of a drug-eluting technologies in peripheral in Europe, and we continue to be the only manufacturer offering both the highly-effective drug-eluting stents and a drug-coated balloon. Both of our drug-eluting technologies are on track for U.S launches in 2019 for Eluvia, our drug-eluting stent, and in 2020 for Ranger, our drug-coated balloon.","We expect data from Eluvia pivotal trial IMPERIAL to be presented in the second half of 2018. And earlier this week, we're encouraged by early COMPARE I trial data that was presented at the LEERINK conference in Leipzig, Germany. This is the first comparative data in the PI DCB space, looking at our Ranger DCB in a prospective multicenter randomized trial against Medtronic's IN.PACT, IN.PACT Admiral DCB.","Ranger will be differentiated as the lowest profile of any DCB, utilizing the minimum effective dose of paclitaxel and builds upon our market-leading 0.018 Sterling platform balloon. We also expect to bring Ranger to the U.S. and Japan as the first DCB with the longest lengths available on the market. Intervention Cardiology continues its above-market growth trend, delivering a 4% organic and 7% operational revenue in the quarter, and for the full year of 4% organic and 6% operational.","IC growth was led worldwide by continued strength of WATCHMAN, 10% growth in our complex PCI portfolio and mid-single-digit growth in PCI guidance. We also launched four new complex PCI products in the second half of 2017, as we continue to extend our lead in terms of depth and breadth of our complex PCI portfolio.","We're targeting continued momentum in 2018 with new launches like the WOLVERINE cutting balloon and our next-generation rotational atherectomy platform called ROTAPRO. We also recently received FDA approval for a high-definition IVUS system, and expect to begin a limited market release this quarter, while we continue to rollout our new Comet FFR platform.","As we disclosed earlier this month, 2017 structural heart revenue exceeded our guidance of $275 million, and WATCHMAN sales delivered $250 million. WATCHMAN has now treated over 3,000 [ph] patients globally, and we continue to drive growth via increasing utilization with existing customers, opening new centers and expanding the therapy geographically.","Clinically, our efforts include indication expansion with the ASAP-TOO study in patients with absolute contradiction to oral anticoagulants. And we reported positive real world results and EWOLUTION WASP [ph] registries this year as well as the five year PROTECT AF PREVAIL meta-analysis.","On the product development front, we target beginning enrollment in Q2 for the next-generation of WATCHMAN FLX in the PINNACLE FLX IDE trial and launching in Japan in 2019. WATCHMAN also received a 10.6% increase in its primary DRG reimbursement in the U.S. starting last October as well as reimbursement in Australia. We remain committed to educating patients and their caregivers about WATCHMAN, as an alternative to oral anticoagulants to help reduce the risk of bleeding and stroke.","Our ACURATE TAVR program, a platform continues to build momentum in Europe, and we recently completed training of our European sales and clinical teams. We look forward to continued momentum as well as the launch of the next-generation ACURATE neo2 that incorporates an advanced seal in Europe in the second half of this year. We also remain on track to begin enrolling patients in our U.S. IDE for ACURATE in the second half of this year, and we'll confirm the trial details in the coming months.","Regarding our LOTUS Edge TAVR valve platform, there's no change to our commentary from earlier this year in that pending our ability to clear certain technical and regulatory hurdles, our goal is to launch LOTUS Edge in the U.S. and European markets in 2019.","Finally, in structural heart, last week, we announced exciting investment and acquisition option agreement with Millipede, a company that's developing a transcatheter mitral valve and Annuloplasty repair device to treat patients with severe mitral regurgitation. This is a large and currently underserved patient population that we estimate could represent $1 billion market opportunity by 2021.","The Millipede IRIS Annuloplasty Ring delivered via transfemoral, transseptal delivery system follows the surgical standard of care to repair, and ultimately reduce the size of a dilated mitral annulus. This unique design in that is a complete - a unique design and that is a complete ring designed to be used as a standalone device or in combination with other technologies. It's also designed to be highly customizable to a specific patient's anatomy and disease state. We're pleased with the results of Millipede's first-in-human study, and a second first-in-human study will focus on improving the efficiency of the procedure.","With WATCHMAN, ACURATE, LOTUS and now IRIS, we're excited about our structural heart capabilities and the long-term growth prospects of our structural heart business. For 2018, we expect revenue from our WATCHMAN and ACURATE TAVR franchise to deliver approximately $400 million in revenue.","Global Rhythm Management sales grew 3% operationally and organically in Q4 and 4% for the full year. CRM sales grew 1% in the quarter and 2% for the full year 2017, while EP sales increased 18% in the quarter and 14% for the full year.","CRM's 1% growth in Q4 reflects strong 6% growth in defib, offset by high single-digit declines in pacing due to tough comps post-April 2016 U.S. launch of our Brady MRI line. The 6% growth in defib reflects the impact of MRI conditional labeling in the U.S., the ongoing European and U.S. launches of our Resonate platform that contains HeartLogic Heart Failure alert, multipoint pacing MRI and best-in-class longevity with EnduraLife battery technology. EMBLEM S-ICD also continued to do extremely well and grew double digits for the full year 2017, while replacements are tracking to our expectations.","Turning to EP, this franchise continues to build momentum, and we grew sales 18% for the quarter. The second-gen RHYTHMIA HDx platform, which provides significant improvements on workflow efficiency and performance, continues to be rolled out and enables our platform to support future innovative capabilities such as the recent European limited market release of our DirectSense catheters. DirectSense technology has received very positive early physician feedback in Europe and provides physicians with confidence in location, stability and proximity of the catheter to the tissue. Full launch of DirectSense is planned for the U.S. and Europe in 2018.","We believe our strategy of category leadership is working and helping us to become a stronger partner to our global customers. We believe we are poised for a strong 2018, we're well positioned to continue and strengthen our performance track record in 2019 and beyond. Over the course of the next three years, we aim to expand into significant markets that represent an estimated $16 billion in opportunities, with strong margin improvement potential, a consistent tax rate and a greatly improved ability to deploy capital. I really want to thank our employees for the high-performance results, their winning spirit and commitment to advancing science and improving the lives of patients around the world.","Now let me turn the call over the Dan for a detailed review of our financials.","Daniel Brennan","Thanks, Mike. Fourth quarter consolidated revenue of $2,408 million represents 10% reported revenue growth and 8% growth on an operational basis, which excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency. The strong top line exceeded the high end of our operational guidance range of 5% to 6% due to outperformance across the majority of our businesses and regions, as Mike outlined.","Our reported revenue reflects a $37 million tailwind from foreign exchange, basically in line with the $40 million tailwind expected at the time of guidance. Sales from the EndoChoice and Symetis acquisitions contributed approximately 130 basis points, which was also in line with our expectations at the time of guidance, resulting in a 7% organic revenue growth for the quarter.","We delivered Q4 adjusted earnings per share of $0.34, which represents 14% year-over-year growth and is towards the high end of our guidance range of $0.32 to $0.35, driven primarily by that strong revenue growth. This includes a $0.02 headwind from FX, which was at the higher end of our range of $0.01 to $0.02.","Our full year 2017 consolidated revenue of $9,048 million grew 8% operationally and on a reported basis and grew 7% organically. Full year 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $1.26, represents 13% growth our fifth straight year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, excluding the $0.08 foreign exchange headwind that we effectively offset throughout the operational savings and initiatives. Adjusted earnings per share grew 20% versus 2016.","Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 72.6% and flat to the prior year, but importantly, reflects our ability to offset a negative 200 basis point year-over-year impact from foreign exchange and pricing in line with what we have seen in prior years, with operational improvements and manufacturing cost reductions as well as favorable product mix due to the continued strength in our WATCHMAN and Men's Health franchises, to name a couple.","For the full year 2017, adjusted gross margin was 72.1%, in line with the 72% adjusted gross margin for 2016, effectively offsetting a negative 130 basis point year-over-year impact from foreign exchange plus the LOTUS inventory charges in Q1 as well as the unfavorable variances incurred in our Puerto Rico facility due to Hurricane Maria in the third quarter. Adjusted SG&A expenses were $859 million or 35.7% of sales in Q4 2017, down 80 basis points year-over-year and within our guidance range of 35% to 36%.","We remain committed to and continue to realize the benefit of our targeted initiatives focused on reducing SG&A, like, end-to-end business process streamlining and automation, expansion of global shared services, and leveraging global indirect sourcing. As a result of these initiatives, the full year 2017 adjusted SG&A rate of 35.6% is down 50 basis points versus the full year 2016.","Adjusted research and development expenses were $256 million in the fourth quarter or 10.6% of sales, which is down 90 basis points from Q4 2016. And for the full year 2017, adjusted R&D expenses were $974 million or 10.8% of sales compared to 10.9% in 2016. Royalty expense was 0.7% of sales in Q4 and 0.8% for the full year 2017, roughly flat year-over-year for both periods. As a result, Q4 2017 adjusted operating margin of 25.6% increased 190 basis points year-over-year and was within our guidance range of 25.5% to 26.5%.","Full year 2017, adjusted operating margin of 25% is an increase of 90 basis points over the full year 2016 and on target with the goals we established nearly five years ago at our 2013 Investor Day as we seek to continue to build our track record of delivering high performance and meeting or exceeding our long-term goals. The 90 basis point year-over-year improvement in our 2017 adjusted operating margin rate was largely driven by gains in our Rhythm Management and MedSurg segment operating results.","The Rhythm Management team delivered an operating margin of 21.6% for Q4 and 19.7% for the full year 2017. This represents an impressive year-over-year operating margin increase of 620 basis points for Q4 and 470 basis points for the full year.","The team continues to make strong progress on gross margin through favorable S-ICD and Resonate product portfolio mix as well as manufacturing efficiencies, while also focusing on expense control and leveraging the improved top line performance of both the global CRM and EP businesses. This improvement also reflects offsetting incremental spend related to the acquisition of Apama Medical and its single-shot pulmonary vein isolation technology that we announced in October.","The MedSurg segment also realized significant year-over-year improvements of 290 basis points in the quarter, delivering Q4 operating margin of 34.3%. The full year rate of 32.3%, increased 100 basis points over the full year 2016. Investments in commercial capability for ongoing launches across MedSurg were more than offset by the strength in Endoscopy and Urology Pelvic Health, two of our highest operating margin businesses and improvements in Neuromodulation operating margin, with its recent commercial launches and resulting moderation in development spend.","We recorded a net litigation-related charge of $89 million this quarter, related primarily to our mesh litigation. We have now reached conditional, final or near final settlement on approximately 44,000 of our approximately 49,000 claims. However, as we do each quarter, we review the volume of known claims, the estimated cost to resolve each claim, an estimate of future claims and the cost to defend each claim in order to calculate the required reserve and make any necessary adjustments.","Having now settled or reached agreement in principle with approximately 90% of all known claims, we continue to reduce the risk on our balance sheet and are targeting a resolution of the majority of our mesh claims in 2018. Our total legal reserve, of which mesh is included, was $1,612 million as of December 31, 2017.","And importantly, for 2018, we expect to make cash payments of approximately $800 million, which will fund the settlement of remaining legal reserves related to the mesh litigation and minimize this liability on our balance sheet, given the cash payments we've already made in prior quarters into the qualified settlement funds. This combined with our expected payment to finalize our disputes with the Internal Revenue Service for approximately $600 million during 2018, requires approximately $1.4 billion of cash flow to settle our remaining significant existing contingencies. Therefore, in 2018, we expect to have approximately $500 million of cash flow for our other, more strategic uses. I'll give more detail on our cash flow guidance in a minute.","Now I'll move to below the line and interest and other expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $56 million, roughly flat to Q4 of 2016. Our average interest expense rate was 3.8% in Q4 of 2017, and 4% in Q4 of 2016. Adjusted other expense was $31 million in the fourth quarter and primarily included a $19 million impairment on certain of our available-for-sale investments as well as foreign exchange losses related to our hedging program. For the full year, interest expense and adjusted other expense were $229 million and $57 million respectively, slightly below our expected $300 million for the full year.","Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 371.1% [ph] on a reported basis and 9.5% on an adjusted basis. On an adjusted basis, the favorability in our tax rate was due to a better-than-expected geographic mix of profit and certain discrete tax items. Our reported tax rate includes an estimated one-time net income charge of $861 million resulting from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This estimate includes approximate $1 billion charge related to the deemed repatriation of unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, offset by a $100 million benefit related to the remeasurement of the company's deferred taxes as a result of the lower U.S. corporate tax rate. The net of these two items is the approximate $861 million one-time charge.","Importantly, we expect to be able to utilize certain tax benefits such as NOL and R&D credits, and thus anticipate the cash impact of these charges will be approximately $450 million which is very manageable considering it's paid out over a period of eight years. Our full year tax rate was 88.8% on a reported basis and 11.2% on an adjusted basis.","Finally, Q4 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $0.34, includes approximately $0.02 of unfavorable foreign exchange and represents 14% year-over-year growth or 23% growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On a reported GAAP basis, which includes the one-time net income tax charge and other net charges, and amortization expenses totaling $1,095 million after tax, Q4 2017 was a loss per share of $0.45.","For the full year 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $1.26 reflects the higher end of our guidance range, while absorbing the $0.08 of unfavorable foreign exchange. Full year 2017, adjusted earnings per share grew 13% over the prior year and 20% excluding the impact of foreign exchange.","On a reported GAAP basis, 2017 EPS was $0.08 compared to full year 2016 GAAP income per share of $0.25. We ended Q4 with 1,393 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $685 million compared to $472 million in Q4 of 2016. And in the quarter we used cash primarily to fund previously agreed upon legal settlements as well as business development activities, namely the Apama Medical acquisition that I mentioned. As of December 31, 2017, we had cash on hand of $188 million.","Our full year 2017 adjusted free cash flow of $1,729 million represents 7% year-over-year growth, but fell slightly short of our $1,750 million cash flow guidance. The shortfall was primarily related to working capital. I'll detail 2018 guidance in a moment, but we continue to expect 2018 adjusted cash flow to be approximately $1.9 billion.","Capital expenditures for the full year 2017 totaled $319 million, in line with our $320 million target, which included expenditures for strategic investments expected to build capacity and drive growth. We expect capital expenditures to be at similar levels for 2018.","So now I'll walk through guidance for Q1 and full year 2018. For the full year 2018, we expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $9,650 million to $9,800 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 5% to 6% on an organic basis, with an additional 30 basis point contribution from the Symetis acquisition. We expect foreign exchange to be a tailwind of approximately $150 million to $175 million for the full year 2018. However, as I'll detail next, due to our hedging program, we do not expect to see the same benefit in our adjusted gross margin or earnings per share.","We expect our adjusted gross margin for the year, as a percentage of sales, to be approximately 72% for the full year, which assumes a negative FX impact of 110 basis points. As a reminder, we lock in our foreign currency hedges up to 3 to 5 years in advance, depending on the currency, so we do not benefit from the recent currency movements. As a result, the upside in reported sales, primarily from the strengthening of the euro, has no associated gross profit benefit and thus our gross margin rate is negatively impacted.","We expect this headwind to be partially offset by favorable mix, standard cost reduction program, and the ramp of accretive new products. As we look forward to 2019 and 2020 if rates were to remain constant, we'd expect a neutral to slightly positive impact from foreign exchange on results in those two years. We expect full year adjusted SG&A to be in the range of 34.5% to 35% of sales as we continue to see the benefits of programs currently underway. In 2018, we will again reinvest the full benefit of the medical device excise tax expansion with strong investments in structural heart and other exciting durable growth platforms.","Full year adjusted research and development is expected to be in a range of 10% to 11%. And we expect our royalty rate to remain at slightly less than 1% of sales for 2018. This implies a full year 2018 adjusted operating margin in a range of 25.5% to 25.75%, which is consistent with the improvement goals we outlined on January 9, and sets us up well to deliver on our long-term goal of 28% adjusted operating margin in 2020.","We forecast our full year 2018 adjusted tax rate to be between 13% and 14%. This assumes an operational tax rate of approximately 14% to 15%, which is lower than the 16% we expected in early January as a result of additional analysis and clarity on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.","In addition, we expect an approximate 100 basis point benefit to the operational tax rate from the accounting standard for stock compensation compared to the approximate 200 basis point benefit we had in 2017 as a result of the US tax rate declining from 35% to 21%.","In 2019 and beyond, we now expect a similar long-term effective tax rate between 14% and 15%, with full access to our global cash. We expect below-the-line expenses, which include interest payments, dilution from our VC portfolio and costs associated with our hedging program to be approximately $300 million for the year, and fully diluted weighted average share-count of approximately 1,399 million shares for the first quarter and 1,402 million for the full year.","As a result, we expect full year 2018 adjusted EPS to be in a range of $1.35 to $1.39, representing 7% to 10% adjusted earnings growth, despite headwinds from a full year negative impact of foreign exchange of approximately $0.02 to $0.03. On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.93 to $0.98.","Now, turning to Q1 2018, we expect consolidated revenue to be in a range of 2,320 million to 2,350 million. This represents year-over-year organic growth in a range of 4% to 5% versus a 9% growth comparison in Q1 2017, with an additional 80 basis point operational growth contribution from Symetis.","We expect the foreign exchange impact on Q1 revenue to be a $60 million to $70 million tailwind. For the first quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.30 to $0.32 per share, representing 5% to 12% growth and GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.19 to $0.22 per share.","Please check our Investor Relations website for Q4 2017 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q4 and full year results as well as Q1 and full year 2018 guidance, including P&L line item guidance. So with that, I'll turn it back to Susie, who will moderate the Q&A.","Susan Lisa","Thanks, Dan. Greg, let's open it up to questions for the next 20 minutes or so. In order to enable us to take us many as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. Greg, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Weinstein","Good morning, guys. And thanks for the taking the questions. Let me start, I mean, we got a chance to talk a little bit about the quarter in San Francisco. And obviously, this is an extremely strong quarter on the tough comp for you. There are some discussion already on the Street about kind of what the first quarter ends up looking like. I think we get a sense for how you're thinking about it with your guidance here.","But with you guys showing such a strong fourth quarter, the industry in general having a strong fourth quarter, do you have a feel for how you're thinking about the first quarter? And should it be conservative just relative to what we saw here in 4Q?","Michael Mahoney","Sure, good morning, Mike. Yeah, we're very comfortable with our 5% to 6% full-year growth. We gave visibility to first quarter with 4% to 5%. As you said, we do have good momentum coming out of the company across the businesses with MedSurg delivering very well, WATCHMAN, PI, really across the board.","We do have some headwinds in 2018 that we'll be facing. We do have some tough - difficult pacer comps. We have some more DES competition with some new entrants that we expect some trialing. We expect to maintain our share over the term, but we expect some trialing early on. We also see some one-time price cuts in Australia and Japan that have a bit more impact in 2018 and that will be neutralized in 2019.","So overall, the business is performing very well. There are few headwinds and we're comfortable with the 5% to 6%. And gave you good line of sights and they are 4% to 5% for the quarter.","Michael Weinstein","Okay. Let me ask you just couple of other items. One, first off, thanks for giving the detailed number on WATCHMAN. That was obviously appreciated. WATCHMAN has a ton of momentum. It sounds like the fourth quarter in particular was very strong for WATCHMAN. Can you just give us a little bit more color on what you're seeing amongst interventional cardiologist and electrophysiologist, and who seems to be really getting on board with WATCHMAN usage and who's driving it?","And then, second, could you spend just a minute on the Millipede transaction? I thought the structure of the deal was obviously very interesting. Effectively, you will be acquiring the company, but it keeps it off your P&L for the next two years. Why was that the right technology? And why was this the right asset to buy in mitral? Thanks.","Michael Mahoney","Thanks, Mike. I'll talk to a little bit of WATCHMAN and then I'll have - then we'll also talk about Millipede. And so, on the WATCHMAN the teams are doing a terrific job. We continue to open up centers, on track. But more importantly, we're improving utilization of the product and the therapies. We're increasing awareness amongst the referring physicians. We're training more physicians. And we're also expanding globally into China, and we will launch into Japan in 2019.","So I think the overall momentum is just excellent clinical outcomes, more physicians, training in the product as well as just increasing awareness. And our focus is on improving utilization rates at these large centers each quarter. So we're very, very bullish on the platform. And as you know, we've only had about 1% of the utilization rate at $250 million. So you will continue to see us invest aggressively there.","Maybe Dr. Stein can make a comment on the clinical work with WATCHMAN, and then we'll touch on Millipede.","Kenneth Stein","Yeah, thanks, Mike. And, Mike, I think, the key behind the momentum has been the great results that we've seen, both in the clinical trials, really pleased with the results that were presented at TCT, the final five-year results, combined meta-analysis, protecting from fail, leaving really no reasonable doubt, but that this is at least as effective as warfarin for stroke prevention. And I think you've seen that translate into the market as well as really the extraordinarily good safety results that we've seen as a result of our training program and disciplined approach to bringing new sites online.","We see balanced interest between IC and EP implanters. And I think both sides have the skill that's required to do the implant and the results show that both sides are doing it well and doing it effectively.","Michael Mahoney","And on the Millipede transaction, we like the structure where we organized it. I think you outlined it pretty well. We aim to purchase this company once they're complete with a - their second-gen fam [ph] if you call it or - likely by the end of this year. That maybe, Ian, you can touch on kind of a rationale for Millipede.","Ian Meredith","Yeah, thanks, Mike. And thank you, Mike, good question. The rationale behind Millipede, it's based on very sound physics principles and logically correct for path of physiology of functional mitral regurgitation. As you know, it follows the surgical predicate in that you have a complete annuloplasty ring. And it's a small footprint device, transfemoral, transapical catheter repair, so not using the apex, which is a huge impasse on patients with significant left ventricle impairment to start with.","And it provides some line of sight to tricuspid valve repair and obviously mitral valve replacement in the future. And more importantly, it doesn't limit or preclude the use of any other therapies and - that is particularly important because mitral valve repair is often a multifaceted approach leaflet and chord repair can still be done in this context.","So we thought that we - there were 8 criteria that we would want for a transcatheter mitral valve repair foundational device and this meets all of those 8 foundational criteria.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Lewis","Good morning. One quick question on structural heart for me and then I have quick follow-up. Mike, I'm just thinking about the structural heart guidance you gave for 2018, which I thought was pretty interesting. I mean, the $400 million number, I wonder if you can provide some context around that. Because given the strong WATCHMAN number in 2017, as you're probably aware, WATCHMAN virtually slowed very marginally in 2017 versus 2016, very aggressive growth.","To do $400 million 2018, if I just take your NeoTract annualization off the fourth quarter and very substantial deceleration in WATCHMAN, you get above $400 million. So help us frame up that $400 million number because it sort of implies a lot of WATCHMAN deceleration or frankly is a very conservative way to think about the year to start the year.","Michael Mahoney","Oh, we've definitely taken the NeoTract numbers out of our numbers. Just kidding you there. But on the WATCHMAN, I think overall, we aim to deliver against our commitments and we continue to do so. So we feel very bullish on the platform. We don't have as many new centers opening in the U.S. We penetrated that quite a bit. We saw a few new centers. And we have some major launches coming more so in 2019 in terms of U.S. - really, Japan. But we feel comfortable with that guidance number. And hopefully, we continue to do well, whether we'll be able to have opportunity to increase it as the year goes on.","David Lewis","Sorry for the Freudian slip there, Mike. We'll move on","Michael Mahoney","The only thing I'll comment on is on Symetis, as part of that. This - that business continues to increase. We've trained our clinical and our sales teams on it. So we expect some acceleration of Symetis in 2018. And the approval - that second generation platform, early third quarter will really be critical, because it already has a very low pacemaker rate, very, very quick to implant, and this will even reduce the PVL rate further and we have those two large clinical trials that we'll also report on.","So I think you'll see strong momentum out of WATCHMAN and Symetis this year in 2018.","David Lewis","Okay. And then just the financial question is for me. Dan, you - tax rate came in a little lower than we thought. Could you just to talk us, what drives the low end and high end of the earnings range? I think we initially thought 50 basis points of leverage this year. Maybe with the - you've got more flexibility now with the lower tax rate. So how are you thinking about leverage in 2018? And from balance sheet perspective, I think a lot of investors are interested on, like, what you think your capacity is towards the back half of this year? Is it $750 million? Is it $1 billion? And where do those priorities sit versus acting under venture portfolio versus externally driven M&A? Thanks so much.","Daniel Brennan","Sure, David. So on the tax rate, in early January we had talked about the 16%. That was the best read at that time. And frankly, now that we've had more time to crawl through it and there's been more clarity, we think the 14% to 15% from an operational rate perspective is a good call for 2018. And then, keep in mind the all-in tax rate is 100 basis points lower than that, just given the ASU on stock comp. In terms of the leverage, if you look at the ranges that we have down through the P&L, you get the outcomes at the different ranges that we have for EPS.","So the lower tax rate is helpful, but the margin goal of 50 to 75 basis points over 2017 is exactly what we said in early January, it's in line with that. We think that sets us up well to get to that 28% by 2020. The - really, the only one that's a bit stuck on that is the gross margin, and that's just the FX impact that we'll see in 2018 and that hopefully turns to a tailwind in 2019 and 2020. So I think, all tends to line up well in terms of very solid leverage in 2018 and then probably acceleration of that leverage in 2019 and 2020.","And then the balance sheet. Balance sheet is probably as healthy it's been in 10-plus years when you look at it relative to our capacity and our debt and leverage ratios. So we're down in the low-tows now. We sit very well with that. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we should have roughly $500 million kind of left over from the $1.9 billion goal that we have this year for cash flow, for more strategic uses in the back half after we take care of the rest of mesh and IRS tax case.","So that going into 2019 and 2020, as we've said very publicly, as we sit with the balance sheet today, we don't have a lot of call on that cash. So as you look at what should be north of $2 billion in each of those years, that's really the exciting part that we get to put even more in strategic uses. I don't know, Mike, you have any other comment on that?","Michael Mahoney","Yeah, you summarized it. We've - on the venture portfolio, we have a number of investments that we like. And I think we've commented in the past, you'll likely see three or four potential acquisitions months within that venture portfolio.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Wise from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Frederick Wise","Good morning, everybody. Maybe just starting with the balance sheet, again, Dan. Maybe talk about your cash flow priorities, or Mike maybe you want to talk about it as well as we think about 2018 unfolding and into2019 and 2020. From here, is it going to be continued M&A? Is that's the number one priority? Or help us think about share buyback as well.","Michael Mahoney","Yeah. That's the sequence that you laid out is the priority. One is, we had to finish the mesh pay down and tax, which we're doing this year. And then, we'll really have much more freedom as you look at second half of 2018 and then going forward once those are retired. We do have a pretty active M&A appetite. We have a venture portfolio that's pretty healthy, that we have some preferred rights to buy a number of those companies. So I think you'll see us be active with tuck-in acquisitions to strengthen our category leadership strategy.","But to the extent that we don't find strategic deals that meet our financial criteria then we would look at share repurchase, more likely share repurchase, more likely in 2019 than 2018.","Frederick Wise","That's great. And just last for me. It's sort of a long haul, but impressive pipeline and beautifully laid out in the charts and the tables, maybe just from your perspective, Mike or Ian, you could highlight the parts that you think have the most outsized potential in the 2018 through 2020 period to drive growth and expanding margins. Is that Symetis? Is it margin you see around, et cetera?","And just last on the stent business. How do we think about it from here? You said you think you're going to hold share in 2018. But does that mean, Mike, that the business is flat or down because of price? A little more color there on maybe the potential headwind or risk in 2018. Thanks a lot.","Michael Mahoney","Sure. We have a - the beauty of that portfolio, it's very diversified. So we have a number of important growth drivers. I won't hit all of them, but just a couple just to highlight. S-ICD continues to grow double-digit, and then we'll eventually get the modular pacemaker on S-ICD, Resonate is a new platform there. We touched on WATCHMAN before, which is really a strong growth driver with great margins. Very bullish on ACURATE. We aim to bring Lotus to the market in 2019.","Endo has a full suite of products, guys, I don't want to go through all of them, I think the strength of the company right now - and also, I'll just mention two big platforms, the spinal cord stim and DPS. So it's a very diversified company now. And each business has really some key platforms that are launching either this year or if the cadence actually gets stronger in 2019 and 2018.","On DES, we continue to believe that SYNERGY based on zero stent thrombosis and its ease of use is the best stent of the marketplace continue to grow that business, although very slowly, but we grow it in Europe. In Europe it seem - faced more competitors than the U.S. We expect some headwinds in the U.S., we think more temporarily as physicians may try the DES platform. But importantly, for our coronary business, the other business that surrounds DES is our complex PCI business and that business is growing 10% last year. And it's 80% the size of DES.","So I think you'll see maybe by the end of 2018 or 2019, those businesses especially the same size. So we expect, really, any softness in DES will be tempered by the growth in our Complex PCI business, where we continue to launch new platforms. So I think we will see some - likely some headwinds with some trialing, but that will be buffered with Complex PCI, then we're confident based on what we've seen Europe, doctors will stay with synergy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Robert Hopkins","Well, thanks and good morning.","Michael Mahoney","Good morning.","Robert Hopkins","So, first question. I just want to clarify from a big picture perspective the 2018 earnings guidance. It's obviously in the slides, you can nicely see that you're guiding to 7% to 10% EPS growth in 2018. But, Mike, I think in your prepared comments, you said that you hope to be able to offset some FX and therefore maybe 10% is more likely. I just want to make sure that I heard that right. Is that the message on earnings growth for 2018?","Michael Mahoney","No, I think the message is that the range is 7% to 10%. Within that 7% to 10%, the goal is to offset that $0.02 to $0.03 negative FX as we've done in the past few years, offsetting the FX impact. But I don't point to one number more likely than the other. The range is 7% to 10%.","Robert Hopkins","Okay. And just the reason I asked that is because at J.P. Morgan, the slides were pretty clear. You expect or you were hoping for double-digit earnings growth. And I'm just - with the lower tax rate. I guess, I was just a little surprised the guidance was a bit higher on the earnings side. So maybe, Dan, you can talk just a little bit about some of the things that prevents you from just guiding to 10% or better? Thank you.","Daniel Brennan","Well, I think as we've said, we have a pretty good track record of hitting or exceeding the goals that we have put out over the last few years. As you look at that range, 10% is at the high end of the guidance range. And obviously, that's our goal, right, our goals is always double digits. But the range is - it contemplates the outcomes of 7% to 10%.","As you look down the different, various elements of the P&L, and this is a bit getting to Mike's question earlier gross margin is really the only one where you don't see a solid amount of progress in 2018 and that's really the foreign exchange impact that we have to offset in 2018. Other than that, at the midpoint of SG&A, you're seeing almost 100 basis points of improvement. And that's what we've been saying over the last few quarters is that SG&A is a big driver of that operating margin improvement story and that's solid progress in 2018 and more to come in 2019 and 2020.","So at the 25 we were in 2017, and then the 50 to 75 basis points this year. And then what should be a much better years for FX in 2019 and 2020, I think we're well on track to have a solid year this year and get to that 28% by 2020.","Robert Hopkins","Okay. Very fair, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Josh Jennings","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question.","Michael Mahoney","Good morning, Josh.","Josh Jennings","I wanted to follow-up on - good morning - on the operating margin trajectory out through to 2020 and how we should be thinking about the cadence of operating margin expansion in 2019 and 2020? Is there anything, Dan, that we should be thinking about in 2019, potentially Lotus launch or FX headwinds getting lighter on the gross margin line, in terms of that 240 basis points-ish of operating margin expansion left to that - for that 28% target?","Michael Mahoney","Yeah, so I think you're kind of using the midpoint of this year and saying there's 240 left at the end of this year to get to that 28 by 2020, which I think is fair. Certainly, leveraging our Lotus launch, as Mike said, that's goal in 2019 in the US. Leveraging that will be helpful because we have a certain amount of commercial infrastructure that's in place, ready to go there. So leveraging that would be helpful.","But then, the rest of the P&L and just the - if you look at the ranges for revenue, we talk about 5 to 6 this year. We've talked about 5 to 8 for 2019 and 2020 as we have a good launch year, this year in 2018. But we are setup for 2019 and 2020 to be even better product launch year. So I think there is a natural opportunity for a topline leverage in 2019 and 2020, plus the continued focus that we have on SG&A, and then the FX relents a little bit in 2019 and 2020. So you should see better gross margin and less of a drag from an EPS perspective.","So I think the - if you look at the 50 to 75 this year and then, say, we need 240 to get to that 28 by 2020, I think the pieces are in place to get there.","Josh Jennings","Great. And then just a quick follow-up on the mitral valve portfolio, you guys are - the Millipede investment was nice to see. How are you thinking about building out the mitral valve-specific transcatheter pipeline? Is there anything internal that we should be remembering? And do you think you need a replacement device to fully capitalize on that opportunity over the next couple of years? Thanks for taking the questions.","Kenneth Stein","Thanks very much. And perhaps I can take that question. I think we do have internal programs as well. And as you know, repairing the mitral valve is often the multi-factorial approach and you need more than one solution to repair the mitral valve. But the primary foundation of mitral valve repair, particularly, functional mitral regurgitation, is the angioplasty, and that can actually serve to treat functional mitral regurgitation in a large proportion of patients.","So we see this as the foundational move in them and their critical first step in building a mitral program but it's certainly the lion's share of that program. Obviously, this does provide us the line of sight down the track to a mitral valve replacement option and indeed tricuspid valve repair as well. It's not the immediate aim, and the immediate aim is to get through the clinical trials and launch a transcatheter mitral valve repair device from a transeptal approach, which I think everybody is yearning for.","Michael Mahoney","Yes, we think this platform serves, clearly as a repair device immediately. Then potentially replacement as well as tricuspids. So we think that's the unique benefit of this platform.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Vijay Kumar","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question, so maybe one on WATCHMAN. Really strong performance in 2017. Maybe, Mike, can you comment on what portion of the drill came from the new center adds versus same center volume growth? I think that would be helpful.","Michael Mahoney","Yeah, we don't break that out for you. But as you might expect, early on, a few years ago it was new centers that were opening up. But now, call it 80\/20 practically, just roughly.","Vijay Kumar","And that's helpful, that's helpful.","Michael Mahoney","Much more so on utilization of increased utilization of same-store. I shouldn't say same-store, utilization of our facilities that are open and less on new openings.","Vijay Kumar","That's helpful, Mike. And, Dan, one on FX hedges I think the comments you made about 3 to 5 years out you guys hedged. Is this now, I assume, this is now a below the line item, right? And given three to five year hedges, like is this now - does this now have impact for 2019 as well?","Daniel Brennan","Yeah, I think it's not a below the line impact. The cost associated with the hedging program are shown below the line, but the actual settlement of the contract - the hedging contract are shown in gross margin, which is why the - we've had that headwind in gross margin in the last two to three years from an FX perspective.","So to be clear, this year we expect 110 basis points of headwind in FX, related to gross margin. When you get to 2019 and 2020, if the rates were to hold where they are today, it becomes a much better story, where it's neutral to slightly favorable for us, both at the gross margin line and then at the FX line as well. So 2019 and 2020 is a much better FX story than it has been for the last three-plus years.","Vijay Kumar","Thank you, guys.","Susan Lisa","Okay. With that, we'd like to conclude the call. Thanks for joining us today. We appreciate your interest, especially at this early hour, in Boston Scientific.

Welcome to the Boston Scientific Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn conference over to your host, Michael Campbell. Please go ahead.","Michael Campbell","Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us.","With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Capello, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q2 results for 2013, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release, as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call, to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financial Information.","The duration of this morning's call will be approximately 1 hour. Mike will begin our prepared remarks with an update on our business progress and his perspectives on the quarter and for the remainder of 2013. Jeff will then review our Q2 financial results and business performance as well as Q3 and full year 2013 guidance. We will then open the call up to questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Jeff will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Dawkins and Dr. Stein.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include among other things statements about our growth and market share; new product approvals and launches; procedural volumes and pricing; clinical trials; cost savings and growth opportunities; our cash flow and expected use; our financial performance, including sales, margins, earnings and other Q3 and full year 2013 guidance; as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses.","Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in our forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs and 8-Ks filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them.","At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike?","Michael F. Mahoney","Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin today with some comments regarding our second quarter performance, and Jeff will review the financials in more detail later on the call.","So overall, it was a strong quarter for Boston Scientific. Our team is beginning to build momentum, and we're executing against our global strategy. So key highlights for the second quarter include the following: We delivered both sales and adjusted EPS above our stated guidance range and above consensus. We delivered net sales of $1.809 billion, down 1% on a reported basis, and we grew positive 2% year-over-year on an operational basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange in the divested Neurovascular business.","In terms of sales, on an operational basis, Neuromodulation grew at an impressive 21%. Endoscopy grew at 8%. PI, 5% versus the same period in the prior year.","In addition, we're encouraged with the improved performance of our CRM and IC businesses. We are strengthening our global position in the EP market through the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire C.R. Bard's EP business, our internal R&D efforts and the recent approval of the Rhythmia platform. We continue to see strong returns in our investments in emerging markets. Our second quarter sales in the BRIC countries grew 29% year-over-year.","Turning to our earnings highlights. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.18, which is above both the high end of our guidance range and Street consensus. In a year-over-year basis, we delivered adjusted EPS growth of 6% while absorbing the full $0.01 impact in the quarter due to the med device tax. We also generated solid cash flow, used $100 million to buy back approximately 12.5 million shares of stock in the quarter.","And so with that, I'll move into the business unit performance for the second quarter. The revenue growth figures that I'll highlight are all in a constant currency basis, so I'll start with the MedSurg businesses.","In Endoscopy, we had another strong quarter with 8% worldwide revenue growth. We experienced consistent growth across all of the Endoscopy franchises. Our hemostasis franchise led the way driven by continued global adoption of our Resolution Clip for GI bleeding. Our biliary device franchise grew faster than market fueled by our Endoscopic Ultrasound platform. And the recent launch of the true tone biliary access device. And again, our metal stent franchise growth was primarily driven by our industry-leading WallFlex platform.","In addition, our Alair Bronchial Thermoplasty platform is building momentum. We continue to see an increase in size during the quarter, exceeding 300 centers across 23 countries. And during second quarter, the 5-year data from the Air2 clinical trial represented confirming that Alair continues to show therapy benefits in adult patients with severe uncontrolled asthma.","BT was shown to provide long-term asthma control demonstrated by a sustained reduction in the heart -- in the rate of severe exacerbations in emergency visits over a 5-year period treatment. So we anticipate publications of 5-year safety and efficacy data during the third quarter of '13, and we continue to execute a focused coding coverage and payment strategy.","So turning to Urology\/Women's Health. We achieved modest growth in the quarter with solid growth in Urology, offset by a challenging pelvic organ prolapse market in Women's Health. In Urology, we delivered solid international growth resulting from our global commercial expansion and new product launches. In the Women's Health, we did successfully launch 2 new products in the U.S. during the quarter, and we do expect the Women's Health division to return to growth in the second half of '13 given the refreshed pipeline and the anniversary of the pelvic organ prolapse market decline in comparable.","So Neuromodulation. Our team continues to execute extremely well. We gained market share during the quarter and firmly established ourselves as the #2 global player in the neuromodulation market. We delivered an impressive growth of 21% on a worldwide basis, driven by a positive physician response to our recently launched Precision Spectra Spinal Cord Stimulation platform. It is really the highly innovative, next-generation Spinal Cord Stimulator that's designed to deliver more coverage and provide a new level of flexibility and advanced control. It's a great example of our internal innovation that enables us to provide differentiated technology to our patients.","In Deep Brain Stimulation, we recently reported interim data though from the European VANTAGE study that demonstrated significant improvements in motor scores of approximately 60% in patients with Parkinson's disease using the Vercise platform at 6 months. We also commenced enrollment in INTREPID, which is our pivotal U.S. clinical trial for use of Vercise in Parkinson's disease and launched the GUIDE DBS system in Europe.","Let's now move into Interventional Cardiology. While our worldwide IC results for the second quarter improved and we maintained our global share position, we still have work to do in this important area. Our worldwide IC revenues declined 3% in a market that we estimate declining in the low to mid-single digits. We did deliver sequential revenue improvement in the second quarter, driven by operational growth in the international markets. While we expect the global market headwinds to persist, we continue to believe the market will moderate over time due to underlying patient demographics and the proliferation of differentiated premium technologies such as our SYNERGY Stent platform.","In Europe and Asia, our IC growth was driven by the successful execution of new launches. In mid-second quarter, we launched Promus PREMIER in Europe. Customer feedback has been very positive, and our European team has been successful on using the product to open up new accounts. Data from the first human use trial was presented at late-breaking trial at EuroPCR in May. And the results reflected the outstanding outcomes we continue to demonstrate in our robust PLATINUM clinical trial program.","We also anticipate U.S. FDA approval for Promus PREMIER in the fourth quarter of 2013. Our next-generation SYNERGY Stent also continues to perform very well. The limited launch we began in Europe has been progressing according to plan, and we're expanding it in anticipation of a full European launch in 2014.","Enrollment in the SYNERGY U.S. IDE trial is tracking ahead of schedule, and we expect to complete enrollment in the third quarter 2013. We believe we have stabilized our DES share and expect to grow DES share in the second half through a continued focus on commercial execution, a strengthened overall IC portfolio and the continued favorable clinical evidence of our DES platforms.","In our core IC business, we improved our performance with worldwide sales growth of 3%. We recently received clearance of our Guidezilla Guide Extension Catheter and OptiCross. We also accelerated the commercial rollout of BridgePoint Medical suite of coronary CTO devices. We expect this growth in our core IC business to continue, as we expand our commercial rollout of these new products in the second half of the year.","So now a quick update on our TAVR program. We presented the 30-day results on the first 60 patients from our REPRISE II CE Mark trial at the EuroPCR in May. We met our primary endpoint, and we believe that the results affirm the clinical advantages of the second-generation platform, including both precise control and very low paravalvular leakage rates due to its unique Adaptive Seal and differentiated positioning capabilities. We continue to anticipate CE Mark and commercialization of Lotus in the fourth quarter of 2013. And we're in discussions now with the FDA to finalize plans for our U.S. IDE trial, which we look forward to starting in mid-2014 subject to FDA approval.","Now I'll turn to our PI business, our Peripheral Intervention division. This division continues to deliver consistent above-market results, and the second quarter global revenues grew 5%. Sales of our leading stent balloon platforms were particularly strong in national markets. We're advancing our core PI pipeline, including our drug-eluting balloon platform in Europe, which we expect to launch in 2014.","In addition, we're excited about international launch of the Vessix Renal Denervation System, which came several months earlier than planned. While we're very early in the launch, the feedback from customers have been encouraging. At EuroPCR, we reported the interim results from the Vessix REDUCE-HTN clinical trial, and the interim results showed a significant and sustained reduction in the blood pressure of patients treated with the Vessix out to one year. We look forward to continued progress, as we drive toward the expected start of the U.S. IDE trial for the Vessix platform in first quarter of '14.","So let me turn to our Rhythm Management segment. We're encouraged by the improved performance of this business. In the second quarter, our worldwide CRM revenues declined 2%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. We believe the worldwide CRM markets continue to be a challenge, but they have stabilized in the negative low to mid-single digits versus prior year.","In our defib business, we estimate our worldwide second quarter market share remain stable despite the impact of the S-ICD supply constraints. These results were driven by the continued momentum of our ICD de novo share, improved performance across our replacement business and continued elevated lead purport ratios. Our CRT-D share remains under pressure. However, we believe we are on track to launch our quad lead in Europe in the first quarter of 2014.","Regarding the launch of the S-ICD. As discussed in the first quarter, our sales outpaced our ability to supply the market, and we've seen significant supply constraints since March. We continue to manage this with our customers, and we're making progress toward resuming our controlled S-ICD launch in late third quarter. In addition, we expect that our GEN 1.5 device will become available in the fourth quarter to further address the increasing global demand for this highly differentiated therapy.","Turning now to our pacer business. We are now at our 1-year anniversary of the launch of our INGENIO family of pacemakers, and we're through our first full quarter of LATITUDE, which we believe will continue to drive pacer share gains in the quarter with growth of 1% on a worldwide basis and 7% in the U.S. We're pleased with the performance of this platform, which includes a number of new design features, including wireless RF telemetry and LATITUDE NXT Remote Patient Management system with cellular capabilities.","Now turning to Left Atrial Appendage Closure. The WATCHMAN product line continues to show strong growth in international markets on both a sequential and a year-over-year basis with international revenues in implants growing by more than 50% compared to the second quarter last year. We submit the final PMA module to the FDA in May and expect U.S. approval in second quarter '14.","Our long-term PROTECT-AF 4-year follow-up data presented to the HRS showed the WATCHMAN device was statistically superior to warfarin for preventing cardiovascular death, all-cause stroke and systemic embolization, as well as all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality. We continue to be encouraged by the long-term efficacy data from PROTECT-AF coupled with safety results of PREVAIL and CAP, which provide strong evidence that the WATCHMAN is a viable alternative to chronic warfarin for stroke reduction in non-valvular AF patients.","And finally, we continue to the make progress in expanding the capabilities of our global EP business. The Rhythmia EP mapping and navigation system achieved CE Mark approval in late second quarter and FDA clearance just earlier this week. We expect the U.S. launch along with the new steerable sheath and ablation catheter in the back half of the year.","As mentioned earlier, we're excited about entering into a definitive agreement to acquire Bard's EP. This business generated sales of about $110 million in 2012, and we expect it to be accretive to BSE in 2014. We believe that Bard EP will strengthen our global commercial footprint and further enhance our emerging EP product offering by adding strong base of diagnostic catheters, other diagnostic tools and EP recording systems to our portfolio. We're confident this transaction will improve our ability to better serve the global EP market. So we look forward to welcoming the new Bard EP team to Boston Scientific, and we estimate the closing of this transaction in the fourth quarter pending the completion of regulatory approval processes and other customary conditions.","So to wrap this section up, overall, we're pleased with our second quarter results and the momentum we're beginning to build. We return to growth on an operational basis in the second quarter, while we're making progress on our strategic growth imperatives. Our MedSurg and PI businesses continue to grow faster than market. We're beginning to improve our global execution in both the IC and CRM markets. We're aiming to grow IC and CRM share in the second half of '13 with continued focus on sales execution, a differentiated portfolio and an improved S-ICD supply chain.","We're expanding globally as demonstrated by our overall growth in international revenue and growth of nearly 30% in the BRIC countries. We're also focused in delivering meaningful innovation to our customers, and our pipeline reflects this core value. We're advancing our efforts to expand in the high-growth adjacencies. Our long-term PROTECT-AF data demonstrated the WATCHMAN device is statistically superior to warfarin, including all-cause mortality. We are advancing our Lotus Valve program, including a favorable 30-day data from REPRISE II CE Mark trial, and we anticipate CE Mark approval later this year.","The interim data from the REDUCE-HTN clinical trial showed positive results, and we're able to launch our Vessix Renal Denervation platform from in Europe earlier than planned. We're continuing to focus on continuous improvement, while we drive our previously outlined productivity and restructuring programs in order to fund our journey and to improve our operating margins.","We expect to continue generating strong cash flow, which enables to fund more share repurchase in the second half and to evaluate appropriate acquisitions to improve our future growth profile. In terms of third quarter guidance, we anticipate a normal seasonality, but we do expect year-over-year revenue performance to accelerate. For the third quarter, we're providing a sales guidance of positive 1% to positive 4% growth on an operational basis and adjusted EPS from $0.14 to $0.16 per share. For the full year of '13 guidance, we anticipate delivering sequential quarterly year-over-year revenue improvement. For the full year, we are increasing both our sales and adjusted EPS guidance. The full year '13 sales guidance is a range of flat to positive 2% growth on an operational basis and adjusted EPS of $0.67 to $0.71 per share.","Finally, I really want to thank our employees for their winning spirits and their commitment to Boston Scientific. So now let me turn our call over to Jeff for a more detailed review of our second quarter financials.","Jeffrey D. Capello","Thanks, Mike. Let me begin by providing some overall perspective on the quarter before getting into the details. We generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.18, which was above the higher end of our guidance range of $0.14 to $0.17 and above consensus. This represents improved profitability from the prior year, which is primarily driven by continued gross margin expansion including a $0.01 benefit associated with an adjustment related to our PROMUS profit share agreement, lower operating expense and fewer shares outstanding. This was partially offset by increased investments in our strategic growth initiatives and a $0.01 impact from the medical device tax. In addition, we generated adjusted free cash flow of $388 million and used $100 million to repurchase of approximately 12.5 million more shares in the quarter.","Now I'll move to the detailed review of our business performance and operating results in the quarter. For the second quarter 2013, consolidated revenue of $1,809,000,000 represents a decrease of 1% on a reported basis. And excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the divested Neurovascular business, we grew the business 2% this quarter. The actual headwind from foreign exchange on sales was approximately $40 million as compared to the prior year and was $10 million higher than what we had assumed in our second quarter guidance range.","In Interventional Cardiology, worldwide revenue came in at $520 million in the second quarter, representing a constant currency decrease of 3% compared to the second quarter of 2012. Total international IC revenue grew by 4% with the Europe and Asia Pacific each growing 5%, including China and India growing by 75% and 41%, respectively, all on a constant currency basis.","Worldwide DES revenue came in at $287 million in the second quarter, representing a constant currency decrease of 7% compared to the second quarter of last year. U.S. DES revenue was $117 million in the quarter, representing a decline of 16% compared to the second quarter of last year. This decrease was primarily due to lower share due to competitive products, softness in PCI volumes and lower ASPs. We estimate that our U.S. DES share was stable sequentially in the mid-30s for the second quarter.","International DES sales of $170 million remained flat in constant currency compared to the second quarter of last year, driven by over 60% growth in the emerging markets of China and India, primarily offset by pricing declines in Europe. Worldwide non-stent Interventional Cardiology was up 3% in constant currency. With the recent launches of several new products along with the ongoing success of our BridgePoint Medical suite of CTO devices, we expect to see continued improvement in this business over the course of 2013.","Now moving on to CRM. Worldwide revenue was $475 million in the second quarter, representing a constant currency decrease of 2% compared to the second quarter of last year. In the U.S., CRM revenue of $282 million was down 1% as compared to the second quarter of last year. International CRM sales of $193 million were down 3% in consent currency compared to the prior year quarter. On a worldwide basis, defib sales were $342 million in the second quarter, which was down 3% in constant currency from last year. In the U.S., defib sales were $213 million, this was down 3% compared to the second quarter of last year. International defib sales of $129 million represented a 3% decrease in constant currency from Q2 of last year.","Worldwide pacer sales increased 1% on a constant currency basis as compared to Q2 2012, driven by continued strong performance from our INGENIO family of pacemakers and CRTP devices. In the U.S., pacer revenue of $69 million was up 7% compared to Q2 last year, while international revenue declined 4% in constant currency for the quarter. Additionally, our worldwide Electrophysiology business remained relatively flat on a constant currency basis compared to Q2 last year.","Our Peripheral Interventions business delivered growth above the market with worldwide revenue up 5% in constant currency compared to Q2 2012. Global growth was driven by stents, balloons and renal denervation. Our Endoscopy business continue to grow faster than the market and had another solid quarter with worldwide sales up 8% in constant currency led by 11% revenue growth internationally. In constant currency, our worldwide Urology\/Women's Health business had growth of 1% in the quarter. However, sales growth was particularly strong internationally at 7% compared to the second quarter of last year.","Our Urology business maintained a leadership position with 3% worldwide constant currency growth in the quarter, driven by strong international revenue growth of 5%. Our Women's Health revenues declined 6% on a worldwide constant currency basis as compared to the prior year. However, our international business delivered 6% growth on a year-over-year basis. We continue to see pressure on elective procedures due to concerns around the use of surgical mesh for pelvic organ prolapse, specifically in the U.S. market. However, we expect this market to begin to stabilize as we move past the second anniversary of the July 2001 FDA safety notification.","Our Neuromodulation business delivered a solid 21% worldwide sales growth, driven by strong market uptake of the Precision Spectra Spinal Cord Stimulation system and very strong commercial execution strategies. We expect to build on this momentum in the second half of 2013 when we expect Precision Spectra to be fully launched.","Now moving on to sales. Adjusted gross profit margin for the second quarter was 70.8% or 230 basis points higher than the second quarter of last year. The increase was largely attributable to benefits from our value improvement programs and a onetime benefit of approximately 90 basis points associated with an adjustment related to our PROMUS profit share agreement. These benefits were partially offset by price erosion and product mix. Looking forward, we expect adjusted gross margins to be between 69% and 70% for the second half the year.","Adjusted SG&A expense were $650 million or 35.9% of sales in the second quarter of 2013 compared to $641 million or 35.1% in the second quarter 2012. During Q2 2013, the impact of our cost-saving programs were offset by continued investments in our strategic growth initiatives and costs associated with expanding in emerging markets. In addition, SG&A expenses in Q2 2013 include the impact of approximately 100 basis points from the medical device tax under the U.S. Affordable Care Act. Currently, the accounting treatment for the medical device tax is not consistently applied across the industry. We expect to absorb the first full year impact of the medical device tax during 2013.","Looking ahead, we expect adjusted SG&A as a percent of sales to be between 36.5% and 37.5% in the third quarter this year, as we expect to continue investing in our strategic growth initiatives in preparation for the commercialization of several new technology platforms and build our capabilities in emerging markets. Adjusted research and development expenses were $223 million for the second quarter or 12.3% of sales. This compares to $213 million in the second quarter of 2012. We expect R&D spending to be in the range of 12% to 13% of sales in the third quarter this year, as we continue to transform our R&D organization and refocus our spending to drive innovation and growth.","Royalty expense was $47 million or 2.6% of sales compared to $48 million in the second quarter of last year. Consistent with the prior year, we expect royalty expense to step down in the second half, as we reach lower per unit royalty rate tiers on our annual volume-based arrangements. On adjusted basis, pretax operating income was $361 million or 20% of sales, up 70 basis points from the second quarter of last year. The increase in adjusted operating margins was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins, partially offset by an increase in R&D expense and the impact of the medical device tax. It is important to note that the medical device tax negatively impacted our operating margins by 100 basis points this quarter.","GAAP operating income, which includes GAAP to adjusted items that had a net negative effect of $141 million on a pretax basis, was $220 million in the second quarter of 2013. The primary GAAP to adjusted items in the quarter were: pretax restructuring charges of $31 million, pretax intangible asset impairment charges of $53 million, pretax acquisition and divestiture-related credits of $44 million, and pretax amortization expense of $101 million.","Now I'll move on to other income expense. Interest expense was $65 million in the second quarter, which was similar to the second quarter of last year. Our average interest expense rate in Q2 '13 was 5.7% or about 30 basis points higher than the second quarter of last year. Our tax rate for the second quarter was 14.3% on a reported basis and 15.8% on an adjusted basis. The difference between our reported and adjusted tax rates for the quarter is attributable to charges excluding determining our non-GAAP results. We estimate our Q2 adjusted tax rate will be similar to Q2 and will be lower in Q4 to arrive at a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 12% to 13%. This excludes any other discrete tax items that may arise during the year.","Moving on to the balance sheet. DSO of 64 days increased 2 days compared to June of 2012, primarily due to lower collections in EMEA, particularly in Southern Europe. Despite lower inventory levels, days inventory on hand of 144 days was up 3 days compared to June of last year due to lower cost of goods sold, primarily driven by the favorable PROMUS profit share adjustment and the impact of foreign exchange.","Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $388 million compared to $386 million in the second quarter of last year. Capital expenditures were $51 million in Q2 '13 compared to $52 million in Q2 '12. We continue to expect our full year 2013 adjusted free cash flow to be approximately $1.2 billion.","Turning to share repurchases. We repurchased 12.5 million shares for the quarter for approximately $100 million. Since July 2011, we have now repurchased $212 million or approximately 14% of our outstanding shares. We currently have $960 million of capacity remaining under our share repurchase authorization. We continue to believe that our stock price is undervalued, and we currently expect to continue our share repurchase program in 2013 subject to business development opportunities, market conditions, our stock price, regulatory trading windows and other factors.","Let me now walk you through our guidance for the third quarter, as well as updated guidance for the full year. As we look ahead over the remainder of the year, we expect pricing pressure and procedural softness in the U.S. to persist but moderate as the IC and CRM markets continue to stabilize. We have launched many new key products in most of our businesses and continue to make solid progress on our strategic growth initiatives. We return to growth on an operational basis in the second quarter, and we remain focused on accelerating top line growth in the second half of 2013. We also believe, despite the medical device tax, that we continue to have opportunities to enhance profitability and expect to continue to generate very strong cash flow.","We expect Q3 consolidated revenues to be in a range of $1,700,000,000 to $1,760,000,000. If current foreign exchange rates hold constant, the headwind from FX should be approximately $30 million or around 180 basis points relative to Q3 2012. On an operational basis, we expect consolidated Q3 sales to be in the range of up 1% to up 4% compared to Q3 last year. On a worldwide basis, we expect DES revenue to be in the range of $265 million to $285 million and CRM revenue to be in a range of $445 million to $465 million in the third quarter.","We expect Q3 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $0.14 to $0.16 per share, and we encourage you to model to the midpoint. We expect reported GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.03 to $0.05 per share, which includes an estimated $0.06 per share impact from amortization expense. We also wanted to remind folks that historically Q3 has been our lowest quarter due primarily to seasonality, typically lower the second quarter, and we expect Q4 to be our strongest quarter given seasonality and the timing of some of our expected new and expanded product launches.","Now moving the full year. We now estimated that consolidated 2013 sales will be between $7,050,000,000 and $7,170,000,000. Assuming that current foreign exchange rates hold constant, we expect the full year headwind from FX to be approximately $145 million. On an operational basis, consolidated sales should be in the range of flat to up 2%, and we encourage you once again to model to the midpoint.","The range assumes that the IC and CRM markets continue to stabilize and our revenue performance improved sequentially throughout the year, driven primarily by improved performance in our IC and CRM businesses, more meaningful contribution from the emerging markets and our strategic growth initiatives plus benefits of new and\/or expanded product launches across our divisions.","From an earnings standpoint, we're moving up our guidance and expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2013 now to be in the range of $0.67 to $0.71. And once again, we encourage you to model to the midpoint of the range. This range takes into consideration an estimated impact of approximately $0.04 per share from the medical device tax.","On a reported GAAP basis, we expect EPS for the year to be a net loss in the range of $0.01 to $0.07 per share, primarily driven by the goodwill impairment charge we recorded in the first quarter. Please note that today's guidance does not include the impact of the recently announced agreement to acquire the Electrophysiology business of C.R. Bard.","That's it for guidance. With that, I'll turn it back over to Michael, who will moderate the Q&A. Michael?","Michael Campbell","Thanks, Jeff. Greg, let's open it up to questions for the next 20 minutes or so.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two questions on the stent side. By our modeling, it looks like stent share both U.S. and globally has finally stabilized, and I'm wondering what this is a function of. Is it a function of just Resolute Integrity of the trial ending there? Is it Promus PREMIER? I'm kind of wondering if it's all the new products that you're launching into the cath lab like CTO that's just driving overall momentum. So if you could give us some additional color? And on a separate note, what would the impact of Germany be going forward?","Michael F. Mahoney","Mike Mahoney here. Thanks for the question. I think in terms of the overall worldwide DES market, we see the kind of market in the low single digits in terms of our performance, and again, choose the market, we see the price volume in the kind of 7% to 8% range and price impact for the overall market in the low single -- mid-single digits. In terms of our performance with the DES market, we're very encouraged by our European performance. So in Europe, we're launching our new platforms. So we have SYNERGY, and we also have Promus PREMIER. And we actually had growth both in Europe and in the Asia-Pac markets for the first time in a number of years. That's an encouraging trend as we grow share in Europe, and also, those products will be coming to the U.S. And they also reflect the broader portfolio strategy that we have in our other IC businesses with our CTO devices that you mentioned and also the additional platforms that we're launching in IVUS. So we're encouraged by the momentum we're seeing outside the U.S. where we're launching our first products. And in the U.S., we've essentially stabilized our share, and we are benefiting from the annualization of the comparables of the launches that you mentioned earlier.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then just...","Jeffrey D. Capello","Glenn, just let me just jump in for a minute to add to what Mike had said. I think the other dynamic that's really starting to benefit is the emerging markets. We've talked about investing aggressively in areas like India and China and some of the other areas. And those areas are growing very well. So if you look at kind of Asia Pacific as a whole, we are probably up mid-single digits plus within DES. So we continue to believe, depending on kind of what happens from a pricing perspective, that the unit growth kind of the emerging markets, subject to kind of pricing results is really going to help the market and us disproportionately as we start to get more of our fair share of the market share in those areas.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Is this what's helping offset the loss of sales in Germany in the second half of the year?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Well, I guess a couple of comments on the German side. So the German market, we had made some conscious decisions based on pricing and based on our portfolio, which we think is differentiated, not to place heavily in Germany this year, and a lot of that's price driven. As a result, our inability to sell in Germany hasn't impacted as much as people may have thought. And in a previous exchange, somebody had asked me how big could Germany be, and I think we kind of landed that it's less than $40 million for the full year. So we're able to grow through that. And of course, we think that our intellectual property position is well positioned, and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves and try to get that appealed in reverse. So despite the impact on Germany, which is not really that significant, the business is performing pretty well.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And can I just ask one question to Dr. Dawkins on SYNERGY? I get a lot of pushback on SYNERGY relative to Absorb with investors asking is SYNERGY just kind of an incremental gain overcurrent DES and why would a doc put in SYNERGY when you could put in Absorb that'll fully disappear. So SYNERGY is in Europe, and I'm wondering if Dr. Dawkins can give us some feedback on how the doctors are viewing SYNERGY. Is it a slight incremental benefit or gain from a technology standpoint over current DES? Or are they viewing this as a major leap forward?","Keith D. Dawkins","I think the majority of physicians still put acute performance top of their list of metrics when they judge the stent. And obviously, with the modified Element platform, the key performance of SYNERGY, we're very -- we like a lot as do the physicians. They also like the concept of the polymer and the drug disappearing at the 3 months time point. And that obviously is not the case for the BBS as you brought up, where the stent struts and therefore, the polymer is still visible in many patients for 2 to 3 years. So that allows us to explore formally short DAPT. And we know that the overall cost of a DES procedure relates more to the medication than the stent itself. And we -- there is no study currently that is sufficiently par to formally explore short DAPT and the impact of stent thrombosis, bleeding and the financial consequences. And we're going to explore that formally. We have more than 14,000 patients planned for enrollments in registries and randomized trials looking at SYNERGY in a variety of complex patient subsets, and this clinical portfolio will support the SYNERGY launch in a wide variety of patients. So we think doctors like a acute key performance. They like the drug and polymer disappearing early. And we will confirm that in a number of important clinical trials.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Wise from Stifel.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Jeff, can you talk a little bit more about gross margin? It was especially strong, above 70%. I appreciate there are a lot of moving pieces, but can you give us -- help us understand a little more carefully the 90-basis-point positive adjustment for PROMUS agreement? A couple of things, is that a onetime thing? Is that going to be with us in some way in the future? And can you sustain gross margin at the 70%-plus level? Are we at a new high level sustainably going forward? How do we think about it?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes, thanks, Rick. So let me take you through kind of a bridge, and as part of that, I'll pick up your question on the Abbott true-up. So I would say the midpoint of our guidance range for gross margins for the quarter was about 68.5%. We guided from 68% to 69%, so 60.5% -- 68.5%. So we're a couple of hundred basis points higher than we guided to. Clearly, one impact is the true-up of the Abbott supply arrangement. So as, I think, most people know, we were procuring PROMUS from Abbott, and we estimated our price from them, the cost of the device, and we had an arrangement, where on a retrospective basis, they looked at their actual cost base, we true it up, kind of our estimate to the actual. So we've now done, in this quarter, the final true-up. In that final true-up, we had a benefit of roughly 90 basis points flow through our gross margin. That's a onetime benefit. It would not recur going forward. So there's a 90-basis-point benefit in the gross margins for the second quarter we do not expect to recur. So that explains a little bit of why the margins were a little bit stronger. However, the other hundred basis points plus was pretty good news for the business, and this really comes into us in 3 different areas: One, we had better performance in the manufacturing side, stronger delivery of our value improvement programs. If you remember back at the Investor Day we want to take out at least 5% of the standard cost. Our manufacturing group delivered, and I think that was very strong performance. We also had the benefit of building some inventories relative to some of the product launches that we helped, that helped us. So part of that survives going forward. Part of that is kind of a onetime benefit. Pricing actually was better this quarter, both pricing and mix. The pricing dynamics continue to get better. There's still a challenge, but they get better. And as we continue to introduce new technology in the marketplace, it's more a mix benefit than a price benefit. We do better from a price perspective. And then mix, overall, helped us. That's the third factor. So I think as we look going forward, I think our guidance for the second half was 69% to 70%. I would hope it would be kind of at the midpoint, if not, the higher end of that, and I think we've got some momentum going into 2014.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. And turning -- second question on the subcu. Mike, you talked about the subcutaneous ICD, and your supply constraints went by a little fast for me. I want to make sure I understood. By the late third quarter, you'll be fully supplied. And did I hear you correctly? Fourth quarter GEN 1.5 launches. But just, in general, can you help us understand when will the subcutaneous ICD be fully rolled out and available to whoever wants it? And it sounds like that 4Q GEN 1.5 is a little faster, if I understood you, than we thought before?","Michael F. Mahoney","Sure. In third quarter, we'll be reentering the U.S. with S-ICD, primarily with our IDE sites, so we'll begin shipment again of S-ICD, call, late third quarter. And by fourth quarter, we'll be able to ramp up more significantly and also expand our commercial presence in the U.S. and globally beyond our trial centers. So if this ramp up in the third quarter, in the fourth quarter we'll be able to drive significant more supply than the marketplace. And also in fourth quarter, we'll launch our 1.5 release, which would further enable greater capabilities for supply going into 2014 and improve the cost profile of the platform.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So full rollout, Mike, again, you think is going to take another 6 or 12 months beyond that? Or how do we think about that?","Michael F. Mahoney","Well, we won't be supply constrained as we head into the fourth quarter. So in third quarter, we'll begin launching S-ICD again. We will not be supply constrained as we move into the fourth quarter and into 2014.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Jeff, maybe a quick question for you and then a follow-up for Mike. But one of the interesting things is the segment margins this quarter. I think if you adjust for PROMUS, it looks like the standout this quarter was MedSurg operating margin expansion. Maybe help us understand what's the continued strength in MedSurg margins now I think up over 30%. And then the interesting thing is CRM margin's obviously a focus for investors. CRM did a lot better this quarter guiding to improving in the back half. What are sort of the catalysts for CRM margin improvement? And what's that balance between top line's getting better, but you're still investing in that business?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Okay, David, thank you. So yes, as you look -- dig into the press release, our MedSurg margins went 27.6% up to 32% so pretty impressive performance within a quarter. One thing to recognize in the MedSurg business is you've got some larger businesses like Endoscopy that are fairly profitable that we're doing very well that can continue to increase the profitability. But Neuromodulation is a business that, as it grows pretty quickly, has significant leverage from a bottom line perspective because not currently at our average operating margins, but it's coming up pretty quickly. So I think what should continue to happen here in this year and into the future is as Neuromodulation continues to grow and we feel very good about the trajectory within the SCS the Spinal Cord Stimulation and the DBS side, that will grow and operating profit will grow much more quickly. So that'll help the margins, as well Endoscopy and certainly, Urology\/Women's Health is opportunity to expand the margins as well. So there's certainly opportunity to push up the margins of the MedSurg, feel pretty good about that. On the CRM side, the margins were down year-over-year, same story as kind of the first quarter. Really, what you see there is investment. Investment in areas like Rhythmia and Cameron are weighing a little bit on the margins as our investments in the EP business, which is lumped in at Rhythm Management. What we do expect though is, over the next 5 years, that 600 basis points that we keep talking about a margin expansion for the whole company, CRM will disproportionately benefit from that because they've got a number of investment programs. What you're seeing so far is all the OpEx. You're not seeing a lot of sales. And as we get back in the market with CRM, as we now have FDA approval for Rhythmia and we have CE Mark, 2014 should be the inflection point from a growth perspective in terms of picking up a lot of sales at pretty good profit margins. And so now you'll have the sales growth with a little bit less OpEx. That's a pretty good equation for us. The other dynamic is we have restructuring programs that we've been running that we updated people on at the end of last year, and certainly, CRM will benefit from those as well.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, very helpful and very clear, Jeff. And then, Mike, in terms of the AF opportunity, we didn't get much time about this at the Analyst Day because that business has really come together in the last several months. So as it sits today, including the recently acquired asset, how do you see the addressable market for AF? And can you give us any sense about when is it appropriate to think about what's the market growth rate and whether Boston should be growing above or below that rate and by when?","Michael F. Mahoney","Well, it's an area we've invested quite heavily in over the last 2 years, and we've done it because we like the size of the market. It's $2.5 billion. It's growing essentially double digits, and there's a tremendous amount of synergy with our CRM business. So we like the market, and we like the synergies with our expanded CRM business, as well as the customer. In terms of the portfolio, we'll have a much more meaningful business as we look at closing the Bard transaction, which hopefully will be fourth quarter. So we'll be approaching the $250 million EP business with much more global scale in terms of our commercial efforts in U.S., Europe and Asia Pac. And a really much -- a well-rounded portfolio with a mapping system, the recording devices, the diagnostic catheters and the therapeutic catheters, we're continuing to develop internally here. So our portfolio really will be highly competitive post the Bard close, one of the much stronger commercial footprint. So we respect there are some very difficult and challenging competitors in that market, but we believe the portfolio we pull together in the team is very innovative and very focused and a lot of synergies to work within our CRM business, so we anticipate ourselves will be improving the drug profile of that business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Let me just follow up quickly, if I could, on the gross margin piece. And, Jeff, could you just walk us through? So you said 90 basis points was the PROMUS catch-up, which we understood. The other, if we looked at last year, so 220 basis points. Could you just break that down maybe how much of that was from as well like FX hedges and how much was from Neurovascular running off? And anything else you can give us, that'd be great.","Jeffrey D. Capello","So if you look from a year-over-year perspective, we're up a couple of hundred basis points from 68.5% to 70.8%. If you look at kind of the impact of -- I'm going to net pricing together with kind of VIP improvements, cost improvements. That was a net benefit of roughly 70 basis points, which is good news for us. That's kind of what we want to see happen, is less pricing pressure and more ability to kind of manage the cost side. It was 100 basis points of -- 90 basis points improvement from the Abbott true-up and about 50 basis points improvement from the Neurovascular divestiture.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And FX impact on gross margin?","Jeffrey D. Capello","FX wasn't that significant. We were -- unlike some of our -- some other people in the sector, we hedged, so the foreign exchange rates don't move us around as much.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then the guidance for the full year, how does FX in the Neurovascular impact the full year? Just trying to find an organic basis here.","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes, so from an FX perspective, we don't expect it to have a big impact in the back half of the year. And then I believe the Neurovascular divestiture, there's a little bit of benefit in the third quarter, and then that's gone.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Could you just talk about the sustainability of 2 businesses, which were very, very strong this quarter? One, Neuromodulation, which we understand with the Precision Spectra launch. And then the other, I look at the Interventional Cardiology business x coronary stents, the business grew 3% reported this quarter. I assume that's like 5% constant currency. And that sort of business, I think, was down 10% in the first quarter, was down 12% last year. So how does it go from down 12%, down 10% to up 5%?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes. So let me start with your last question first. So as you might recall, we kind of targeted investing in the other Interventional Cardiology area a couple of years ago, and it started with kind of looking at our balloons, guidewires, and then the IVUS franchise had been kind of a net share loser for us. And so those are some dynamics that we had that kind of weighed on that side. So what we've done over the past couple of years is we revitalized pretty significantly that segment. We've come up with new balloons, new guidewires, and the other thing we've done is from an IVUS perspective, we come up with our, really our first new catheter in over 10 years and a new software platform, which we really think is going to allow us to reposition that business. And that business was up mid-single digits, and it's a good-sized business for us. So we think we're going to build momentum. And as we talked on the Investor Day, we talked about having FFR capability sometime in '14. So we see that as a good opportunity for us to kind of get back some of the share we have lost. The other dynamic is BridgePoint, the CTO acquisition. That was something we were pretty bullish on that we've been talking about at every public point. We think that really positions us very well to be the provider of choice to treat difficult-to-treat lesions. And we think that's starting to play out, and we think we're going to get more momentum going forward. So credit to the management team and the various individuals running those businesses, this quarter was a strong quarter. We think we can build on that based on all the factors I just listed. The other dynamic I should point out as well is the emerging markets because the emerging markets and this other IC area is a great opportunity for us to kind of continue to grow our share as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Now that the stocks have kind of revalued to more acceptable levels, I think people are looking at some of the longer-term growth drivers that may be somewhat under the radar. So when we -- specifically, with regards to the S-ICD, like what percent of the patients do you feel, who get ICDs today, would have an equivalent shock burden with the S-ICD? And might that make this a 10% to 20% category rather than a 5% to 10% category? And secondly, with regards to Left Atrial Appendage, given the strong superiority result in PROTECT-AF, you guys have pegged the market at around $500 million. Might there be upside to that? And secondly, are you going to need a panel given the compendium of evidence?","Michael F. Mahoney","Bruce, Ken Stein or Dr. Stein here on the phone.","Ken Stein","Yes, I am. Thanks, Mike. Yes, Bruce, I guess, let me deal first with the S-ICD question, and then we can -- Mike, I don't know if you want me or if you want to take the Left Atrial Appendage question. So yes, in terms of the S-ICD, particularly if you're asking about where it fits long term, right, first of all, let's understand this is going to be used for de novo. It's obviously only going to be used in selected cases for patients who reach need for replacement. And within de novo, right, it clearly is not indicated for patients who need CRT, clearly not indicated for patients with a defined brady pacing indication. But we do believe that it over a long term, particularly as we continue technical iterations to the device that this can become the device of choice for remaining patients who really have no defined need to have a lead within the heart. There's accumulating data, data that we presented from MADIT-RIT, data we presented as a late-breaking trial at HRS this year from our ALTITUDE study, really showing that there's no reason on earth to think that in patients without an indication for pacing that there's any long-term outcome benefit to having a lead in the heart, and there are obviously a lot of advantages to not have a lead in the heart. And as we kind of went through our even our early experience with the first launch of the S-ICD, we were frankly taken aback at how quickly that began to get expanded use within just a general primary prevention population and really, how robust the demand was for us. And obviously, the product is only going to continue to improve as we start to iterate next-generation devices. Left Atrial Appendage, Mike, do you want me to take that?","Michael F. Mahoney","Yes, why don't you just comment on the clinical results that were presented and your thoughts on the approval timelines.","Ken Stein","Yes. So we were -- really couldn't be happier with the long-term 4-year results PROTECT-AF study of the WATCHMAN Device. And I think being able to show for the first time that this is now not only equivalent in outcomes to use of warfarin, but actually is superior to warfarin, both in terms of preventing strokes and also, obviously, at least as important, in improving all-cause mortality, as well as cardiovascular mortality. And we do believe that, that should have an impact on both the pace at which technology will be adopted, where it's proved today and assuming that it does get U.S. approval, as well as I think the role that implanting physicians or referring physicians are going to see for this as an alternative to drug therapy. In terms of timelines, as we've said, we've already submitted to the FDA. It's always hard to predict where FDA is going to be. We're looking towards approval in the first half next year and obviously waiting to hear whether FDA is going to make this go to another panel or not.","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess, Mike, just as a follow-up. I mean, is there upside to that $500 million that you've kind of roughly scaled the market at?","Michael F. Mahoney","We believe so. We've taken the market view on S-ICD up to about $750 million. So we'll be back in the market in full in the fourth quarter, and we do see upside longer term in S-ICD. But also just let me just expand more broadly on your question on the growth profile. Think of 3 major buckets, and Jeff outlined our performance in our MedSurg, Cross, Neuromodulation, PI and Endoscopy. We're growing plus 7%, and we have a number of new product launches, and you see the momentum there in the second half. The second piece is the improving performance of our IC and CRM businesses. And you touched on S-ICD and WATCHMAN. And then these adjacencies, we received, quite frankly, better-than-expected clinical results with TAVR, hypertension, S-ICD in the second quarter. And then the expanding impact of our emerging markets. So those 4 elements really deliver a lot of muscle to the long-term strategic plan that we outlined at Investor Day and give us great confidence in that, as well as the operational -- operating margin improvement opportunities that Jeff outlined.","Michael Campbell","Greg, we're coming close to the hour, so we have time for one more question.","Operator","Okay. That question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just 2 questions for me. First, mike, it would be helpful to hear from you your M&A focus at this point. You did a lot of technology deals over the past few years, and the Bard deal was bit of a departure for you. And then I had one follow-up question for Dr. Dawkins.","Michael F. Mahoney","Sure. Our M&A strategy, we're always looking for the right opportunities, and as you mentioned, we've done a number of earlier-stage deals in 2012. And those were pointed at faster-growing markets. We're also in markets, the synergies with our existing Boston Scientific business that we can leverage and ultimately, deliver a faster growth profile for the company. And we're really in the middle of the investment phase of those acquisitions and we believe they'll have a growing impact on our revenue and ROI towards the back half of '13 and in '14. So the EP deal, we want to clearly balance our acquisitions. They all want to be in fast-growing markets where we drive synergies. But we'll continue to look for properties like C.R. Bard EP business, where we have quite a bit of leverage with our existing EP business in Rhythm Management area. It complements our businesses, and it would be accretive in 2014. So we'll continue to look for that right balance but ideally seek revenue-seeking opportunities that are accretive to the company.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And Dr. Dawkins, this year, you talked about the controlled rollout of SYNERGY in Europe; next year, the full launch. You've talked about developing some clinical data to show the need for less or shorter dual anti-platelet therapy. Could you give us an update on where you are generating that data, when we might see that and when we might see that data?","Keith D. Dawkins","Thanks, Larry. We've got a number of clinical trials, some that have already started. Some registries, some comparing SYNERGY with other platforms. And obviously, as you well know for the clinical outcomes with clinical endpoints, you usually need to wait 9 to 12 months following the completion of the trial. But we have also invested in some OCT studies where we'll get an earlier endpoint in terms of strut coverage of SYNERGY about the low [ph] and in comparison with other DES. We're encouraged also with the fast recruitments in EVOLVE II. That's the IDE trial, as you know, comparing SYNERGY with PROMUS Element. And we anticipate,, as Mike said, the completion of EVOLVE II in the third quarter this year ahead of schedule. So I think unlike some of the other platforms that we've discussed earlier, we have randomized trial data, and we have large randomized trial, and of course, that on the background of the EVOLVE versus PROMUS trial with just under 30 -- just under 300 patients randomized. So we're building steadily a data set to support SYNERGY, both at the experimental level, at preclinical level and obviously, the clinical level. And so within the next 6 to 12 months, we'll have increasing amounts of data to support SYNERGY worldwide.","Michael Campbell","Okay. With that, we would like to conclude the call.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to your host, Susan Lisa. Please go ahead.","Susan Lisa","Thanks, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q3 2019 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release, as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financials and Filings.","The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Mike will provide strategic and revenue highlights of Q3 2019. Dan will review the financials for the quarter and then provide Q4 2019 and full-year 2019 guidance, and then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Ian Meredith and Dr. Ken Stein.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that, on the call, operational revenue excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and organic revenue further excludes the impact of certain acquisitions, including NxThera, Claret, Augmenix, Vertiflex and BTG in the relevant periods for which there are no prior period related net sales.","Also note, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate, and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share, new product approvals and launches, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance, including sales, margins, earnings and other Q4 and full year 2019 guidance, as well as our tax rates, R&D spend, and other expenses.","Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them.","At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike?","Michael Mahoney","Thank you, Susie. Good morning, everyone. Boston Scientific delivered a very strong third quarter. We continued to grow above market and improve profitability, while we also invest for the long term and deliver meaningful innovation to address unmet patient needs.","In the third quarter, our team delivered 14.2% operational and 9.3% organic revenue growth, with another quarter of strong balance across our businesses and geographic regions. ","In addition, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.39, which is the high-end of our guidance range, while generating $526 million in adjusted free cash flow.","We're also narrowing our guidance for the full year 2019 organic revenue growth to approximately 7.5% and bringing up the bottom end of our adjusted EPS guidance range to $1.55 to $1.58.","We've also increased our expected contribution from acquisitions from 140 basis points to 360 basis points, resulting in operational revenue growth guidance of 11% to 11.5% for the full year.","I'll now detail some key aspects of our third quarter results and thoughts on our Q4 2019 prospects. All growth rates refer to organic sales growth versus the prior year unless otherwise stated.","MedSurg sales accelerated to 10% organic and 14% operational revenue growth. Endoscopy organic revenue growth of 10% was fueled by the breadth of our portfolio, including multiple launches across several franchises, most notably in infection prevention, therapeutic imaging, biliary and luminal hemostasis product lines.","We also enjoyed double-digit growth across multiple regions. And importantly, we remain on track for a year-end launch of our Exalt-D single-use duodenoscope and we're encouraged by the FDA's communication in September regarding single-use technologies. ","We continue to believe that our therapeutic imaging portfolio represents a significant opportunity in 2020 and beyond, with an incremental $2 billion market opportunity by 2024.","Urology and pelvic health also grew 10% organically and 19% operationally. And I would say this is particularly impressive as the team offset 150 basis point headwind to organic growth from the market withdrawal of transvaginal mesh for the treatment of pelvic organ prolapse.","Double-digit growth organic sales in uro\/PH was led by strong momentum in our core stone where we are uniquely positioned to treat the broadest range of kidney stone cases via our innovative LithoVue, lithotripsy and laser portfolio.","SpaceOAR, which is a hydrogel that temporarily creates space between the prostate and organs at risk during radiotherapy for prostate cancer, contributed 900 basis points of operational revenue growth and went organic in October 1. SpaceOAR continues to deliver excellent results and is tracking $100 million for full year 2019.","In the quarter, NxThera, which offers a unique minimally invasive treatment for BPH, also accelerated our growth and we continue to engage with insurers, physicians and patients to strengthen this exciting platform.","Our rhythm and neuro team group grew 4% in the quarter, which we believe represents above-market growth in CRM at 2%, while EP sales did grow below market at 7% and neuromodulation sales grew 8%.","So, I'll start off with neuromodulation. The neuromodulation sales results of 8% organic and 18% operational growth represents an acceleration versus second quarter despite a challenging 23% comp in Q3 2018. ","In our neuromodulation business, we have developed a strong and diversified portfolio in deep brain stimulation and across the continuum of care for pain patients via our complementary platforms in SCS, RF and Vertiflex.","In DBS, our Vercise platform nearly doubled sales year-over-year and is consistently gaining global market share and now offers patients full-body MRI labeling along with our differentiated Cartesia Directional Lead. ","In our pain franchise, our SCS results, which were down low-single digits globally, showed sequential improvement as we're seeing some modest signs of market stabilization.","We aim to deliver continued improvement in SCS in fourth quarter with the launch of WaveWriter software enhancements and then into 2020 with the release of the COMBO randomized clinical trial data on WaveWriter at NANS in January.","The Vertiflex platform represents an important therapy for patients with moderate lumbar stenosis. Vertiflex continues to see growing demand and is on track to deliver full-year 2019 sales of $60 million. And, overall, we're enjoying strong momentum with our category leadership strategy across our neuromodulation portfolio.","Global CRM sales grew 2%. And in defib, global sales continued to grow faster than market and were up low-single digits, driven by our RESONATE platform and replacements, while S-ICD also continued to grow.","Pacer sales declined low-single digits in the quarter which were consistent with second quarter, but we're wrapping up the limited US market release of our new program which should enable an improved implant experience and unique remote service capabilities.","So, looking ahead, we remain on track to launch LUX-Dx, which is our implantable cardiac monitor by midyear 2020.","EP sales grew globally 7%, but, importantly, we received US IDE approval in late September to begin the clinical trial of POLARx single-shot cryotherapy and we plan to initiate enrollment before year-end. We're targeting the year-end launch of POLARx and excited to enter this large vascular and single shot market with this next gen cryo platform.","Shifting now to cardiovascular. The group sales were up a strong 13%. Peripheral intervention sales increased 8%, led by continued momentum across our arterial, venous and interventional oncology platforms. ","The launch of our VICI venous stent is going very well and global Eluvia results were consistent with our previous commentary at TCT in September.","On August 19, we closed the BTG transaction and welcomed the team to Boston Scientific. Sales of legacy BTG interventional grew high-single digit in third quarter and we're very pleased with the integration process thus far and expect this business to deliver double-digit growth in 2020.","We're focused on adding additional commercial capabilities, initiating product registrations in Europe and Asia, and delivering productivity synergies as previously communicated.","Specialty pharma sales declined in the quarter largely due to rebates and timing of product expirations, and they were slightly above our internal plan as CroFab continues to do well both clinically and in maintaining high market share.","For the third quarter stub period, which is August 19 through September 30, all of BTG is reported separately for both sales and operating income as we integrate operating and reportable segments. ","Our interventional cardiology business accelerated from 5% in the first quarter to 8% in the second quarter and now 15% in the third quarter. This represents strong growth across all regions, led by structural heart sales across all product lines and excellent growth in coronary therapies, up 6% globally.","The diversification of our coronary therapies business continues to deliver results, with mid-teens growth across the board in complex PCI products, while our PCI guidance business, which is IVUS and FFR grew in the mid-20s.","Drug-eluting stent sales were down mid-single digits which is an improvement from first-half trends. And in Europe, we recently launched SYNERGY MEGATRON, which is a purpose-built stent for large proximal vessels. With a mid-2020 US launch targeted, MEGATRON is an important extension of our market-leading SYNERGY platform.","With respect to DBS business, I'd like to comment on some recent concerns regarding the potential impact of the ischemia trial which is scheduled to be presented at AHA on November 16. We won't know the results in ischemia until then, but we believe the impact will be highly manageable in all scenarios, with a potential future dollar impact ranging from slightly positive to negative $40 million. So, I'll leave additional details on this topic for any interest in Q&A where Ian can provide more detailed commentary about the trial design and physician practice.","So, now turning to structural heart. The combined strength of Watchman, Lotus Edge, ACURATE, and Sentinel positions very well to deliver toward the high-end of our guidance of $700 million to $725 million in structural heart revenue in 2019.","Watchman year-over-year growth accelerated from second quarter's rate as the platform continues to build global momentum with physicians and patients. And Watchman recently received reimbursement in Japan and we're building out this new therapy with a focus on opening new accounts and physician training.","We continue to enjoy strong demand for next generation Watchman FLX in Europe and we're enrolling both in the OPTION trial as well as the ASAP-TOO.","The US reimbursement outlook for Watchman remains very positive, with an 8.6% weighted average increase in 2020 Medicare reimbursement. ","So, turning to our catheter business. ACURATE neo sales grew faster than the market in third quarter and the product is now available in 45 countries. We continue to enroll in the ACURATE neo2 IDE trial in the US with a targeted 2021 launch. And we also continue to expect European launch of our next generation ACURATE valve in mid-2020.","And post the Scope I results and prior to the launch of ACURATE neo2 in Europe, we do estimate that ACURATE neo growth will likely slow on a percentage basis, but will likely remain accretive to growth for both IC and BSC overall.","The Lotus Edge launch is going extremely well and we're building momentum in both the US and Europe. We remain on pace to open 150 accounts in our first 12 months in the US and we're currently in limited market release for the 15 FR iSLEEVE introducer sheath.","We also remain on track to launch in Japan in 2020 and continue to enroll the REPRISE IV US clinical trial to expand indication to intermediate risk patients.","Finally, adoption of the Sentinel cerebral embolic protection device continues as penetration and account openings expand in the US, Europe and other markets. ","Sentinel is now in 500 accounts globally and we're pleased to announce recently at TCT that, in 2020, we will initiate the global protected TAVR randomized clinical trial. We believe that definitive evidence focused on the stroke endpoint will continue to elevate Sentinel to become the standard of care for all patients and will help influence future clinical guidelines.","So, to close, I'd like to share my enthusiasm for the outlook of the rest of this year and in 2020 and beyond. We believe that Boston Scientific continues to be uniquely positioned to drive shareholder value due to our strong long-term growth profile, meaningful opportunity to improve operating margins, track record of delivery and double-digit adjusted EPS growth and our proven ability support to deploy capital.","I want to really thank our employees once again for their winning spirit and commitment to advancing science for life. And Dan will now provide a detailed review of our financials.","Daniel Brennan","Thanks, Mike. Third quarter consolidated revenue of $2.707 billion represents 13.1% reported revenue growth and reflects a $26 million headwind from foreign exchange, slightly favorable to the $30 million to the $35 million headwind expected at the time of guidance.","On an operational basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, revenue growth was 14.2% in the quarter. ","Sales on the Claret, Augmenix and Vertiflex acquisitions contributed 210 basis points, higher than the 180 basis points expected at the time of guidance.","As a reminder, the operational contribution from Claret only represents one month as the acquisition was considered organic as of August 1 this year.","The acquisition of BTG, which closed within the quarter and was not included in prior guidance, contributed an additional 300 basis points to operational growth with two-thirds from the interventional medicine business and the remainder in specialty pharmaceutical.","The divestiture of our legacy embolic beads portfolio partially offset acquisition contributions by 10 basis points.","The resulting organic growth of 9.3% in the third quarter exceeded our guidance range of 7.5% to 9%.","With the strong sales performance, we delivered Q3 adjusted earnings per share of $0.39 at the high-end of our guidance range of $0.37 to $0.39 and representing 13% growth versus the prior year. The FX impact on adjusted earnings per share was immaterial as expected at the time of guidance.","Adjusted gross margin for the third quarter was 72.7%, at the midpoint of our guidance range of 72.5% to 73% and flat versus prior year as favorable FX impact and manufacturing improvements were offset by price erosion in coronary drug-eluting stents and pacers as well as a mix shift within our coronary therapies franchise from DES to complex PCI products.","Adjusted SG&A and expenses were $949 million or 35.1% of sales in Q3, a 40 basis point improvement year-over-year due to ongoing operating expense control and optimization initiatives, but just outside our guidance range, driven by the acquisition of BTG which was not included in guidance since the transaction had not closed at the time. ","Adjusted research and development expenses were $297 million in the third quarter or 11% of sales, at the high-end of our range, again partially driven by BTG expenses which were not reflected in guidance and relatively flat to Q3 of last year.","Royalty expense was 0.6% of sales, also roughly flat over prior year.","With solid topline results, balanced by the funding of key commercial launches and supporting acquisition-related initiatives, Q3 2019 adjusted operating margin achieved the lower end of guidance at 26.1%, increasing 50 basis points year-over-year.","While immaterial to earnings, BTG did create an approximate 10 basis point drag to adjusted operating margin in the quarter.","Now, I'll move below the line to interest and other expense. Adjusted interest expense for the quarter was $83 million and now includes BTG compared to $58 million in Q3 of last year. Our average interest rate was 3.5% in Q3 of 2019, slightly higher than the 3.2% in Q3 of last year.","Adjusted other expense was $11 million in the quarter and primarily includes dilution from our equity method investments and transactional foreign exchange losses, including hedging costs.","Our tax rate for the third quarter was negative 38.7% on a GAAP basis and 10.3% on an adjusted basis, below our guidance of approximately 11% for the quarter as we realized a net benefit from stock compensation accounting.","Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $526 million compared to $569 million in Q3 of last year. We now expect full year adjusted free cash flow to be closer to $2.1 billion due to increased working capital requirements, mainly in inventory to support new product launches and overall sales growth. ","We continue to work to resolve fully the mesh litigation, with over 95% of all known claims now settled or in the final stages of settlement, including additional settlements reached during Q3.","Our total legal reserve, of which mesh is included, was $568 million as of September 30, 2019. This is a decrease of roughly $35 million versus June 30 and includes an additional $25 million reserve for international settlements. There is no change to the US outlook where the known claim count remains flat at 53,000 as does the anticipated amount required for settlement. ","Including these international settlements, we now anticipate payments into qualified settlement funds to total $270 million, which will then resolve all significant existing contingencies related to mesh.","However, as the legal and administrative processes are taking a bit longer than previously estimated, we now expect payment of this $270 million to extend into 2020, with $120 million paid in 2019 and the remaining $150 million to be paid in 2020. ","As a reminder, this liability is released from our balance sheet as payments are made out of the qualified settlement funds to plaintiffs.","Capital expenditures for the third quarter 2019 were $121 million. We expect capital expenditures to be towards the high-end of our guidance range of $375 million to $400 million for the year as we build capacity, integrate acquisitions and position the company for continued growth.","We ended Q3 with 1.412 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding.","I'll now walk through guidance for Q4 and full year 2019. For the full year, we expect 2019 reported revenue growth to be in a range of approximately 9% to 9.5%. On an organic basis, we're narrowing our full-year revenue growth guidance to approximately 7.5% and expect the net contribution from acquisitions and divestitures to provide an additional 360 basis points of growth. Of that 360 basis points, we expect a contribution of approximately 155 basis points from BTG interventional medicine and 70 basis points from BTG specialty pharmaceuticals.","We expect foreign exchange to be a $175 million to $180 million headwind to revenue for the full year and we continue to expect FX to be neutral to earnings per share for the year due to our currency hedging program.","We now expect our full year adjusted gross margin as a percentage of sale to be in the range of 72.25% to 72.5% for the full year, narrowing towards the midpoint of prior 72% to 73% guidance. We will continue to execute on our ongoing standard cost reductions and also expect a positive full-year FX impact to adjusted gross margin of 60 basis points, which remains partially offset by pricing declines.","We expect full year adjusted SG&A to be approximately 35% of sales and down slightly year-over-year. There's no change to expectations from full-year adjusted R&D expense to be in a range of 10.5% to 11% and full year royalty rate to remain at less than 1% of sales for 2019.","As a result, we expect to achieve 2019 adjusted operating margin in a range of 26% to 26.25%, up 50 to 75 basis points versus 2018. This revised range reflects the lower half of our original 26% to 26.5% guidance range due to the impact of closing BTG in August. ","Although BTG contributes operating income, which is largely offset by the incremental interest expense, it is not yet at the company overall rate. So, it is dilutive to the total adjusted operating margin by approximately 20 basis points for the year.","We remain committed to our improvement goals outlined at Investor Day with a sustainable goal of 50 to 100 basis points of annual operating margin improvement. ","We expect our full-year 2019 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 9%. This is based on an operational tax rate of approximately 11%, slightly more than 100 basis points of benefit from the accounting standard for stock compensation and nearly 100 basis points from the discrete tax benefits in Q2, which will not impact our tax rate outlook beyond 2019.","We expect below the line expenses, which include interest payments now inclusive of BTG, dilution from our venture capital portfolio and costs associated with our hedging program to be approximately $400 million for the year.","Note that yesterday we announced a cash tender offer for up to $1 billion of our outstanding debt securities subject to financing conditions and target launching a Eurobond offering shortly, given attractive rates in European bond markets. ","We expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.415 billion shares for Q4 2019 and 1.411 billion shares for full year 2019.","We're raising the low end of our full-year 2019 adjusted earnings per share guidance to $1.55 and maintaining the high end of $1.58. This represents a full year adjusted earnings per share growth of 11% to 13% excluding the 2018 net tax benefit of $0.07 in the base. On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.72 to $0.75.","Now, turning to Q4 2019, we expect reported revenue growth to be in a range of approximately 13% to 15%. This represents strong year-over-year organic revenue growth of 8% to 9%, with an approximate net 600 to 680 basis points of operational growth contribution from acquisitions and divestitures. Of the 600 to 680, we expect roughly 390 to 430 basis points from BTG interventional medicine and 160 to 200 basis points from BTG specialty pharmaceuticals. We expect the foreign exchange impact on Q4 revenue to be a $20 million to $25 million headwind.","For the fourth quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.42 to $0.45 per share, representing 10% to 18% growth excluding the Q4 2018 net tax benefit of $0.01 in the base and we do not expect any adjusted EPS impact from foreign exchange.","GAAP earnings per share for the fourth quarter is expected to be in a range of $0.22 to $0.25 per share.","Please check our investor relations website for Q3 2019 financial and operational highlights which outlines Q3 results as well as Q4 and full year 2019 guidance, including P&L line item guidance.","With that, I'll turn it back to Susie who will moderate the Q&A.","Susan Lisa ","Thanks, Dan. Kevin, let's open it up to questions for the next 30 minutes or so. In order to enable us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. Kevin, please go ahead. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. First question from the Bob Hopkins, Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Robert Hopkins","Great. Thank you and good morning. And congrats on a good third quarter. Two quick questions for me. First, I think we all appreciated the encouraging comments you made on the ischemia trial. I was wondering if you wouldn't mind just quickly walking us through why you see only maybe a $40 million negative case impact if there's no difference between PCI and drug therapy, just kind of walk through the math there if you don't mind. Thank you.","Michael Mahoney","Hey, Bob. Good morning. So, I'll start with a quick summary. Then I'll let Ian walk you through with some more color. First of all, to start off by saying, it's important to recognize \u2013 we certainly have a very long history of clinical evidence in the space and innovation demonstration for the right patient. It's clearly appropriate and can be life-changing therapy.","And second, we do think there's a decent amount of confusion regarding this study and its impact. And as I mentioned in the script, really the third point, we think the financial impact could be anywhere from a positive impact to a slightly negative impact of up to potentially $40 million based on a 5% to 10% reduction in our revenue related to treatment of these patients with coronary syndromes.","So, Ian, maybe you could just follow on with some color as to why we feel the impact in that kind of positive to minus $40 million range.","Ian Meredith","Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Bob. To elaborate on what Mark just said, as you know, the population of patients in the ischemia trial of stable patients undergoing revascularization and not those patients that receive the vast majority PCIs in the US and indeed globally. 80% of patients undergoing PCI in the US, and similar outside the US, are done in patients with unstable angina or acute coronary syndromes. And, of course, the role of PCI in those settings is not in dispute nor the focus of the current trial. It's important to note, though, that in the ischemia trial, not all patients with stable ischemic heart disease were eligible even to be enrolled in this study and then there were significant exclusions after enrollment before randomization. Many of the more complex and sick patients \u2013 for example, those with low small ejection fraction, heart failure, left main coronary disease, end stage renal disease, concomitant valvular heart disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, previous unstable angina now stable are all ineligible for this trial. So, in all, there are 28 major exclusions from the stable ischemic population in this study. So, the translatability of this data set to the 20% who are in the stable ischemic population probably accounts for significantly less. And so, it is on that basis that we think that the impact would be significantly less. ","Robert Hopkins","Okay. Yeah. Appreciate you framing that. Just one other quick follow-up. Mike, over the last couple of months, there's been sort of three things that have caused a little concern about the 2020 outlook \u2013 the BTG growth, the neo data from TCT and ischemia. And you've kind of addressed all of them in your prepared remarks. But I just want to make sure I heard the message right. The message on BTG that you're comfortable with high single digits going forward. And I just want to make sure, on neo, that despite the data you still expect that product to grow going forward.","Michael Mahoney","We think the Street worries about these things more than we do because we feel like we can manage all of this very effectively. As Ian \u2013 we laid out on the DES piece, this is still an important business for us, but now it's approaching 7% of our mix. Urology alone can be three times bigger than DES given the strong diversification of our \u2013 in the US, I should say. So, we think that one has clearly been we think overblown in terms of some of the writeups that we received.","On the SCOPE I, on the reports I gave in the written script, we do expect \u2013 there's a likelihood that that growth will slow down on a percent basis in 2020, but we're quite confident that will grow above the BSX corporate average as well as the IC corporate average really based on the followership that we have in Europe with that valve. Current users are very pleased with the performance of that valve. They continue to use it. They continue to increase their utilization. And so, we'll be anxious to get the second-generation valve approved hopefully mid-2020 in Europe. So, we feel good about that. ","We feel very confident in the full-year guidance that we provided. The company has a very broad range of diversified portfolio. We continue to advance ourselves in high-growth markets and we have very durable high-growth outlook.","Operator","And the next question is from the line of David Lewis, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","David Ryan Lewis","Great. Thanks so much. Just a couple of quick questions. Dan, I just want to start with you. Guidance into the fourth quarter \u2013 actually, a very strong third quarter \u2013 reflects some deceleration, but there are some one-timers and some comparability issues from the third to fourth. Can you help us quantify some the comparability dynamics from the third to the fourth quarter and how you see or how investors should see kind of underlying business momentum into the fourth quarter?","Daniel Brennan","Sure, David. Yeah. As we look at the sequential going from Q3 to Q4, true, the comp gets a little bit easier as you go from Q3 to Q4. We do have a little bit less of a benefit of days. We talked about we had a benefit of days in the second half versus the first half. Saw more of that benefit in Q3 than we will in Q4. So, as we look at the 8% to 9%, I think that's very solid guidance for the fourth quarter. It gets us 7.5% for the full year. And that would be, as Mike had alluded to, acceleration again this year versus last year and feel that's a good place to be for the fourth quarter. We, obviously, have some good launches as well. We had some momentum with Lotus. We have the Watchman going in Japan. We have endo which is kind of \u2013 had been single digits in the first half, back into the double-digits. Urology is going strong. A little bit of a wait and see on spinal cord stimulation. We did see a bit of stabilization in the quarter, but, obviously, not to the levels that we've seen in the past.","So, given the headwinds and tailwinds we have, we think 8% to 9% is strong guidance for the fourth quarter that get us to that 7.5% for the full year, which is acceleration versus last year.","David Ryan Lewis","Just wanted to come back to BTG for a second. I think this is one of the issues that, with a delayed integration, that business has slowed a bit. Actually, in the third quarter, the number came in much better than we were expecting. So, has there been sort of stabilization in recovery in BTG in the early days of integration?","And recent events, Jeff has sort of talked about the ability of taking that business to sort of 50-50 global mix over the next several years. Just maybe, Mike, your recent trends in BTG and sort of your just confidence in getting that 50-50 global mix implies some pretty dramatic growth dynamics for BTG over the next two to three years. You're confident that kind of global mix is achievable here in the near term or in the intermediate term?","Michael Mahoney","Sure. And I saw. I missed that earlier, your BTG comment. So, just on BTG overall, very excited to finally get this closed. It did take three or four months longer than we planned. We did have some commercial turnover during that period which the team, now that it has closed, is shoring that up and really beeping up the resources on the commercial side. ","As I said, focused on product registrations globally to enhance that international mix. For sure in Europe and Asia-Pac. And importantly, we feel very confident with the cost synergies that we've committed to. ","And based on really just early feedback from physicians, the combined portfolio in interventional is really kind of we laid out. It makes sense for interventional radiologist in the interventional oncology space to have these therapeutic capabilities that we have now with cryo and Y-90 as well as additional capabilities that we have with EKOS and Varithena and so forth.","So, the portfolio fix is really kind of a dream for the commercial team. And based on that, we do feel comfortable that BTG will grow faster than the BSC composite in 2020 and beyond and be nicely accretive to the PI business. And we're comfortable with the double-digit growth scenario in 2020 and going forward with BTG interventional.","So, really, all systems go there. The team is focused on integration and we're pleased that we closed the deal. ","Operator","Next question is from the line of Rick Wise, Stifel. Please go ahead.","Frederick Wise","Good morning. Let me turn to Lotus for a moment. Sounds like everything with the launch is on track. Can you just expand on your comments on the 15 FR sheath launch? It sounds like you're still on limited launch. We've heard from physicians that the smaller sheath size really makes a big difference. You said it was going to be the fourth quarter for a full launch. I think where in the fourth quarter is it happening? And with that launch, would we expect to see a step up or an acceleration in Lotus utilization into 2020?","Ian Meredith","Thanks very much. We could see in here. The 15 FR size sheath will actually expand the option in terms of how many patients can be treated because we're always seeing patients excluded from either our clinical trials or commercial use because their peripheral vessels aren't large enough for the existing, but very functional delivery sheath. So, the limited market release is going very well. It's on track and the plans haven't changed thus far. [indiscernible] have an impact on the ability to take in more patients. There will be fewer exclusions, probably 5% of patients are being excluded on vessel size. But the roll out of Lotus Edge, of course, is a planned, controlled release. In the short term, it will be determined by training.","Unidentified Participant","Okay. And if I could turn to sort of a big picture and looking at 2020 question. Mike, you've addressed obviously some of the key concerns on acute ischemia and BTG, but I think there has been a larger discussion and debate about potential 2020 growth headwinds from some of those issues and elsewhere. I know you're not ready to provide 2020 guidance today, but maybe you could help us think from a high level some of the puts and takes and maybe what we're underthinking on the positive side about as you look at 2020 and you sort of emphasize that you think that some of the negatives we're concerned about might be a little less challenging than feared. Thank you.","Michael Mahoney","Sure. Thanks, Rick. Clearly, we're not going to give 2020 guidance at this point. I just think there's a lot of very positive things going on in the company. You look at the momentum that we have really across each business. With the exception EP, each business we believe grew nicely above market and we have very strong momentum across each region. Emerging markets growing at nearly 20%. Very strong above-market growth in Europe which is impressive given that most of our products get approved in Europe prior to get in the US and very strong growth in the US.","And importantly, since you said high level, each quarter, we continue to shift our mix of businesses into faster growth markets as we've outlined that numerous times in various calls. So, each quarter, that profile in terms of our growth potential gets stronger and the team continues to grow above market while investing for the long term. And we have many exciting product launches in 2020, with the Exalt scope which we think will be a really unique platform for us for many years, across our structural heart portfolio where the Watchman FLX would be approved, ideally the ACURATE neo2 in the second half and very a strong product cadence.","You can see the \u2013 for example, neuromodulation. That business really was solely based on US SCS. And now that business is very diversified with growth in Europe and you're seeing tremendous growth out of our DBS platform which nearly doubled in sales and we'll have that for a full year in 2020.","So, we have many different, I would say, tailwinds to offset some of these, I would say, overblown headwinds which were ischemia, the ACURATE SCOPE I as well as the BTG. We're very confident in ACURATE for the long term. We're very confident in BTG. And our DES business, although not a key growth driver, is an important contributor.","So I think, overall, we are excited about the future. I think if you look at our Investor Day deck, we talked about its acceleration. So, despite some of these headwinds in 2019, we expect to grow organically faster than we did in 2018, and that would clearly be our goal for 2020. And at our Investor Day, we talked about organic acceleration in 2020, 2021 and 2022 versus the previous three years. So, we think we have all the tools to do it and we have a lot of confidence in our team to deliver.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Vijay Kumar, Evercore. Please go ahead","Vijay Kumar","Thanks, guys. Congrats on a really nice print here. Mike, maybe turning to some of the positives. The one which really stood out for us was the interventional cardiology. I know you mentioned complex PCI, but that doesn't seem to have changed trends. It's been up teens, mid-teens, pretty consistent. So, it really looks like structural heart really changed trajectory here. So, I'm just trying to understand, how much of this is maybe possibly an acceleration underlying TAVR market growth versus standalone Boston outperformance? I think you mentioned Watchman coming in well above. So, maybe tease out what is Boston specific versus maybe underlying market strength? ","Michael Mahoney","Yeah. So, in cardio, the value of complex coronary is probably understated across the company. It may be our most important platform in Asia-Pac. Our complex coronary business is growing much faster than BSC composite. We continue to invest quite a bit in new portfolio there. And that business is really quite a bit larger than our DES business. And so, again, that was a purpose strategy from Kevin Ballinger, Lance Bates and the team over the year. So, I think complex coronary will continue to be very bright as it gets significantly larger than DES. And also, positions us more uniquely in cath lab clinically with doctors.","And structural heart, I think we know Watchman is doing extremely well. Watchman continues to accelerate growth, continues to deliver strong outcomes, improve utilization and we're very excited about the FLX progress that we're seeing in Europe and our ability to take share in that market with that second gen product and that coming to the US. So, I think we're excited about Watchman as we head into fourth quarter and 2020.","And then, our TAVI plans are really on track. We're very excited where we're with Lotus. I do not think there is a \u2013 we have seen a tremendous change in terms of the market growth, but the outcomes with Lotus have been very favorable. We think it offers some very compelling differentiation versus our competition and we're really on track with opening the 150 accounts really per our plan. And I made comments on ACURATE before.","I think the combination of all these things within cardiology are going to lead to nicely above growth versus the BSX overall average as you look forward to 2020. And, slowly, that strategy of diversification into complex coronary and structural heart, that's working.","Vijay Kumar","That's helpful, Mike. And, Dan, maybe one quick one for you. I think I heard you mention BTG, about 20 basis points [indiscernible] margins. That would imply 40 to 50 basis points of dilution in 2020 and possibly some of that being offset by synergies. Is that the right math? Just to think about margins for next year.","Daniel Brennan","Yeah. I think as you look at 2020, we'll obviously give you a lot more color as we give guidance here at our next call. But, obviously, the $175 million in overall synergies, as Mike said, we're committed to that over that three-year timeframe. And the BTG operating margin will continue to improve where it will be \u2013 the interventional medicines piece will be approaching PI and then eclipsing PI and eclipsing the overall for Boston Scientific. So, it would start to be accretive to Boston Scientific overall. And we'll give you more on the timing on that when we talk about 2020 and specifics.","Michael Mahoney","And maybe to go back to \u2013 follow-up on David\u2019s question on BTG O-US. I think given the strength that we have in the US and the concentration in the US, it's going to be difficult in the near term to get to 50-50 split between internal markets and the US, given the base that we have in the US and our expectations for double-digit growth. ","But that being the case, Jeff and the team are spending quite a bit of resources and leveraging our capabilities in both Europe and Asia, particularly in the regulatory capability area to get these new products approved in Europe into our sales force. That's ready to take them as well as Asia.","And also, we're making investments \u2013 more strategic, long term investments, specifically in China, with our Y-90 and TheraSphere portfolio to ideally build a capability there where liver cancer is really 2x the size of the US.","So, it may take some time for us to \u2013 in terms of our revenue mix where it's more meaningful, but we're putting the efforts there. We already have commercial teams in place and a big focus area to grow O-US or international BTG.","Operator","Next question is from Robby Marcus, J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Robert Marcus","Thanks. And congrats on a good quarter. One of the areas you continue to do well in despite some of the underlying market fundamentals is neuromodulation. I was hoping you could break down some of the growth trends of your different business, DBS versus spinal cord stim, and any commentary you can add to the market health overall?","Michael Mahoney","Sure. So, we're pleased with the overall performance of neuromodulation in the quarter. As I mentioned in the script, really the highlight there for that was our deep brain stimulation platform, Vercise, which is doing extremely well globally, taking quite a bit of share and really doubling the sales year-over-year. And we're excited for 2020 when we'll have the full body MRI capability and the Directional Lead for the full year in 2020 So, a lot of the optimism in neuromodulation.","I think the second highlight there would be our business in the pain overall. So, we essentially have diversified our capabilities there in both SCS, Vertiflex as well as RF. And our Vertiflex acquisition is really exceeding our deal model and we're really the best company to provide that continuum of care for RF lumbar stenosis with Vertiflex or SCS. So, I think that positions us more uniquely versus our peers in terms of that full portfolio to address that. We're seeing great results out of Vertiflex, great results out of RF.","On SCS, the results, we believe, have improved. So, it's a positive trend, but clearly not to the market levels that we enjoyed in the past. We do believe still that, going forward, this will be a mid to high single-digit growth market based on historical trends. And we'll have some easier comps next year in SCS. And, I guess, that's good to look forward to. ","But we do have some new software enhancements that we'll be launching in fourth quarter to our platform, as well as the NANS data that I commented on. So, I think, overall, the marketplace still is clearly not to the levels that it was in 2018 and historical. Potentially, low negative single digits. But we believe we continue to grow above market in SCS and we're really buoyed and enhanced by the depth of the portfolio with Vertiflex, RF and our DBS platform, which is really kind of in line with our category leadership strategy. And as we go forward in 2020, we aim to see slightly better overall SCS market trend, which should help.","And then just, Robby, just the last point on that, with all of those things in place and obviously the SCS not where we had expected to be and many had expected it to be, the overall neuromod franchise grew 8% in the quarter. So, I think that just really speaks to the diversification within that entire business that it's not just an SCS portfolio that it was able to grow 8% in the quarter.","Robert Marcus","And then, a quick follow-up here. Complex PCI, over a billion dollar business, growing mid-teens. I just looked back for over two years now and double digits except for one quarter. PCI guidance, low 20s, I think you said in the script. What's driving such strong growth and how durable can this be?","Ian Meredith","Just to speak to what potentially would be driving this, first of all, we have an aging population with an increasing burden of risk factors, and so there is a greater proportion of patients who are elderly who are being treated by percutaneous intervention to the obvious benefits of being minimally invasive. And as you get older, you have more calcification and more disease. And there is a greater focus now on careful selection of lesions to make sure you're treating the right lesion and optimizing the treatment. So, the practice of interventional cardiology is really more sophisticated. And there's an expectation of better outcomes and you do that by PCI guidance and by functional assessment of the lesions at the time. And, of course, changing demographics means we're dealing with a significant burden of the elderly degenerative disease. And that is the reason it continues to grow.","Operator","Next question from the line of Matthew Taylor, UBS. Please go ahead.","Matthew Taylor","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. I just want a follow-up on some of your comments on EXALT-D. You seem very excited about it. And you mentioned the FDA decree earlier this year. Can you talk about what that could mean? And also, any expectations that you have for the upcoming panel in November on duodenoscopes?","Michael Mahoney","Yes. So, really, in terms of our EXALT platform and the future products that fall behind it really on track and no new commentary other than we expect and we're still on track for year-end 2019 approval, which we \u2013 and we've also initiated a post market clinical trial which will start in the first quarter 2020. But we expect to see our first revenue with EXALT near the end of the year here and we think it will be a significant growth driver for us in 2020.","We think the trends in that FDA advisory certainly are a tailwind for EXALT and kudos to our team for really identifying this opportunity nearly three or four years ago. And so, we think the timing and the physician excitement and may be the FDA support of this are all nice tailwinds for this platform. And we think we're uniquely capable of delivery in this based on our results and expertise that we've created with both LithoVue in urology and digital SpyGlass in endo. So, we have the manufacturing and the ops and the supply chain and the R&D capability to deliver this one as well as the future scopes with it. So, it's one of our more existing launches in 2020.","Matthew Taylor","Thanks. Just a quick follow-up on the comments before on ischemia. I was just curious if you could expand on what you think drives the positive results? What do you think could come out of the trial that could actually drive more stenting or how do you see that as a positive, what's the probability of that?","Ian Meredith","Well, I don't think it would drive more stenting unless we changed guidelines. So, if we use the word positive to say could the trial actually have a positive result, in other words revascularization by other bypass graft surgery of percutaneous intervention be better than just optimized medical therapy. And the reasons for considering that as a possibility is that unlike previous trial, there was a dedicated effort here to determine that the patients who were enrolled in the studies did in fact actually have objective evidence of ischemia. And as you know, 80% to 85% of the patients in this study in both arms have moderate to severe objective evidence of ischemia, not symptoms, but ischemia on functional testing.","Now, by doing that, you know that you have the greatest likelihood of showing the benefit of revascularization. And many previous registries and small studies have suggested the great burden of ischemia you have, the more likely that revascularization is a better option than optimized medical therapy. ","This is the first trial to actually test that out. And despite all of the potential vagaries around the trial, if that plays out, there is a possibility that it could be a positive result because we're treating the right patients in this subset to actually test that question. ","So, that's why I would think that there is a reason to, not so much doom and gloom, because the burden of ischemia might favor an outcome that is positive.","I'll make another comment on the quality of life since everybody thinks that it is going to be positive on quality of life. Just remember that the Seattle questionnaire score was 80 out of 100, a 100 being perfect and 0 being terrible. So, the patients were already asked very minimal symptoms. 80% of the patients had monthly or less frequent angina. So, it is going to be hard to show an improved quality of life in patients who are having symptoms only a few times a year.","Operator","Next question, Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Lawrence Biegelsen","Hey, guys. I don't know, I thought I heard a joke in the background there, Mike, about an ischemia question. But thanks for taking the questions and congrats on a nice quarter. I guess I will ask one ischemia question, Ian, and then just one follow-up on emerging markets in China. Ian, I'm just curious if you have thoughts on US versus O-US implication for this study, if you think they'll be different.","And second, what is your \u2013 listening to your response on the last question, Ian, what's the base case here. It sounds like you think it's going to be hard to show quality of life benefit, but it sounds like you think there might be a hard outcome, death, MI, hospitalization for angina, et cetera, benefit based on what you said on the 80% to 85% of patients having moderate to severe ischemia. And I just had one follow-up.","Ian Meredith","Okay. Well, first to deal with the O-US versus US, as you know, Larry, there's been a significant shift towards \u2013 a greater proportion of PCI is being undertaken in unstable angina and acute coronary syndrome. That trend has been a global trend for over 10 years ever since the COURAGE trial in 2007. And we've done considerable research over the last few weeks to see whether that fact is sustained. ","Just a look in the US. We know the NCDR CathPCI registry has shown that trend away from stable angina. And similarly, there is data from the Sweetheart Registry, the China pace registry and other international registries that all point to the same trend. Maybe a percentage point here or there, but overall we think there will be a consistent pattern in the response to this trial, positive or negative, US to O-US because, overall, the proportion of PCIs undertaken for unstable and acute coronary syndromes outside the US is essentially the same as inside the US. And there is very good data actually published this year from single sentence both inside and outside the US showing the same sort of trends over the last 10 to 12-year period. That was the first question.","The second question you asked was \u2013 I've forgotten.","Lawrence Biegelsen","Just what is your base case assumption kind of on the outcome of the trial?","Michael Mahoney","I really feel like the ischemia \u2013 the level of questions are so disproportionate to the overall business. The MEGATRON launch in the US will likely have a larger impact than the potential downside scenario that we are talking about with ischemia trial.","Lawrence Biegelsen","Fair enough. Just for my second question, just on emerging markets, you had a nice quarter there. There's been a little concern about slowing growth in China. So, I guess, my question is, kind of what are you seeing there, Mike? And any update on the drug-eluting stent price cuts in China, any more visibility on timing or magnitude? Thanks for taking the questions, guys.","Michael Mahoney","Sure. Thanks for the non-ischemia question. The emerging markets grew almost 20%. So, it continued to do extremely well. It's really a combination of our consistent \u2013 it's really the same playbook. We're seeing great growth in Latin America, great growth in China and really nice growth in the ASEAN countries as well as some parts of Europe.","But it's really a combination of a couple of things. It's the diversification of the portfolio. Whereas eight years ago, it was drug-eluting stents and now you're seeing complex coronary being larger than DES in those markets, with those tailwinds that we talked about. Ian mentioned the patient population. But as importantly, the portfolio investments that we've made have driven complex coronary to be very important businesses there. And then, you see the diversification of endo, amazing growth with PI, particularly in Asia, great growth of our interventional oncology business and we're starting to see the impact really just the diversification of BSE other than drug-eluting stents. You're seeing very strong growth with Watchman in China and we're excited to bring our structural heart TAVI portfolio to many parts of Asia-Pac.","So, it's the diversification of the business, the focus that our global presidents put on it, the allocation of resources and really the smart prioritization of which products and which countries makes the most sense to invest in and kind of the speed of the team to execute on the plan. ","So, we're confident in the emerging markets growth. I think in terms of the China DES tender that you'll see, again, there could be some upsides or downsides there based on how these tenders go, but I think, overall, we have very strong balanced portfolio in China that continues to grow very well beyond DES. So, we hope to win these tenders, but we have a very strong diversified business there.","Susan Lisa","Great. Thanks, Mike. With that, we'd like to conclude the call. Thanks for joining us today.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","And I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ms. Susie Lisa. Please go ahead.","Susie Lisa","Thank you, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q4 2014 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our Web site under the heading, Financial Information.","The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Mike will begin our prepared remarks with an update on our business progress and his perspectives on the quarter and year.","Dan will then review our overall Q4 2014 and full-year 2014 financial results as well as guidance for full-year 2015 and Q1 2015. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Keith Dawkins and Dr. Ken Stein.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate and other similar words.","They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share; new product approvals and launches; clinical trials; cost savings and growth opportunities; our cash flow and expected use; our financial performance, including sales, margins, earnings and other Q4 and full-year 2014 results and 2015 guidance; as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses.","Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs and 8-Ks filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them.","At this point, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike?","Mike Mahoney","Thank you, Susie, and good morning, everyone. Boston Scientific delivered excellent well balanced results in Q4 as the Company continues to strengthen execution, diversify our portfolio on regional mix and build global momentum.","Our 7% operational revenue growth in the quarter is the result of broad strength across our businesses and regions and represents another quarter of delivering on our commitment to drive revenue growth at or above the market rate. We expanded adjusted operating margins by 210 basis points in fourth quarter and delivered adjusted EPS at the high-end of our guidance range, despite foreign currency challenges.","Importantly, our Q4 results built upon the momentum generated over the past few years and contributed to the following full-year \u201914 results. Number one, we delivered above market revenue growth with 6% operational growth and 4% organic, excluding the acquired sales from Bard EP and Bayer Peripheral. We expanded adjusted operating margins 130 basis points over 2013 to 20.2%. And number three; we grew adjusted EPS to $0.84, which represents 15% growth for the full-year despite currency headwinds in the fourth quarter.","We are continuing our track record of consistent results and exceeding the goals we provide at our February 13 Investor Day conference. We really continue to believe that Boston Scientific is uniquely positioned to deliver at or above market revenue growth and consistent double-digit EPS growth via our ongoing operating margin improvement initiatives.","Our results demonstrate that we\u2019re a Company that continues to deliver on those commitments. Since joining Boston Scientific three years ago, I\u2019ve met with many customers globally and its really clear that we\u2019re becoming a strong partner of choice, given our focus on meaningful innovation to improve patient outcomes and reduce overall healthcare cost.","Our strategy is to provide market leading, comprehensive and innovative products and solutions to targeted clinical service lines. We strive to address several of the pressures facing healthcare systems today, the need to improve outcomes, lower costs, and increase access to life-saving and life enhancing therapies. Our fourth quarter and full-year 2014 results reflect this focus on delivering meaningful innovation to our patients and physicians, while also providing clinical and economic value to our hospitals and healthcare systems.","I'll now provide some highlights in Q4 and 2014 results, along with thoughts on 2015 outlook and beyond. Dan will then review the financials and 2015 guidance and we will take your questions after that.","Please note that these remarks all references to growth on a year-over-year constant currency basis unless otherwise specified.","Many of our key highlights for the quarter are consistent with our achievements throughout the first three quarters of 2014. Number one, we delivered balanced 7% revenue growth in the fourth quarter with Cardiovascular growth of 10%, 5% growth in Rhythm Management and 4% in MedSurg.","We are very encouraged by the strong results across most of our businesses and I\u2019d particularly like to point out that growth rates in Interventional Cardiology at 10% and Urology and Women's Health at 9%. Also encouraged by the consistency of results in our Cardiac Rhythm Management business posting 3% revenue growth in the quarter, which brings sales growth in CRM for the trailing 12 months to 2%.","Additionally, we saw strong results across all regions, led once again by impressive revenue growth of 10% in Europe, which we view as confirmation of our reinvigorated portfolio and strategic approach. Emerging markets revenue continued to grow at high teens rate, plus 17% in Q4 and represented 10% of total sales for the fourth quarter and full-year 2014.","Taking a closer look at Interventional Cardiology, operational revenue growth of 10% in the quarter was due to the continued strong performance of our innovative portfolio and execution of our global commercial teams. We continue to gain share in a number of cardiovascular segments and DES, our differentiated platform of premier and synergy continues to build momentum globally and gain worldwide share.","We are excited about expanding the global reach of SYNERGY and PREMIER in 2015. Other growth drivers include our complex PCI portfolio, such as Polaris and solutions for a complex total occlusions.","We also enjoy continued strong growth of a small base from our Structural Heart franchise, which includes the highly differentiated second-generation LOTUS percutaneous valve and our WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure device.","For LOTUS, we are currently enrolling patients in the REPRISE III clinical study for FDA approval and Respond which is a 1,000 patient post-market registry in Europe. And we continue to expect a first half 2015 FDA approval for our WATCHMAN device.","Looking forward, we are bullish on a rejuvenated IC pipeline and emerging Structural Heart business, including the SYNERGY, LOTUS, WATCHMAN, BRIDGEPOINT and the Polaris integrated IVUS and FFR imaging systems.","We believe that Boston Scientific brings a uniquely broad set of solutions to help interventional cardiologist, heart teams and hospitals treat the most complex coronary artery in Structural Heart disease patients.","Moving to MedSurg, Urology and Women's Health performance of 9% revenue growth in the fourth quarter brought the full-year growth rate to 7% led by our global expansion efforts. Urology and Women's Health is a great example of our global mindset and diversification, as the business have now posted OUS double-digit operational revenue growth for six consecutive quarters.","Our Endoscopy team continues its high performance track record with consistent mid single-digit sales growth as revenue increased 5% operation in the quarter with growth in every region led by Latin America and Asia.","Another highlight is our consistent revenue growth in Cardiac Rhythm Management with 3% revenue growth in the quarter and 2% for the full-year. We continue to grow de novo ICD share in the U.S despite the replacement share headwinds created by the excellent performance of our industry leading battery longevity.","Our momentum in growth was once again fuelled by our strong portfolio, including a continued adoption of S-ICD, MINI, which is the world's smallest ICD, the longevity associated with our EnduraLife battery technology and our X4 quadripolar CRT-D system in Europe and pulse generator in the U.S.","Patient and physician demand for our S-ICD, which is the only defibrillator that doesn't touch the heart or invade the vasculature, continues to be strong. We comfortably exceeded our 2014 full-year goal of delivering $100 million.","We also continue to expand S-ICD reimbursement coverage with improved Medicare outpatient rates and physician payment codes in 2015 and new commercial coverage such as the recently announced TRICARE, following on from the Aeta approval from last quarter.","TRICARE for example, with 10 million members provides coverage to active duty and retired military for medical services outside of the VA system, where S-ICD is also reimbursed.","We strengthened our number two U.S share position in the de novo ICD implants and we expect continued momentum in 2015 given the growing clinical evidence and improved U.S reimbursement outlook for S-ICD. The targeted year-end 2015 launch of our second generation system EMBLEM, continued new product cadence as core CRM around the world and really increased recognition of the clinical and economic benefits of our EnduraLife battery technology.","Our confidence is also bolstered by our 2014 performance of our European team, the region where each competitor has the latest products and solutions and Boston Scientific continues to take de novo share. An example of how we\u2019re helping the healthcare systems reduce costs is our latest break through in CRM longevity. This unique capability in battery longevity was recently highlighted by Dr. Samir Saba, at the University of Pittsburg Medical Center. Dr. Saba led the first U.S implant of DYNAGEN EL and as data was recently published in the peer-reviewed journal called EuroPace, which demonstrates a superior longevity of Boston Scientific CRT-Ds versus competitors.","The DYNAGEN EL platform offers our proprietary EnduraLife battery. This technology enables a smaller size, up to 11% smaller, 24% thinner than the competitors with industries longest projected battery longevity at approximately 12 years. Our battery technology allows us to help patients and hospitals reduce the cost and potential complications associated with early replacement.","Turning now to revenue growth and expanding operating margins. I'm pleased to report that we are continuing our strong track record. We achieved seven straight quarters of operational revenue growth, we\u2019re delivering on our financial goals and we\u2019re ahead of the total revenue growth and EPS goals provide on our February 13 Investor Day.","For the full-year \u201914, sales growth of 6% and we expanded operating margins of 130 basis points from our full-year \u201913 rate. We also meet our guidance and grew our adjusted EPS 15% year-over-year. We remain committed to our goal for double-digit adjusted EPS growth. And we believe this represents attractive scarcity value, given our revenue growth and differentiated margin expansion opportunities relative to our peers.","As we close the books on 2014, I\u2019d like to provide an update on the progress of a few of our key adjacency growth platforms. We continue to build capabilities and momentum in the Structural Heart. I discussed the ongoing clinical program for our LOTUS TAVR valve which posted strong growth and reorder rates in fourth quarter and remains on track for our 2017 U.S approval. In addition, WATCHMAN remains on track for first half 2015 FDA approval.","In our Peripheral Interventions business, the acquisition of the Interventional Division of Bayer AG with the Thrombectomy and Atherectomy platforms has been an important step to strengthen our global key [ph] acquisition and expand our capabilities.","Moving to renal denervation, we believe in our long-term value of the Vessix platform, we recently received FDA approval for an innovative IDE study called Reduce HTN Reinforce, which is designed to isolate the effects of our Vessix renal denervation system, while minimizing the impact of multiple medications and patient compliance that occurred in other trials. We expect to begin enrolling in this study in first half 2015.","Rhythmia, our mapping and navigation system for use by electrophysiologist to map and treat complex heart arrhythmias is in limited market release and was recently featured in several successful live cases at the January AFib meeting, in Orlando.","Momentum is also improving for our Alair, our BT system for Bronchial Thermoplasty, for treating for patients with severe asthma. Alair has recently received positive commercial coverage from both CareFirst with 3 million members and HCFC, the nations fourth largest insurer with over 40 million members.","And finally VERCISE, our Deep Brain Stimulation system for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and another tremor disorders is building momentum in Europe in its second year of commercial availability. Enrollment continues in our U.S pivotal trial for DBS therapy in Parkinson's disease patients.","So in summary, strength and execution, and improved results in our core business are really driving consistent results across the Company. Our European growth continues to provide evidence of our promising pipeline and we\u2019re expanding our capabilities globally, particularly in emerging markets.","It\u2019s really an exciting time for Boston Scientific, and we look forward to continued high-performance globally. And to us that means above market revenue growth, leveraged operating income of growth via margin expansion, which in turn will drive differentiated double-digit EPS growth and we\u2019re executing towards these goals.","So in closing, we\u2019re pleased with our \u201914. It was a significant year of advancement in our operations, our pipeline and our commercial performance. Our global employees are inspired by our mission and transforming patient lives with innovative medical solutions and we estimate that Boston Scientific products touch more than 21 million patients in 2014.","I\u2019d like to thank our employees for their winning spirit and their tremendous commitment to the Company. I'll now turn the call over to Dan, for a more detailed review of our financials.","Dan Brennan","Thanks, Mike. I will start with some overall perspective on the quarter before diving into the details. We generated adjusted EPS of $0.22 achieving the high-end of our guidance range of $0.20 to $0.22.","The strong performance in Q4 was driven primarily by operational revenue growth, gross margin expansion, and a lower than expected tax rate. Unfavorable foreign exchange impacted Q4 adjusted EPS by one penny.","Our Q4 2014 adjusted operating margin of 20.7%, represents improvement of 210 basis points over Q4 of 2013. We\u2019re pleased that we also exceeded our profitability goal for the full-year of 2014 delivering an adjusted operating margin of 20.2%, representing 130 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement over the full-year of 2013.","In addition, we generated adjusted free cash flow of $508 million and operating cash flow of $439 million in the quarter. The strong cash flow generation this quarter helped us exceed our adjusted free cash flow goal of $1.2 billion for the full-year of 2014.","Now I'll provide a detailed review of our Q4 business performance and operating results. Unless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2013 and all revenue growth rates are given on a year-over-year constant currency basis.","For the fourth quarter of 2014, consolidated revenue of $1.887 billion represented operational revenue growth of 7%, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange and the divested Neurovascular business.","On an as reported basis, revenue grew 3% year-over-year. Excluding foreign currency impact, divestments and an approximate 200 basis point contribution from the Bard EP and the Bayer Interventional acquisitions, organic revenue growth was 5% in the quarter.","The foreign exchange impact on sales was a $71 million headwind or approximately 385 basis points compared to the prior year period and about $44 million worse than we assumed in our guidance range. I\u2019ll provide more color on FX later in my commentary. ","I\u2019ll now provide more details on the revenue results for our seven businesses, which roll up into our three reporting segments. I\u2019ll start with MedSurg, where total group sales of $614 million grew 4% and group adjusted operating income increased 170 basis points to 33.2%.","Endoscopy sales grew 5% worldwide, driven by 7% growth in biliary, the largest franchise and all regions posted growth with Latin America being particularly strong growing above 20% for the third consecutive quarter.","Urology and Women's Health worldwide sales continued to outperform the market and grew an impressive 9%, driven by double-digit growth in the urology franchise and international sales stood out again with Europe and Asia each growing 20%.","To close out the MedSurg results, our worldwide Neuromodulation business declined 2% in the quarter, reflecting a very difficult comparison to Q4 of 2013 were growth was 30% plus and slower U.S market growth due to reimbursement changes that impacted physician office trialing. For the full-year 2014, our Neuromodulation global revenue grew 5% and we believe we gained share in the U.S spinal cord stimulator market.","Turning now to the Cardiovascular Group, which consists of the Interventional Cardiology and Peripheral Interventions businesses, global sales for the group totaled $745 million and grew 10%.","Cardiovascular Group adjusted operating margins for the quarter of 25.9%, represented a 470 basis point improvement year-over-year. Within cardiovascular, worldwide Interventional Cardiology sales of $523 million grew 10%.","Globally, DES grew 12% with exceptional balance as the U.S., Europe, and Asia, all grew DES revenue double-digits. Worldwide complex PCI solutions grew 3% led by imaging, which grew double-digits driven by strong performances in the U.S., and Japan. This growth is due to physician demand for our OptiCross IVUS catheter and ongoing launch of our Polaris hardware system which can integrate both IVUS and FFR in the same platform.","It was the second consecutive quarter of significantly above market revenue growth in IC, and we believe it validates our strategy of providing the interventional cardiologist with the broadest portfolio of technology and differentiated products to treat the most complex coronary cases.","In Structural Heart, our LOTUS percutaneous valve continues to build momentum and WATCHMAN is now approved in over 70 countries and grew over 30% for the full-year. Peripheral Interventions delivered worldwide revenue growth of 10%, driven primarily by revenue from the acquired Bayer Interventional business. Offsetting this was some weakness in the core balloon business where we saw some softness during the quarter due to some recent global launches.","We expect this newly strengthened peripheral franchise to grow above market in 2015 as we fully integrate the commercial teams and technology platforms.","Finally, I will discuss our Rhythm Management group, which consists of our Electrophysiology and Cardiac Rhythm Management businesses. Worldwide Rhythm Management sales in Q4 of $527 million grew 5%. Rhythm Management's Q4 adjusted operating margin of 14.8% represents a roughly 800 basis point improvement year-over-year, admittedly off a low base in Q4 of 2013.","Rhythm Management demonstrated consistent adjusted operating margin improvements throughout the year with mid teens or higher operating income growth every quarter, resulting in a Rhythm Management full-year 2014 adjusted operating margin of 13.4%. This represents improvement of 310 basis points over the full-year 2013.","We are very pleased with this progress and remain focused on our goal of returning Rhythm Management\u2019s adjusted operating margins to the low 20s in 2017. As we previously mentioned, there may be trade-offs that cause the rate of improvement to fluctuate from one quarter to the next and we encourage you to gauge improvements on a full-year basis.","And given the gross margin significance of key new product launches, such as INGENIO 2 or ACCOLADE, and EMBLEM S-ICD, we expect gains in 2015 Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin to be a bit back-end loaded towards the second half of the year.","Worldwide Electrophysiology revenue was up 23% in Q4, with legacy BSE EP sales up low single-digit. We continued the progress of our limited market release for our Rhythmia mapping and navigation system and we\u2019re pleased by the early feedback from physicians using the system, given its higher fidelity images acquired in a fraction of the time required by competitive systems.","For the Cardiac Rhythm Management division, Q4 worldwide sales increased 3%. Growth in CRM was led by Europe, which grew 6% for the second consecutive quarter. On a worldwide basis, defib sales of $339 million grew 5%. U.S. defib revenue posted solid growth of 5%, driven by continued S-ICD and MINI ICD momentum and our X4 quad pulse generator as we continue to gain de novo ICD share.","Worldwide pacer sales were flat totaling $129 million. International growth was strong at 6%, led by adoption of our INGENIO family of pacemakers. Again, as we\u2019ve said, CRM trends are best analyzed over multiple quarters, we believe we were net share gainers in worldwide CRM for the full-year 2014, as we estimate our 2% sales growth outpaced the underlying combined pacemaker and defibrillator market.","Let me now briefly recap full-year 2014 revenue. On a reported basis, consolidated revenue was $7.380 billion, which represents a 3% increase from the prior year. On an operational basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange and the divested neurovascular business, sales increased 6% compared to 2013.","Organically, which excludes foreign currency impact, divestments, and contribution from the acquired BARD EP and Bayer PI businesses, revenue grew 4% over full-year 2013. Lastly, foreign currency negatively impacted reported sales growth by approximately 120 basis points or about $86 million.","Turning now to the P&L, adjusted gross profit margin for the fourth quarter was 71.4%, up 140 basis points year-over-year and 30 basis points, sequentially. The increase was largely attributable to benefits from our standard cost reduction program, partially offset by price erosion.","For the full-year 2014, our adjusted gross profit margin was 70.7% compared to 69.7% for the full-year 2013. The 100 basis point net full-year gross margin improvement stemmed from improvements in standard costs, and lower sales of divested businesses partially offset by price as well as volume and mix. For Q4 and the full-year 2014, as a result of our hedging program, FX positively impacted gross margin by 40 and 20 basis points respectively. ","Adjusted SG&A expenses were $724 million or 38.4% of sales in Q4, roughly flat to the rate in Q4 of 2013. Our Q4 adjusted SG&A rate includes roughly 85 basis point impact related to settlement of a long standing litigation matter and fees related to our IRS transfer pricing litigation, the timing of which has continued to move out.","For the full-year 2014, adjusted SG&A expenses were $2.8 billion or 37.9% of sales. We are not satisfied with this level of spending and are expecting our full-year adjusted SG&A rate to decrease by roughly 100 basis points in 2015.","Adjusted research and development expenses were $208 million in the fourth quarter or 11% of sales. As a percent of sales, this represents a 70 basis point decline in year-over-year spending, due to efficiency gains and the timing of projects. For the full-year 2014, adjusted R&D expenses were $817 million or 11.1% of sales.","Royalty expense was $25 million in the quarter or 1.3% of sales, in line with Q4 of 2013 and for the full-year 2014 royalty expense was $111 million or 1.5% of sales.","On an adjusted basis, pre-tax operating income was $390 million in the quarter or 20.7% of sales, up 210 basis points year-over-year and 20 basis points, sequentially. Adjusted pre-tax operating income grew 14% with all three of our reportable segments contributing to the improvement.","GAAP operating income, which includes GAAP to adjusted items of $283 million, was $107 million in Q4. The primary GAAP to adjusted items for the quarter included litigation related charges of $37 million, contingent consideration expense of $37 million, intangible asset impairment of $18 million, restructuring and other charges of $48 million and amortization expense of $111 million. Our total accrual for all legal matters was $972 million as of December 31, 2014, an increase of $27 million due to cost related to ongoing litigation.","Now, I\u2019ll move to our other income and expense, which primarily consisted of interest expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $54 million, which is $4 million lower than Q4 of 2013. Full-year 2014 interest expense was $216 million; $109 million lower than full-year 2013, primarily due to the refinancing of our public debt in Q3 of 2013.","Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was negative on a reported basis, and 7.7% on an adjusted basis. Our Q4 2014 adjusted tax rate includes roughly $16 million of discrete tax benefits.","Now I\u2019ll provide a bit more detail on our full-year 2014 adjusted tax rate where our most recent guidance was 12% to 13%. As you may know, the tax extenders package was passed during the fourth quarter of 2014, which included a one-year extension of the U.S R&D tax credit for 2014.","The R&D tax credit itself was roughly 150 favorable basis points. However, other elements of the legislation had an unfavorable impact of about 50 basis points for a net favorable impact of approximately 100 basis points. In addition, we had certain Q4 discrete tax items that reduced our full-year rate by approximately 100 basis points.","The net result of this is our 10.9% adjusted tax rate for the full-year. Therefore, without the tax extenders package and the Q4 tax discrete, our full-year 2014 adjusted tax rate would have been in the 13% range. The difference between our reported and adjusted tax rates for the quarter is attributable to charges excluded in determining our non-GAAP results.","For the full-year, we reported adjusted EPS of $0.84 per share which represents 15% adjusted EPS growth over 2013. On a reported GAAP basis, 2014 EPS was $0.20 per share. GAAP results for 2014 included after-tax charges of $862 million or $0.64 per share related to intangible asset impairments, acquisition and divestiture related costs, litigation, restructuring related expenses, and amortization of intangible assets.","Moving on to the balance sheet, DSO of 56 days decreased 9 days compared to December of 2013, due primarily to strong collections in Europe. Days inventory on hand of 156 days was up 7 days compared to December 2013, due to higher inventory in advance of launches and lower cost of goods sold, driven primarily by standard cost improvements and a favorable product mix.","Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $508 million compared to $319 million in Q4 2013. Our full-year 2014 adjusted free cash flow of $1.261 billion represents growth of 6% over full-year 2013. This increase was primarily due to higher adjusted operating profit and continued focus on reducing working capital partially offset by higher ordinary tax payments due to the use of acquired tax benefits in 2013.","Capital expenditures were $79 million in the fourth quarter compared to $85 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. For the full-year, capital expenditures were $259 million compared to $245 million in 2013. There were no share repurchases in the quarter and there is no change to our top capital allocation priorities, M&A and share repurchase while maintaining flexibility. Any continuation of our share repurchase program in 2015 would be subject to business development opportunities, market conditions, our stock performance, regulatory trading windows, and other factors.","To summarize, 2014 was a strong year for Boston Scientific as we continue to make solid progress on our global strategy. We delivered against three critical financial objectives, consistent revenue growth, meaningful adjusted operating margin expansion, and double-digit adjusted EPS growth, specifically 6% operational revenue growth, 10% adjusted operating income growth, and 15% adjusted EPS growth. Although pleased with 2014 results, we believe that we will continue to have opportunities to enhance profitability and expect to continue to generate strong cash flow.","I\u2019d like to conclude with guidance for Q1 and full-year 2015. For the full-year 2015, we expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $7.300 billion to $7.500 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 3% to 6% on an operational basis and a decline of 1% to growth of 2% on a reported basis.","As a result of a stronger dollar at current rates, we expect foreign currency to be roughly $310 million headwind for the full-year 2015. We expect our adjusted gross margin for the year as a percentage of sales to be in the range of 71% to 72%.","Although we expect to continue to see downward pricing pressure, we expect this headwind to be offset by improved price management, principally through market segmentation and tiered offerings and standard cost reduction programs.","We believe that the impact of these benefits will increase particular in the second half of 2015. Our adjusted SG&A rate was 37.9% in 2014 and our goal was to bring the full-year 2015 adjusted SG&A rate to between 36.5% and 37.5% of sales.","We continue to transform our R&D organization and refocus our spending to drive innovation and growth. In 2015, we expect adjusted R&D expenses as a percent of sales to be in the range of 11% to 12%.","We expect 2015 royalties to be approximately 1% of sales, 50 basis points less than 2014. Interest and other expense is expected to be slightly higher in 2015 than 2014, primarily due to some net investment gains we recognized in 2014, we do not expect these gains to reoccur.","This implies a full-year adjusted operating margin in the range of 21.5% to 22.5%, the mid point of which represents 180 basis points of improvement over full-year 2014. We expect our adjusted tax rate for the full-year 2015 to be between 13% and 15% consistent with what we\u2019ve said throughout 2014. As you'd expect, this does not assume an extension of the U.S R&D tax credit or any other expired tax provisions during 2015, nor does it assume any discrete tax items. It does assume a more normalized geographic mix of earnings.","As a result, we expect adjusted EPS for the full-year 2015 to be in the range of $0.88 to $0.92. We believe we have an effective hedging program with a three-year time horizon that has a long track record of successfully minimizing the foreign exchange impact on operating income, with current euro and yen rates we haven't seen in close to a decade, we expect 2015 adjusted EPS to be negatively impacted by approximately $0.04 or a little north of $50 million of adjusted income -- net income.","The $0.04 impact breaks down into roughly $0.01 per quarter for modeling purposes and our full-year adjusted EPS guidance range reflects this. Despite this $0.04 hit, our goal remains double-digit adjusted EPS growth, which will be realized at the higher end of our range.","On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.42 to $0.48 and lastly for 2015 our guidance assumes adjusted free cash flow of approximately $1.3 billion, capital expenditures of approximately $260 million, pre-tax amortization expense of approximately $435 million, stock comp expense of approximately $100 million and a share count of roughly $1.345 billion fully diluted weighted average shares for our EPS calculations for the full-year subject to the conditions I mentioned earlier.","Now turning to Q1, 2015, we expect consolidated revenues to be in a range of $1.740 billion to $1.800 billion. If current foreign exchange rates hold constant, the headwind from FX should be approximately $90 million or 500 basis points relative to Q1 of 2014.","On an operational basis, we expect consolidated Q1 sales to grow year-over-year in a range of 3% to 6%. For the first quarter, adjusted EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.19 to $0.21 per share and GAAP EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.07 to $0.11 per share.","I encourage you to check our investor relations Web site for Q4 2014 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q4 results, as well as Q1 and full-year 2015 guidance including P&L line item guidance.","So with that, I'll turn it back to Suzie, who will moderate the Q&A.","Susie Lisa","Thanks, Dan. Brad, let's open it up to questions for the next 25 minutes. In order to enable us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. Brad, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Of course. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Lewis","Good morning. Mike, just two questions here. Maybe one for you, one for Dan. So just taking \u201915 guidance for a second here, a little stronger at the top end of the range than we\u2019d have expected, but maybe help us understand what drives the top and the bottom end of this view and specifically what assumptions have you made for key pipeline products in \u201915 and namely they are S-ICD, WATCHMAN and SYNERGY? And just had a quick follow-up.","Mike Mahoney","Sure, David. I'll take that one and then I'll hand your call off as well. As you look at the 3% to 6%, we\u2019re not going to get into the specifics of what the individual line item guidance is for specific products within that, but at the low end of that, its markets that may not be as strong as they are today. Maybe pricing is a little bit more unfavorable. Always have to be wary of the global economy and then specific around Structural Heart maybe it's a slower ramp in some of our Structural Heart products, LOTUS and then WATCHMAN in the U.S. The flip side of that on the higher end of that is, maybe the core end markets are a little bit better. Some of them -- some of our markets we call kind of flat to slightly up. If those are a little bit better, then that\u2019s closer to the top end. The flip of the slower ramp in Structural Heart is maybe there is a stronger uptick relative to those products. And then, MedSurg which doesn't get a lot of attention on the high-end maybe better and earlier new product launches on MedSurg front could get us closer to the higher range as well. Hopefully that -- directionally hopeful that\u2019s helpful in terms of what would put us at each end of that range.","David Lewis","Okay, very helpful. And then, maybe a related question on margins and growth. By our math, you\u2019ve got 10% to 15% constant currency earnings growth which is, obviously nothing to sneeze at for the year. But one of the big drivers has obviously been gross margin. This is the fourth straight quarter of GM expansion, the third straight year of GM expansion, and you\u2019re guiding to another robust GM year for \u201915. So, can you just give us specifically, what are those drivers of GM on the upside here for \u201915, and your confidence in this 500 basis points of operating margin expansion over the next two to three years. Thank you.","Dan Brennan","Sure, David. You\u2019re correct. I mean, gross margin has been a significant point of strength for the company over the last two to three years. And we look for that to continue going forward. It\u2019s probably about a -- at the mid-point of our range, 80 basis points over 2014. So, we were 70.7 in 2014, and the mid-point of our range is 71.5. So, within that, it\u2019s a continuation of the same things that we\u2019ve been doing and executing on over the last couple of years, which is taking high single-digits of cost out of the system every year relative to standard cost. It obviously offsets the pricing impact that we have. And then we have other efforts in OCOGs around period expenses and excess and obsolete charges to really accelerate the gross margin improvement. So, it\u2019s been a big part of our story, and I would look for it to continue to be a big part of our margin expansion story going forward.","David Lewis","Thank you very much.","Dan Brennan","Thanks, David.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Weinstein","Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a couple of items on the guidance. Dan, I think you commented that you had a goal of producing SG&A by a 100 basis points in 2015. Could you just talk a bit about that, and what drives that and how you get there?","Dan Brennan","Sure, Mike. Thanks for the question. So, clearly as we look at \u201914 -- 2014, the $379 million is higher than we wanted to it be, so we\u2019re redoubling our efforts on SG&A in \u201915. I\u2019d probably look at three key reasons and three key drivers that we\u2019re looking at for \u201915. You\u2019ll have better leverage in the adjacencies as sales continue to ramp at a lower operating cost. You think of LOTUS, you think of a U.S. rollout of WATCHMAN. So, overall structural heart just gets better in terms of a leverage perspective. We are doing some things around challenging our global team to really focus on reducing spending with a variety of new initiatives and programs. I\u2019d say undergoing a cultural shift to focus more directly on spending, everything from travel to meetings to suppliers to royalties. No stone left unturned there and then a continuation of what we\u2019ve done in the past which is, the G&A competitive benchmarking and making sure that all of our G&A functions have competitive benchmarks and time horizons to get to best in class against those benchmarks. There is a few others you think of leverage in the emerging markets, particularly in BRIC, reduced integration cost from prior acquisitions. So, there are other things, but I think those other three are really the key drivers that are going to get us down to that 37% in \u201915.","Michael Weinstein","Okay. Let me ask couple of pipeline items before I drop. So one, have you submitted the G&A supplement for EMBLEM? Two, could you talk about the timing of INGENIO 2.0 in Europe which has started to rollout and then in U.S. and then third, can you give us any sense of when you expect to complete enrollment in REPRISE III for those? Thanks.","Mike Mahoney","Hi, good morning, Mike. Yes, on the EMBLEM we\u2019re still confident that we\u2019ll be able to have a full rollout of EMBLEM product by the end of the year in 2015 both in U.S. and Europe, and we\u2019re really building up our internal supply chain capabilities to accommodate that goal for yearend launch in EMBLEM in both those markets. On the enrollment of our LOTUS TAVR valve we\u2019re making good progress there. We have about 50 to 60 patients enrolled currently, and we\u2019re confident of a fourth -- by yearend enrollment in 2015 for TAVR as well as our registry in Europe will continue to mount. And then third one, on WATCHMAN, I don\u2019t think you asked about that one. We\u2019re still confident in a first half approval in the U.S. with WATCHMAN.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Frederick Wise","Good morning, everybody. Can you talk a little bit about LOTUS in a little more detail? Clearly you\u2019re building momentum; you talked about the EU re-order rates. Is the availability in Europe [indiscernible] valve size making a difference? Is that what's helping? Is that the critical factor? And maybe talk about when we might see some data that reflects this broader size at? Thanks.","Mike Mahoney","Sure. And Keith maybe you could make some comments upfront, I\u2019m done. The addition of the 25 millimeter valve has helped. We see that as the valve size that\u2019s used most frequently in Europe. And so having that valve size added to our matrix is very helpful, and then we should have -- add two additional sizes to our LOTUS fleet if you will by the end of the year. So that will help round out up to five sizes in our matrix in Europe. So we\u2019ll be positioned to have that by the end of the year. And in terms of the reorder rates, they continue to grow nicely off of a small base, and we\u2019ll likely highlight our structural heart business in particular at our upcoming investor day in the second quarter. So, we\u2019ll provide more details on some of the reorder rates and financials behind our TAVR program then. And in terms of the clinical piece, Keith did you have any comments on that?","Keith Dawkins","Yes, Rick. So we are encouraged by the recruitment rates in the respond post market study in Europe which is a 1000 patient study and has the three valve sizes, 23, 25, 27, and at least a third of the patients, so the newest size was 25. And the first 250 of those patients will be presented at PCR in Paris in May. We also have a next-generation delivery system which is being tested and has performed very well, and the data from that will be presented at PCR as well. And as Mike says, REPRISE III is on track. The pivotal trial should complete by the end of the year. That of course had three valve sizes. And then the 21 and the 29 millimeter valve and a new sheath they\u2019re in development. And finally, we\u2019re very encouraged by the sale of the Safari wire, which is a dedicated TAVR wire which is being used not only for LOTUS implants, but also for competitive bowl implant.","Frederick Wise","Thanks. And just, second question, maybe if you could talk Dan or more about the operating margin made. I mean, with zero margins continuing to expand despite exceeding your S-ICD goal. Maybe just a little more color, is the S-ICD more profitable than we thought? Are you getting it, cost reduction or a mix improvement elsewhere? And did you give a target S-ICD number for 2015, maybe I missed it. Thanks so much.","Dan Brennan","Sure, Rick. No you didn\u2019t miss it. We didn\u2019t give specific number for S-ICD. We did in \u201914 obviously with a lot of interest around the ramp and the uptake and now in \u201915 and beyond we look at that really as part of our core business. Relative to your question on margins, I think I\u2019d start with the growth of \u201914 versus \u201913 in each of our segment. So, Rhythm Management gets a lot of focus. But if you look at operating margin for each of three segments, the cardiovascular was up 220 basis points year-over-year, Rhythm Management was up 310, and MedSurg was up 120. So, yes Rhythm Management is a big piece of that, but all segments are contributing. Specific to Rhythm Management we knew what the profitability was of the S-ICD heading into 2014 obviously and we have other programs and other actions and initiatives in place to ensure that we hit our target. So nothing really surprised us relative to that. We knew what we had heading into \u201914. We know what we have now heading into \u201915 until we launch EMBLEM by the end of the year in the U.S. and Europe. So, its all part of the overall well documented and executed plan within Rhythm Management to continue to drive margins back to the low-20s.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Bruce Nudell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Bruce Nudell","Good morning. Can you hear me okay?","Dan Brennan","Yes, Bruce.","Mike Mahoney","Good morning, Bruce.","Bruce Nudell","Okay, great. Excellent year, Mike. Well done. The surprise I saw today was really about renal denervation. Could somebody talk about that trial design, when we might have results, and what are the key elements of it that will help tease out the specific treatment effect in what class of patients?","Mike Mahoney","Dr. Dawkins, would you like to take that one?","Keith Dawkins","Sure, Bruce. I mean, we can't release full details of the protocol right now, but we\u2019re having a great protocol with the agency. And we think, there were lots confounders as you know in the simplicity trial. And we feel we should pullout some of the obvious one in relation to patient compliance, manipulation of medication, the length of the primary endpoint and stability of the patient, as well as highlighting the performance of what we think is differentiated products. We remain very confident about renal denervation with Vessix not only for hypertension, but we have trials ongoing, investigator sponsored trials with other applications. And so, we think this will be a very important scientific study not just for Boston Scientific investors but actually for the field to justify the role of renal denervation in the treatment of difficult hypertension.","Bruce Nudell","And my second question is, when I met with you guys recently, you expressed under-appreciation of your likely success in TAVI. Could you just kind of speak to the position that you hope to be able to retain and what's proving to be a much more robust market than people thought a year ago? And are there dimensions of performance improvement that would -- that could be improved upon in the current LOTUS design?","Keith Dawkins","Do you want to talk to that Mike or?","Mike Mahoney","Just briefly, then you can add to it, Keith. We take a lot of pride in the capabilities of our engineering teams and our clinical teams and our commercial teams. And we have very strong track record of delivering innovation across the cardiovascular business, and we have really excellent capabilities in terms of R&D and manufacturing at Galway. And we\u2019re really building strong knowledge base in structural heart in TAVR as well as WATCHMAN. So, we think given our leadership commercial position and the capabilities of R&D team that the structural heart expectations of the external analysts is quite understated as you go out in the mid and longer term of the strat plan. So we would be very disappointed in delivering against some of the projections that externally have been discussed. So we have a lot of confidence in the program, and we think with the differentiated platform, we\u2019re starting to see that and the revenue growth numbers in the fourth quarter in Europe. And we\u2019re really starting to click in terms of the productivity the R&D teams with, as Keith said with new valve sizes coming, reduction in profile of the device coming, and its really just building up new capabilities everyday. We also think the market as you said continues to expand globally, and we also think this is a very expensive endeavor to be fully committed to the TAVR space. And we don\u2019t think this market is going to be quite as crowded as what we see in Europe globally.","Keith Dawkins","I would just add Bruce that, we\u2019ve got to a very good position in a very short time with the REPRISE program, and I would encourage you to look at the independent Weber [ph] data that we released shortly in Europe to identify the Boston Scientific LOTUS position in Europe. We\u2019d obviously give more granularity about the structural heart side at our New York Investor Day later this year. And finally of course the REPRISE III trial in the U.S, the pivotal trial is in fact incorporating two partner trials in one. So, we\u2019re looking at extreme risk and severe risk, and so, we\u2019ll catch up again. So we think considering we were later into the market we\u2019re in good shape.","Bruce Nudell","Thanks so much.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Robert Hopkins","Thanks so much, and congrats on a good year. The first question, given that it\u2019s a point of interest for everybody, I was wondering if we could just get a quick litigation update from you in terms of any updated thoughts on the timing from a ruling from the judge in the J&J case, or just any other litigation milestones we should be aware of in 2015 as it relates to mesh or IRS?","Dan Brennan","Sure, Bob, this is Dan. I\u2019ll take that one. Relative to the J&J litigation, I think it\u2019s where we were at the end of the closing comments in the end of January. With the judge we like our set of facts, and then are looking forward to a favorable resolution in that -- in his words shortly we\u2019ll see what that means relative to timing. With respect to mesh, we continue to try cases in mesh. So, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything necessarily to look for there. All the reserves that we have relative to all of our litigation are included in the $972 million that I referenced in my prepared remarks.","Robert Hopkins","And then as a follow-up, I wanted to ask Dan a question on margins. I think you mentioned that Rhythm Management margins in 2015 would be a bit more backend loaded. So I was wondering if you could just explain that, should we expect continued sequential improvement earlier in the year, and to what degree are your pricing trends impacting things, and did pricing trends in the fourth quarter get worse or stay the same relative to earlier in the year? Thank you.","Dan Brennan","Sure, Bob. No, it\u2019s not necessarily pricing trends, because they have been consistent through \u201914, and I don\u2019t think we see those changing in \u201915. I think as you look at \u201915, we\u2019re talking more about the backend for sequential improvements relative to Rhythm Management. I think in the first half, you\u2019d see it be more flat to where we have been. And then the benefits of EMBLEM and the INGENIO 2, ACCOLADE will really start to kick-in in the second half. So, again I just want to make sure that folks look at broader windows than just 90 day windows. And we feel very good at where we are as we exit \u201914, and we would look for, as we exit \u201915 to be in the same spot, but I\u2019d just look more to the back half of \u201915 for more incremental gains in Rhythm Management operating margins.","Robert Hopkins","Great. Thanks for the color.","Dan Brennan","Sure.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Danielle Antalffy","Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. I was hoping you could give a little bit more color on endoscopy. You guys came in a little bit lower than we were expecting. And just wondering how we think about the Alaris adoption ramp here given the reimbursement pressures in such, and thinking about that in not just \u201915 but also longer term?","Mike Mahoney","Sure. Thanks for asking the question on endoscopy. Overall we\u2019re pleased with the performance for the full year. We grew 5% in the quarter -- fourth quarter, 5% in the full year. We think that\u2019s slightly faster than the market. And the team is really building out \u2013 it\u2019s our most global business, and the team is building a number of new capabilities to drive future revenue growth particularly in Biliary in the emerging markets where there is a lot of under-penetrated patient demand as well as the need for greater physician training. So, our team is really pioneering that in the emerging markets. So, we think 5% of solid year. Then also as Dan, mentioned the MedSurg segment improved operating margins. And as you look to 2015, we\u2019ll have a stronger cadence of product launches in the endoscopy business in 2015 which should help. And also as you mentioned Alair which I think some had written off is starting to build some momentum in terms of reimbursement as I mentioned in the opening comments. So we still have a long way to go for Alair to make a meaningful impact on the top line of endoscopy, but we\u2019re not giving up on it, because the product works, the clinical results are very good. And we think over time, we\u2019ll continue to layer on additional reimbursement approvals where Alair maybe not in \u201915 but in the strat plan period will have a more significant impact on endoscopy\u2019s top line.","Danielle Antalffy","Okay, great. That\u2019s really helpful. And then, on the Neuromodulation side of things, I know this was a tough year. You do have potentially more competition coming here in the back half of the year. So I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color about the trajectory there, and also an update on the clinical side of things. I know you guys are doing to accelerate clinical trial and when we could see some data from that? Thanks so much.","Mike Mahoney","Sure. So, on Neuromod, the performance if you look across 2014 was a 5% grower, and we clearly had very high growth in the first half of the year off of our Spectra launch, and then we really had some very challenging growth comparables in the second -- really the second half of the year. I don\u2019t have the exact number, but growth comparable is probably in the 25% plus range that we\u2019re fighting against. So for the full year to scratch out of 5% growth we think its kind of in line with the market for Neuromodulation. We also are encouraged with as we head into 2015 with some new product approvals with the 32 contact paddle which we think provides additional differentiation with our Spectra platform, and Spectra continues to be really the market share leader in spinal cord stimulation with share gains there. So we have some new products that will come in 2015, and Nevro we anticipated their FDA approval, so that wasn\u2019t a surprise for us. We have been competing with Nevro for a number of years over in Europe and Australia. In Australia we\u2019re very comfortable with our leading market share position. And also as you mentioned, we are investing beyond the technology platforms in additional clinical studies for Neuromodulation, and we\u2019ll continue to report those out as appropriate.","Danielle Antalffy","All right. Thanks so much.","Susie Lisa","Brad, we\u2019ll take one more question please.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Brooks West with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Brooks West","Hi, guys. Thanks for sneaking me in. Couple of product questions, I was wondering on the synergy U.S. launch versus how you\u2019re launching that in Europe. You\u2019ve got tiered strategy over there, is that how we should think about the approach to the U.S. or can that be a workhorse stent and just any thoughts on kind of uptake there. Then I\u2019ve got a follow-up.","Mike Mahoney","Yes, we haven\u2019t provided any insights yet in terms of the, kind of the launch strategy in the U.S. We are expecting FDA approval synergy in late \u201915, so hopefully we can get a potentially a fourth quarter impact with synergy. And we\u2019re continuing to be very careful about how we price that synergy. We think that\u2019s the best way to preserve the strength of this overall marketplace, the strategy to working for us, and for the full year we grew DES 6% in a combination between PREMIER and Synergy. So, we think we offer a differentiated platform that provides unique value and therefore we should be apprised appropriately that way. So, we\u2019ll continue to refine our launch plans for U.S. and communicate more details on that once it\u2019s approved.","Brooks West","Thanks. And then on the EP platform with Rhythmia, can you give us a little bit more detail again on the launch trajectory there. And then I\u2019m curious in the accounts that have the Rhythmia system, are you seeing pull-through of your diagnostic catheters, and then when could we see the new ablation catheters I believe they\u2019re called the MiFi catheters, is that still on track for kind of the next 18 months here?","Mike Mahoney","Yes. So, on the Rhythmia side we did see -- you saw a few cases if you went to the few live cases at the AFib meeting in Orlando early in January there. So we\u2019ve just really launched our first call it 10 sites or so globally, and we\u2019re seeing some excellent feedback in terms of the speed and acquisition times and the collection points of the Rhythmia platform. In those sites we are seeing some core pull-through as you mentioned in the diagnostic side. And also, lecture physiologists are looking at Boston Scientific as their Rhythm Management provider. So we also see the strength of our CRM business, the capabilities we have there will also help in the overall story with lecture physiologists. So we\u2019re in our early days of the Rhythmia launch but its going well on the sites that have installed it and we have seen some pull-through in diagnostic catheters.","Brooks West","And anything Mike on the MiFi catheters?","Mike Mahoney","Yes, on the MiFi catheters we\u2019re still enrolling in the U.S. and we\u2019re looking to continue to sell the open-irrigated platform for MiFi in Europe.","Brooks West","Great. Thank you.","End of Q&A","Susie Lisa","And with that we\u2019d like to conclude the call. Thanks for joining us today. We sincerely appreciate your interest in Boston Scientific.

Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thanks a lot, Susie. Good morning, everyone. Boston Scientific delivered another quarter of excellent results as we continue our strong focus on quarterly execution while also diversifying the portfolio and building out our plans for long-term, sustainable, high-single-digit revenue growth and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our balanced portfolio and category leadership strategy are driving top tier performance enabling us to invest to address significant unmet clinical needs in both our core and adjacent markets. In the third quarter our team delivered 9% operational and organic revenue growth with balanced contributions from all our businesses and regions.","Most of our businesses and regions continue to grow faster than the market. MedSurg led the way with 11% growth while Rhythm and Neuro grew 8%, Cardiovascular sales increased 7%, all on an organic basis. We enjoyed similar broad strength regionally with operational sales up 8% in Asia-Pac, 9% in the US, 7% in Europe\/Mideast Africa, 18% in Latin America\/Canada. Overall, emerging market sales grew 20% operationally, led by strong performance in China and Latin America in particular.","We leveraged this worldwide 9% Q3 revenue growth to deliver adjusted EPS of $0.35 which is up 12% year over year, and at the high end of our guidance range. Boston Scientific also continues to generate excellent cash flow with $569 million in adjusted free cash flow this quarter which represents a 21% year-over-year improvement.","As a result of our strong performance and confidence in our outlook, we're narrowing our full-year 2018 revenue growth guidance to the high end of prior ranges and now target 8% operational and 7% organic revenue growth with a one point contribution coming from M&A.","We're also raising our Structural Heart revenue guidance from $450 million to $475 million to reflect continued WATCHMAN and ACURATE strength, plus the impact of the Claret acquisition. We're also narrowing our full-year 2018 adjusted EPS guidance range from $1.37 to $1.41 to $1.38 to $1.40. On the outperformance year-to-date, plus an incremental $0.01 of FX headwind which is now expected to be a negative $0.04 to $0.05 for the full year, versus prior expectations of $0.03 to $0.04.","For the fourth quarter, we're guiding to operational revenue growth of 7% to 8% and organic growth of 6% to 7% with a one-point contribution coming from M&A. Excluding the Q4 reinvestment of our second quarter tax settlements, we are targeting Q4 2018 adjusted EPS of $0.36 to $0.38 and Dan will detail that a bit more.","I'll now provide some highlights on Q3 results and our Q4 outlook. All references to growth are on an organic year-over-year basis unless otherwise specified.","Our urology and public health business continued its above market global performance trend growing 12% operationally and 10% organically. This is led by mid-teens growth in our Stone franchise and sales of LithoVue continue to outperform and drive nice pull through. Sales of Men's Health products grew high single digits. Well balanced both erectile function restoration and male continence products. And our prostate health business also grew high single digits on an organic basis due to GreenLight laser therapy, international expansion, and also Rez\u016bm, which is our minimally invasive therapy for BPH via the NxThera acquisition, contributed nearly 200 basis points of growth to Uro PH overall.","Also, the recently closed Augmenix acquisition enhances our category leadership strategy in Urology with the SpaceOAR hydrogel, a compelling addition to our growing prostate health treatment portfolio. Prior to radiation therapy, the SpaceOAR hydrogel is injected in office by the urologist or radiation oncologist to create additional space between the rectum and prostate during treatment, thereby reducing the amount of rectal exposure to radiation and therefore the associated side effects.","Turning to Endoscopy, Endo growth accelerated 12% due to excellent momentum in our core Endo business and EndoChoice sales, including infection prevention and pathology. Looking ahead, Endo should turn in high single digit growth for the full year 2018 and is well poised to sustain this rate in 2019 as we look forward to multiple new product launches including SpyGlass Digital II, Orca's hemostasis pod for infection prevention and Orise gel for endoluminal surgery and resection of suspicious and cancerous lesions.","We also remain on track with the ongoing development of our comprehensive single use scope platform, which will include the Exalt-D duodenoscope slated for year-end 2019. Plus, a bronchoscope for use in pulmonary applications, an upper GI scope for emergent bleeds and a surgical scope for pancreatic biliary applications.","Neuromodulation grew an impressive 23% in the quarter, driven by the ongoing successful launch of our innovative WaveWriter Spinal Cord Stim system in the U.S. and increasing demand in Europe. In the pain segment, WaveWriter continues to gain global share due to impressive real-world results given its unique ability to offer combo waveform therapies both with paresthesia and sub-perception. We also enrolled our first patient earlier this month in the WaveWriter COMBO clinical trial which is a randomized clinical trial that will compare WaveWriter to traditional therapy.","In addition, our deep brain stimulation performance and capabilities continue to expand with strong early momentum in the U.S. and continued penetration in Europe. And we're preparing for a launch of our rechargeable and primary cell DBS system with directional leads by the end of this year. And given our differentiated technology and excellent underlying market growth, we anticipate continued strength in both SCS and DBS sales.","CRM sales grew above market at 3% and we continue to gain share as the number two share player globally in the high voltage defib segment. CRM sales gains were led by double-digit growth in defib sales reflecting strong global uptake of S-ICD and our RESONATE platform with its highly differentiated HeartLogic, heart failure alert.","In addition to continued momentum from S-ICD, we believe HeartLogic will be a long-term key differentiator for the RESONATE platform. Phase I of our MANAGE HF HeartLogic trial should complete enrollment by the end of Q1 2019 and is intended to evaluate the clinical integration of HeartLogic in managing patients with heart failure.","Turning to pacemaker segment, as forecast, sales were down low-double digits in Q3; however, last month we received FDA approval for MRI compatibility in our CRT-P devices which should improve our Brady outlook looking forward. Despite this headwind from pacing, the excellent global momentum of our defib portfolio supports our expectations for above-market CRM growth as evidenced by our low-single-digit growth year-to-date in 2018.","EP sales grew 9% in the quarter, which does represent a slowdown from recent trends. We continue to invest in this high-growth market and see good growth in our Rhythmia HDx mapping and nav platform. And we're now fully launching our DirectSense and IntellaNav MiFi OI ablation catheters in Europe. We're also rolling out LumiPoint which is the first automated algorithm to assist with high definition map integration, helping EPs accelerate clinical decisions. We also continue to invest in long-term in EP with projected year-end 2019 launches for both second gen cryo- and RF-ablation single shot balloon therapies for PDI. The Cryterion and Apama single-shot platforms respectively will complement our RHYTHMIA mapping system and therapeutic catheter platforms.","Within our Cardiovascular group, PI posted another impressive quarter, growing 11%. Growth was strong in all geographic regions. PI also delivered excellent growth across all three franchises, including peripheral artery disease, venous, and interventional oncology. We've also commenced the launch of Eluvia in the U.S., following both the outstanding results of the IMPERIAL trial which showed a superiority for Eluvia in the first head-to-head study of its kind and an earlier than expected FDA approval. We believe Eluvia has significant market opportunity given the large addressable patient population, its differentiated, sustained-release technology, and its demonstrated superior clinical outcomes with reduced need for reintervention. This launch is in the very early stages, but our sales team is fully trained. We've already received significant interest from physicians and healthcare systems around the country.","We've also achieved two important clinical milestones in the quarter in PI. We've enrolled the first patient in our SAVAL study evaluating a purpose-built drug-eluting stent for below-the-knee lesions. And secondly, we completed enrollment in the Ranger II SFA trial, which will support a targeted 2020 U.S. launch of the Ranger drug-coated balloon.","Turning now to our Interventional Cardiology business, this segment delivered 6% growth in the quarter, which is great evidence of the ongoing and successful diversification strategy of this business. Complex PCI products grew double digits through the breadth of our portfolio, new product launches and successful global expansion efforts. Our global Complex PCI results largely offset the high-single-digit declines in our coronary drug-eluting stent business. In coronary DES, we continue to work through competitive pricing headwinds, particularly in the U.S., and we're excited to be launching the new DES named Promus ELITE, which was recently FDA approved and provides a permanent polymer stent alternative for physicians while leveraging the SYNERGY delivery system. We believe that Promus ELITE will provide important support to our global tier DES segmentation strategy.","Our Structural Heart programs continued to build strong momentum and we're excited about our overall performance in this significant category, which includes the defense of our intellectual property so we may continue to sustain our cycle of innovation. We're very pleased yesterday's German court ruling that granted Boston Scientific the right to enjoin Edwards Lifesciences from selling its next-gen Ultra device in Germany. As mentioned, our increased Structural Heart revenue guidance of $475 million is due to above plan results from both our WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure and ACURATE TAVR programs and a small contribution from the recently closed Claret acquisition.","Claret developed Fentanyl, which is the only cerebral embolic protection system approved in the U.S. and Europe to protect patients against the risk of stroke during TAVI. We see significant opportunity for embolic protection in TAVI, both today and longer term, including usage with intermediate and low-risk patients and potentially other left heart and endovascular procedures. We believe the unique value of this technology is evidenced by the new technology add-on payment for Sentinel in the U.S., which went in effect October 1.","On the clinical front, we're pleased to announce that we've completed enrollment in the 50-patient LOTUS Edge (13:38) registry and submitted that data to FDA in support of our PMA submission which we filed mid-August. We've also recently filed two IDEs with the FDA, one for the REPRISE IV study, which will be used to pursue U.S. reg approval for LOTUS Edge in intermediate TAVR patients, as well as another IDE for the ACURATE neo2 study in intermediate, high, and extreme risk TAVR patients.","We've now launched ACURATE into 30 countries and continue to see excellent physician uptake for this valve, and we're excitedly prepared for the targeted LOTUS Edge launch in first quarter 2019 in Europe and mid-2019 in the U.S., which is consistent with previously communicated timelines.","Turning to WATCHMAN. WATCHMAN delivered excellent growth again this quarter as the platform continues to build very strong physician support and global positioning. All key metrics are trending well, including utilization, reorder rates, and account openings. We completed enrollment in the U.S. in the NextGen WATCHMAN FLX IDE well ahead of schedule but continue to target an EU launch of FLX in the first half of 2019. Japan remains on track for WATCHMAN launch in second half of 2019 and we continue to invest in multiple WATCHMAN market development and training programs.","So beyond organic objectives, our integration teams are highly focused on maximizing integration and success of the tuck-in acquisitions that we announced last year, or this year, which includes EMcision, Securus, NxThera, nVision, Claret, Cryterion, Veniti, and Augmenix. These acquisitions all target high-growth markets, enhance our category leadership strategy, leverage existing BSC global capabilities, and further enhance our short-term and long-term growth profile. Yeah, it's really a combination of our strong organic portfolio and commercial execution, along with tuck-in M&A that's led to our recently increased outlook for 7% to 10% operational revenue growth CAGR in 2019 and 2020. We also continue to absorb the near-term dilution of these multiple tuck-in transactions and a greater FX hit while continuing to deliver on our commitment to double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our core business has very strong momentum, and our pipeline due to both internal and external initiatives has never been stronger. We believe we are uniquely positioned to drive shareholder value due to our long-term growth profile, continued potential for operating and margin improvements, commitment to double-digit adjusted EPS growth, and improving ability to deploy capital.","So, I want thank our employees for their winning spirit, their commitment to advancing science for life, and Mr. Brennan will now provide a detailed review of our financials.","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thanks, Mike. Third quarter consolidated revenue of $2.393 billion represents 7.7% reported revenue growth and reflects a $31 million headwind from foreign exchange, which compares unfavorably to the tailwind of up to $10 million we expected at the time of guidance. On an operational basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, revenue growth was 9.1% in the quarter compared to our guidance of 7% to 8% growth. The outperformance was once again across the board, both on a business and regional basis.","In Q3, sales from recent acquisitions, primarily NxThera ad Claret, contributed approximately 40 basis points to total company growth, resulting in organic revenue growth of 8.7%. With this strong sales performance, we delivered Q3 adjusted earnings per share of $0.35, representing 12% year-over-year growth and at the high end of our guidance range of $0.33 to $0.35. Notably, this $0.35 in the quarter includes approximately $0.02 of negative FX impact, which is $0.01 to $0.02 greater than our expected $0.00 to $0.01 headwind at the time of guidance.","Adjusted gross margin for the third quarter was 72.7%, above our guidance range of 71.5% to 72% and represents an increase of 50 basis points year over year, despite a 50 basis point negative year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. This FX hit was more than offset by a mixed benefit from strong performance in our Neuromodulation business, WATCHMAN, and Men's Health franchises, as well as continued benefit from operational improvements and manufacturing cost reductions.","Adjusted SG&A expenses were $849 million or 35.5% of sales in Q3, at the high end of the range and up slightly year-over-year as we continue to fund initiatives related to recent acquisitions and focus on key commercial launches. Adjusted research and development expenses were $261 million in the quarter or 10.9% of sales, at the high end of our range, given robust clinical spend and down slightly year-over-year.","Royalty expense was 0.7% of sales, roughly flat year-over-year. As a result, adjusted operating margin was 25.6% in the quarter, towards the high end of our guidance range of 25.25% to 25.75% and represents a 50-basis-point increase year over year, which was driven by the strong adjusted gross margin result. We continue to expect our full-year adjusted operating margin to be in a range of 25.5% to 25.75%, consistent with the goals outlined at the start of the year. We believe we can deliver 50 to 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement in 2019 and 2020 as well, while also investing in our businesses and developing our recent acquisitions to drive 7% to 10% operational revenue growth.","Moving to below the line in interest and other expense, interest expense for the quarter was roughly flat to last year at $58 million versus $57 million in Q3 last year. Our average interest rate expense was 3.2% in Q3 this year compared to 3.7% in Q3 of last year. Adjusted other expense was $12 million in the third quarter and primarily included dilution from our equity method investments, adjustments to investments accounted for under the measurement alternative, as well as transactional foreign exchange losses including hedging costs. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 5.3% on a reported basis and 10.5% on an adjusted basis, below our guidance range of 13% to 14% as a result of a lower operational rate from greater clarity related to the tax reform and its impact on our tax structure. Further, we delivered Q3 2018 adjusted earnings per share of $0.35, which includes an FX headwind of $0.02. On a reported basis, GAAP EPS of $0.31 includes net charges and amortization expenses after tax of $53 million for the quarter.","We ended Q3 with $1.404 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $569 million compared to $469 million in Q3 last year. In the quarter we used cash and short-term debt to fund our recent acquisitions, as well as previously agreed upon legal settlements. We continue to expect 2018 adjusted free cash flow to be approximately $1.9 billion.","We're also making good progress on our mesh litigation with approximately 97% of all of our known claims settled or in the final stages of settlement. In the quarter, we increased our forward-looking accrual for legal fees associated with the remaining mesh cases by $18 million, but we continue to believe that our reserved amounts for case are sufficient to finalize the remaining cases and claims. Our total legal reserve, of which mesh is included, was $1.162 billion as of September 30, 2018, a decrease of $102 million from the $1.264 billion as of June 30, 2018.","In the quarter, we made cash payments of over $100 million into the qualified settlement fund, which is shown as restricted cash on our balance sheet. Our current balance of restricted cash, which is primarily related to the qualified settlement fund, is $781 million. As a result, we have approximately $300 million left to fund and the remaining balance sheet liability will be released as funds are released out of the qualified settlement fund to plaintiffs, which should occur in Q4 with a small portion in the first half of 2019 to complete the process. Capital expenditures for the third quarter 2018 were $77 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $350 million for the year as we build capacity, integrate acquisitions, and drive growth.","I'll now walk through guidance for Q4 and full-year 2018. For the full year, we expect consolidated 2018 revenue to be in the range of $9.787 billion to $9.827 billion as we narrow our full-year organic revenue growth guidance from 6% to 7% to simply 7%. We expect the contribution from acquisitions to be an additional 80 basis points of growth for the full year. Note that this includes the recently closed Augmenix acquisition as well as contributions from NxThera, Claret and Symetis in the relevant periods. For the full year we now expect foreign exchange to be a tailwind of approximately $50 million to $60 million for full-year 2018 revenue, which is a significant decrease from our prior expectations of a $125 million to $150 million tailwind due to the strengthening U.S. dollar against most major currencies.","We continue to expect our adjusted gross margin for the year as a percentage of sales to be approximately 72% for the full year, which now assumes a negative FX impact of 80 basis points for the full year, down slightly from our prior guidance of 90 basis points. We now expect our full-year adjusted SG&A expense to be at the high end of our previous range at approximately 35% of sales, as we're seeing the benefits of operating expense control programs currently underway while also investing to further enhance our short-term and long-term growth profile, particularly with initiatives related to our recent acquisitions.","Similarly, we now expect full-year adjusted R&D spending to be approximately 10.5% to 11% of sales and continue to expect full-year royalty rates to remain at slightly less than 1% of sales for 2018. This implies a full-year 2018 adjusted operating margin in a range of 25.5% to 25.75%, which is consistent with prior guidance.","Turning to tax, we now expect our full-year 2018 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 12%, which reflects an operational rate of approximately 13% and an approximate 100 basis points of benefit from the accounting standard for stock compensation, the majority of which was already reflected in our year-to-date tax rate. As a reminder, we recorded a $0.06, or $82 million noncash tax benefit in Q4 resulting from the IRS settlement for the 2001 to 2010 tax years. As previously disclosed, we continue to explore strategies to reinvest this $0.06 tax benefit into our tax structure with the goal of reducing our operational tax rate in 2019 and beyond, below our previously announced goal of 15%.","The strategies we are exploring would optimize our structure, leveraging differences in tax rates by jurisdictions. Based on the work we've completed to date, we believe this $0.06 reinvestment will not have a material cash consequence. It will occur in Q4 of 2018 and will result in an approximate 27% adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter. Given that our year-to-date adjusted tax rate through Q3 is 6.5%, this Q4 adjusted tax rate of 27% will result in our full year adjusted guidance of 12%; thus you can see there is no impact to our full-year adjusted tax rate as we're simply reinvesting the $82 million benefit in Q4 that we recorded in Q2.","Accordingly, we do not expect an impact of full-year adjusted earnings per share as a result of either the Q2 tax benefit or the Q4 re-investment. To be clear, our fourth quarter EPS guidance, which I will discuss in a moment, will include this reinvestment expense of $0.06. However, we encourage you to exclude both the Q2 benefit of $0.06 and the Q4 reinvestment of $0.06 when you model the underlying business performance thus net neutral to full-year 2018 adjusted EPS.","Moving below the line, we continue to expect these expenses which include interest payments, dilution from our venture capital portfolio and costs associated with our hedging program to be approximately $300 million for the full year. Finally, we expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.405 billion shares for Q4 and 1.401 billion shares for the full year 2018. We're narrowing our full-year 2018 adjusted earnings per share range to $1.38 to $1.40 representing 10% to 11% adjusted earnings growth. Importantly, this now includes a negative FX impact of $0.04 or $0.05 which is an increase of $0.01 versus prior expectations of $0.03 to $0.04 due to recent rate movements.","While FX continues to be a headwind for us in 2018, we believe if rates hold constant, FX should become relatively neutral for our EPS in 2019, as we've previously said, but we will provide additional details with our guidance in early 2019.","As a reminder, in addition to the $0.04 to $0.05 of negative FX, our adjusted EPS guidance also includes $0.02 to $0.03 of dilution expected from product and market development activities required for the acquisitions we've completed in 2018, consistent with our Q2 earnings call. On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $1.08 to $1.10.","Now turning to Q4, 2018, we expect consolidated revenue to be in a range of $2.525 billion to $2.565 billion representing year-over-year organic growth of 6% to 7%. Our guidance for the fourth quarter reflects the ongoing momentum from the business but also has the more difficult comp from Q4 last year which is 250 basis points greater than the Q3 2017 comp on an organic basis.","In the fourth quarter, we expect an additional 120 basis points contribution from recent acquisitions and expect the foreign exchange impact to be a headwind of $30 million to $40 million.","For the fourth quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.30 to $0.32 per share, including the expected $0.06 reinvestment of the Q2 2018 tax benefit, and representing an EPS decline of 13% to 7% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the expected $0.06 tax reinvestment, our adjusted earnings per share guidance is $0.36 to $0.38 which represents 4% to 10% growth, and we encourage you to model using this guidance range.","Fourth quarter GAAP EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.15 to $0.17 per share.","Please check our Investor Relations website for Q3 2018 financial and operational highlights which outlines Q3 results as well as Q4 and full-year 2018 guidance, including P&L line item guidance.","With that, I'll turn it back to Susie who will moderate the Q&A.","Susan Vissers Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thanks, Dan. Greg, let's open it up to questions for the next 30 minutes or so. Please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. Greg, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Oh, thanks and good morning.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Morning, Bob.","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Morning, Bob.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Morning. So, just two quick things and congrats on another very strong quarter. First, just given the announcement yesterday on the German court ruling, I have sort of a procedural question. So, now you guys have the right to enjoin Edwards in Germany. Is there f a date by which you need to make a decision on next steps and whether or not you'll enforce that injunction?","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yes, for the Ultra injunction that was announced yesterday, it's 30 days. So, it's basically November 23.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. So, you need to make a decision by then on what you're going to do?","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","On Ultra, yes. On S3 Ultra, yes. That's correct.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then just a question, a little bit of a bigger picture question. The Street obviously has a lot of confidence in your ability to drive top-line growth, but it's always hard for us to model certain things like short-term deal dilution and I appreciate your comments on currency. But on the notion of short-term deal-related dilution, could you offer any preliminary thoughts on what the impact of that deal dilution might be for next year relative to the $0.02 to $0.03 this year? And just maybe some preliminary thoughts on whether or not the Street is accurately capturing those headwinds in the current consensus of $1.58?","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah, Bob, we won't give a specific number relative to what the dilution is. We did give that, obviously, for this year being that $0.02 to $0.03. I'm happy that we have the financial strength that's allowing to us offset that this year and that's always the goal. As we've always stated and consistently delivered, our goal is double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth and I would assume that that's no different as we head forward. So, it's about making a tradeoff. We certainly want to make sure we give the care and feeding necessary to those acquisitions so they can drive that 7% to 10% growth for 2019 and 2020 and hopefully beyond that timeframe as well. And we're pretty well-heeled in making those tradeoffs and delivering that double-digit EPS growth.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","But you don't think the Street is missing anything big picture?","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","I wouldn't comment on, specifically on what the Street has. We'll obviously give guidance in early 2019, but our goal is always double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth and should be no different going forward.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Fair enough. Thank you very much.","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Just two for me. One on the top and one on the bottom. Just looking to the fourth quarter, guys, you're modeling to modest organic acceleration into the fourth quarter, which I think is notable only because you haven't done that all year. So, what are some of those drivers in the fourth quarter and what does that tell us, if anything, about your confidence in organic acceleration heading into 2019? And then I had a quick follow-up.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thanks, Dave. I think if you just look at the business, it's broadly-based. It's performing at a pretty high level. Strong diversification across them with, in third quarter, MedSurg growing 11%, Rhythm and Neuro 8%, Cardio 7%. So, as you look to the fourth quarter and also the regions, U.S. 9%, Europe 7%, and Asia 8%, so we're seeing very well-balanced, diversified growth across regions and businesses and we expect that momentum to continue in fourth quarter. We did have some important new approvals like Eluvia, but we don't anticipate that making a significant impact until really first quarter 2019. So, we really see just the continued momentum of the business and we continue to invest for what will be this 7% to 10% operational growth CAGR in 2019-2020. So it's really just a continuation of our momentum that we have, new product launches. And as you indicated, we have a tougher comp in fourth quarter, about 250 basis points higher than third quarter.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","But, Mike, is it reasonable to assume \u2013 obviously, we're getting operational acceleration next year. Should we also expect organic acceleration next year?","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah, we'll give guidance in due course here. We talk about 7% to 10%, and during that piece we think about 150 basis points of that 7% to 10% comes from M&A. So, that leaves 5.5% to 8.5% organic, which is pretty strong. And we've got \u2013 you heard in my comments that were lengthy that we've got significant product launches coming across each major segment. So, we're very confident in that 7% to 10% and we've got a nice track record delivering it.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And very helpful and clear, Mike. And then, Dan, just a couple follow-ups here on earnings next year. I know you're not, in keeping with historic practice, not going to give us the number for 2019, unfortunately. But there are a couple pieces in your script I wanted to push you on a little bit. The first is FX. Most people would have assumed an FX headwind next year, certainly to revenue. You mentioned neutral effect to earnings. Maybe help us understand that. The tax reinvestment this year, does it imply that we could see some positive movement on the tax rate for next year? And then the 50 to 100 basis points of margin expansion, are you still confident in that number, even if you move forward with the significant Millipede investment? Thanks so much.","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah, sure. There's a lot there. Let me hit them one at a time. So, FX, yes. We've obviously kind of snapped the line with where rates are today and have a very successful hedging program that we've put in place over time. And with what we see today with where rates are today, we'd kind of see FX being neutral at an EPS line as we get to 2019. Obviously, when we give guidance, we'll update that, but that's kind of where we'd be today.","Tax, yes. If we're successful in being able to reinvest, which we believe we will be, reinvest that $0.06, $82 million one-time benefit here in the fourth quarter, we would expect to be able to bring down that 15% operational tax rate guidance that we've given for 2019 and 2020. So, that is clearly the goal and we'll give you more information on that when we give guidance. And then the 50 to 100 basis point, yes, that's the goal that we've had, that's the goal we've established and for 2019 and 2020, that should absolutely be doable.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Mills from Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","Jason Richard Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Good morning, Mike and Dan. Thanks for taking the question. Have a more 20,000-foot question on MedSurg and then a question on U.S. Structural Heart. First on MedSurg, Mike, that business has been a leader for you, both in growth and margins for quite some time, and not all that much of your M&A activity has occurred in MedSurg. Could you talk a bit about the targeted addressable markets in MedSurg? You've gotten into BPH now, Augmenix is a new TAM. Could you talk about those TAMs merging with the existing ones that you already have relative to the rest of your business? I know you're excited about all of your business, but this one gets maybe a little bit less attention. I'd just be interested in your assessment of the TAMs there over the longer term. And then I had a follow-up on the Structural Heart.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah. So, thanks for the question. We spend a lot of internal time on our Endo and Uro businesses. We think they have really unique category leadership in the industry in MedTech. Both of them do, at this point, and significant scale now globally. So, you know, just the Endo business, there has been lighter M&A activity in the Endo business. Very high percentage of that business is revenue growth, which has been impressive, being 12% in Q3 through organic initiatives. And so, we invest a strong amount in R&D, being very efficient with it and we've got a strong product cadence and we continue to expand globally, but a little bit less M&A activity and more organic the last 12 months in Endo.","Uro, we've been very active with M&A. We've done three acquisitions in Uro. Really, we think \u2013 I hate to say \u2013 I won't say cement. That's too cocky, but to really give us a very strong category leadership position in urology with the recent acquisitions of Augmenix, NxThera and also expansion into Women's Health with nVision. So, it's a similar playbook as Endo. They're a little less diversified in terms of the geographic commercial results. But they're just very strong portfolios, very strong innovation cadence coming, and maybe most importantly, divisions that they deliver on their commitments and they continue to invest for the long term. On the total adjustable market, I don't know, Dan, do you have any comments on that?","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah, we really haven't \u2013 It's part of the kind of the mid to high teens of billions of markets that we're adding over the next two to three years in the new technologies that we're addressing, both organically and also through acquisitions. So, we haven't given specific numbers. We did include in the financial operations highlights on our website a nice little summary of acquisitions. So, you can kind of refer to that, but we haven't put out the TAM buy acquisition at this point. I'd imagine we'll talk more about that as we get to Investor Day next year as well.","Jason Richard Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","That's helpful. I guess, Mike and Dan, where I was going with that is it's been a leader in both growth and margins for a while. Given the acquisitions, would you expect that to continue say over the next couple of years? And then I'll just ask my follow-up as well. In Structural Heart, clearly when you had to pull back a little bit on LOTUS in the U.S. market for TAVR, it seemed WATCHMAN benefited from the incremental focus from that sales force in the United States. And so, as you prepare for launch in the United States with LOTUS Edge, how might your sales force change? Will you need to add to it? Will there be incremental spending there? Or do you feel like you're ready at this point to market both products full force whenever the FDA approves LOTUS Edge? Thank you very much.","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Sure. I can take the acquisition one and then Mike can do the second one. So on the acquisition front, we've obviously done a series of acquisitions this year. Still have a tremendous amount of financial flexibility; debt to EBITDA 2.4 times at the end of Q3, obviously, putting some of the legacy liabilities, particularly mesh, behind us. So, as you look at 2019 and 2020 and cash flow that hopefully should be north of $2 billion in each of those years, still gives us ample capacity to be able to continue to execute our strategy, which is category leadership. So, I would look for us to continue to do acquisitions that fill out the portfolio.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah, and on the sales coverage area, we feel very comfortable there. In terms of WATCHMAN which is doing really remarkably well, it's all about increasing utilization. So, the sales reps' requirements to open up new centers really has declined significantly over the past three years because we have so many centers that are open. So, there's still a few new center openings that account for the revenue but the bulk of it really is a combination of what we call therapy awareness reps, helping, working in partnership with the customers or the hospitals to drive awareness, physician training, and increased utilization. And so, it's a pretty significant, I would say, clinical exercise and therapy awareness exercise, and a little bit less on the traditional sales, new account openings. That will now shift over to the TAVR responsibility for a lot of those reps. So, by geography, there's different models. Sometimes we have separate reps, sometimes we combine reps. It depends on what the situation is. But we'll continue to invest in both our WATCHMAN clinical team and also continue to make investments as we do a smart launch of our LOTUS platform in the U.S. with clinical reps and sales reps.",".","Jason Richard Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. One on Eluvia, one on litigation. So, starting with Eluvia, Mike, can you talk a little bit about the pricing strategy? We've heard you've priced it at a substantial premium to Zilver in the U.S. Can you talk about your plans and expectations for a new tech add-on payment and a pass-through payment and how that could impact near-term and mid-term Eluvia sales? And I had one follow-up.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah, thank you very much. You did a nice report on that this week. Well done. So, I really won't comment on our pricing strategy, really for competitive reasons. And so, we do think that Eluvia has demonstrated superior results with the platform, given the IMPERIAL data and so we do believe that the product should be priced at a premium, and we are pursuing an NTAP in the inpatient environment. And so, we'll hopefully hear news on that by the end of the first quarter time period. So, we think a combination of the superior results should help drive a premium price and we'll work smartly to try to receive additional reimbursement add-on payments currently as planned in the inpatient center.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. And Mike, it would seem that the Edwards litigation is ripe for some type of resolution soon because you only have 30 days, as you mentioned earlier to exercise your option to enjoin Ultra in Germany. If you don't exercise your option on Ultra, you'd lose some of your leverage. Investors have assumed that you haven't enjoined Sapien 3 in Germany because you've been supply constrained, but that situation I believe is changing. I'd love to hear your thoughts on those topics. Thanks for taking the questions.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah, so the great news is, as you know, we've made really strong progress with both LOTUS and ACURATE. So, our ability to supply with ACURATE has been significantly enhanced over the past year, the ops team's done a great job with that and we continue to actually build another facility to support ACURATE. And we're excited about the launch of LOTUS in Europe.","So overall, the strength and capabilities of our TAVR supply and capabilities continue to get stronger. I won't make any comments other than we're really pleased and it's the results that we expected. So, we have really demonstrated in proving our patents out in Germany with S3, including the appeal trial and we're pleased with the results of the Ultra enjoinment with ACURATE's capability. So, we've got some options here and I think we'll continue to play it out.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning and thank you for taking the question. I have two of them. The first one is is, could you give us a little bit of a State of the Union on your Neuromodulation franchise? This year, you have sales of the WaveWriter SCS and the Vercise DBS, which is helping that along.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Sure. Just \u2013 I'm sorry, just broad comments on how we're doing with SCS and DBS?","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Whatever you can share would be wonderful. Thank you.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Okay. Yeah, I think Maulik and our global team have done a very nice job. We've talked about WaveWriter for a while and its ability to have the diversity, flexibility of waveforms, paresthesia based and non-paresthesia based. And I think really what we're seeing is the adoption of that and then longer-term clinical benefits. So, we're seeing stronger reorder rates from current customers as we continue to grab new physicians as well. So, I think it's really the proven clinical outcomes that's driving the adoption at comfort level and we continue to try to improve the ease of use of training and programming, which we'll continue to do in 2019 to drive more adoption. And also, you're seeing greater outside the U.S. \u2013 I hate that word, but greater adoption in Europe and the Asia markets for our Spinal Cord Stim business.","In DBS, we're early phases in U.S. Europe's really the footprint there, the blueprint for the U.S. We have our new platforms all approved in Europe and we're doing quite well there. And in Deep Brain Stimulation, that should be a nice tailwind for us in 2019, once we have our directional lead approved which we expect likely by the end of this year, early first quarter. So, DBS should be nice additional boost for us in 2019. We'll have some tougher comps for Spinal Cord Stim throughout 2019, but the business has a lot of momentum.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. And as my follow-up, I want to shift a little bit to the Structural Heart franchise. In Europe, you have ACURATE in 30 centers, how do you think about now launching LOTUS into that market and into those centers? And then anything that you can share with us on how you plan on approaching the United States next year would be great. Thank you.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah, so, Dr. Meredith can comment. We're pleased with our ACURATE performance and LOTUS coming back to market in Europe. A lot of physicians have broad experience in Europe with LOTUS prior to us pulling it off the markets. And so, there's a lot of enthusiasm for doctors to get LOTUS back in their hands. I was just over in Italy last week, and it's very encouraging to hear. You had many ACURATE users at this large confidence in Italy, many doctors who had used LOTUS before and they see \u2013 some doctors see specific clinical areas, bicuspid or heavy calcified valves that they want to use LOTUS. Some want to use it routinely. And so I think having the combination of both platforms gives us a unique competitive advantage.","And then, I think what you'll see particularly in the U.S. and a little more slowly in Europe is the support of Claret, the embolic protection. So that business and opportunity continues to grow. So, I think offering physicians the uniqueness of both ACURATE and LOTUS with Claret positions us pretty well. Dr. Meredith any comments?","Ian T. Meredith - Boston Scientific Corp.","I can't really add much, Mike, other than that they clearly are complementary and while both valves could be a workhorse, there will be specific indications for the use of both. But perhaps one thing I could add is that LOTUS will be an ideal valve for low-volume users just simply because it's completely repositionable. So, we see that the added advantage of LOTUS in low volume on new centers as well. So, complementary strategy, obviously specific indications might favor one over the other, but it's a case of better to have two than one.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thanks, Joanne.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. First question on ICD growth in the quarter. Very strong. You called out S-ICD, you called out RESONATE. There's also a replacement tailwind. But was there any one driver that stood out or did all three of those drivers equally contribute to the strong growth in the quarter? And I had a follow-up.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Sure. They all contributed. The greatest contributions come from S-ICD and RESONATE and the tailwind from the replacement's kind of about a point or so. So, more significant contribution from the execution of the launches. And I think S-ICD, and Dr. Stein can comment, it just continues to build momentum and I think greater comfort level with physicians. We see that business really growing extremely well in Asia, Europe and the U.S. as the clinical data continues to be strong and comfort level. So, I think that's a continued long-term competitive advantage for us with S-ICD.","And, I give to Joe and the team a lot of credit for HeartLogic. That was a significant investment over multiple years, and I think it's positioned the RESONATE platform to have a uniquely differentiated heart failure alert that we believe will perform significantly better than competitors' products that had previously been in the market but, quite frankly, not used. And so we think this will be a very unique opportunity to reduce heart failure readmissions and to differentiate the RESONATE beyond its longevity and other capabilities.","Dr. Stein, any further thoughts there?","Kenneth Stein, M.D. - Boston Scientific Corp.","No, thanks, Mike. Yeah, Glenn, I would just sort of add maybe a little bit of color to what Mike said. Again, S-ICD I think very clearly has increased comfort, particularly in the U.S. We did report results as a late-breaker HRS earlier this year showing significant reduction in appropriate shocks with our new SMART Pass filter technology, and those results I think have had an impact in increasing folks' comfort using it. And then particularly in Japan, we've been very pleased with the uptake of the device in that market. And in terms of heart failure and the RESONATE launch, again, having the only FDA-approved alert system for OED compensation and heart failure is really getting us traction in not just among our implanting physician community but also in the referring physician community and particularly in the heart failure community and that's had a significant impact in enabling us to drive growth in our high voltage devices.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then, just as a follow-up, you had, as you mentioned, across the board strength here in the third quarter with the only areas of weakness being U.S. drug eluting stents and pacemakers. But in your prepared remarks, you highlighted a new drug eluting stent launch, you highlighted new pacing launches. So as I think about 2019, can these businesses improve and can these businesses actually grow for you in 2019? Thanks.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Well, we'll outline that quite a bit more in the coming months. I think the pacemaker piece should improve generally in 2019 with new product launches and easier comps. And defibs will be a little bit trickier in 2019 with tougher comps, but we have a unique platform that we just talked about with RESONATE and S-ICD to continue to grow that. So, I think broadly in 2019, you'll see CRM continue to grow above market. I know a lot of companies say that, but we actually continue to do that in CRM. So, I think that'll be good.","I think in DES, that's our toughest segment in terms of market, given the pricing pressure there. But this ELITE solution will be a nice segmented offering because what it will enable us to do is offer customers who want better economics, a permanent polymer stent to match our two biggest competitors, global competitors, and then to further differentiate our synergy bioresorbable polymer at more of a premium. So, it's a nice way for us to position best in class delivery system with synergy with a durable polymer to match some of the competitive headwinds that we see in price. And then use that to then further differentiate synergy a bit more. So, I think it's a nice strategy, and hopefully we'll see some improvement next year in DES.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right. Thanks, Mike.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thanks, Glenn.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan, please go ahead.","Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could talk about the sustainability of Urology. We saw mid-teens growth in Stone and high-single digit in Men's Health. That's well above the market. Maybe help us understand what's driving that and what are some of the product launches and dynamics that could help to keep that where it is?","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yes, happy to do that. The Urology business has \u2013 we have a lot of faith in it. First of all, we have a very strong leadership team there globally that delivers on the commitments and that's why we've tripled down with three acquisitions in that business this year. It's a \u2013 I would say broadly the demographics are very good. The ability for us to expand that business globally are significant. It's our least global business that we have in terms of the revenue mix and higher concentration in the U.S. So, I would start off with we have a very strong team. I could talk about the portfolio second. The international expansion efforts are likely the greatest of all the divisions at Boston in Urology. And then third, we just had a very, very strong innovation cadence and current pipeline.","We just recently, in the last month continue to advance our ability in stone retrieval with a combination delivery platform, as well as a basket combined into one user interface. I'm blanking on the name of the new product, but the team continues to reinvent and innovate in core Stone through that device as well as our visualization capabilities. And that uniqueness is driving pull through of the core business. And then you're seeing very strong additional new market entries with our NxThera BPH platform that complements our laser platform. We're very excited about Augmenix and the ability for us to leverage our commercial footprint and offer that platform to radiation oncologists as well as to urologists in the outpatient center. It's already reimbursed, nice FDA approval. So, I think you're seeing just very strong core products, innovation in our core, and these new adjacencies in global growth. And late-breaker news, the name of that product I was thinking of is LithoVue Empower.",".","Robbie J. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Coming out of TCP there's a lot of excitement in the mitral valve, the tricuspid space. You have the Millipede device which you're going to close on that transaction in early next year if I'm not mistaken. Can you maybe spend a minute on your strategy in mitral and tricuspid and help us understand maybe what's in the pipeline or is the scenario that we should see continued investment in externally? Thanks.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","I'll have Dr. Ian Meredith help me out on that one.","Ian T. Meredith - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thank you very much. Obviously, mitral valve disease is a very important space. Ageing community globally, and increasing burden of heart failure, so the treatment of functional mitral regurgitation by percutaneous approach, I think is here to stay. And we certainly saw those results with COAPT, which actually fueled this. So obviously, first step for Millipede is to complete the current study, the requirements we have in the current study and then to arrange a CFS study and a concomitant CE Mark study then plan our U.S. IDE strategy thereafter. And course this is a foundational element to our functional mitral regurgitation and indeed tricuspid valve platform. So, you'll need a toolbox to do this, as we say. It's not one device to treat all problems. So, we see the annuloplasty device, subcutaneous annuloplasty device as being foundational, very good standalone treatment for functional mitral regurgitation, but it also provides a basis for other therapies to be added on in the future as well.","Susan Vissers Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.","Greg, we'll take one more, please.","Operator","Okay. Your final question today comes from the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Hey, guys, congrats on a nice quarter and thanks for taking my question. Two really quick ones. One, LOTUS, I didn't get the timeline for the launch in Europe, so if you could clarify that. And second, Dan, on EPS headwinds from FX, it looks like Street had mis-modeled on the FX headwinds. Would we be accurate in thinking, versus Street models, maybe FX is a little bit \u2013 we should be modeling a little bit more headwinds into 2019, just given where rates are? Thank you.","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah, I can take the FX.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","The first one's easier, first quarter. First quarter LOTUS, Europe.","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Right. First quarter 2019 for LOTUS in Europe and FX actually is pretty easy as well. I think I hit part of this in the prepared remarks. For 2019, if you look at where rates are today, if you kind of snap that line today with where our rates are and where our hedging programs are, we would say it's neutral. So, just I would say it's neutral for 2019. Depending on where things go from now to then, we'll update you when we give guidance, but I think putting it in neutral for now is probably a safe bet.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks, guys.","Susan Vissers Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.","With that, we'd like to conclude the call.

Welcome to the Boston Scientific Q3 2017 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to Susie Lisa. Please go ahead.","Susan Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thank you, Stacy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q3 2017 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Investors\/Filings\/Quarterly Results and non-GAAP reconciliations.","The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Mike will provide strategic and revenue highlights for Q3 2017; Dan will review the financials for the quarter, and then Q4 2017 and full year 2017 guidance; and then, we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Ian Meredith, and Dr. Ken Stein.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that, on the call, operational revenue growth is defined as excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Organic revenue growth is defined as excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and sales from the acquisitions of EndoChoice and Symetis over the relevant prior year period. In Mike and Dan's remarks, all references to growth are on an organic year-over-year basis unless otherwise specified. Also of note, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share, new product approvals and launches, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance, including sales, margins, earnings and other Q4 and full year 2017 guidance, as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses.","Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them.","At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Well done, Susie. Good morning, everyone. Boston Scientific delivered strong results, again, in third quarter 2017 with both revenue and EPS coming in at the high end of our guidance range despite a 9% organic revenue growth comparison in Q3 2016. Operational revenue growth of 6% and organic revenue growth of 4% reflects strong execution by our global teams and the success of our category lead strategy.","We leveraged the 6% operational revenue growth in the quarter to deliver a 16% adjusted EPS growth, or $0.31 per share, which is the high end of our guidance range. Also, if you exclude the $0.02 negative impact of foreign exchange, adjusted EPS grew 23% year-over-year. This EPS growth reflects an 80 basis point year-over-year improvement in adjusted operating margin to 25.1%, led by a solid 72.2% gross margin and the 100 basis point reduction to year-over-year in SG&A spending to 35.2% of revenue.","We're also excited about our plans to close out 2017, build upon our global momentum and drive sustainable long-term growth in 2018 and beyond. We're also narrowing our full-year 2017 operational revenue growth guidance to an estimated 7% growth, which includes an approximate 120 basis point full-year impact from the EndoChoice and Symetis acquisitions.","We're also narrowing our full-year adjusted EPS guidance to $1.24 to $1.27, which represents 11% to 14% earnings growth. This revised adjusted EPS guidance includes an expected $0.07 to $0.08 negative impact, or approximate 700 basis point headwind, from foreign exchange.","I'll now provide some highlights on third quarter 2017 results and thoughts to finish out the year. We continue to grow faster than market in most all of our businesses and regions. We also delivered consistent organic revenue growth in every geography, led by 8% growth in AMEA, 5% in Europe, and 3% in the U.S. We also continued to outperform in the Emerging Markets with 18% growth in the quarter, including 23% in China.","I'll start with MedSurg highlights. The three MedSurg businesses together delivered 8% organic revenue growth and 10% operational growth, including the EndoChoice acquisition, which continues to deliver above our deal plan. In Endo, organic revenue grew 5% in Q3 and 10% including the EndoChoice, led by strong performance from the Spy DS [SpyGlass DS] Visualization System, AXIOS platform, Res 360 Hemostasis Clip and EndoChoice ambulatory surgery center portfolio. We do expect Endo to return back to mid to high single-digit growth rates in the fourth quarter.","We have now completed the integration of EndoChoice and revenue is ahead of plan, contributing 75 basis points to total growth in the quarter. We continue to be pleased with the results from our expanding presence in the ambulatory surgery center market, led by differentiated offerings in GI pathology and infection prevention.","Our Urology and Pelvic Health businesses continued this streak of double-digit organic revenue growth, led by our Single-Use Digital LithoVue Ureteroscope and products to treat men's health and pelvic floor conditions. The overall 10% growth across Uro\/PH is particularly notable in light of a 13% growth comparison in Q3 2016.","Emerging market sales continue to accelerate, led by our stone and men's health franchises. In our men's health business, we look forward to future developmental launch of new products now that the FDA Warning Letter was lifted during the third quarter from our Minnetonka, Minnesota facility.","In Neuromodulation, revenue grew 11% in Q3, driven by strength in spinal cord stimulation market, sales of our Montage MRI platform, as well as continued strong uptake of the Vercise MRI Deep Brain Stimulation System in Europe. The strength in the SCS market reinforces the need for flexible technology platforms, like Spectra, that can enable physicians to address the unique needs of patients suffering from pain.","We are deep into preparations for our expected launch of Vercise into the U.S. deep brain stimulation market, which we expect by year-end 2017 or early 2018, followed by a Directional Lead and MRI conditional labeling expected in 2018.","Now, I'll turn to Cardiovascular. This group grew 3% against a very difficult 12% growth comparison in Q3 2016. Peripheral Interventions was up 5% on strong growth in Asia and Latin America. We continue to see solid growth from across the portfolio, including drug-eluting technologies Eluvia Stent and Ranger Balloon in Europe, Jetstream Atherectomy and OptiCross intravascular ultrasound, now in the second quarter of launch for our Peripheral applications.","In September, at the CIRSE European conference, we presented compelling data from both drug-eluting platforms, Eluvia DES and Ranger DCB, both with mid-80% ranges rates of freedom from TLR. While 2018 will be a quieter year for new product launches in PI, the globalization momentum continues and the pipeline is very strong for 2019 and 2020.","Our Interventional Cardiology business grew operational revenue 4% and organic revenue 2%, in light of a 13% growth comp in Q3 2016. Our performance was led by strong sales of our WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure device, our portfolio of complex PCI products and above-plan contribution from the Symetis ACURATE platform in Europe.","The WATCHMAN platform had another excellent quarter and continues to build global momentum as our market development efforts continue. The U.S. continues to be our largest and most important market, and we're pleased to announce that, effective October 1, Medicare reimbursement rates for DRG 274, to which 93% of WATCHMAN implants map to, increased by an average of 10.6%. We also continue to drive multiple market development efforts for WATCHMAN to increase physician and patient awareness. We now expect to end 2017 with over 375 accounts implanting WATCHMAN, while continuing to see increased reorder rates in previously opened accounts.","We're also making good progress on building the WATCHMAN franchise outside the U.S. China is off to a solid start and we hit a new monthly record for implants in September. At last month's Asia-Pac HRS, WATCHMAN was showcased by principle investigators from the Japan SALUTE Approval Trial, where we remain on track to launch in 2019.","Also, at Asia-Pac HRS, investigators presented the WATCHMAN Asia-Pac Registry, which showed a 99% implant success rate and an 82% low risk ischemic stroke rate compared to expected outcomes at one year, while also avoiding the bleeding risk associated with long-term anticoagulation. We continue to make strong progress, both clinically and commercially, with WATCHMAN and view it as a significant long-term growth driver.","Products for complex PCI procedures grew double-digits, led by strong Atherectomy and Cutting Balloon sales. Our PCI Guidance business grew single-digits and continues to build momentum with strong IVUS sales in the launch, our integrative fractional flow reserve platform.","Global DES sales declined low single-digits in the quarter, reflecting a very challenging 14% growth comp in Q3 2016. Within DES, we will continue to invest in our market leading SYNERGY platform with multiple new portfolio enhancements in progress.","Turning to TAVR, we continue to see very strong clinical and commercial performance with the ACURATE neo Valve across Europe, as integration activities remain on target. ACURATE demonstrated strong year-over-year growth, ahead of our expectations, and continues to take market share. Positive clinical data also continues to emerge with ACURATE, as seen just this week in a publication in JACC: Interventions (sic) [JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions], comparing ACURATE to SAPIEN S3, which we will discuss in greater detail during our TCT Investor webcast Monday, along with more insights into our clinical program.","We also continue to make progress bringing LOTUS back into the market. Our mid-2018 timeline for the U.S. of LOTUS Edge remains unchanged. We are nearing completion of our PMA submission with two of the three required modules already submitted to FDA in the third quarter. This includes a clinical module which was filed in August, and we continue to target submission of the final technical module and completion of the PMA submission by year-end or potentially January.","In Europe we're also working closely with a notified body to provide pertinent information in review of our Notice of Change submission, which is standard submission path for an update to a CE Mark design dossier. Depending on the review time needed by European regulators, we now expect to launch LOTUS Edge in Europe in first quarter 2018, which would represent a delay from our original expectation for year-end in 2017.","We expect this minor delay to LOTUS timelines will have minimal impact and will help ensure the utmost long-term success of LOTUS and our Component and Structural Heart franchise, which we believe will be uniquely positioned to address the needs of physician and patients with a differentiated TAVR portfolio. Importantly, we now expect to exceed our $275 million Structural Heart revenue guidance for 2017 and we look forward to providing you with additional details around our multiple TAVR and WATCHMAN clinical programs at our TCT webcast on Monday from Denver.","Our Rhythm Management business grew faster than market at 1% in the third quarter. Our focus on Rhythm Management profitability has also paid off, resulting in another quarter with strong operating margins of 19.4%, which is up 230 basis points year-over-year.","As for product trends, high voltage sales grew low-single digits and double-digit growth with our EMBLEM S-ICD, strong early launch feedback on our new Resonate platform in Europe and, now with MRI compatibility approval in the U.S. We're also very excited by the ongoing launch of the recently approved Resonate ICD CRT-D platform into the U.S. market. We believe Resonate brings entirely new and compelling capabilities to the CRM space with the introduction of the HeartLogic Heart Failure Diagnostic.","HeartLogic can proactively predict worsening heart failure more than four weeks in advance with the highest level of predictability in the market, 70% sensitivity in the MultiSENSE trial and less than two unexplained alerts per patient year. Furthermore, the Resonate device has enabled backward compatible MRI labeling, they're equipped with MultiSite Pacing and offer the benefits of our best-in-industry longevity technology.","Brady patient sales declined modestly as we fully anniversaried the launch of our U.S. ACCOLADE MRI Brady pulse generator, INGEVITY patient lead.","Turning to EP, we grew sales 18% in the quarter led by improved uptake of our RHYTHMIA HDx platform globally. We launched the INTELLANAV MIFI OPEN-IRRIGATED therapeutic catheters in the EU and U.S., and we expect to begin early European commercialization of our DirectSense technology shortly, followed by the U.S. launch in the first half of 2018.","We're also excited by the recently announced acquisition of Apama Medical, which allows us to expand into the single-shot pulmonary vein isolation ablation market, which is a potential $1 billion market by 2022. This multi-electrode single shot RF balloon catheter is designed to provide greater ease of use, improve visualization and more complete pulmonary vein isolation. The Apama design combines the primary benefits of differentiated energy levels via RF and shorter procedure times via balloon-based ablation approaches. Apama nicely complements our rhythm portfolio and will be integrated into our RHYTHMIA HDx Mapping and Nav platform. Our goal is to gain CE Mark for the Apama single-shot balloon by year-end 2018 and begin U.S. clinical trial enrollment in early 2019.","So, to close this out, Boston Scientific's portfolio strategy, our effective globalization efforts and a execution focus are working and they continue to deliver strong and differentiated results. Also, as outlined in detail at our Investor Day back in June, we believe that we are well positioned to continue our performance track record into 2018, importantly, while accelerating our performance in 2019 and 2020. I want to thank our employees for their winning spirit and commitment to advancing science for life.","Dan will now provide a detailed review of our financials.","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thanks, Mike. Third quarter consolidated reported revenue of $2.222 billion represents 6% growth on a reported and operational basis, which excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency and is at the high end of our guidance range of 5% to 6%. Our reported revenue reflects a $3 million headwind from foreign exchange, which is $17 million or approximately 80 basis points less than the $20 million headwind expected at the time of guidance. Further, excluding the 140 basis point contribution from acquisitions, organic revenue was at the higher end of guidance with 4.3% growth.","Although immaterial to the quarter overall, our revenue growth reflects a modest impact in the 10 basis point to 20 basis point range from the hurricanes in the quarter, which impacted procedures. Our thoughts are with those impacted by the hurricane and I'd like to reiterate Mike's thanks to our employees for their winning spirit, particularly on their ability to serve the needs of customers and patients throughout the many weather-related challenges this quarter.","We delivered Q3 adjusted earnings per share of $0.31, also at the high end of our guidance range of $0.29 to $0.31, and representing 16% year-over-year growth. This double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth was driven primarily by the strong sales growth and P&L line item metrics that were in line with our guidance ranges.","Adjusted gross margin for the third quarter was 72.2% compared to 72.5% in Q3 last year and, significantly, includes a year-over-year negative 120 basis point impact from foreign exchange, which is 40 basis points more than our guidance of 80 basis points. Revenue benefited from the euro strengthening, but since we are largely hedged for 2017, there is little corresponding benefit in gross profit, which negatively impacts the gross margin rate. Adjusted gross margin for the quarter represents a 30 basis point decrease over prior year, as manufacturing cost reductions and favorable product mix from continued strength in our WATCHMAN and men's health franchises were slightly offset by the gross margin phenomena I just mentioned, as well as onetime unfavorable variances in our Puerto Rico facility due to Hurricane Maria.","Due to the great efforts by our team, our Puerto Rico plant is currently running at 90% capacity. While we do not expect any material ongoing impacts as a result of the storm, it remains a challenging situation and, after our number one priority of our employees and their well-being, our key business priorities are continuing to work to eliminate our current dependency upon generators for power, and validating the resiliency assurances we have from our raw materials and component suppliers. We expect our full year 2017 adjusted gross margin to be approximately 72% of sales, which now assumes a negative FX impact of 120 basis points for the year, a 20 basis point increase from the full year 2017 outlook we gave in July.","Adjusted SG&A expenses were $783 million or 35.2% of sales in Q3, down 100 basis points year-over-year and at the low end of our guidance range of 35% to 36%. In any given quarter, you may see some variability and seasonality within SG&A, but we remain committed to SG&A optimization through initiatives like expansion of global shared services, end-to-end business process streamlining and automation, and global indirect sourcing leverage. We continue to expect our full year 2017 adjusted SG&A rate to be in a range of 35% to 36% of sales, which at the midpoint would represent a decrease of 60 basis points versus the full year last year. Adjusted research and development expenses were $247 million in the third quarter or 11.1% of sales, which is roughly flat year-over-year, and we continue to expect full year adjusted R&D to be in a range of 10% to 11%.","Royalty expense was 0.7% of sales in Q3, which is 20 basis points lower than prior-year, due to a mix of certain product sales and their related royalty rates. But we expect our royalty rate to remain relatively consistent, just below 1% of sales for the full year 2017. As a result, Q3 2017 adjusted operating margin of 25.1% increased 80 basis points year-over-year and it was within our guidance range of 25% to 26%. The improvement over prior year was largely driven by strong operational improvements in our Rhythm Management and MedSurg segment results.","The Rhythm Management team delivered an operating margin of 19.4% for Q3, an improvement of approximately 230 basis points over the prior year, as they continue to make great progress on gross margin and focus on expense control. We continue to expect the full year 2017 Rhythm Management operating margin to be approximately 19% to 20%.","The MedSurg segment also realized significant year-over-year improvements in operating margin of approximately 170 basis points, delivering operating margin of 32.9% of sales, while continuing to invest in commercial capabilities for key upcoming launches. In the Cardiovascular segment, operating margin of 28.3% represents a decrease of approximately 180 basis points over the prior year due to commercial and development spend, primarily related to building our Structural Heart franchise. In any given quarter you may see some variation in segment operating margin, but Cardiovascular continues to be accretive to total company operating margin.","Now, I'll move on to interest and other expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $57 million, roughly flat to Q3 of last year, and our average interest expense rate was 3.7% in Q3 this year compared to 3.9% in Q3 of 2016. Adjusted other expense was $11 million in the quarter, which is consistent sequentially and includes $6 million in equity method dilution from our portfolio of venture investments.","As a reminder, our below the line expense is comprised of the dilution from our venture investment portfolio and interest expense as well as costs associated with our FX hedging program. For both full year 2017 and full year 2018, we expect below the line expenses, in aggregate, to be approximately $300 million.","Our tax rate for the third quarter was 8.5% on a reported basis and 11.9% on an adjusted basis, below our guidance range of 13% to 14%, primarily due to timing of certain interim items. We now expect the full year adjusted tax rate to be in a range of 12% to 12.5%, which decreases the range by 50 basis points as a result of discretes recognized during the year.","Finally, Q3 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $0.31 includes approximately $0.02 of unfavorable foreign exchange, as we expected, and represents 16% year-over-year growth, or 23% growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On a reported GAAP basis, which includes net charges and amortization expense totaling $149 million after tax, Q3 2017 earnings per share was $0.20, exceeding our guidance range of $0.16 to $0.18.","During the quarter, we continued to make progress on settlement discussions and the claims processing related to our mesh litigation and, as of today, we've entered into or are in the final stages of entering master settlement agreements in principle with certain plaintiff's counsel to resolve approximately 44,000 claims, which represent over 90% of our approximately 48,500 known claims. We remain committed to reducing the risk on our balance sheet and continue to target a resolution of the majority of our remaining mesh claims in 2018. Our total legal reserve, of which mesh is included, was $1.69 billion as of September 30, 2017.","Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $464 million, compared to $440 million in Q3 last year. And in the quarter, we used cash primarily to fund previously agreed upon legal settlements. As of September 30, 2017, we had cash on hand of $210 million. We continue to expect full year adjusted free cash flow to be $1.75 billion, representing 9% growth in the year, and expect the primary use of the cash generated in 2017 and into 2018 will be to fund mesh legal settlements. We continue to make progress in finalizing the IRS stipulation of settled issues, but now expect the payments for the settlement of approximately $500 million to be made in the first half of 2018 as we continue to work through the calculations and documentation necessary to finalize the agreement.","Capital expenditures for the third quarter totaled $60 million. Given recent strategic investments, we now expect capital expenditures for the full year to be approximately $320 million versus our previous guidance of $300 million, but believe we can absorb the increased spend within our cash flow guidance.","We ended Q3 with 1.394 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding and we expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.395 million for Q4 2017 and 1.393 billion for the full year 2017.","I'll now walk through guidance for Q4 and the full year 2017. For the full year, we now expect consolidated revenue to be in a range of $8.985 billion to $9.015 billion, or $9 billion at the midpoint, which represents year-over-year growth of approximately 7% operationally. Included in this guidance is an approximate 120 basis point contribution from the EndoChoice and Symetis acquisitions, which implies 6% organic revenue growth for the year.","We now expect foreign exchange to be a tailwind of approximately $10 million for the full year 2017 and, as a result, we expect to achieve 7% to 8% revenue growth on a reported basis. We're tightening the full year 2017 adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.24 to $1.27, representing 11% to 14% adjusted earnings growth, and now assume the full year negative impact of foreign exchange will be approximately $0.07 to $0.08. On a GAAP basis, we now expect earnings per share to be in a range of $0.71 to $0.75.","Now, turning to Q4 2017, we expect consolidated revenue to be in a rage of $2.345 billion to $2.375 billion. This represents year-over-year growth in a range of 5% to 6% operationally and 4% to 5% organically, and it's a slight acceleration sequentially given the Q4 total company comparable that is 120 basis points higher than our Q3 comp.","In Q4, we expect an approximate 130 basis point contribution from acquisitions and expect the foreign exchange impact on revenue to be a $40 million tailwind. For the fourth quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.32 to $0.35 per share, representing 7% to 17% adjusted earnings growth and includes $0.01 to $0.02 of negative FX impact. GAAP earnings per share for the fourth quarter is expected to be in a range of $0.19 to $0.23 per share.","Please check our Investor Relations website for Q3 2017 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q3 results as well as Q4 and full year 2017 guidance, including P&L line item guidance. So, with that, I'll turn it back to Susie, who will moderate the Q&A.","Susan Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thanks, Dan. Stacy, let's open it up for questions for the next 30 minutes or so. In order to enable us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. Stacy, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we'll go to Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","[Technical Difficulty] (28:46-30:47)","Operator","Pardon me. We'll go to David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Can you hear me?","Susan Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yes.","(30:54)","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I am the lucky winner. Okay. So, let me kick it off here with a couple questions. Maybe I'll just keep asking, because I'm the only one who can talk. But just two questions, one for Dan and one for Mike. So, Dan, a couple things. You did bring up momentum improving in the fourth quarter. I just wonder if you could highlight what gets better. And you also shared with us at Analyst Day some specific commentary for 2018: 5% to 7% top, 50 bps of margin, $300 million non-op. Just want to know if there's any changes to 2018 assumptions you provided at Analyst Day, and then a quick follow-up for Mike.","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Sure. I'll start with the second one. No update to that. We obviously have not issued guidance yet for 2018; would expect to do that in early 2018. So those numbers that we had given as goals at Investor Day are still good.","Relative to Q4, we've guided to Q4 organic revenue growth of 4% to 5%, so the midpoint is 4.5%. So yes, there is, I would say, a slight acceleration if you take the midpoint of our range at that 4.5% versus the 4.3% we posted in Q3. But really, the key point to note is the comp, as we mentioned. The growth comp for Q3 was 9% and it's a little bit over 10% in Q4, so I think that gets at the acceleration portion for Q4.","Broadly, the biggest driver from Q3 to Q4 is CRM. We don't expect to be down 1% in CRM in the fourth quarter, especially with the momentum of the RESONATE launch and our MRI safe defibrillator portfolio in the U.S. So, I'd say that's probably the biggest driver of the momentum from Q3 to Q4.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Very helpful. And then, Mike, just want to clarify some things on LOTUS. So, the slight delay into the first quarter, you talked about platform enhancements. So, how much of this is \u2013 is it new platform enhancements, additional required documentation or is it simply a longer than expected standard process for Europe? And just U.S. PMA timing, is approval mid-2018 still a decent estimate? Thanks so much.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yes, I'll start with the second one. Yes, we haven't changed our timelines for U.S. approval to be mid-2018. So, we stay on track for that. There's a potential that the actual submission may slip into January, but we're comfortable with our timeline for approval mid-2018 and launching and starting to see a nice impact in the U.S. second half of 2018.","No. In Europe, it really comes down to very small minimal impact to our overall business in Structural Heart franchise. And so what we want to do is ensure as robust a possible manufacturing and quality control process, given the importance of the platform, and we're just continuing to take a long-term view of this. And depending on the review time needed by the European regulators, we expect to launch LOTUS Edge in Europe in first quarter 2018. So, the bulk of it really is ensuring sound manufacturing and quality control, and we estimate a first quarter 2018 launch.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And Mike, were there any changes to the device inter-quarter that necessitated this move?","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","No, we haven't made any technical changes beyond the pin pull fix that we've discussed. It's more scalability of our operations and supply chain and quality capabilities.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, and we'll go to the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Perfect, can you hear me okay?","Susan Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.","We can.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Mike, just to follow up with that and flesh that out if you can, what are you referring to in scalability of the operations on LOTUS?","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Simply, as we look at the \u2013 we talked about the end of the line QC testing that we've put in place that's automated, as well as testing along the lines of it in different increments, as well as ensuring we have the sufficient design builds for the number of devices needed for the PMA submission. So, it's design builds as well as enhancements to the quality control and scalability of the line. And so, with that, as said, we don't see a delay in our U.S. approval and we see potentially a 90-day delay in terms of our European launch.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And so, the people just want to know what's the risk of another delay here happening. Do you just want to characterize that?","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","We feel comfortable with it. So, we haven't projected a delay to the U.S., which is the biggest market. We've exceeded our Structural Heart guidance, we estimate, for the year. The only impact, which we think is quite minor, is in Europe, which is potentially a 90-day delay. And so, we debated forever whether we should just say January or first quarter; we landed on the first quarter. So, we feel like a 90-day delay in Europe is an accurate date and we haven't delayed our U.S. launch. And in the meantime, we exceeded expectations with WATCHMAN as well as ACURATE.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Let me \u2013 Dan, just one question on 2018. I heard your answer to David that \u2013 the dollar has moved since the June analyst meeting. You haven't gotten any benefit of that on the bottom line in 2017. Does that help you at all relative to that $0.05 headwind you called out for 2018?","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yes. Mike, I think that's a good point. As the rates have moved in 2017 and we're largely hedged in 2017, obviously, as we head into that year, we haven't seen a benefit. And actually, from a gross margin rate perspective, we've actually seen it go the other way on us. I think it's fair to assume our hope is that if rates were to stay where they are that we might see a little improvement against that $0.05 that we gave you of negative FX at Investor Day.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. I'll let some others jump in.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go to Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks for taking the question. So just to \u2013 sorry to beat the dead horse here on LOTUS, but it's obviously such a key pipeline for you. So, I'm just curious to see what exactly changed from your kind of previous guidance, like what exactly is causing this? Is it something that you guys have decided to do or is it something that's been sort of mandated by regulators that you have to do?","Ian Meredith, M.D., Ph.D. - Boston Scientific Corp.","Perhaps, I can take that actually, Bob. This is Ian Meredith here. So, as you know, we are well out of the starting gate with the regulatory approval processes, both Europe and indeed for the PMA. We have the PMA submission in the U.S. We have two of the three modules already submitted, including the clinical module, and the clinical module is one that might be the normal stumbling block. That's out there. And the technical data, as Mike said, will be submitted by year-end or possibly in January, and we're just trying to meet the number of design builds to provide that technical information.","In Europe, we're working very closely with our notified body to ensure LOTUS Edge notification of change reflects the regulator's requirements in advance of the new medical device regulation framework that will come into place 2019 to 2020. So, I think the timeline is in our hands and I think the processes Mike outlined before really characterize the minor delay.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thank you for that. And then, Mike, one bigger-picture question for you on a couple of issues that have been swirling around the last month or two. I'd love to get your view on the outlook for growth in your business in China, given some of the changes that have been going on in China, or proposed changes from a kind of a national pricing perspective. What's your outlook for China in light of those potential changes? And any update, also, on kind of the national coverage decision determination that'll be made in late November on ICDs? Thank you.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yes. So, we continue to see very strong growth in China. We're up 18% in the Emerging Markets and over 20% growth in China, again. And really, our business in China is really being diversified beyond just drug-eluting stents. So, some of the pricing, tendering and so forth you see in drug-eluting stents potentially could have an impact on our price, which we've already baked in to lots of our guidance that we gave at Investor Day. But also, that's offset by volume as we continue to increase our commercial distribution reach, and now we're playing in tenders and provinces that we never had in the past. So, we think our volume and distribution reach will offset any potential price declines in DES in China. And then, we continue to register new products in complex coronary.","But more importantly, we just continue to diversify beyond DES in China. WATCHMAN's doing quite well for us at nice ASPs. Our whole MedSurg business was very underweight there a few years ago. Now, Endo\/Uro\/Neuromod are gaining traction, as well as our PI business. So, we really don't see in our projections a change of our kind of 15% growth commitment coming out of the Emerging Markets over the next couple of years.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go to...","Susan Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.","Sorry, Stacy. One second. On the NCD, Ken?","Kenneth Stein, M.D. - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yes, Bob. It's Ken. Just quickly on the NCD, we're looking forward to the revised national coverage decision. As you know, the existing NCD is quite old at this point and really sort of just hasn't kept up with professional society guidelines and appropriate use criteria. We have urged CMS reserve coverage for the currently covered patient populations, but also just to clarify reimbursement around some of the edge cases that got caught up in the DOJ investigation a few years back. And we're optimistic that the results are going to enable physicians to use the devices where appropriate and where indicated under current professional guidelines.","Operator","And we'll go to Rick Wise with Stifel, Nicolaus. Please go ahead.","Frederick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Rick.","Frederick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Mike, maybe start off with some (41:32), obviously, you called out your above plan commercial performance for ACURATE neo. Maybe update us, if you would, in a little more detail on the European progress in whatever way you like: number of countries you're in now, hospitals. Can you give us any sense of market share and maybe what's next in terms of product gains or clinical milestones? Just give us some updates there. Thank you.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yes. Candidly, Symetis has outperformed our expectations, and its potential impact, globally, we're much more bullish on as part of our TEVR strategy, quite frankly, than versus we first acquired it. So today we're primarily in Germany and some of the Nordic countries, and we're expanding. We're getting out of some distribution arrangements that were previously set. We're working through that this year and early part of next. And we're enhancing our direct sales force with the Symetis platform.","So, we'll seek to provide potentially more specific guidance on Structural Heart at the next earnings call. We'll detail out what our plans are for 2018. But essentially, we've been able to deploy the bulk of our Structural Heart commercial organization and clinical over to Symetis while we're enhancing the LOTUS valve and bringing that back to Europe in first quarter 2018, and Europe and U.S. approval by second half \u2013 second quarter next year.","So, the valve is doing very well. And I think to speak to that, there was just an interesting article written yesterday in JACC Magazine, JACC, that maybe Ian can highlight a bit.","Ian Meredith, M.D., Ph.D. - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yes. Thanks, Mike. Rick, we continue to be very excited about the progress of the ACURATE platform in Europe. And as you know, the SCOPE I trial, which is a randomized, multi-center, head-to-head trial comparing S3 versus ACURATE, is going extremely well in the countries that it's in. And indeed, it's on target to complete its enrollment by the middle of next year.","The SCOPE II trial, which is a randomized, head-to-head trial against the Evolut R or PRO platform is also doing well, and we expect that to complete enrollment in the middle of the year.","As well as that, Mike just mentioned there was a nice publication in JACC: Interventions (sic) [JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions], yesterday. Three German centers comparing head-to-head \u2013 non-randomized data, though \u2013 ACURATE versus S3, showing equivalent efficacy and safety with a significantly lower rate of pacemakers for ACURATE and overall excellent results. Of course, this is not randomized data, but it bodes very well to the results of the forthcoming SCOPE I trial and, more importantly, the planned U.S. IDE ACURATE trial in full \u2013 for all classes, the extreme high and intermediate risk, which is planned for the second half of next year. So, these data published yesterday certainly give us great insight into the likely \u2013 or potentially likely outcomes for both SCOPE I and the U.S. IDE trial.","Frederick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Now, that's real helpful. Just one follow-up on pacers. The 4% decline sort of stands out this quarter. Maybe I missed it, but remind us the issues here. Is it competitive dynamics, product approval timing, and just where are we there in terms of getting that back on track? Thank you.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yes. So, Pacer for the quarter, we really anniversary \u2013 quite frankly, it's more of a comp issue. We've anniversaried some tough comps with the pacer growth that we had last year, and so we expect that to improve. But really, it was a comp issue for the quarter and it was offset by our strong growth in ICD, which is up 1% for the quarter, really being fueled by S-ICD. And the quarter really didn't reflect any Resonate benefit beyond what we saw in Europe \u2013 sorry, European's CRM business grew nicely on the heels of Resonate, which we will launch in \u2013 with earnest throughout 2018.","Frederick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go to Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. Can you hear me, okay?","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Hi, Glenn.","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Good morning, Glenn.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks. I want to focus on the ICD franchise. So, congratulations, you got MRI safe approved sooner than expected; at least, sooner than we thought. And if I go back to the impact of MRI pacing on your business \u2013 over a year ago, the business prior \u2013 your pacing business prior to MRI approval was declining, and then it started growing double-digits. So, wonder if you can help us think about how your ICD franchise should grow going forward now that you have MRI safe in the marketplace.","And then, as a follow-up, at your analyst meeting back in June you talked about a replacement headwind for the U.S. ICD business for next year. Is that still on track, and can you remind us the impact for 2018? Thanks.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Sure. So, we're very bullish on our position, particularly in Defib, as we close out 2017 and enter in 2018. As we articulated, that Resonate platform not only offers that MRI capability, but we believe that HeartLogic, that Ken can probably detail out a bit more, is a highly differentiated diagnostic tool for heart failure physicians that we'll be doing a number of clinical studies on. Then, you combine it with a longevity benefit. So, I think we're really well positioned with Resonate and S-ICD to take share in Q4 as well as throughout 2018 in Defib, which is clearly \u2013 is the highest profit margin business within CRM versus Pacer.","So, we don't expect this to have the same level of growth rates that we saw when we had the Pacer MRI, because we had this MRI compatibility strategy with our current ICD and CRT-Ds. But nonetheless, we do expect to grow faster than market in Defib and expect faster growth in fourth quarter and in 2018 than we saw in 2017 in that business. And that'll also be combined with some benefits of a \u2013 more of a tailwind in replacements, which we talked about being about 100 basis points to CRM.","So, we think we're very well positioned in the high margin Defib business with S-ICD and Resonate, as well as the tailwind, and also our strength in the EP business, which is up 18% in the quarter.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yes.","Operator","And we'll go to Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So, two for me. I wanted to start with \u2013 what struck me in the quarter was all of the regions except the U.S. accelerated on an organic basis. So, the U.S., I think, went from 7% to 2.8%. And I know you said weather was a pretty minor impact, but the amount of the impact, I think, was lower than some other companies have called out. And I guess my question is why the deceleration in the U.S.? And do you expect a benefit from Medtronic's issues in any business in the fourth quarter? And I had one follow-up.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yes. We didn't really want to overplay the weather card. We thought it was kind of 10 basis points to 20 basis points in the quarter, so had some impact and \u2013 but our teams did a really nice job. It had some impact on procedures, clearly, in Houston and in Florida. But overall, I think it just shows the balance and strength of the company, that diversified growth across Europe and Asia-Pac, and also, particularly with Europe's growth, which was a 9% operational growth with a benefit of a number of our new platforms, with the Eluvia, the DES, and the DCB, with the Resonate platform launching more quickly in Europe, as well as the impact of Symetis, as well as the growth of EP; it was significant in Europe. And again, all those platforms are coming to the U.S. So it gives us a lot of optimism for the U.S. growth as we head into 2018, 2019 and 2020 on the heels of these platforms that are performing very well in Europe.","So, will there be upside from Medtronic's challenges? I think all companies have had challenges with Puerto Rico, and I think our team's done a really good job of limiting supply outages and having terrific contingency plans and backup resiliency plans in order to minimize those impacts that you're maybe seeing more strongly from other companies.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. And then, Ian, I wanted to ask you one question. When you were asked this a couple quarters ago about LOTUS versus Symetis and the share, I think you said you expect them to be roughly 50\/50 and it might have taken some people by surprise. I'm just wondering, at this point, do you still expect it to be 50\/50 or is Symetis maybe picking up more, in your view? Thanks for taking the questions.","Ian Meredith, M.D., Ph.D. - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thanks, Larry. Probably, it's hard for me to comment fairly on market share. Obviously, you can see that ACURATE is doing very, very well in Europe. It's a very popular platform. I think it'll play out over time what the market share will be.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Fair enough.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yes. I guess it just speaks to why we acquired Symetis in the first place. And we've talked about it for a while. We think the data for Symetis is very compelling, and Ian articulated that in terms of its performance against the best valves that Edwards and Medtronic has. We'll have a trial that will report that out.","So, we have a lot of confidence in the clinical capabilities of Symetis and we have tremendous confidence in the unique abilities of LOTUS. And so, combined in a $5 billion market, which is a very small number for us today, we think it gives us the most unique growth profile in Structural Heart combined with WATCHMAN. And we're in the \u2013 I think we're not even \u2013 we're probably in the top of the first inning, still, in terms of our LOTUS opportunity as well as Symetis.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","And we'll go to Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Can you hear me okay?","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yes. Good morning.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Wonderful. Good morning. I have two questions for you. The first one has to do with gross margins. The commentary at the Analyst Day would imply a 50 basis point improvement next year, but this year you're absorbing 120 basis points from the FX headwind. And with FX shifting, walk me through, please, why this wouldn't be better next year?","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Well, obviously, we haven't given guidance yet, Joanne, relative to 2018. You're correct, it's 120 basis point headwind for the full year this year, and I think what's nice is that we basically will have offset that with operational improvements this year relative to the total number. So specific to next year, it's one of the numbers that'll add down to what we give for total guidance for operating margin and earnings per share and such for 2018.","But the focus of the team relative to the operational improvements and the value improvement programs that we drive is alive and well. So, we'll need to sort that out relative to what FX will be next year. Again, the hope \u2013 as I mentioned to Mike Weinstein's question earlier, the hope is that with the rates where they are, we might see a little bit less of a headwind next year relative to the FX at the bottom line. But we'll give specific line item guidance when we give guidance in 2018.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. My follow-up question has to do with \u2013 sorry, another LOTUS question \u2013 LOTUS in the United States. Assuming the third module goes in at the end of this year or the beginning of next, what are the steps that you need to then take to get a timely mid-year approval for LOTUS in the United States? Thank you.","Ian Meredith, M.D., Ph.D. - Boston Scientific Corp.","Well, once the PMA submission is completed, it will be just a case of answering any questions that are required to complete that submission. And it's just simply a process of dialogue with the FDA. We have frequent and very productive communication with the FDA. So, it's simply a process of meeting their expectations. There's obviously a timeline to the FDA approval process, and in that time we may be required to answer questions.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","But taking it a step further, what about manufacturing, ramp, productivity, sales force training? All that will be set in advance, I assume.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yes. Unfortunately, with the delays, we've had \u2013 we have commercial capability ready to go in the U.S. for LOTUS. They've been deployed elsewhere within our Cardiovascular team since they can't, obviously, sell LOTUS at this point. So, we have resources already established and we'll continue to strengthen and build upon that team. So, it won't be a commercial concern for us.","And by the time we launch LOTUS in the U.S. at greater scale in the third quarter, we'll have been ramping up manufacturing significantly in the first half. So commercial capabilities and manufacturing should not be a concern for us when we launch in the U.S.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Terrific. Thank you very much. Have a good day.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","We'll go to Matt Taylor with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask one about the balance sheet and use of cash, given you gave us an update on the settlement today. Can you talk us through a little bit how you're thinking about using your cash flow going forward as you're now going to be kind of out from under this overhang?","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yes, Matt. I think we've been pretty public about that in the past, and I don't think that really the timing of the payment for the IRS settlement really changes that. It's M&A and returning cash to shareholders are our two most favored uses of cash. I think we've balanced that well over the last four or five years, while at the same time settling a lot of legacy litigation liabilities and such.","So, as we look forward to 2018, 2019, 2020, think back to Investor Day, we had talked about 90-plus percent of our cash over the next three years being able to go towards M&A and share repurchase over that timeframe, where it's been kind of the reverse of that over the last three or four years. So, I would look for M&A and share repurchase over that timeframe. And from an M&A perspective, there's plenty of opportunities out there to support our overall strategy of category leadership. I think you've seen that this year with a couple of the more notable ones we've done with Symetis and Apama, and I'd look for more of the same.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. And one follow-up, I just wanted to ask about your mitral program and how you're thinking about mitral options in repair and replacement? It's been a little bit of time since we've gotten an update there. Can you talk about what you have and if you need to add anything to the portfolio to be competitive?","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Sure. So, our focus clearly has been on the TAVR platforms, as you know, with LOTUS as well as ACURATE, as well as our WATCHMAN. And we think the size of the TAVR market is well over $5 billion, likely. And the WATCHMAN market, every point of penetration is $250 million; and, we continue to press on clinical and portfolio advantages there. So, we've been investing in the mitral area more with our VC investments, some of which have not been disclosed. So, we're interested in repair as well as replace. And we've really done more work on that through VC investments that we've made as well as a few internal, organic R&D opportunities.","So, more to come on that. It's an area that we're interested in. We do think it'll be a significant market. We do think it'll play out longer than TAVR, given that it's more fragmented. So, expect us to continue to enhance our capabilities in that area, but it's not as much of a priority versus our atrial appendage and TAVR programs.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Susan Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.","All right. Stacy, with that, we'll conclude the call. Thank you very much, everyone, for listening in today. Apologies for the technical issues and, Stacy, if you could please give the replay information.","Operator","Sure.

As a reminder this conference is being recorded. ","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Susie Lisa. Please go ahead.","Susan Lisa","Thank you, Roxanne. Good morning, everyone. Thanks very much for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our fourth quarter and full year results for 2013, which included reconciliations of non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release, as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call, to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading, Financial Information.","The duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Mike will begin our prepared remarks with an update on our business progress and his perspectives on the quarter, the year and the outlook. Dan will then review our overall fourth quarter and full year 2013 financial results and then discuss goals for full year and first quarter of 2014. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Keith Dawkins and Dr. Ken Stein.","Before we begin I'd like to remind everyone that this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share; new product approvals and launches; clinical trials; cost savings and growth opportunity; our cash flow and expected use; our financial performance, including sales, margins, earnings and other Q1 and full year 2014 guidance; as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses.","Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs and 8-Ks filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date and we disclaim any intentions or obligation to update them.","At this point I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike?","Michael F. Mahoney","Thank you, Susie. Good morning, everyone. I will begin today with some highlights regarding our fourth quarter and full year performance for 2013, and then provide some thoughts on our 2014 outlook. Dan will then review the financials and 2014 guidance and then we will take your questions from there. So please note that throughout the commentary all growth rates discussed are on constant currency basis and represent fourth quarter 2013 year-on-year growth unless otherwise specified. ","So overall fourth quarter was a very good quarter for Boston Scientific. We are pleased that we are delivering on our commitment and building momentum. In fourth quarter we exceeded our guidance and delivered 5% operational revenue growth. We also exceeded our EPS guidance in the fourth quarter delivering adjusted EPS of $0.21. ","We estimate that most of our business units grew faster than the market. For 2013 we committed to turnaround our performance and return to positive growth and we've achieved that goal early by posting 2% operational growth in second quarter and then improving upon that with a 4% growth rate in third quarter and now 5% in the fourth quarter. And throughout the year we returned cash to shareholders with $225 million worth of stock repurchased in fourth quarter and $500 million for the full year, or 43% on adjusted operating cash flow for the year. ","I will turn now to a few highlights from the fourth quarter and provide some commentary on 2014. Our MedSurg business, which now represents 33% of company sales are growing faster than the market and driving a balanced portfolio mix, led by impressive growth in neuromodulation, with continued above market growth in both our endoscopy, urology and women's health business. ","In endoscopy we had another strong quarter and we continued to grow faster than the market. Our key growth drivers include our hemostasis franchise, failure devices and our Endoscopic Ultrasound needle platform. ","We are also really excited about the progress we are making with our Spyglass Direct Visualization System that's recently been launched in China. The Spyglass System was launched earlier in 2013 and this platform allows GI physicians to visualize the insides of the biliary tree and it's been very favorably received. ","Also within Endoscopy Alair, our Bronchial Thermoplasty platform delivered 28% full year growth as we surpassed 350 worldwide treatment sites. We also continue to experience improving reorder rates and consistent case-by-case approvals by large commercial insurers. So in 2014 we expect the Endoscopy division to continue to deliver solid growth across all regions fueled by a very strong pipeline and broader emerging market expansion. ","Now turning to Neuromodulation, which is also within our medical surgical reporting sector. Neuromodulation during fourth quarter sustained excellent momentum from the previous quarter and grew at 33%. Our team at Neuromodulation is really performing at very high level and we continue to strengthen our leadership position and gain significant market share particularly in the U.S. spinal cord stimulation market. ","Physicians have enthusiastically adopted our next generation Precision Spectra Spina Cord Stimulator platform which is designed to improve pain relief to a wide range of chronic pain patients. Also at the North American Neuromodulation Society annual meeting last month we presented compelling clinical outcomes data using the Precision Spectra SCS System. Although preliminary these real world results affirm the advantage of using this novel platform to treat pain patients. ","Precision Spectra validates our focus on developing other clinically meaningful innovations such as the Vercise Deep Brain Stimulator System which is available in Europe. ","So turning to Urology and Women's Health, this division also grew 5% in the quarter and this growth was led by our international expansion efforts in several new product launches. We expect to deliver above market growth also in this business in 2014 as we continue to build momentum. ","Now turning to intervention cardiology. Our IC business did not grow in fourth quarter primarily due to softness in drug-eluting stents. However the business is stabilizing and we are well positioned to improve our DES performance in 2014. We're excited about our newly enhanced IC portfolio and capability including the recent approval and launch of the Promus PREMIER drug-eluting stent in the U.S. PREMIER delivered excellent outcome offering physicians a custom architecture that improves actual strength while providing outstanding deliverability.","So in 2014 we expect Promus PREMIER to be a catalyst for our global DES franchise. And we anticipate PREMIER approval in Japan in the second half of the year. ","In addition adoption of physician training for our BridgePoint chronic total occlusion platform continues to expand. Internationally our next generation SYNERGY stent continues to perform well. We have seen good results from the limited launch we began in Europe and we're expanding to a broader EU launch this year supported by a comprehensive SYNERGY clinical evaluation portfolio which includes almost 28,000 patients.","Synergy is priced at a premium through our PREMIER platform. And Synergy has done very well in targeted markets in Europe and it's becoming a first choice for physicians for tackling complex coronary cases. ","Moving to our core IC business we continue to see strong performance. Our IC business X stents grew faster than the market in fourth quarter up double-digits. The growth is driven by the revitalization of our complex PCI product portfolio including the Emerge Balloon in the OptiCross coronary IVUS catheter as well as emerging market expansion. ","We continue to expect this business to grow faster than the market in '14 as we expand our commercial rollout of seven new products. ","Next I'd like to highlight WATCHMAN, which is our Left Atrial Appendage Closure device we're very pleased with the favorable December FDA panel vote. The panel supported WATCHMAN 13 to one across the three areas of device safety, efficacy and benefits that outweigh the risk. This is really a significant milestone for the therapy in bringing this innovative technology to the U.S. ","We also continue to expect U.S. approval in the first half of 2014 and we believe we have a significant timing advantage over our competitors. We also continue to show good progress with our Lotus TAVR program. In the fourth quarter the final end point data from the REPRISE II CE Mark trial was presented at PCT conference and this demonstrated excellent results. ","Highlights of the 120 patient study include that 83.6% had no or trace paravalvular aortic regurgitation at 30 days, 1% had moderate aortic regurgitation and 0% had severe aortic regurgitation. We also received Lotus CE Mark approval and initiated commercial sales in Europe in the quarter. ","So the impressions from the commercial accounts we have launched into thus far has been very positive and we look forward to expanding the roll-out of this second generation Lotus Valve platform in the international market and initiating the REPRISE III U.S. IDE trial in 2013. ","Also within cardiovascular is our peripheral interventions division. This division continues the strong consistent performance. The PI business delivered above market growth for the eight consecutive quarter. Our market leading balloons, stents and intervention oncology franchises continue to lead the way, with a particularly strong performance in the U.S., Latin America and Canada. ","During the quarter we strengthened our peripheral embolization business with multiple U.S. launched and we are advancing our drug coated technologies and expect to achieve important clinical and commercial milestones later in 2014, including our drug-coated balloon platform, which we expect to launch in certain international markets in the second half of this year. ","Turning to hypertension, we are starting our Vessix platform in Europe and remain enthusiastic about both its clinical impact and long-term business potential. It's important to know that Vessix is a second generation balloon expandable multi-point renal denervation platform. ","We believe Vessix is highly differentiated from the competitor's product that recently announced missing its efficacy endpoint in the U.S. pivotal trial. We recognize that this is an important development in the market, yet potentially an opportunity for BSC. ","So regarding our U.S. trial, we will carefully examine the forthcoming available data and work collaboratively with the scientific community to determine the next steps for our Vessix clinical program. ","Let me now discuss our rhythm management segment. And we are really encouraged by the improved revenue performance of this business and its return to operational growth over the last two quarters. While we weren't satisfied with the margins within our rhythm management growth and we are focused on improving those in 2014 and throughout our multi-year strategic plan. ","So in terms of the market we believe the worldwide CRM market continues to stabilize over the course of 2013, with year-over-year market growth rate slightly flat to low single digits in the fourth quarter. In our defib business we estimate our worldwide Q4 market share to be up sequentially from the third quarter, driven by improved share in our international core defib business and worldwide growth of the highly differentiated S-ICD platform. ","During the fourth quarter we expanded the worldwide launch of the S-ICD platform and continued to observe high demand for the system in our physician training programs. The S-ICD franchise is delivering on our manufacturing ramp-up objectives and training is proceeding on plan. ","We remain very excited about S-ICDs ability to product sudden cardiac death protection without touching the heart. So today physicians have used the S-ICD to treat primary and secondary preventive patients while it's still very early in the launch of the system recent publications such as the one by [Dr. Poole and Gold] in circulation clearly articulate the value of rationale for implanting S-ICD in various indicative patient populations. ","In addition in December we initiated the European launch of our new quadripolar X4 CRT-D patient system. Our X4 quad lead offers three different lead options and the most pacing vectors in the industry. The system also builds upon the longevity advantages of our CRT-D devices with nearly twice the battery capacity, thus reducing the risk of additional hospitalization and clinical complications associated with early change out including resection. ","We also expected to begin our X4 Quadripole IDE trial in the U.S. in the first half of 2014. ","Turning now to our pacer business, this franchise delivered good results in both the U.S. and international markets and we believe continues to drive worldwide pacer share gains in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter we plan to launch our MI technology more broadly with the approval of the [INGENIO] pacemaker lead in Europe and system approval in Japan. ","We expect these new opportunities will build upon our differentiated RF remote monitoring capabilities that are designed to assist patients and physicians in detecting clinical events sooner. In EP we closed the acquisition of Bard's EP business on November 1st. It's an important acquisition that expands our portfolio of EP technologies and brings stronger global capability to our EP division. We expect to improve our performance in EP in '14 through new product launches and synergies from our broader rhythm management capabilities.","So I will wrap up the fourth quarter and 2013. Overall we are really pleased with the fourth quarter, our full year results and the momentum we are building as a company. Last year we committed to turnaround our performance and return to positive revenue growth and we did exactly that. We returned to growth faster than anticipated and we improved our quarterly revenue growth rate on an operational basis throughout the year. ","We continue to focus on margins, we are targeting significant improvements. We are strengthening both our portfolio and utilization fees through meaningful innovation that delivers unique value to patients and savings to the healthcare system. ","We delivered full year adjusted EPS above our guidance range and we continue to deploy a balanced capital allocation strategy throughout the year with a strong emphasis on returning cash to shareholders. ","As we look forward to 2014 we are highly satisfied with our performance. We have we have numerous growth opportunities in front of us and there is significant room for improved execution and performance across many of the businesses and regions. We remain focused on executing our strategic plan and in 2014 we expect to continue to improve our performance, expand operating margins and accelerate full year revenue and earnings growth.","In terms of the broader market the global markets are dynamic and certainly challenging. However we see relative stabilization of market growth rates in most regions and slight market growth rate improvements from a year-ago in CRM and IC. ","Our aim in 2014 is to grow our core business faster than the market and to grow our operating income faster than sales. In this year we plan to continue to devote our R&D and commercial investments and deliver meaningful innovation in new products, new solutions and new commercial models. ","Our pipeline of new products such as S-ICD, WATCHMAN, PREMIER, Alair, SYNERGY, Lotus and VESSIX are advancing and we expect them to generate a more meaningful revenue contribution in '14. Our organization is developing stronger global capabilities, and we now operate, measure and reward our business leaders from a global perspective.","As a result we are improving our customer focus, registering more products internationally and more purposefully investing our commercial resources for growth. So today we are still under penetrated in emerging markets relative to some of our peers, however we are making great strides to narrow the gap and we are developing capabilities more fully in emerging markets. ","Our emerging markets sales increased to 9% of our total company operating sales in fourth quarter 2013 and we anticipate emerging market sales will grow to an estimated 15% of our mix by 2017. ","So as a result of these plans we expect to continue to generate strong cash flow which we believe will support a balanced capital allocation strategy that is aligned with our strategic priorities, while enabling us to maintain sufficient flexibility. So overall we have numerous opportunities to create value for shareholders by accelerating both the sales and earnings growth in '14. ","And finally I would like to thank our employees around the world for their winning spirit and their commitment to Boston Scientific. ","Now let me turn the call over to Dan for more detailed review of our financials and \u201914 guidance.","Daniel J. Brennan","","Thanks Mike. Let me begin by providing some overall perspective on the quarter before getting into the details. ","We generated adjusted EPS of $0.21 compared to $0.18 in Q4 last year in our guidance range of $0.18 to $0.20. This improved profitability from the prior year was primarily driven by our operational revenue growth, continued gross margin expansion which was up 190 basis points year-over-year and a lower effective tax rate. This was partially offset by investments in our strategic growth initiatives and our core infrastructure, variable expenses associated with higher sales levels as well as a $0.01 impact from the medical device tax. ","In addition we generated operating cash flow of $268 million in the quarter and used over 80% of that to repurchase approximately 19 million additional shares in the quarter. While we\u2019re pleased with our execution against goals particularly with respect to the return to operational revenue growth for the year and growth in Q4 against tougher year-over-year comps we believe we still have substantial future potential operating leverage.","Now I will move to the more detailed review of our business performance and operating results in the quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2013 consolidated revenue of $1,838 million represented growth of 1% compared to the prior year on an as-reported basis. On operational basis which excludes the impact of foreign exchange and the divestiture of our Vascular business we grew revenue 5%. This 5% operational revenue growth includes approximately $15 million in revenue from the CR Bard electrophysiology business we acquired effective November 1st or approximately an 80 basis points contribution to growth. ","The actual headwind from foreign exchange on sales was approximately $42 million as compared to the previous year and was fairly consistent with the $40 million impact we assumed in our guidance range. ","Now let me provide little more granularity on our sales for our three business groups comprised of our seven divisions. To start with MedSurg, this group once again grew at a double-digit rate in constant currency and faster than its underlying markets while contributing strong operating income as well. ","Total MedSurg sales of $613 million in the quarter were up 12% with all regions growing double-digit over the previous year period on a constant currency basis. MedSurg operating income for the full year was 31.5% representing a 120 basis points increase over 2012. MedSurg performed well across all its businesses led by global constant currency revenue growth of 33% in Neuromodulation, 8% Endoscopy and 5% in Urology and Women's Health. ","To dive into the details just a bit endoscopy sales grew 8% worldwide on a constant currency basis with a very strong international performance with high single-digit growth in Europe and low double-digit growth in Asia. Urology and Women's Health worldwide sales grew 5% on constant currency basis compared with prior year quarter and this performance was driven by strong international sales of 15% year-over-year constant currency with particular strength in Europe and Latin America as we continue to build our global infrastructure in this business. ","To close out the MedSurg highlights we are pleased to report a second straight quarter of 13% plus year-over-year sales growth in Neuromodulation with 33% worldwide growth in the fourth quarter on a constant currency basis. This predominantly U.S business saw 30% domestic sales growth and 70% international sales growth on a constant currency basis for the quarter, compared to the year ago period as the launch of our Precision Spectra system continues to help BSC gain share and drive market growth. ","Turning now to cardiovascular; global cardiovascular group sales, which consist of our Interventional Cardiology and peripheral intervention's division was flat for the quarter on a worldwide constant currency basis with sales of $705 million. Cardiovascular full year 2013 operating margin of 25% was essentially unchanged from the 2012 level. ","Within cardiovascular worldwide Interventional Cardiology sales of $500 million declined 3% compared to the fourth quarter 2012 on a constant currency basis. Outside of drug-eluting stents worldwide other Interventional Cardiology delivered very solid sales growth of 7% as compared to Q4, 2012 in constant currency terms driven by gains in IRIS, atherectomy and continued adoption of our WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure device in international markets. ","Worldwide drug-eluting stent revenue of $272 million was down 10% year-on-year in constant currency and below the low end of our guidance range. U.S. DES revenue of $108 million and OUS DES revenue of $164 million declined approximately 9% and 11% respectively compared to Q4 of 2012 on a constant currency basis. We estimate that our U.S DES share was relatively stable both sequentially and compared with Q4, 2012 in the low to mid 30s. ","Internationally the DES sales declined reflected disruptions in Germany following the OrbusNeich settlement in late Q3 as well as competitive product launches. ","The WATCHMAN\u00ae Left Atrial Appendage Closure products continue to show strong growth in international markets with sales up 76% for the quarter on a constant currency basis compared with prior year Q4 which put full international sales growth at just over 50%. Full year WATCHMAN sales were at the low end of the $20 million to $30 million goal we outlined at our February, 2013 Investor Day due to the reimbursement delays in the U.K and Korea. ","Lotus percutaneous valve sales with just four weeks of limited launch post European approval in Q4 did not meaningfully contribute to our revenue in the quarter. Peripheral interventions worldwide sales of $205 million in the quarter grew very strong 7% year-on-year in a constant currency led by consistent 6% constant currency growth across the U.S, Europe and Asia and low double-digit in Latin America compared with prior year period. That brought full year global PI sales growth to 6% on a constant currency basis. ","Now I'll discuss our Rhythm Management group which consists of our Cardiac Rhythm Management and Electrophysiology business units. Worldwide Rhythm Management sales in Q4 of $518 million grew 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis with year-on-year growth in all regions excluding the $15 million contribution from C.R. Bard, Electrophysiology acquisition closed on November 1, Rhythm Management Q4 sales grew 2% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. ","Full year 2013 operating margin for the group, of 11% with roughly flat with 2002 level as a result of several one-time items in Q4, 2013. We had incremental expenses associated with the return of the S-ICD to the market, inventory reserves related to our upcoming CRTD and Quad Lead introductions, Bard integration cost and expenses related to the Rhythmia manufacturing ramp. ","Increasing management profitability is the key component of our goal of 25% operating margins by 2017 and we remain focused on achieving that objective. ","Worldwide CRM revenues of $468 million in the fourth quarter, grew 2% year-on-year as reported and 3% on a constant currency basis exceeding the high end of our guidance range and improving upon the 1% year-on-year constant currency growth we posted for the third quarter.","Sales grew in both the U.S. and international which was led by Europe turning in high single digit year-on-year growth for the quarter offset by slightly weaker sales in Asia. To breakdown CRM a bit further on a worldwide basis defib sales were $333 million in the fourth quarter which was up 1% in constant currency from Q4, 2012 on strong international core defib sales and very encouraging S-ICD sales for the quarter, which brought full year S-ICD sales above the low end of the $25 million to $45 million goal we provided at our February 2013 Investor Day, despite having very limited market presence during the year.","Worldwide pacer sales grew 7% on a constant currency basis as compared to Q4 '12, as both our U.S. and International pacing businesses posted 7% year-over-year growth for the quarter. We continue to see strong performance in the U.S. and improved OUS results due to the adoption of our INGENIO family of pacemakers. Within Electrophysiology the quarter 35% year-on-year growth on a constant currency basis includes $15 million in revenue from the closing of the Bard EP acquisition. Excluding the Bard EP contribution global EP sales was down 5% primarily to share loss in therapeutic catheters. ","Importantly we believe the Bard EP acquisition meaningfully expand our product portfolio and commercial capability and we look forward to improve results in this newly strengthened franchise in 2014 and beyond.","Let me now briefly recap full year 2013 revenue. On a reported basis, consolidated 2013 revenue was $7,143 million, which represents a 1% decrease from the prior year on a reported basis. In constant currency and excluding the impact of neurovascular divestiture, operationally sales increased 2% compared to 2012. For the full year foreign currency negatively impacted reported full year sales growth by approximately 215 basis points or about $156 million.","Moving on from sales, adjusted gross profit margin for the fourth quarter was 70% or 190 basis points higher than Q4, 2012. The increase was largely attributable to benefits from our improvement programs, favorable product mix which was partially offset by price erosion. ","For the full year 2013, adjusted gross profit margin was 69.7% compared to 67.8% for the full year 2012. The 190 basis points net full year gross margin improvement stemmed from improvements in incentive cost, lower sales of divested businesses and Promus profit share and added through ups, partially offset by price as well as volume mix. Foreign exchange continued to have a very minimal impact upon gross margin as a result of our hedging program.","Adjusted SG&A expenses were $704 million or 38.3% of sales in Q4, 2013 compared to $630.3 million or 34.6% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2012. During Q4, 2013, the impact from our cost savings programs were offset by several one-time investment in our strategic growth initiatives, strengthening execution in our core markets and costs associated was expanding in emerging markets and Europe all with the goal of driving consistent top-line growth. ","Although it will be necessary to make trade-offs within the P&L in any given time period, we remain focused on achieving our goal of at least 100 basis points annual operating margin improvement and reaching an overall 25% plus operating margin by 2017.","For the full year 2013, adjusted SG&A expenses were $2.63 billion or 36.8% of sales compared to 34.6% of sales in 2012. Recall that SG&A expenses in Q4 and for the full year 2013 includes a negative impact of approximately 100 basis points from the medical device tax. ","Adjusted research and development expenses were $215 million for the fourth quarter or 11.7% of sales. This compares to $241 million or 13.2% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2012. For the full year 2013, adjusted R&D expenses were $859 million or 12% of sales. Royalty expense was $24 million in the quarter or 1.3% of sales compared to $28.3 million in Q4 last year and for the full year 2013 royalty expense was $140 million or 2% or sales.","On an adjusted basis pretax operating income was $342 million in the quarter or 18.6% of sales, down only 10 basis points from Q4, 2012 despite a negative 100 basis point impact from medical device tax and investments in our strategic growth initiatives which were partially offset with targeted cost reduction initiative and higher gross margins. ","GAAP operating income, which includes GAAP to adjusted items was $126.6 million in Q4 2013. The primary GAAP to adjusted items included in operating income for the quarter were pretax restructuring charges of $45.6 million, pretax litigation charges of $15 million, pretax loss on the Neurovascular divestiture of 2.6 million, pretax contingent consideration expense of $21.8 million and pretax amortization of $106.2 million. ","Now we move on to other income and expense which primarily consisted of interest expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $58 million as compared to $64 million in Q4 last year due primarily to the refinancing of our public debt in Q3 of 2013. ","Our average interest expense rate in Q4 2013 was 5% or approximately 50 basis points lower than Q4 last year. For the full year interest expense on an as-reported basis was $324 million or $63 million higher than in 2012 primarily due to a pretax one time charge of approximately $70 million associated with our third quarter debt refinancing. ","Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was a negative 82.7% on a reported basis, a negative basis 5.7% on an adjusted basis. The difference between our reported and adjusted tax rate for the quarter is attributable to charges excluded in determining our non-GAAP results. ","In addition our Q4 adjusted tax rate includes approximately $20 million of net favorable discrete items. Excluding these discrete tax items our operational tax rate was 1.5% for the fourth quarter and 10.6% for the full year 2013. Our full year tax rate is lower than our previous expectations due to a favorable geographic mix of earnings.","For the full year we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.73 per share. On a reported GAAP basis 2013 EPS was a loss of $0.09 per share. GAAP results for 2013 included after tax charges of $1,112 million or $0.82 per share related to goodwill and intangible asset impairment, acquisition and divestiture related cost, litigation, restructuring related expenses and amortization of intangible assets. ","As a reminder full year 2013 adjusted EPS of $0.73 includes a $0.01 one-time benefit associated with the final adjustment related to our Promus profit share agreement and $0.02 benefit for the 2012 R&D tax credit which was recorded in Q1 of 2013 and certain other discreet tax items, which we don't expect to reoccur.","Moving on to the balance sheet, DSO of 66 days increased three days compared to December of 2012 due primarily to slower collections in Europe. Days inventory on hand of 149 days was up nine days compared to December of last year due to higher inventory in advance of many of the launches we mentioned and lower cost of goods sold driven by standard cost improvements and favorable product mix. ","Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $316 million compared to $361 million in Q4 of 2012. The decrease is due primarily to investments in inventory support, new product launches as I just mentioned as well as an increase in capital expenditures related to our previously announced restructuring program and infrastructure optimization initiatives. ","For the full year adjusted free-cash flow was $1,158 million consistent with 2012. Capital expenditures were $85 million in Q4 of 2013 compared to $63 million in Q4 of 2012 and for the full year capital expenditures were $245 million compared to $226 million in 2012. ","Turning to share repurchases, we repurchased approximately 19 million shares for $225 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 as Mike mentioned. For the full year 2013 we repurchased approximately $51 million shares for roughly $500 million. Since July 2011 we've now repurchased 238 million shares or approximately 15% of our outstanding shares. We currently have $660 million of capacity remaining under our share repurchase authorization. ","We believe buying back our stock is a good use of cash and a key part of a balanced capital allocation strategy that values returning cash to our shareholders. We plan to continue our share repurchase program into 2014 subject to business development opportunities, market conditions our stock performance, regulatory trading windows and other factors. ","To summarize Q4 was another strong quarter for Boston Scientific as we continued to make solid progress on our global strategy and we remain focused on driving profitable revenue growth. ","I would also like to take a minute to benchmark against our February 2013 Investor Day guidance where we called for 2013 operational revenue growth of minus 2% to up 2% and delivered up 2%; adjusted operating margin of 18% to 19% and achieved 18.9%; and adjusted EPS of $0.64 to $0.70 achieving adjusted EPS of $0.73, which includes $0.03 of non-recurring benefits I previously mentioned. We also believe that we continue to have opportunities to enhance profitability and expect to continue to generate strong cash flow. ","Let me now walk you through our guidance for full year 2014 as well as the first quarter. For full year 2014 revenue guidance we estimate consolidated revenue to be in the range of $7,300 million to $7,500 million which represents growth of 2% to 5% on as reported basis. Holding current foreign exchange rates constant, we expect the full year impact of FX to be relatively neutral although we do expect $20 million headwind in the first quarter. ","On an operational basis which excludes the impact of foreign exchange and the divested neurovascular business we estimate that consolidated 2014 sales will grow in a range of 3% to 5% compared to 2013 and we encourage you to model for the midpoint. Included in this revenue guidance is an estimated 100 plus basis point contribution from our adjacencies including the WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure device, Lotus percutaneous valve, Alair system for Bronchial Thermoplasty, Rhythmia mapping system, Vercise deep brain stimulation system and the Vessix renal denervation system. ","Our guidance also assumes continued strong revenue growth contribution from emerging markets as we remain underpenetrated in these markets relative to some of our peers. We expect our adjusted gross margin for the year as a percentage of sales to be in the range of 70% to 71%. Although we expect to see continued downward pricing pressure we expect this headwind to be offset by improved price management principally through market segmentation and tiered offerings and our manufacturing value improvement programs. We believe that the impact of these benefits will increase as we progress through the year. ","As we forecast SG&A expense for 2014 we expect to continue to make necessary investments in our strategic growth initiatives to improve our core execution and to enhance our capabilities in emerging markets and Europe. However we believe the cost of these investments should be partially offset by restructuring savings. ","For the full year we expect adjusted SG&A as a percent of sales to be between 36.5% and 37.5%. We continue to transform our R&D organization and refocus our spending to drive innovation and growth. In 2014 we expect R&D spending as a percentage of sales to be in the range of 11.5% to 12%. We currently expect 2014 royalties to be relatively consistent with 2013 while interest and other expense is expected to be $20 million to $25 million lower year-on-year primarily due to lower interest rates as a result of our refinancing in Q3 of last year. ","This implies the full year operating margin goal in the range of 20%. We expect our adjusted tax rate for the full year 2014 to be between 13% and 15%. This does not assume an extension of the US R&D tax credit in 2014. It does assume a more normalized geographic of earnings and also excludes any discrete tax items that may arise during the year. ","We are subject to tax authority examinations in many jurisdictions that are scheduled to conclude in 2014. The final resolutions of these exams may result in additional favorable or unfavorable discrete tax items during the year that are difficult to forecast but may impact our full year adjusted tax rate. As a result we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2014 to be in the range of $0.75 to $0.80 and we encourage you to model for the midpoint of the range.","On a GAAP basis we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.35 to $0.40. So again to reference our February 2013 investor day goal, for 2014 we projected low single digit operational revenue growth of 100 basis points improvement in operating margin and mid to high single digit adjusted EPS growth and believe that our guidance measures up favorably against these goals. ","Lastly, for 2014 our guidance assumes adjusted free cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion, capital expenditures of approximately $250 million, pre-tax amortization expense of approximately $450, stock comp expense of approximately $100 million and our share count of approximately $1.345 billion fully diluted weighted average shares for our EPS calculations for the full year subject to the conditions I mentioned earlier. We hope you find this level of detail helpful for you modeling. ","Now turning to Q1, 2014 we expect consolidated revenues to be in the range of $1,755 million to $1,805 million. If current foreign exchange rates hold constant the headwind from FX should be approximately $20 million as I mentioned or 115 basis points relative to Q1 of 2013. On an operational basis we expect consolidated Q1 sales to grow year-over-year in a range of plus 3% to plus 5%. ","For the first quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.16 to $0.18 per share and reported GAAP EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.06 to $0.08 per share. So with that I'll turn it back to Susie who will moderate the Q&A. Suzy?","Susan Lisa","Thanks, Dan. Roxanne let's open it up for questions through the next 20 to 25 minutes or so. In order to enable us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourselves to one question and one quick related follow-up. Roxanne, please go ahead. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly (Operator Instructions). The first question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Good morning. ","Michael F. Mahoney","Good morning. ","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Just two quick questions on S-ICD and CRM more broadly, one for Mike and one for Dan. So Mike obviously S-ICD is the key focus for us and investors here in 2014. I wonder could you characterize fourth quarter S-ICD traction in your commentary that you are above the low end of your expected range. So does this reflect your capacity, can you give us any color on 1Q trends and maybe quantify the 2014 outlook for S-ICD and then a quick follow-up for Dan? ","Michael F. Mahoney","","Yes, absolutely. So in S-ICD we expanded our IV sites really in the fourth quarter here. So as we go into right now the first quarter of 2014 the full year we do not have limitations in supply for S-ICD at this point. So the operational improvement that are made we will focus on is physician training and insuring that we have the right, excellent outcomes with S-ICD. And so to this point we are delivering on expectations operationally. ","In terms of the results overall for CRM, we saw strong pacer results and we also strong de novo ICD results, the pull down continues to be with our CRT-D results which drove the -- which impacted some of the headwinds of our CRM results. ","But overall ICD have been strong, pacers have been strong, and we anticipate S-ICD to be a significant share taker for us for de novo ICD implants as we head in 2014. So we are not going to provide specific guidance as to the carve out of the S-ICD number at this point but we are comfortable with S-ICD in combination with the quad lead that we will be launching in Europe will drive share gains in CRM in 2014. ","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you and then Dan, we were encouraged by margin outlook for the total corporation in 2014 but you did mention several times in the script here CRM margins being a specific focus for 2014. So can you in a sense of what type of progress can be made in the CRM margins in 2014 and\/or what is the key drivers of margin expansion for the company in 2014?","Daniel J. Brennan","","Yeah, David. The Rhythm management profitability as Mike mentioned was essentially flat year-over-year driven mostly by the cost in Q4 which were what we believe one-time in nature and driven by launches and bringing S-ICD back to the market. So we would look to make considerable progress in 2014 on rhythm management margin and still remain committed that we get that up to the mid-20s by that 2017 timeframe and obviously it's a big piece of how we get to our 25 as an overall company. ","In terms of how we do that it's really just throughout the P&L. I mean as you look at these new product launches that we talked about with Quad and the Quad lead and CRT-D those are higher margins than some of the technologies that they are replacing. And that's the theme that will continue over the next few years with CRM as we launch new technologies that will be margin accretive, so that's one piece. ","We get operating leverage from increasing sales. So we plan to increase sales within CRM and that gives us the ability to drop through more relative to that sales increase. And then within SG&A and R&D it's continuing to optimize and drive the most efficient structure that we can. So we are a little disappointed that we stayed flat in 2013 but remain committed for the future increases for management profitability. ","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Thank you very much. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. ","Michael F. Mahoney","Good morning, Mike. ","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co.","Yeah. Can you hear me okay?","Michael F. Mahoney","Yes we can. ","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co","Okay, perfect thanks. Could you just spend a minute on margins. One was the sequential step down in gross margin line if there is anything unusual nature of that? And then secondly just want to make sure I understand your operating margin targets for 2014 relative to your long range plan? Thanks.","Daniel J. Brennan","Sure so in terms of Q4 versus Q3 gross margin really the thing that impacted at the most was the transition related to inventory charges that we had. So we were at 70.7% gross margin in Q3, we were at 70% gross margin in Q4 and that's worth about 50 basis point in the step down from Q3 to Q4. Relative to the overall margins for us going forward from an operating margin standpoint, if you heard for 2014 we're looking at something approaching 20% from an operating margin and going forward we'll be in that 100 basis point plus range now through 2017 with increasing revenue new growth to really drop through more leverage and get to that goal or better by 2017.","So we still remain committed to 2017 25% operating margin at this point. ","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co","And then on the S-ICD re-launch here I think we're a bit surprised that we didn't see more initial progress in the U.S. business in the fourth quarter. And it's hard for us outside here to judge the supplier ramp over the course of the quarter. So as you are speaking about the first half of this year would you be surprised if you didn't show sequential share gains just based on having full availability at this point? And do you want to give guidance for ICDs for the first quarter which I think you didn't give for the first time? Thanks.","Michael F. Mahoney","Yeah so we can be more enthusiastic about S-ICD and its ability to treat primary and secondary prevention patients and really the differentiation that we have with us so strategically we think it's very unique and powerful to be a CRM story. We do think we will gain de novo ICD implant share in the first half of the year. ","The CRT-D mix that we keep talking about is what's watering that down. So our de novo ICD share we believe has increased in fourth quarter and we believe that will continue to increase in the first half of 2014 driven by the strength of ICD and the S-ICD. The wane in the CRT-D is what's been dragging that piece down and which will be resolved in Europe and we'll start to explore quad CRT-D trial in the first half of 2014. ","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co","So Mike in your internal modeling do you assume that between those pluses and minuses obviously S-ICD being a plus and then the CRT-D competiveness in replacement cycle being negative, do you view yourselves as share gainers in ICDs in 2014, total ICDs?","Michael F. Mahoney","In total ICD we believe for the full year we should gain share. The second half should accelerate with the quad lead being ramped up in Europe. So for full year we believe we'll be a share taker. We believe we'll definitely be a share taker in that single chamber ICDs, so that's driven by S-ICD. ","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co","Okay. Thanks, Mike. And then if I could ask one other question on the no guidance for ICDs. ","Daniel J. Brennan","And really the driver there is we believe now are much more diversified company, less reliance on one product line. So we're going to be much more reticent to provide franchise specific guidance at this point?","Michael F. Mahoney","Okay. Next question?","Operator","Next question is from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go head.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch","Hi, Thanks for taking the question. I want to ask two things, one on the tax rate and again back on margins. So obviously the tax rate was a source of upside for this particular year and I think you got about the lowest tax rate of any company that I follow and so Dan I just want to get your sense stepping into the roles for the first time how sustainable kind of a 13% to 15% tax outlook is for the company in light of the fact that long-term some of the inter-company loans might fade straightaway. ","So how long you think you can enjoy this low of the tax rate and as we model longer term should we model some upward pressure? ","Daniel J. Brennan","I think what we have gone on record before saying it's 15% for 2014 and '15 based on some of the geographic mix that we're seeing. I think we're comfortable saying 13% to 15% or next year and 13% to 15% for 2015 as well. ","I would be reluctant to go further out than that at this point but I think we're very comfortable that we can have 13% to 15% for this year and next year as well. ","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's helpful. And then on the margin front and I apologize if I have my numbers wrong here but it also looks like the cardiovascular segment margins in Q4 were down sequentially and I was wondering if you could just comment broadly on what you saw in terms of pricing across your franchises this quarter and any particulars on what drove the cardiovascular margin weakness this quarter if I got that numbers right?","Daniel J. Brennan","Yes. We had a slight dip down in margins in our cardiovascular reporting segments there, a couple one is we are now preparing for the launch of our PREMIER platform, so we did a lot, quite a bit of stock in inventory to get PREMIER launch which we have fully launched in the first quarter of 2014. So a lot of inventory movement there prepared for that which we believe will be share gain for in DES in 2014. ","Also we have in terms of improvement areas International DES performance in fact our global performance in 2013 is not what we wanted to be. We did lose a little bit of share in Europe and we are off the market in Germany as well as Japan and our PREMIER approval was late, we just received it shortly after TCP.","So with a challenging year overall for DES it was a very positive year for our IC other business segment with 7% and as a mix that IC other businesses is almost the same size as our DES business now. But going into ' 14 we expect the improvement in our margins in the cardiovascular segments given our preparation in inventory available now for both SYNERGY and PREMIER.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch","And anything going on with pricing that's noteworthy relative to recent trends?","Daniel J. Brennan","Nothing significantly difference we like the positions just going forward in '14 we have a three tier strategy with our synergy prices to premium, in our PROMUS PREMIER and our Promus line. So we believe that will be able to hopefully improve the pricing impact that we observes the past few years but we call Canada a mid-single digit overall price headwind in DES.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks for taking the questions.","Daniel J. Brennan","","Thanks Bob.","Operator","The next question is Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning everybody. If I can follow up on a couple of product points Alair it sounds like you had a terrific quarter on a small base. Mike can you update us on where you are with insurance, you were still hoping to get some of the large insurers what's next and maybe if you could frame the growth and continued roll out a little bit there?","Michael F. Mahoney","Yes on Alair we continue to make progress here we had higher reorder rates for the platform, the payers continued to reimburse although on a one-off basis and we also, as you know, had a five year data that was published in the second half of 2013. So we remain bullish about although I'll point out that we haven't had a major payer reimbursement platform. And so in 2014, we are going to through another cycle of this major payers to determine what they are going to reimburse the platform and we have appropriate guidance, appropriate projections built in for the platform and we continue to expect strong growth although it won't be breakthrough growth until we can knock down one of these payers and that's where our team's focused on in '14. ","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, and two quick follow ups on the S-ICD the supply ramp is clearly picking up base on our work. When are you at full launch there and maybe if you could also just quantify the impact of the OrbusNeich impact what kind of the drag in fourth quarter DES sales and I assume that's back now?","Daniel J. Brennan","On the S-ICD this is not like a drug eluting stent, so we don't stock it and replace PREMIER like we would Promus with DES and move it to a 1000 labs in a few weeks. So this is a very controlled thoughtful platform launch that requires training for physicians and a proper amount of clinical work to support it. So it's not like DES launch. ","So S-ICD will continue to ramp, we moved the IDE centers, there is clearly a queue physicians that we are successfully training them right now and that queue is quite extensive and so there is lot of enthusiasm for it and we think it will grow it will be a share taker for us for our de novo ICD implants. ","And the awareness of the therapy continues to build and support that. And so we think this is really unique opportunity for us and we don't see ourselves being supply constrained, it's more of a constraint on training and effective rollout of the products. ","What was the second one? Yeah, the OrbusNeich, what the OrbusNeich in Europe did was basically limit us in terms of hitting the Q4 running relative to some of the tender cycles that will take place in Europe and such that\u2019s why we called that out as kind of a bit of a challenge ramping up in Q4 but we think in 2014 we can put some of that behind us.","Michael F. Mahoney","Drs. Stein, do you want to make any other comments on S-ICD roll out?","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Ken Stein ","Yeah I think I would just say to reiterate what you said Mike that we are not any longer capacity constrained the productions ramped up, now it\u2019s really a matter of getting physicians through the training both in terms of how to select patients, how to screen patients as well as the implant technique that what we found that physician\u2019s view of the roll of the device where it fits in and in particularly primary prevention patients really changes once it actually been exposed to the training and once they have one or two implants under their belt. ","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","","Our next question is from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","","Hi, thanks. Just a follow-up on the subcutaneous ICD training. In the percutaneous valve market the companies have been giving us how many centers they think they can train per quarter per year. Is that something you can share with us in other words how many centers you are in today, how many centers you think you can train per quarter? I would imagine that that\u2019s going to be a big driver of the revenue growth in 2014. ","Michael F. Mahoney","","It\u2019s Mike here. Today we haven\u2019t. That\u2019s certainly something we can consider going forward in 2014 but today we haven\u2019t publically stated how many physicians we trained or how many centers going forward.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","Okay let me ask just two quick follow-ups just on the stents side, the OUS number did come in where you highlighted Germany. Were there any other sources of weakness outside the U.S.?","Michael F. Mahoney","","For drug eluting stents yeah the weakness again Turkey wasn\u2019t a great year for us in drug eluting stents. It was a very strong year in our other interventional cardiology business that grew 7%. So the weakness in DES really was Japan with some competitive product launches, Europe we were off the market in Germany for a significant part of the year and quite frankly in U.S. where we anticipated approvals of our PREMIER products early in the fourth quarter it didn't receive until just toward the very end of the year.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","When does Japan reverse?","Michael F. Mahoney","So in Japan in 2014 we launched PROMUS PREMIER pending approval in Japan we believe in the second half of the year. So we believe we will get back to share taking and a leadership position which we traditionally enjoyed in Japan as we move towards the back half of 2014. We do have a as it is competition pricing headwind in Japan this year for drug eluting stents as the pricing comes down but overall we believe we will get back to a share taking position in the second half in Japan and we should be in a share taking position in U.S. now as we move into the first quarter.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","Great. And then just one quick one, the REPRISE U.S. trials for Lotus when in 2014 will that start first half, second half?","Michael F. Mahoney","So we haven\u2019t locked that in yet with the FDA but we\u2019re projecting a second half of the year IV initiation. ","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brooks West with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Brooks West \u2013 Piper Jaffray","","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Mike we\u2019ve been much more focused on electrophysiology as a potential growth driver for your CRM franchise and I wonder if you would give us a little bit of color on where are you with the Bard EP integration and where are you with the Rhythmia launch and as we think about how that franchise within CRM kind of performs I imagine you are spending pretty heavily right now, is it fair to assume that as we see revenues ramp we\u2019re also going to see operating margin contribution pretty significantly ramp in EP?","Michael F. Mahoney","Absolutely, Dan touched on earlier -- thanks for the question first of all, the operating income margin of the Rhythm management group is clearly not what we want it to be and we have been purposely making investments in that business because we see the size of the market and the growth potential and we talked about it today with S-ICD, with WATCHMAN, with our quad and all the moves we made to your point in EP, with the acquisition of C.R. Bard, the acquisition of Rhythmia. ","So we really like the market profile of this. We don't like our current operating income margin. And as you indicated as we go through '14 here and we deliver consistent top line growth that will help because the business has suffered historically not growing. So we believe we'll grow the business, we'll see the reverse of the negative dilution of the acquisitions, the short-term negative dilution of Bard and the negative dilution of WATCHMAN and [Livya] Although those kind of acquisitions that have been dilutive will reverse themselves as we move through '14 and '15.","If you combined that with improved gross margins of new products that we're lunching, new S-ICD will be launched, new quad, new platforms of our primary ICD and CRT-Ds will be launched with improved gross margins. So growing consistently the reversal of the dilution of these adjacencies and improved gross margins of new products and smarter SG&A spend will really contribute significant margin improvement and rhythm management which really is the backbone of the strategy for the overall corporation's improvement in operating income margin. ","Daniel J. Brennan","And I think it's important point Brooks as well that you bring up which is EPS is kind of sometimes forgotten as a piece of that rhythm management group but we're looking for that to contribute much more significantly to operating income going forward. ","Brooks West \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Thanks for that and then on neuro guys better than expected growth in Q4. Again I know there is a reimbursement change coming next year. Can you talk about how we should think about the growth of neuro franchise as you look at anniversary some of the really good performance this year?","Daniel J. Brennan","Yeah so we haven't provided specific guidance but we grew over 30% for second half of 2013 and we've taken a clear leadership position and gained significant share in a market that's nicely profitable. ","So we really like the platform that we have and the capability advantages that we have and how we can extend that platform into other therapies that we're either in trial and\/or considering. So we would anticipate that, that market, that growth is going to come down in 2014 given the comparables that we're going to have at the start of second quarter and also some of the pricing pressure.","So we do believe that, that business would continue to grow faster than market and gain share but not at the levels of 30%. ","Brooks West \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Great, thanks guys. ","Operator","We have a question from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen & Company. Please go head.","Josh T. Jennings - Cowen & Co., LLC","Hi, good morning thanks for taking the questions. I just want to start off with international drug-eluting stent question, just with that franchise and looking at the full European launch of SYNERGY it seemed to me there would be some meaningful opportunity there to improve on that performance. ","Can you just take us through again just what your strategy is there pricing as well as the opportunities that were available on the technology platform? ","Michael F. Mahoney","I'll make a few comments and I'll have a comments and then I will have Dr. Dawkins comment as well. So we've been -- we believe we've been disciplined in trying to come up with a new production tiered product portfolio to address what's historically been a challenging pricing market. ","So it's still a large business but in drug-eluting stents now we have a strategy where we have a, we believe a highly differentiated bio-absorbable stent with SYNERGY that we are pricing at a premium. We are launching that product in markets that will support a premium price so that's not the entire European market. ","Our strategy today has not been to drive that price down to workhorse level to try to gain short-term share at the cost of eroding a market. So we've been keeping that at a price premium because we think it's the best product and we're really launching that product in geographies that will support that price. ","The second product that we have is PREMIER which likely we'll have a greater mix in terms of overall mix of DES internationally. We believe that's the second best stent in the marketplace behind SYNERGY in terms of its ability to be a work horse stent and treat complex coronary arteries and we'll launch that product throughout Europe and essentially that's being done now. ","And then we have a couple of countries that are very, very price sensitive. And we have another brand just called Promus that will continue to sell in that those geographies. So that's the strategy. The fact that we were off the market in Germany which is the large market hurt us in '13, we'll get back in the market in '14 and we hope to use that strategy not only to gain share but to gain share thoughtfully while managing price effectively. ","Keith D. Dawkins","","I would just add Josh that not only just do we want a premium for SYNERGY but we want to support the product with a very wide clinical trial portfolio. And you would have heard in Mike's comments earlier on the call that we have now almost 28,000 patients in both Boston Scientific Studies and investigator-sponsored Research. ","Exploring SYNERGY in complex coronary disease in a variety of other scenarios including short DAPT. So we want to underpin the launch not only from a premium price point of view but also with clinical data. As you know we have now have two year published data for the -- released EVOLVE study, we have completed the EVOLVE IDE trial and we in 2014 have already started a number of investigator sponsored trials which will give us additional data on the platform. ","With regards to your comments about bio-absorbable we are interested in the total bio-absorbable space synergy, you know we made an investment in a start-up Amaranth. We don't think the current availability VVS technology which has a sub 5% market share is a workhorse product. We think the stats are big, we think the delivery is in period and we think that the large polymer load lasts too long. And we will be working both internally and externally on a platform. ","But right now the focus is Synergy because the key performance is what cardiologists want and they want the polymer and the drug to disappear early and that's exactly what's in the\u2026 ","Josh T. Jennings - Cowen & Co., LLC","Great, and just a quick follow-up obviously from questions on the call here, its big focus on the subcutaneous ICD franchise. I was just hoping you could maybe give us some insight into some advancements in that technology platform and maybe some timelines in terms of can you generate your size down, battery life and what can be improved there and when should we see kind of generation 2.0? Thanks a lot. ","Michael F. Mahoney","Sure. Thanks for the question. We can always improve on our platforms and right now with S-ICD what we are really focused on excellent training and excellent outcomes to carve out what we think will be a significant category. And for a physician today the S-ICD is the fitness device and a long lasting battery for subcutaneous ICDs. And so we think it's uniquely positioned today. And if they want a lead solution we have many of those a new platform that we are just launching. ","So we think it's uniquely differentiated in its existing platform, we think we have a generation ahead lead in terms of the competition and we will continue to work on new features and capabilities as we look at generation 2.0 and we will certainly give more color on generation 2.0 as we get through 2014. But right now our focus really is on training and delivering excellent outcomes for a very differentiated device in its current generation. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. ","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Good morning and thanks for fitting me in. Guys I have couple of housekeeping items. For the R&D tax credit Dan, it's not in the guidance, so that's worth roughly 200 basis points or $0.02 I just wanted to confirm that. And then there were two, I think less selling days in the first quarter of last year. Is there a difference in the day count in the first quarter of this year or any quarter in 2014 that you would call out in? ","And then just lastly on the Japan cut, there were some significant cuts in 2012. What are you guys expecting this year kind of overall the high single-digit, mid to high single-digit for the company and anything that you would call out on the FAP cuts for '14 and then I will drop. Thanks. ","Daniel J. Brennan ","Great, Larry. So this Dan, I can probably take those pretty quickly. So the tax, yeah you are correct. So we've not assumed the R&D tax credit in 2014 because it has not yet been enacted. So and that's worth about two points. So I think you are correct there. So if that were to get enacted that's a two point benefit for us. ","On days, there should be no change in days for us relative to Q1 or the full year. And then relative to the Japan price cuts which was your third question. We don't really know that hasn't been released yet, obviously so we don't know the specifics of that. But that will certainly be a headwind of growth for Japan and for the company in total depending on where that number comes in. But really don't have a sense yet as to what that will be and we will be obviously more forthcoming once the Japanese government finalizes those numbers. ","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Thanks for taking the questions. ","Daniel J. Brennan ","Great. ","Susan Lisa","Roxanne we have time we will take two more please.","Operator","The next question is from Matthew Dodds with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc","","Hey good morning. I just had a follow up on the last question that Larry asked for the Japan price cuts you have modeled in price cut before changes, you are waiting for the final number, right?","Michael F. Mahoney","Yeah Matt we certainly have modeled that in and we have all of our assumptions on share and volume and the whole bit. And so in Japan certainly it will be a more of a headwind for us in \u201914. We think it will be offset by some volume benefit in the first and second half of the year. As we look at overall mix globally of DES pricing we got kind of call in the negative mid-single digit range and hope that will be offset with our mix strategy that we have in Europe and the new launch with PREMIER in the US. ","So we think globally it will be a slight headwind but we will make couple over the volume with some of our new portfolio.","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc","And then just quickly MedSurg didn't get a lot of attention today, endoscopy and urology women\u2019s health is there any reason to assume that the growth rates would deviate a lot from this year and you are not giving guidance but is there anything particular that might change what\u2019s been going on in the last couple of quarters?","Michael F. Mahoney","No, we feel very strong and thanks for asking about that, medical surgical represents now 45% of our business mix and growing. We continue to improve its operating income margins. All three of those businesses and the women\u2019s health urology and endoscopy are growing faster than market. We have new refreshed pipeline that we\u2019ll launch in \u201914. They are expanding internationally and so we don't anticipate any slowdown in the performance of our women\u2019s health urology and endoscopy business.","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc","Thanks Mike.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Bruce Nudell \u2013 Credit Suisse","","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just looking at your guidance for \u201914 you know 4% constant currency middle of range, 20% operating margin and tax at 15% at the high end of the range, that gets you to kind of the high end of EPS guidance. Should we be thinking about or how should we think about things if things go better than that with tax at the low end and you know maybe revenue at the higher end? Should we be thinking about reinvestment or upside to numbers?","Daniel J. Brennan","Bruce this is Dan. Good question. I think if you look at the numbers we gave relative to the midpoint of all that it should actually come to the middle of our range which would be albeit not a round number but about $0.775. So I think the math would get you there you can kind of take a tax rate of 14%, you take 4% revenue growth all the way down take the middle of those and you should get kind of that $0.775. I think what we\u2019ll do relative to if we saw upside in businesses would be to try and book some of that upside and get a head start on the 25%. ","Michael F. Mahoney","Yeah I think we\u2019re very comfortable and quite frankly we want our SG&A to go down. The fourth quarter SG&A is high, and we have a focus on improving operating income margins of the company and so if we are fortunate to have some additional room we want to sharpen the SG&A and operating income margin performance for company. ","Bruce Nudell \u2013 Credit Suisse","","Perfect and as you could judge by the questions on the call the S-ICD is an area of extreme focus but just thinking about it more generally and more in the midterm I think most street models have a S-ICD at least 5% unit share and given the ASP that has and the fact that a lot of it\u2019s not cannibalizing your business that has important share connotations as we go forward. Could you just like kind of express your overall goals in terms of ICD share on a global basis you know in the context of the S-ICD and CRT-D launches?","Michael F. Mahoney","Yeah I guess we\u2019ve probably not given color on that area. You know we think that would kind of back to the regional question, we really we do believe that will be a share taker in the ICD market in 2014 with this launch with the S-ICD being broadly available as well as the current capabilities of our existing line, with this battery longevity and leave your liability and remote patient monitoring. So we believe we\u2019ll take share particularly in de novo ICD. CRT-D will continue to suffer in the U.S. until we launch our quad core program.","Bruce Nudell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks so much.","Susan Lisa","Thanks Bruce.

Please go ahead.","Michael Campbell","Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Capello, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q4 and full year results for 2012, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release, as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call, along with other supporting schedules, to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financial Information.","The duration of this morning's call will be approximately 1 hour. Mike will begin our prepared remarks with an update on our business progress and his perspectives on the quarter and 2013. Jeff will then review our Q4 financial results and business performance, as well as Q1 and full year 2013 guidance. We will then open the call up to questions.","During today's Q&A session, Mike and Jeff will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Dawkins and Dr. Stein.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate and other similar words.","These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share; our products including new product approvals, launches and performance; procedural volumes and pricing; clinical trials and results; cost savings and growth opportunities; our cash flow and expected uses; our expected financial performance including sales, margins, earnings and other guidance for Q1 and full year 2013; as well as expected tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses.","Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in our Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs and 8-Ks filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them.","At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike?","Michael F. Mahoney","Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us this morning. So I'll begin today with some comments regarding our fourth quarter performance, which Jeff will cover in more detail in a few minutes.","Overall, we demonstrated improved performance during the quarter. We delivered sales of $1,821,000,000, down 1% on both a reported and an operational basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange and the divested Neurovascular business. This was above our guidance range and Street consensus. Meanwhile our adjusted EPS of $0.18 was at the higher end of our guidance range and above Street consensus. We also generated strong operating cash flow of $370 million and used a portion of our cash flow to buy back approximately 18 million shares of stock in the quarter.","We saw a continued above-market growth in several of our businesses. And the growth figures that I'll highlight are all on a constant currency basis.","So starting off. Neuromodulation grew at 14%, Endoscopy grew at 10% and our Peripheral Interventions or our PI business grew at 9%. We also continued to see strong returns on our investments in the emerging markets with combined revenue in Brazil, Russia, India and China growing 35% in the quarter. As we further build our capabilities in these countries, we expect this growth trend to continue into 2013.","We continue to make progress on strengthening our CRM and EP business with the U.S. launch of the S-ICD System and the completion of the acquisition of Rhythmia Medical. Additionally, we continue to expand the high-growth adjacent markets such as hypertension by completing our acquisition of Vessix Vascular.","So let me now go into more detail regarding our business performance for the quarter. In the Interventional Cardiology or IC market, global PCIs continue to grow mid-single digits with growth in international markets offset by declines in the U.S., which, combined with global pricing dynamics, are yielding a global market that we believe is declining in low to mid-single digits. During the quarter, IC revenues declined 9%. While we're disappointed in our lack of growth, we believe that our U.S. DES share is stabilizing and we were able to grow international DES revenue mid-single digits. In the U.S., our PROMUS Element Plus long-length stents have been well received and we expect them to provide access to more competitive accounts as those accounts come up for contract renewal. We estimate our fourth quarter U.S. DES share to be in the mid-30s.","And in terms of our U.S. -- I'm sorry, in terms of our DES pipeline, our next generation of SYNERGY Stent continues to progress according to plan with CE Mark Approval received in late October and a controlled limited launch currently underway in Europe. The early feedback from customers has been very positive. And further, we commenced our SYNERGY U.S. IDE trial called EVOLVE II and enrollment is tracking on schedule. Also, our launch of PROMUS Element Plus long lesion and small vessel stents in Japan has delivered solid share gains in that market.","So with our PROMUS and SYNERGY platforms, we believe that we have the most compelling DES portfolio and pipeline in the industry as backed by clinical evidence. And the continued focus on commercial execution of our overall IC pipeline and the continued favorable clinical evidence of our DES platforms, we believe that we will stabilize our DES share in the first half of 2013 and grow our DES share in the second half of the year.","In our core IC business, we improved our performance sequentially. We continued the launch of the Emerge balloon catheter during the quarter and we've continued to receive positive feedback from customers. In addition, we commenced our commercial rollout of the BridgePoint Medical suite of coronary CTO devices that add to our unique and clinically differentiated portfolio of IC products, all of which enable us to be uniquely positioned to provide treatment for complex PCI procedures.","On the structural heart front, we continued to make progress in TAVR with the Lotus Valve. Lotus is a differentiated, second-generation valve that is fully repositionable and recapture-able post deployment. At TCT, favorable 3-month data from the REPRISE I trial were presented. And we expect to complete REPRISE II in the first half of 2013 with projected CE Mark approval and European launch of the Lotus Valve to occur in the second half of 2013.","So moving on to our PI business, Peripheral Interventions. PI delivered strong growth of 9%, resulting from a cadence of new product launches. We continued to see growth around the world with the U.S. and Asia Pac regions showing double-digit growth during the quarter. And this year, we're very excited to announce the acquisition of Vessix Vascular, which closed in the fourth quarter. This technology is a second generation of renal denervation platform for the treatment of uncontrolled hypertension. This platform is highly differentiated and it accelerates our entry into what we expect to be a multibillion-dollar market in the next 5 to 10 years. We expect to launch this platform commercially in Europe and other international markets in the second half of 2013.","Overall, we believe that the end markets in PI are healthy, they're growing mid-single digits and we will continue to drive above-market growth both in the U.S. and globally in 2013.","In Endoscopy, we had a strong quarter with 10% growth worldwide. During the quarter, several of our key product franchises in Endo experienced strong growth, namely our biliary, biopsy, metal stents and hemostasis franchises. Also, effective January 1, 2013, Category I CPT codes are now in place for the Alair platform, which is our bronchial thermoplasty system. This is a major reimbursement milestone for BT and we believe it also reflects the strength of the clinical evidence and the growing support for this procedure among pulmonary physicians. We expect those codes to provide greater access for treatment for patients with poorly controlled, severe asthma, it'll facilitate easier claims processing and accelerate private payer's coverage of this important treatment option.","In the quarter, we surpassed our year-end goal exiting 2012 with approximately 230 sites and 18 countries using our BT platform.","Overall, we believe that the end markets in Endo are healthy, and we will continue to drive above-market growth on a global basis in 2013.","In our Urology and Women's Health division, we returned to growth with a 3% increase during the quarter. The Urology business continued to perform very well with strong growth due to our commercial expansion and effective product launches. Our Women's Health business continues to be pressured, particularly in the U.S., due to the market declines in the pelvic floor procedures. In 2013, we have a strong pipeline in Women's Health and Urology with 7 expected new product launches. And in addition, we plan to continue expanding the global footprint of this business.","In Neuromodulation, we delivered 14% growth during the quarter and we now have a clear #2 position in spinal cord stimulation in the U.S., driven by a leading technology and excellent consistent execution. We recently launched the Precision Spectra Spinal Cord Stimulation System in Europe. Precision Spectra is the industry's first 32-contact spinal cord stimulation system offering several market-differentiating features that are designed to provide clinicians with greater flexibility in treating the broadest spectrum of pain patients. We are pleased with the physician enthusiasm that Spectra has received, and we expect the launches in the U.S. in the first half of 2013.","So now, let's move to the CRM business. Our worldwide CRM business declined 4% during the quarter, and we believe that the worldwide CRM market continued to show signs of stabilization during the quarter, declining to low to mid-single digits for the full year. In the U.S., we continued to see the easing of year-over-year comparisons as we sunset the significant 2011 market declines. In the U.S., we estimate the defib market decline in the mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. And from a share perspective, we estimate that overall U.S. de novo defib share continue to increase sequentially, thanks to the continued strong performance of our INCEPTA and ENERGEN family of ICDs and our highly reliable RELIANCE lead platform. In addition, sales of our RELIANCE leads remain strong in the quarter, driving continued increase of our defib lead-to-port ratio.","So now, let's turn to our innovative S-ICD platform. So during the fourth quarter, we continued to manage a controlled launch of the S-ICD System. We are continuing to enhance our supply chain to meet the very strong clinical demand for this technology that follows early FDA approval. We believe that the growing demand for the S-ICD highlights the strategic importance of this innovative technology for patients and to our CRM business. We believe that the S-ICD technology provides us with the opportunity to both take share in the existing ICD market and to expand the market over time.","Also, the recently announced results of the 1,500 patient MADIT-RIT trial highlights the potential of the S-ICD. This trial demonstrated that very simple ICD device programming with limited antitachycardia pacing and relatively long delays before giving therapy resulted in significantly better outcomes for participating patients. And thus, simple programming, limited pacing at longer delays before therapy are all design features of the S-ICD.","On the pacing side, we believe we've taken modest share both in the U.S. and internationally with our INGENIO family of pacemakers and CRTPs, thanks to an upgraded platform that now includes wireless telemetry, RPM-enabled devices and other significant new design features. In terms of our pacer pricing, our pricing has remained relatively stable versus last year, thanks in part to price uplifts we realized on this new platform.","Now, turning to left atrial appendage. The WATCHMAN product line continues to show strong growth in international markets, both on a sequential and year-over-year comparison. Specifically, WATCHMAN implants in the fourth quarter grew by more than 65% year-over-year.","And finally, in our EP business which grew 5% during the quarter, we're focused on making good progress on several new internal AFib-focused projects. We have CE Mark for our Blazer Open-Irrigated Catheter, and we are currently enrolling 2 IDE trials for approval of the open-irrigated Catheter in the U.S. BLOCk-CTI study for AFib -- I'm sorry, for atrial flutter, and ZERO-AF for atrial fibrillation.","In addition, we're excited about the recent acquisition of Rhythmia Medical and its next-generation mapping and navigation solutions. This acquisition is a decisive step by Boston Scientific and it shows our commitment to the Electrophysiology business and better positions the company to participate in the fast-growing EP market. So we expect CE Mark approval of Rhythmia platform in the first half of 2013 with FDA approval in the second half and a full EU and U.S. launch in 2014.","So to wrap up the rhythm management section. We believe that the combination of the S-ICD, WATCHMAN and newly rejuvenated pacing and ICD platform, combined with a stronger EP and mapping portfolio, will provide BSC a truly differentiated offering for EP that we expect to improve our future growth profile.","So in summary, in 2012, although we're encouraged by our performance in the fourth quarter, we're clearly not satisfied. Overall, 2012 was a challenging year in terms of top line performance. However, we were successful in hitting our adjusted earnings for the year and continued to generate significant adjusted free cash flow. So despite these challenges, we believe that there's a lot to be positive about: we continue to see above-market growth in several of our businesses; we expanded our capabilities in emerging markets; and we began to see some encouraging signs of stabilization in our core IC and CRM markets.","We're also encouraged by the recent progress we've made on strengthening our largest core businesses with the early launch of the S-ICD System in the U.S., the acquisition of BridgePoint in the CTO device segment and CE Mark approval for our next-generation stent system called SYNERGY. We've also seen continued strategic push in the higher-growth adjacent markets by acquiring Vessix Vascular for the treatment of hypertension and Rhythmia Medical for mapping and navigation.","So finally, we continued our share repurchase program and now bought back 12% of the outstanding shares of the company in the last 18 months.","So taken together, we believe that our progress in '12 puts us in a stronger position going forward and will lead to improve shareholder returns, particularly given our current stock price valuation.","So before moving to 2013, I want to highlight our new strategic imperatives and provide an overview to the changes being made right now to strengthen our global execution. These imperatives will be used to guide the company going forward.","So first, we plan to improve our execution to increase share in our core markets by adding new capabilities and innovation to drive clinical and economic value to our customers. Secondly, we're entering new and faster-growing adjacent markets. We're leveraging our current capabilities, including our global manufacturing, clinical and sales organizations to grow in these markets. Third, we're driving global expansion through a strong and continued focus on our international markets, including the BRIC countries and other emerging markets. And fourth, we plan to fund our growth strategy and improve margins by focusing on continuous improvement and following a disciplined approach to restructuring as evidenced by today's announcement, which Jeff will discuss in more detail later. Lastly, we continue to develop new capabilities and programs for our employees to compete and lead in the shifting global med tech environment.","Now, I would also like to highlight the important leadership and operational changes that we're already making and will continue to work on as we strengthen our global execution. Number one, we're moving a global operating structure across our business units. We believe this structure will enable us to operate more efficiently and effectively by improving our speed in global resource allocation. Two, we're streamlining our commercial sales model, both in the U.S. and Europe, by reducing layers and complexity. We're also building a stronger corporate solutions organization to meet the demands of the large integrated health networks and emerging accountable care organizations. We strengthened our leadership team with a number of important organizational changes and experienced hires across the company. And we continue to strengthen our focus on emerging markets that's demonstrated by our plus-30% growth in 2012. We're shifting more of our R&D dollars into higher-growth markets and we're improving the leverage of our R&D capabilities across the company to unlock more synergies and growth opportunities. And lastly, we continue to be focused on continuous improvement and scaling back our corporate infrastructure to reduce costs and improve our overall speed.","We believe that these actions taken together demonstrate that we're thinking differently and acting decisively to improve our global execution and growth profile.","So with that, I'll now offer some comments regarding 2013, which Jeff will cover in more detail.","So as we look forward in 2013, we expect improved global execution and improved revenue and earnings performance. So with respect to revenue growth, we're projecting a range of negative 2% to positive 2% growth and we encourage you to model at the midpoint. We expect a slower first quarter with sequential improvement throughout the year, ending with a return to growth in the second half of 2013.","Looking across the company, we expect to see continued above-market growth in our PI and our MedSurg businesses, which consist of our Endoscopy, Urology and Women's Health and Neuromodulation divisions. We expect to see continued growth in the emerging markets, driven by accelerated top line performance in the BRIC countries. And lastly, we believe that our IC and CRM businesses will deliver improved performance versus 2012 and we expect to grow our market share in the second half in those businesses in 2013.","We expect to continue to drive our continuous improvement and restructuring initiatives while we invest in our strategic growth initiatives. We believe that the first half of 2013, and particularly the first quarter, will be a more challenging from a top line perspective due to tougher 2012 comparisons, primarily driven by competitive pressures in DES and the impact of fewer selling days in the first quarter. We expect to continue delivering on our continuous improvement opportunities to reduce costs and boost our overall speed. Unfortunately, we will also need to absorb the impact of the medical device tax under the U.S. Affordable Care Act that begins in 2013.","And with respect to operating margins and earnings, our 2013 EPS range is $0.64 to $0.70. At the midpoint of our guidance range, we're projecting a low single-digit adjusted EPS growth, but this includes the full impact of the medical device tax.","Lastly, we expect to generate strong cash flow, which we believe would enable us to fund more share purchases under our newly authorized $1 billion program and to continue to look at acquisitions to improve our future growth profile, which we expect will enhance shareholder return.","So in summary, we believe the steps we are taking are what's needed to turn around our performance and return Boston Scientific to growth. We plan to go into greater detail during our upcoming Investor Conference, which will be February 12 in New York City.","Let me now turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey D. Capello","Thanks, Mike. Let me begin by providing some overall perspective on the quarter before getting into the details. Despite continued challenging global economic and market conditions, we generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.18, which was at the higher end of our guidance range of $0.15 to $0.18 and above consensus. This solid profitability was driven by better top line performance, continued gross margin improvement and a favorable tax rate and fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by increased investments in our strategic growth initiatives. In addition to our solid adjusted earnings performance, we also generated $376 million in adjusted free cash flow and repurchased approximately 18 million more in shares in this quarter.","Consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter of $1,821,000,000 represents a decrease of 1% on both a reported and an operational basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange and the divested Neurovascular business. The actual headwind from foreign exchange on sales was $19 million and slightly higher than what we had assumed in our fourth quarter guidance range.","Now, I'll move to the detailed review of our business performance and operating results in the quarter. Starting with Interventional Cardiology. Worldwide revenue came in at $534 million in the fourth quarter, representing a constant currency decrease of 9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Worldwide DES revenues came in at $312 million in the fourth quarter, representing a constant currency decrease of 11% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. U.S. DES revenues were $118 million in the quarter, representing a decline of 29% compared to the fourth quarter last year. This decrease was primarily due to a strong comparison to the prior year quarter, driven by the launch of PROMUS Element Plus in the fourth quarter of 2011, lower share due to competitive products, lower ASPs and continued softness in PCI volumes and the number of devices used per procedure. We estimate that our U.S. DES share was stable sequentially in the mid-30s for the fourth quarter. International DES sales of $194 million represented an increase of 6% in constant currency compared to the fourth quarter last year, primarily driven by over 25% growth in the emerging markets of Brazil, India and China. Worldwide non-stent Interventional Cardiology was down 5% constant currency. However, with the upcoming launches of new products along with the acquisition of BridgePoint Medical suite of CTO devices, we expect to see continued improvement in this business over the course of 2013.","Now, moving on to CRM. Worldwide revenue was $457 million in the fourth quarter, representing a constant currency decrease of 4% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. In the U.S., CRM revenue of $265 million represented a 5% decrease from the fourth quarter of 2011. International CRM sales of $192 million were down 3% in constant currency compared to the prior year quarter.","On a worldwide basis, defib sales were $330 million in Q4, which was down 5% in constant currency from the fourth quarter of last year. In the U.S., defib sales were $204 million. This was down 5% compared to the fourth quarter of last year, due primarily to overall market declines. International defib sales of $126 million represented a 4% decrease in constant currency from last year.","Finally, worldwide pacer sales declined 3% on a constant currency basis as we continued to gain share in the quarter. In the U.S., pacer revenue declined 5% while international revenues declined 2% in constant currency for the quarter.","Moving on to Electrophysiology business. EP delivered a strong quarter with worldwide growth of 5% on a constant currency basis. Our Peripheral Interventions business delivered the fourth quarter in a row of above-market growth as worldwide revenue was up 9% in constant currency. Global growth was driven by impressive 12% growth in U.S. and 8% internationally.","Our Endoscopy business had another solid quarter of significant growth with worldwide sales up 10% in constant currency, led by 10% growth internationally and 9% growth in the U.S.","In constant currency, our worldwide Urology\/Women's Health business returned to growth this quarter with a 3% increase in sales. Growth was particularly strong internationally at 11%. The Urology business maintained its leadership position and delivered 6% worldwide constant currency growth driven by strong international growth of 10%.","Our Women's Health business declined 7% on a worldwide constant currency basis versus a decline of 11% in the prior quarter. We continue to see pressure on elective procedures and concerns around the use of surgical mesh for pelvic organ prolapse, specifically in the U.S. market.","In Neuromodulation, we ended 2012 on a strong note with 14% revenue growth on a worldwide basis driven by strong uptake of our 16-contact Infinion lead and our focus on commercial execution. We expect to sustain this momentum in 2013 as we work on bringing Precision Spectra to the spinal cord stimulation market.","Let me now briefly address full year 2012 revenue. On a reported basis, consolidated 2012 revenue was $7,249,000,000, which represents a 5% decrease from the prior year on a reported basis. In constant currency and excluding the impact of the Neurovascular divestiture, sales decreased 3% compared to 2012.","For the full year, foreign currency negatively impacted reported full year sales growth by approximately 160 basis points or about $124 million.","Moving on from sales. Adjusted gross profit margin for the fourth quarter was 68.1% or 330 basis point higher than the fourth quarter of last year. The increase was largely attributable to the continued mix shift towards self-manufactured product in DES as a result of the launches of PROMUS Element in U.S. and Japan, as well as benefits from our Plant Network Optimization plan and value improvement programs partially offset by price erosion and some product transition charges. For the full year 2012, adjusted gross profit margin was 67.8%.","Adjusted SG&A expenses were at $630 million or 34.6% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to $620 million or 33.6% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2011. During the fourth quarter 2012, benefits from cost-saving programs were offset by continued investments in emerging markets and costs associated with our strategic growth initiatives, including our recent acquisitions. For the full year 2012, adjusted SG&A expenses were $2,511,000,000 or 34.6% of sales.","Adjusted research and development expenses were $241 million for the fourth quarter or 13.2% of sales primarily driven by continued investments in our strategic growth initiatives, including costs associated with our SYNERGY U.S. IDE trial, EVOLVE II. This compares to $230 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. For the full year 2012, adjusted research and development expenses were $889 million or 12.3% of sales.","Royalty expense was $28 million or 1.6% of sales, compared to $33 million in the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year 2012, royalty expense was $153 million or 2.1% of sales.","On an adjusted basis, pretax operating income was $341 million or 18.7% of sales, up 170 basis points from the fourth quarter of last year. The increase in adjusted operating margins was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins, which were partially offset by the impact of lower sales.","GAAP operating income, which includes GAAP to adjusted items that had negative effect of $226 million on a pretax basis, was $115 million in the fourth quarter. The primary GAAP to adjusted items in the quarter were pretax restructuring costs of $52 million; pretax net litigation-related charges of $73 million; and pretax amortization expense of $101 million.","Now, I'll move on to other income expense. Interest expense was $64 million in the fourth quarter, which was $8 million lower than the fourth quarter of last year, primarily due to the collection of Spanish government receivables and the refinancing of our revolving credit facility in mid-2012. Our average interest expense rate in the fourth quarter of 2012 was 5.5% or about 40 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of last year. 2012 interest expense was $261 million or $21 million lower than 2011, primarily due to a lower average debt balance as a result of prepaying our term loan in 2011 and the refinancing of our $2 billion credit facility in mid-2012.","Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was a negative 19.3% on a reported GAAP basis and 8.5% on adjusted basis. The difference between a reported and adjusted tax rates for the quarter is attributable to the net benefit of restructuring, litigation and other net charges excluded in determining our non-GAAP results. Our 2012 tax rates do not include any benefit for the U.S. federal R&D credit due to timing of approval. Our adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter reflects an operational tax rate of approximately 12%, increased by discrete tax charges and reduced by a true up to the expense booked in previous quarters based upon our estimated full year operational tax rate. Our actual full year operational rate was lower than expected due to a change in the geographic mix of earnings.","For the full year, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.66 per share. On a reported GAAP basis, 2012 EPS was a loss of $2.89 per share. The GAAP results for 2012 included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition- and divestiture-related net credits, litigation and restructuring-related charges, discrete tax items and amortization expense after-tax of $5 billion or $3.55 per share.","Now I'll move on to the balance sheet. DSO of 61 days improved 1 day compared to December of last year due to good performance in emerging markets and U.S., offsetting weakness in EMEA. Despite lower inventory levels, days inventory on hand of 140 days was up 10 days compared to Q4 last year primarily due to lower cost of goods sold driven by the PROMUS Element transition.","Reported operating cash flow in the quarter was $370 million compared to $349 million last year. Q4 2011 included the receipt of $76 million from Abbott to settle our outstanding PROMUS cost adjustments. Excluding this receipt, reported operating cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2012 is $97 million higher than the fourth quarter 2011, primarily due to higher adjusted operating income and improved working capital management.","Q4 2012 reported operating cash flow included $61 million of restructuring payments compared to $25 million in the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year, restructuring payments in 2012 were $155 million compared to $121 million in 2011. In addition, the fourth quarter 2012 included $8 million of milestone earn-out payments related to prior acquisitions.","Capital expenditures were $63 million in the fourth quarter of this year compared to $81 million in the fourth quarter 2011. For the full year, capital expenditures were $226 million in 2012 compared to $304 million in 2011. The lower capital expenditure in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to the timing of infrastructure investments.","Based on the above, full year reported operating cash flow was $1,260,000,000 compared to $1 billion in 2011. 2011 included $296 million to settle a legacy GUIDE legal claim.","Turning to share repurchases. We repurchased another 18 million shares for approximately $100 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. In 2012, we repurchased 105 million shares for approximately $600 million. Since July 2011, we have now repurchased 187 million or approximately 12% of our outstanding shares. In addition, we announced today that a new program was authorized for the repurchase of up to $1 billion of the company's common stock, bringing the total authorization up to approximately $1.1 billion. We continue to believe that our stock price is undervalued and we currently expect to utilize approximately 1\/2 of our available adjusted free cash flow for the repurchases of shares in 2013, subject to business development opportunities, market conditions, our stock price, regulatory trading windows and other factors.","Today, we also announced an expansion of our 2011 restructuring program intended to build on the progress made under that program to strengthen our operational effectiveness and efficiencies and support our new investments, which we expect to increase shareholder value. The company estimates that the expansion will reduce gross annual pretax operating expenses by approximately $100 million to $115 million exiting 2013.","From a cost prospective, we expect that a substantial portion of the Total Program savings will be reinvested in targeted areas for future growth, including our strategic growth initiatives in emerging markets. Key activities under the Total Program including the expansion.","[Audio Gap]","so we estimate that the implementation of expansion results in total pretax charges of approximately $140 million to $160 million, of which $40 million should be noncash.","Let me now briefly provide some perspective on our outlook and walk you through our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2013.","As we enter 2013, we continue to expect dynamic market conditions with the risks of macroeconomic weakness, particularly in Europe and some softening procedural volumes in the U.S. However, despite these uncertainties, we believe there's reason to be positive. We have recently acquired new technologies and launched key new products in most of our businesses and are seeing high single digit or better sales growth in several of them. As a result, we remain focused on returning to top line growth in the near term. We also believe despite the medical device tax that we have the opportunities to enhance profitability and expect to continue to generate strong cash flow. In addition, we are leaving 2012 with encouraging signs of stabilization in both of our 2 largest end markets and related businesses.","Having considered those factors, we estimate that our consolidated 2013 sales will be between $7,050,000,000 and $7,350,000,000. Assuming that the current foreign exchange rates hold constant, we expect full year tailwind from FX to be approximately $15 million. On an operational basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange and the divested Neurovascular business, we estimate that consolidated 2013 sales will be in the range of up 2% to down 2% and we encourage you to model to the midpoint. The range assumes that the IC and CRM markets continue to stabilize and our revenue performance improves sequentially throughout the year, driven primarily by tougher year-over-year comparisons in the first half.","We expect our adjusted gross margin for the year, as a percent of sales, to be similar to 2012. Although we expect to continue to see downward pricing pressure, we expect this headwind to be offset by improved price management and manufacturing value improvement programs. We believe that the impact of these benefits will increase as we progress through the year.","As we forecast ongoing SG&A expense, please note that this includes the estimated impact of approximately 100 basis points from the medical device tax under the U.S. Affordable Care Act that begins in 2013. In addition, we expect to make investments in our strategic growth initiatives and continue to build our capabilities in emerging markets. However, the cost of these investments should be partially offset by restructuring savings. For the full year, we expect adjusted SG&A as a percent of sales to be between 35% and 36%.","We continue to transform our R&D organization and refocus our spending to drive innovation and growth. In 2013, we expect R&D spending, as a percent of sales, to be similar to 2012. We expect R&D expense to be higher in the first half of the year and gradually decline as a percentage of sales in the second half as savings initiatives are expected to partially offset spending on several of our strategic growth initiatives.","We currently expect royalties and other income and expense to be relatively flat to last year.","We expect our adjusted tax rate for the full year 2013 to be between 11% and 13%. This reflects an operational tax rate for 2013 between 13% and 15%, reduced by 2% for the retroactive extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit for 2012, which will be recorded in the first quarter of 2013. This excludes any other discrete tax items that may arise during the year. We are subject to tax authority examinations and many jurisdictions are scheduled to conclude in 2013. The final resolution of the exams may result in additional favorable or unfavorable discrete tax savings during the year that are difficult to forecast, but may impact our full year adjusted tax rate.","As a result, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2013 to be in a range of $0.64 to $0.70 and we encourage you to model to the midpoint of the range. The range reflects the estimated impact of approximately $0.04 per share from the medical device tax. Excluding any onetime items that may arise, we expect adjusted EPS to increase sequentially as we progress to the year with Q4 being the strongest quarter, driven by improved revenue performance and the timing of certain investments and cost benefits we expect to realize. On a reported basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.29 to $0.37.","Lastly for 2013, we expect adjusted free cash flow to exceed $1.2 billion, CapEx of approximately $300 million, pretax amortization expense of roughly $100 million per quarter and stock comp expense of approximately $110 million.","Now turning to the first quarter. We expect consolidated revenues to be in the range of $1,740,000,000 to $1,850,000,000. If current foreign exchange rates hold constant, the headwind from FX should be approximately $10 million or 50 basis points relative to the first quarter of last year. On an operational basis, we expect consolidated Q1 sales to be in a range of down 2% to down 6% and we encourage you to model at midpoint.","The forecasted decline in Q1 is primarily driven by tougher year-over-year comparisons and the impact of less selling days than in the prior period. On an adjusted days basis, Q1 operational revenues are expected to be more in the range of down 0 or flat to down 4%. On a worldwide basis, we expect DES revenue to be in a range of $280 million to $310 million and CRM revenue to be in a range of $455 million to $475 million. For the first quarter, adjusted EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.14 to $0.17 per share and reported GAAP EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.04 to $0.07.","That's it for guidance. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Michael who will moderate the Q&A. Michael?","Michael Campbell","Thanks, Jeff. Greg, let's open it up to questions for the next 20 minutes or so.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. One, can you elaborate a little bit more on the restructuring that is new going forward? In the press release, you talked about headcount reduction and some of the savings, but can you talk to us about which divisions is it -- are we coming from? Is this coming from CRM? Is it stents? Is it U.S., o-U.S.? Any type of color would be helpful.","Jeffrey D. Capello","Glenn, this is Jeff. Let me respond to that one. So as you remember, a couple of years ago, we talked about the opportunity through the emerging markets initiative and Zero Based Budgeting to take out $100 million to $200 million out of the cost structure of the company focused primarily on kind of the corporate infrastructure. And we've been saying all along throughout this year that we felt that we could do in excess of that. We came out with a restructuring plan midway through 2011 and said we would do somewhere between $225 million to $275 million in total savings by focusing primarily on those corporate infrastructure-type departments. So this program here is an extension of that. It's predominantly centered around the corporate functions that currently are larger than they need to be relative to the size of the business. There are some adjustments we are making to some of the businesses that are primarily outside of the commercial infrastructure. And so it's more or less right in line with what we anticipated doing relative to a couple of years ago and then the step-up we'd done a year ago.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just as a follow-up on the ICDs, your U.S. number did come in line with our expectation, so probably better execution. You talked about the new products gaining traction, but I was also wondering with the subcutaneous ICD in the marketplace today, have you been able to pick up any new accounts that you were previously cut out of?","Michael F. Mahoney","Sure. I'll touch on that, Glenn. We did have a controlled launch in 2012, 2013 as we continue to ramp up supply chain to meet the demand. But the uniqueness of the product, one, is allowing us to open up new accounts in Europe and the U.S. to sell S-ICD, which we do sell at a premium and does enable some pull-through as well. So we think that, combined with a broader portfolio, that we touched on in the discussion points with our investments in EP and Rhythmia as well are also assisting with that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Jeff, just a couple of quick questions here on 2013. I guess, first off, you mentioned the Vessix and Rhythmia and Mike did as well in his prepared remarks. Can you just give us a sense of what contribution you could expect in '13 from inorganic drivers, specifically Vessix and Rhythmia and others?","Jeffrey D. Capello","So David, we're probably not going to get into as much depth as you'd like right now on those contributions. At our Investor Day, on the 12th of February, we're going to get into a little more detail in terms of what we expect the programs to generate. And I guess what I can help you with is we said all along that we've got 3 or 4 programs we expect to contribute to earnings in '13 and that'll be accelerated in '14 with another 3 to 4 programs, and we'll take you through that in more detail at the Investor Day.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, very helpful. And then just one more quick one on margins. The restructuring announcement and clearly your buyback sentiments are very positive and a little higher than what we would have expected for '13. But it still looks like based on your guidance, Jeff, operating margins are expected to be down year-on-year. And I guess the biggest disconnect there, if that's correct, is gross margin. Maybe help us understand what are some maybe the key headwinds in gross margin that we're sort of not appreciating because we expected obviously this year to be a little stronger given some of those headwinds in '12 began to fade?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes, so if you look at gross margins, we exited 2012 with gross margin of 67.8%. And as you look forward, we continue to expect that price will be a headwind and I think we can do better on price and we've got a number of things that we're working on, on the pricing side. However, as a percentage basis, we think our standard cost improvement can largely offset the margin erosion on price. So that's good and we're stepping up more, and the manufacturing team's doing a great job on that front. So that pretty much neutralizes those 2 impacts from a margin perspective. And then we've got some benefits coming through for the last segment of the PROMUS Element transition. The 2 factors that weigh a little bit on gross margins, one is the impact of acquisitions. Some of these acquisitions are a little smaller in terms of revenue and as we ramp them up, they're below our average gross margins, so that has an impact. And the second impact is we did do, for consistency purposes, some reclasses between R&D and gross margins for next year, which moves some costs out of R&D up into gross margins to be consistent across all the businesses. The combination of the acquisitions and the movement of R&D is worth about 100 basis points on gross margins. So margins would be up more. I would tell you, though, that we expect to end the year at a higher rate gross margin-wise. So our margins will start off a little bit slower because of some of these smaller acquisitions and they'll end at a higher rate.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Wise from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. First, on WATCHMAN, pretty extraordinary performance. We were at Boston Nature [ph] recently, and frankly, we were really impressed and surprised and excited by the physician reactions. It seems like they're very excited. Can you talk to us about when is the data coming out? What are we looking for? Do you expect another panel? And maybe talk about the launch and the uptick, just the -- and market potential, just all that background with WATCHMAN.","Michael F. Mahoney","Yes, this Mike. I'll make a couple of comments, then we turn it over to Ken Stein who's on the phone as well. We're very encouraged about the size of the market as you indicate. We think it's about -- it could grow to a $500 million to $750 million market. We're seeing nice uptick in Europe as we continue to train more physicians and drive growth there. Relating to the clinical data, the PREVAIL enrollment was completed, say, early third quarter of 2012. And we're currently analyzing the data and we'll be looking to discuss with the FDA the submission strategy in the near future here. So we'll be able to provide a very detailed update on WATCHMAN at the upcoming Investor Day.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Two last quick ones. Can you talk about what it would take to get to the upper end of your 2013 sales guidance. Is it market, is it product timing, launches, execution? And maybe on the asthmatic front you've got your CPT I code. Can you characterize at all the 2013 outlook there and the uptick potential?","Michael F. Mahoney","A lot of components to that one, Rick, but I'll say a couple of things. One on the end markets. We see the end markets very consistent and stable versus 2012. So across BSC portfolio, we think of the end markets as kind of 0% range. With our -- if you want to classify, our DES and CRM markets, in the globally, the negative 3% to 5% range. In our other businesses, market's about 3%. So we think neutralize for all that, our markets are essentially flat. So when you look at potential for the future, we see ourselves continue to grow very effectively in our MedSurg businesses and our PI where we'll grow faster than market. And our second focus area is to significantly improve our execution in IC and CRM. So on a combined basis, those businesses grew last year, call it, negative 9%. And so, we're going to put a lot of focus on that and improve those results. So you'll see the 45% of our business, MedSurg and PI, continue to grow faster than market and a lot of execution to improve our results and performance for 2012. And then as you mentioned, on top of our core business, we'll layer on the impact of Alair, WATCHMAN, the S-ICD, as well as Vessix new adjacencies. And the results of that, combined with our focus on BRIC, provide us upside. I hope that's helpful for you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a couple of clarifications first. Jeff, you had mentioned difference in selling days in the first quarter. Were they the same in the fourth quarter year-over-year?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, and then you were talking about gross margins, Jeff, in 2013. And one component that I thought was left out was the transition service agreements. My math had the expiration of those TSAs adding them up 60 basis points to the gross margin and that really kind of kicking in the second half the year. Did that change?","Jeffrey D. Capello","No, no. There is a benefit associated with the Neurovascular transition, and it's not far off. There's some other various factors that kind of add up that neutralized that, so I kind of gave you a more condensed version of the lot, I guess.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, and then can you talk about sustainability of the tax rate? Obviously the tax rate is coming in below what people were modeling in for 2013. And you had the lowest tax rate in the sector. Can you talk us a little bit about that over the next few years, in particular as you go out to the period in which those Guidant transfers, intercompany transfers expire and then roll off and then what will your tax profile look like once that occurs?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes. So tax rate was lower this year than we anticipated due to kind of geographic mix of earnings. I explained that in the prepared comments. As we look forward, as we continue to migrate more manufacturing offshore, that pulls down our tax rate. And so some of the activities we had commenced as part of the Plant Network Optimization program and some other things we'd done in our international locations were putting downward pressure on the rate, so kind of the 13% to 15%. I think I said last quarter kind of 16-percent-ish was what we thought for this year. We're now a little bit lower than that. We continue to kind of migrate more things offshore. That looks fairly sustainable as far as we see today. I think everyone knows we had this dispute with the IRS relative to the Guidant transfer pricing and we do reserve for that in our rates. That's built into the rate on a normal basis. And so our 13% to 15% reflects that. And we think we're appropriately reserved and we're appropriately positioned. We'll have to see how that plays out. And as a reminder, that's probably a couple of years out, 2 to 3 years out in terms in terms of full resolution.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then what I was asking, Jeff, was just when your intercompany debt transfers, when you basically played all those out -- going back to the Guidant acquisition, what will your tax rate look like once that's done, which I think is 14%, 15%?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes, you're referring to now the repatriation of cash, not the tax rate.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes.","Jeffrey D. Capello","Okay, sorry, misunderstood. So we have at least a couple of years left with those intercompany notes to kind of bring cash back assuming we don't do something different from a tax structure perspective, which is always possible. So it's probably a couple of years. And thereafter, we'll be in a position similar to other companies that are kind of building more cash outside the U.S. and less cash within the U.S. One of the things, though, that's helpful for that is as we continue to migrate more activity offshore, which we're doing as part of this restructuring, that rebalances our expense base and our cash flow mix. So we're naturally readjusting where we generate and consume cash by moving more activities outside the U.S. So that helps as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell from Credit Suisse.","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Jeff, clearly you're reinvesting next year, but you've kind of set the table with savings. And just looking at your operating cash margins around 19% in 2012, could you just give us a flavor of where that margin might go kind of in the midterm?","Jeffrey D. Capello","So we're going to -- as we did a couple of years ago, we're going to step the investment community, investors through kind of our margin expansion opportunity at the upcoming Investor Day in February. But we're confident we can -- we continue to improve our operating margins. As you look at kind of the $650 million to $750 million of short-term cost-saving opportunities and just kind of tick down kind of what's left, as you look at the PROMUS Element transition, there's a piece of that, that's left for '13. The value improvement programs we had said historically 5% cost savings consistently every year, we're going to be able to do better than that. We've got a line of sight for increased ability to kind of take out costs over the next 5 years, so that'll continue to expand gross margins and offset price. Our project transformation on the R&D side we think will continue to offer opportunities. We're done, our Plant Network Optimization programs, we still have 12 plants in the network, so we'll continue to look at whether that makes sense. And then we've got the expanded restructuring program we talked about today that'll throw off more savings in '13 and '14. So those, we've got pieces left of the $650 million to $750 million and on top of that you've got a pretty high level of spend associated with these new programs, which we expect to grow out of as the revenue comes. And as the programs finished their development cycles, so that'll be helpful. We think we can do better on price. We're going to talk a lot about continuous improvement at the Investor Day in terms of getting our costs down even further. So there's certainly no shortage of opportunities to drive our cost base down. And as the revenue comes, it'll be on a lower base of costs, which will naturally help with the margin expansion.","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, and I guess my follow-up is you guys have repeatedly said that you're doing reasonably well in the de novo part of the ICD business and that your replacements or headwind and certainly the data on FactSet confirms that. Do you feel that, first of all, when is that replacement headwind going to begin to abate? And are the new products, including the S-ICD, enough to stabilize share and actually move forward on a share basis?","Michael F. Mahoney","Yes, it's Mike, here. So you nailed it. We continue to see some improved sequential share gain in de novo of implants, both in the ICDs and also core pacer. And the headwind on the replacement back from the -- the Guidant recall back in 2005, we believe that, that headwind will begin to soften up more the second half of 2013. So we think the replacement performance will improve in the second half of 2013. That's what -- in the prepared comments, we discussed stabilizing our share in CRM in the first half and improving our share position in the second half to be based on the softening of the replacement headwind, continued impact of S-ICD and also the continued impact of the new pacer and ICD new launches we had in 2012.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Dodds from Citigroup.","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","On Neuromodulation, that business saw a nice uptick. How much of that do you think was due to a competitor's restructuring the business versus the new products cycle you're just under way with? And then also, what's your expectation for DBS in Europe? Is that going to do much at all, do you think, in 2013?","Michael F. Mahoney","Matt, difficult to determine how much of it was our execution or maybe disruption with some competitors, so tough for us to gauge that. I guess, just the good news, as you saw the results for the fourth quarter are very strong. We had very early launch of Spectra in Europe and we see a full launch of Spectra in the U.S., which we think will be very innovative, the next breakthrough for paying patients. And you'll see the full launch of that -- the results of that in the second half of 2013. So we're very bullish on our guidance for Neuromodulation for 2013. And DBS will just initiate our clinical trial in the U.S. in 2013. And got to get that information. I'm sure we completed enrollment in Europe at this point, so we've completed enrollment in Europe and so we'll see some improvements, obviously, to our DBS sales in Europe and we're launching our clinical trial in the U.S.","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then, Jeff, just a quick one for you. I just want to make sure I had this right. For the model in '13, share repurchase, 1\/2 the operating cash flow, that's -- it was in the guidance?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes, it'll be 1\/2 the available cash flow. So we have, if you look at kind of our legacy acquisitions, we have approximately a couple of hundred million dollars of earn-out payments that we expect to have to make here in 2013. So if you look at the $1.2 billion of adjusted free cash flow, after we make those payments, approximately 1\/2 of that cash we'd look to kind of use for share repurchases subject to the business development environment, the price of the stock and regulatory issues.","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, but that's what you have in the guidance?","Jeffrey D. Capello","More or less, yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor from Barclays.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just wanted to ask about the stent performance sequentially better and get your view on expectations for SYNERGY and pricing in stents in the coming year. You should be lapping a bit of a Medtronic headwind, so I'm just curious to get your thoughts there.","Michael F. Mahoney","Yes, so in the DES market, similar to CRM, we believe we will stabilize our share position. Clearly stabilize that in the first half and we'll drive share gains in the second half of 2013. We do anniversary the Medtronic launch in second quarter. And similar to the prepared remarks, we believe we'll have more of a challenging first quarter based on less days selling and also very difficult competitive comps in first quarter. And we'll lap the Medtronic launch in the second quarter. And the combination of new launches with SYNERGY, trialing increasing and our long lengths will drive share gains in the second half.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And you talked about your share repurchase plans for the year and stock being undervalued. I'm just curious as the stock continues to perform here, when do you start to think about potentially initiating a dividend or changing that kind of a program?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Matt, I think we've been -- this is Jeff, I think we've been fairly consistent with that. That we think from an investor perspective and shareholder value perspective, there's a lot bigger return to driving the growth rate of the company into the low single digits and up north of that versus kind of putting in a dividend program. So we're very focused on getting back to growth the second half of this year in '13 and then moving that growth rate up. I think once we do that and accomplish that, then we can really look at that capital allocation whether we make a dividend more of priority, but it's not -- for the next short while, it's not as much of a priority as is bringing in new technology to drive the growth rate of the company up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So Jeff, just to clarify, your SG&A guidance for 2013, excluding the med tech tax, is roughly in the 34% to 35% range, is that right?","Jeffrey D. Capello","That's correct.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And that's roughly the same as what you did in 2012. And just kind of going back to some of your comments in the Q3 call where you were talking about SG&A and hopefully seeing a good-sized benefit from some of your ongoing programs in 2013, I'm just wondering kind of what's changed between Q3 and Q4 as it relates to SG&A expense and the outlook for some real fall-through as a result of some of the programs you have going on?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes, it's a fair question, Bob. And I think as we considered kind of the best potential return from a shareholder perspective, we are getting more than what we anticipated relative to the cost savings. So I think we're doing really well in the cost savings. I think what we're finding is we found a great asset in Vessix, we found a great asset in Rhythmia, both that can be significant revenue growth drivers for us in the next couple of years. So we put more of an onus on investing for growth in the short term versus letting an incremental amount drop through on the SG&A side. So there's a little bit more of a lean towards investing for growth given the very attractive assets and the great position that leaves us in from a growth perspective.","Michael F. Mahoney","Yes, I'll just add on to that. In the emerging markets, we're seeing very good growth in 2012 and we plan for that to continue to accelerate in '13. And so we're adding quite a significant amount of commercial capabilities in BRIC and other emerging markets.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So it's incremental investments in SG&A. And then, I just wanted to follow-up, just quickly on S-ICD. I know it's early in the year, but can you give us a sense as to what sort of contribution you expect from that business line in 2013? Is that roughly $40 million to $50 million or is it less than that?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Bob, as David Lewis had asked the same question about the broader contributions, we're going to hold those questions to the Investor Day in the 12th then we're going to walk you through by growth driver what we think it can contribute to '13 and thereafter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just wanted to just make sure I heard it correctly. On the tax examination with the Guidant, I guess, back tax years, did you say that would be another 2 to 3 years that you expect that to be finalized? And is the viability still in that $1.2 billion range?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes, yes. Both are correct. We expect that'll take at least a couple of years to play out through Tax Court and we currently have reserves of about $1 billion in the balance sheet.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, and then the commentary I guess that you made with respect to the S-ICD talking about, I believe, is the MADIT trial where you're talking about how there was a benefit of a more simplified ICD. What do you guys see as the risk moving forward, just overall for the CRM market, to the extent that physicians look at that and not only move to an S-ICD, but more to a basic single-chamber defibrillator. Could that be something that puts pressure on the ICD market incrementally in 2013?","Michael F. Mahoney","I think we'll have Ken Stein provide some color on that question.","Ken Stein","Yes, thanks, Kristen. I think it's a good question. I think the first thing to recognize, so MADIT-RIT was a dual-chamber ICD study and I think the lessons from it bear less on the issue of single versus dual chamber and more on the issue of what's the importance of giving rapid therapy versus a delay to giving therapy, what's the importance of a lot of sophisticated antitachycardia pacing. And so I think I agree with the commentary Mike provided, which is MADIT-RIT, although it's a transvenous ICD trial, supports the design features of the S-ICD. I don't think it says anything at all within transvenous ICDs about single versus dual.","Michael Campbell","We're running a little past the hour, so we have time for 2 more questions.","Operator","Okay, your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Jeff or Mike, could you talk a little bit about the drug-eluting stent performance in the quarter. Outside the U.S., it was very strong. Where was the strength? Was it Japan, Europe, emerging markets? And given that I was a little bit surprised with the guidance for the first quarter was a little bit weaker, the growth rate, than what you saw in Q4 and I think resolute anniversaries, I think, in January 2013.","Michael F. Mahoney","Yes, in terms of our o-U.S. performance in DES, you hit the major regions, starting -- start with Japan first, where we had very strong fourth quarter and a second half in share gains in Japan. So good strength there in the fourth quarter. Similarly, remaining pieces of Asia Pac. You saw the growth numbers for BRIC. We don't break out China and India specifically, but they're big contributors to that, plus 35% and those markets are heavy DES revenue drivers for us. Europe had some improvement in performance as well in the fourth quarter. In terms of first quarter guidance, we mentioned the impact on days and also we see a larger impact on that days challenge in Japan, which is part of the drivers of the first quarter guidance. We also have a difficult comparable in first quarter 2012 as well. So we're -- similar to the comments, we're optimistic we're going to stabilize share performance in first half and gain share for the full year, just that you see the timing of the quarters consistent what Jeff outlined.","Jeffrey D. Capello","And Larry, just to provide some clarification, our U.S. DES share was 45% in the fourth quarter in 2011, then it went to 47% in the first quarter of '12. So when Mike says comparisons, actually the first quarter of '13 versus first quarter '12 was a more difficult comp than the fourth quarter of '12 versus the fourth quarter of '11.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I got it, that's helpful. Jeff, how many extra days are there -- or less days, I'm sorry, in Q1 2013, if you could just give us those numbers. And just lastly, on asthmatics, at the investor day you guys did last year, if you look at the slides, it was about -- your expectation was about $20 million in 2012 and it was clearly $40 million to $50 million in 2013. Could you just give us a little bit of an update if those goals are on track?","Jeffrey D. Capello","So in terms of the numbers of days, it's approximately -- it rounds to kind of 2 days, so it's not insignificant relative to the first quarter of '13 versus the first quarter of '12. And then the second part of your question, Larry, you were -- I didn't quite follow kind of what you were referring to.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So asthmatics, when you did the Analyst Meeting in 2012, you did give some sales expectations and you had about, if I look at the -- when I looked at the slides, about $20 million was the expectation in 2012 and $40 million to $50 million in 2013. And I was just wondering if you were on track to meet those goals?","Jeffrey D. Capello","So as I responded to David Lewis and Bob Hopkins, we're going to go through each of the major growth drivers and kind of tell you kind of what we did in revenue in '12 and our expectation for '13, so we're going to reserve those questions and that discussion for the Investor Day.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jose Haresco from JMP Securities.","Jose T. Haresco - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Just wrapping up, could you first just refresh us on the what the expectation is for the overall market growth for both CRM and DES? And then on S-ICD, could you just give us an update on how we should think about the inventory build-out and the training schedule for the rest of the CRM team?","Jeffrey D. Capello","So we've got -- this is Jeff, we've got the DES market pegged to be kind of low, to be down low single digits to mid-single digit next year and very similar for the CRM market, both market to be slightly unchanged from this year. The CRM market will be a little bit better because we have now the lapsing of kind of the difficult comps from '11. And then relative to the S-ICD, I'm going to hold that response. We're going to have a separate section on the whole CRM business and our President will talk about kind of the S-ICD plan and that would be a probably a more appropriate time to kind of get into any more details on the S-ICD.","Michael Campbell","With that, we will conclude the call.

Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Hank Kucheman, Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Capello, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q4 and full-year 2011 results, which included key financials and reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in the release. We posted a copy of that press release, as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in today's conference call to the comparable GAAP measures and other supporting schedules to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financial Information.","Hank will begin this morning's prepared remarks with an update on our business progress and his perspectives on the quarter. Jeff will then review our Q4 and full-year 2011 financial results and business performance, as well as Q1 and full-year 2012 guidance. We'll then open the call up to questions.","During today's Q&A session, Hank and Jeff will be joined by our President, Mike Mahoney, as well as our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Dawkins and Dr. Stein.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal security laws which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, project, believe, plan, estimate, intend and similar words. These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding our market share; markets for our products; new product approvals; launches and performance; clinical trials; our cost reduction and growth initiatives; our investments in emerging markets; the timing and volume of share repurchases; our free cash flow and uses thereof; our future financial performance, including sales, margins and earnings guidance for the first quarter and full-year 2012; and our future tax rates, R&D spending and other expenses.

These statements speak only as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them.","At this point, I'll turn it over to Hank for his comments. Hank?","William H. Kucheman","Thanks, Sean. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before I get started, I want to let you know that starting today, we are implementing a revised approach to our earnings calls, which is intended to reduce call duration, as well as streamline and focus the information we provide. And we look forward to your feedback on this revised format.","Now let me move on and show my perspectives on the fourth quarter and the progress we are making on our key initiatives to drive revenue growth and increase EPS, including a glimpse forward into 2012.","I'll start with a couple of key points regarding fourth quarter results and then move on to some of the more important product introductions we expect to benefit from in 2012 and beyond.","Fourth quarter revenue of $1.848 billion was down 8% on a reported basis and down 5% in constant currency and excluding the Neurovascular divestiture. This decrease was primarily the result of continued weakness in some of our end markets, particularly CRM in Europe, as well as some other factors Jeff will address in his comments. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.13 in the quarter, which was in line with consensus and within our guidance range of $0.13 to $0.16, despite the fact that the negative EPS impact of inventory charges relating to the earlier-than-expected U.S. launch of PROMUS Element Plus were not included in that guidance. Jeff will detail our financial results in guidance, as well as several positive developments which should help set the stage for BSE in 2012.","As you know, we're a global leader in a diverse $30 billion marketplace. Some of those markets are growing, others are not, but we continue to believe that the markets we're in are some good ones, with long-term growth prospects supported by demographic and disease trends, underutilization, underpenetration and the growing middle class in emerging markets. Our potential for future success starts with new products, so let me share with you why I'm excited about our pipeline.","In CRV alone, we expect to launch 24 new products in 2012. Our U.S. PROMUS Element Plus Stent launch is now fully underway and meeting our high expectations, and we anticipate approval of PROMUS Element in Japan ahead of our previously announced time line of mid-'12. Once we have this approval, our platinum chromium element drug-eluting stent series will be approved in all major markets worldwide, and we should be well on our way to realize in the approximate $200 million profit opportunity that we expect to come with the conversion from PROMUS to PROMUS Element in the U.S. and Japan.","In addition, we just received approval for PROMUS Element Plus in Canada much earlier than expected and have also begun a rollout of this new delivery system in Europe. Although the worldwide DES market was relatively flat, it is still a large and profitable market, any market where we expect to continue our share momentum on the strength of the Element platform.","In CRM, we've historically focused on the higher end of the market, with single product offerings which often limited our ability to compete effectively in all segments. We expect to change that with our new tiered defib and pacer platforms. In defib, we began the U.S. launch of our INCEPTA, ENERGEN and PUNCTUA ICDs and CRT-Ds in earnest this quarter. These new devices maintain our advantage in size and shape, which is often a critical factor for patients. They also offer improved programming options. Our LHFM capability, 4-SITE, DF4 universal connector system built off our highly dependable RELIANCE lead platform and our market-leading battery longevity warranties of up to 10 years, are key platform differentiators. To date, we're very pleased with the rollout based on the positive feedback received from customers. ","Turning to the pacing side, we expect to launch our INGENIO family of pacemakers in CRTPs in Europe and the U.S. in the first half of the year. Similar to our new tachy devices, INGENIO incorporates clinically relevant features that offer tangible benefits to patients. For example, INGENIO includes a feature called right rate, which builds on our unique capabilities around the treatment of chronotropic incompetence. The INGENIO platform will also be RF-enabled, support remote patient monitoring, have advanced heart failure diagnostics and be compatible with MRI systems, the last of which is planned for Europe in the middle of this year. We believe that our new tachy and Brady platforms will be a one-two punch for our sales teams, who are very excited at the prospect of beginning to offer these new devices and targeting market share gains in 2012.","In PI, we've increased our investment in new products over the past several years. We believe this strategy is starting to pay off, and we expect the combination of new products and market dynamics to continue to drive good growth. We now offer best-in-class balloons across all size platforms with our Coyote, Mustang and Charger devices, which has enabled us to regain our #1 PTA balloon position in the U.S. We also began a limited market release of our recently acquired TruePath crossing device in the U.S. and Europe and offer reentry catheter to treat chronic total occlusions in international markets. We expect to move to a full launch for TruePath and offer them in approved markets this year. ","In addition, following very positive results from the ORION trial in January, we expect to receive FDA approval of the Epic Self-Expanding Stent this year. Epic will allow us to offer a complete line of advanced iliac solutions in the U.S. We also anticipate launching our INNOVA Self-Expanding Stent internationally in 2012.","In our EP business, we continue to leverage our expertise in catheter and ablation technology as we execute our global AFib strategy and our 6 internally approved AFib-focused products. Within EP this quarter, we expect FDA approval for the Z\u00baFLEX-270 steerable sheath, which is designed to facilitate the introduction and placement of catheters within the heart. This device can provide more than 270 degrees of tip deflection, allowing access to difficult-to-reach areas of the heart.","In Endo, we have an established track record of bringing innovative new technologies to market which drive above market sales growth. Consistent with that history, we are pleased to receive clearance from the FDA in Q4 to market the WallFlex Biliary Stent System for malignant strictures. We expect to begin full launch of this product, as well as our Expect 19 Flex Ultrasound Aspiration Needle, which is used for tissue acquisition to diagnose GI malignancies this quarter.","In Urology and Women's Health, we're looking forward to the expected 2012 global launch of our BackStop Gel designed to prevent stone migration during stone management procedures. Despite what we expect to be a temporary headwind in Women's Health, we are focused on creating new and differentiated technologies such as our Genesys HTA System to drive continued growth in this business.","In Neuromod, we believe we are the technology leader with Smoothwave. In our constant cadence of innovation, additions to our product set has helped to drive above market growth over the past several years. We recently launched the Infinion Lead, the industry's first and only 16-contact percutaneous lead, and physician reaction has been enthusiastic. This new lead is right in line with our strategy to introduce meaningful innovations that optimize the treatment of chronic pain.","So as you can see, our pipeline is real. Bottom line, our goal with these launches is to continue to further strengthen our current worldwide market positions which, in my view, is growing in accordance in an era where economic buyers have increasing influence and purchasers are considering fewer vendors, not more.","Let's now shift to emerging markets, which is one of our critical elements of our business strategy. This initiative provides us with significant potential to expand and accelerate profitable growth, while at the same time improving the scope and quality of global patient care. We continue to make excellent progress in building our infrastructure and driving growth in these key markets. Allow me to provide a few examples. In the fourth quarter, combined sales in China and India increased by more than 70% over the prior year. We also continued investments in our sales force, clinical and marketing teams, distributor networks and infrastructure, including progress under our announced $150 million investment to build a manufacturing training facility in China. In China, we recently initiated several important product launches, including PROMUS Element in our ALTRUA pacemakers.","In India, we launched the WallFlex Stent Dreamwire Guidewire. We also continued patient enrollment in the TUXEDO trial to assess the TAXUS Element or ION Stent in diabetic patients. We now have a total approaching 500 patients at almost 40 sites initiated. Earlier this week, we announced the creation of an Asia-Pac regional organization to help drive growth by leveraging best practices in the region, assessing a strong pool of local talent and collaborating with local healthcare professionals and regulatory agencies. We appointed Supratim Bose, an industry veteran with extensive experience in the region to lead this organization.","We're also doing well in other emerging markets where we have more of a established presence. One example is Brazil, where we began introducing PROMUS Element in late 2010. Since then, we rapidly converted our PROMUS share to PROMUS Element and increased our overall DES share by an estimated 800 basis points. By the end of 2012 -- I'm sorry, 2011, we had grown our share to over 60%, and we're optimistic we can push it even higher. This spells growth.","Our strategy in emerging markets is to offer innovative, leading technologies, backed by a global respected brand. One example is in DES where we currently have single-digit shares in China and India, which together represent a nearly $700 million market growing at around 20%. We believe that we can increase these shares share significantly and that this will be an important contributor to our growth going forward.","In summary, we are making real progress in generating significant year-over-year growth and are targeting emerging markets. We feel we have the right structure, the right people and a clear path supported by products and investment that will allow emerging markets to be an important growth driver for us in 2012 and beyond.","Now let's shift briefly to the cost side. Another key element of our plan is to optimize the company and execute on significant cost reduction opportunities related to our organization, systems and infrastructure. We have previously outlined $650 million to $750 million in operating profit improvement opportunities we expect to realize over the next several years. Jeff will cover some of these later, but I want to reinforce here that efforts to realize these opportunities are well underway. We are making excellent progress in all areas, and we expect to begin to see tangible benefits from several of these initiatives, including gross margin benefits tied to our PROMUS Element launch in the U.S. and expect to launch in Japan our plant network optimization program, as well as SG&A savings from our restructuring program as we move into 2012 and into 2013. The bottom line here is that we're delivering on our commitment to improve efficiency and effectiveness across the organization. ","Lastly, I'd like to update you on several of the acquisitions that we have made under our priority growth initiatives where we continue to make good progress towards achieving meaningful revenue contribution to overall top line, starting in 2013. We are pleased with the progress we're achieving during our first full year commercializing the Alair Bronchial Thermoplasty System, our proprietary device for the management of severe asthma. Alair is now available in 92 sites across 7 countries, including the U.K., where nice recently issued positive guidance supporting BT as a safe and effective treatment option for severe asthma sufferers. We expect to be more than double the number of countries and sites offering this technology in 2012 and believe that potential market for this unique device could exceed $1 billion.","During Q4, we're also pleased to learn that CMS acknowledged that substantial improvement associated with the use of the Alair System for the management of severe asthma. As a result, effective January 1, '12, the Alair catheter is eligible for Medicare reimbursement through a separate pass-through payment when the procedure is performed in an outpatient hospital setting. This is in addition to unique category 3 CPT codes that are now available for the procedure. The combined Medicare payments for the catheter and procedures should provide a strong benchmark for private insurers to support establishing reimbursement for BT.","In structural heart, our WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure Device is now launched in more than 20 countries in Europe, Asia Pac and Latin America. Again, we plan to double this number by the end of 2012. In the U.S., we plan to complete the enrollment of PREVAIL trial and submit our PMA by the end of the year. This would set us up for expected FDA approval and launch in 2013. Similar to Alair, this is a product that plays in the market with a very large potential, and we expect both of these innovative products to begin to positively impact revenue growth in a noticeable way in 2013.","Our other foray into structural heart is the Lotus Valve. Now while this product is a little further out, we believe it provides us with an opportunity to become a major player in what most expect to be a multibillion-dollar market for percutaneous aortic valves. Development of the Lotus Valve is based on extensive clinical feedback, and we expect it to bring true differentiation to the market that resonates with physicians and patients. We plan to begin the reprise to our CE Mark trial for Lotus in the second half of this year with European approval and launch expected in the second half of 2013.","Finally, I'll touch on 3 internal development products -- projects that we're extremely excited about. We believe that these areas represent a next wave of revenue contribution commencing in 2014. The first is our fourth generation Synergy DES stent which is built on our platinum chromium element stent platform and incorporates a thin bioabsorbable polymer coating on the outside edge of the stent. At the TCT conference in November, we announced impressive clinical and angiographic results supporting the safety and effectiveness of Synergy. CE Mark approval is expected as early as late 2012, with full EU launch anticipated in 2013. We expect that the U.S. IDE trial called EVOLVE 2 will commence as early as mid-2012.","As a part of the randomized trial, we will also formally investigate short and dual antiplatelet therapy or DAP. And as you know, the cost of DAP is significant and we believe the Synergy stent may be ideally suited to a shorter DAP treatment protocol, potentially offering both patient benefit and healthcare system cost savings. A second internal program is exploring multiple approaches to device-based treatment of hypertension. These approaches leverage our core competencies in catheters, RF ablation and stimulation technology in an effort to address a market expected to reach $3 billion within the decade. The first human use of one of our renal denervation devices is planned for this year. We anticipate CE Mark approval and commercialization in Europe next year, with the U.S. trial expected to begin in 2014.","Another market with $1 billion plus potential that we are pursuing is deep brain stimulation or DBS, which is also characterized by a refractory patient population with a highly unmet need. The initial indication we're targeting with our unique neurostimulation technology is Parkinson's disease. We're currently enrolling patients in the VANTAGE trial in Europe to study this indication and expect to complete the trial in 2013. Once approved, we expect to have the only available DBS system that incorporates multiple, independent, current control designed to enable greater customization of the therapy.","I've just laid out 6 high potential opportunities involving technologies that we have either acquired or developing internally that we believe will provide us with competitive entrees in the major growth markets. They are all minimally evasive device-based procedures intended to address unmet clinical needs and help reduce overall healthcare system cost. Characteristics, we believe, that are critical in our marketplace today, as well as in the future.","Finally, we continue to generate strong cash flow in the fourth quarter and for the full year. During the second half of 2011, we repurchased close to 500 million of our stock or roughly 5% of the company under an estimated $1.25 billion in stock repurchase programs announced in July. We expect to continue to generate good cash flow, which should allow us to continue to both repurchase shares and acquire new technologies to increase our growth opportunities. We like the bets we've placed so far, and we continue to expect to be able to add new technologies through our business development initiatives. ","In closing, we continue to show measurable progress in the execution of our business strategy to achieve our goal of double-digit EPS growth. We have built our pipeline, and we are building commercial capabilities in emerging markets. We are achieving key milestones relating to our cost reduction opportunities and our Priority Growth Initiatives, and we have improved our financial situation so that we now have added flexibility to balance investments in new markets and growth technologies, along with returned capital to shareholders.","That's it for my comments. Let me now turn the call over to Jeff for a review of our results in 2012 guidance. Jeff?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Thanks, Hank. Let me begin by providing some overall perspective on the quarter. Despite global economic and end market conditions that continue to be very challenging, we generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.13, within our guidance range of $0.13 to $0.16 and in line with Street consensus, driven by continued strong attention to cost control. Once again, we also generated strong operating cash flow which allowed us to repurchase another 52 million shares in the quarter.","Let me now move to the detailed review of the quarter to discuss the operating results and highlight the progress being made. Consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter was $1,848,000,000 and represents a decrease of 8% on a reported basis and a decrease of 5% in constant currency compared to the fourth quarter last year, excluding the negative impact of the Neurovascular divestiture, which negatively impacted revenue by 300 basis points. The actual tailwind from foreign exchange was $9 million, less than the $18 million assumed in our fourth quarter guidance range. At this point, I'll move on to address our sales results and drivers for our businesses. ","Worldwide DES revenue came in at $356 million, which included an $8 million negative impact from the sales returns reserve relating to the early U.S. approval of PROMUS Element Plus. Excluding the impact of the sales returns reserve, this represents a constant currency decrease of 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Our worldwide DES revenue included $101 million for TAXUS and TAXUS Element, $136 million for PROMUS and $119 million for PROMUS Element.","We once again held clear worldwide DES market share leadership during the fourth quarter, with an estimated global share of 34%, which we estimate to be a full 400 basis points higher than our nearest competitor. These figures exclude the negative impact of the PROMUS Element Plus reserve in the U.S. With the continued strong customer adoption of our element platform, now including PROMUS Element Plus in the U.S., the expected launch of PROMUS Element in Japan and building momentum in India and China, we are focused on growing our worldwide market share leadership going forward.","U.S. DES revenue was $168 million, including the $8 million negative impact of the PROMUS sales returns reserve. Excluding the impact of this reserve, U.S. DES sales declined 7% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The revenue shortfall compared to our Q4 guidance was primarily driven by some continued softness in PCI volumes.","The launch of PROMUS Element Plus has been extremely well received in the U.S. marketplace. In particular, physicians have remarked on the product's outstanding deliverability, conformability and the improved visibility of the platinum chromium alloy. Our PROMUS Element sales began exceeding our PROMUS sales in the U.S. a few weeks ago, and we expect full conversion and a return to 100% self-manufactured DES margins in the U.S. this year. ","U.S. DES revenue in the quarter included $69 million TAXUS and TAXUS Element, $89 million of PROMUS and $10 million of PROMUS Element Plus. Excluding the impact of the PROMUS sales returns reserve, we estimated that our U.S. DES share was 47%, which was an increase of 100 basis points compared to Q4 last year, off of the strong ION and early PROMUS Element Plus launches. We continued to maintain drug-eluting stent market share leadership in a competitive U.S. market with an estimated 800 basis points more market share than our nearest competitor.","During Q4, we experienced an improvement in year-over-year ASP erosion to down mid single digits compared to the high single digits we've seen in recent quarters. Although we believe it's a little too early to tell whether this will continue, we are encouraged by this improvement and expect to leverage the unique value proposition that the differentiating features of the PROMUS Element now allows us to bring to the market.","International DES sales of $188 million represented a decrease of 1% in constant currency compared to Q4 last year, due largely to continued pricing pressures. Q4 revenue included $32 million in TAXUS and TAXUS Element, $47 million in PROMUS and $109 million in PROMUS Element sales. The rollout of our element platform continues to do very well internationally, and we are starting to see some contribution from the launch of our element DES platform in emerging markets, primarily India and Brazil. We expect this to accelerate in 2012 as we anticipate gaining additional important pricing approvals in India and expanding the recent launch of PROMUS Element in China.","Worldwide CRM revenue was $482 million in the fourth quarter, representing a constant currency decrease of 15% compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. We estimate that our worldwide CRM share was down slightly on a sequential basis at just over 18%. In the U.S., CRM revenue of $278 million represented a 20% decrease from the prior year quarter. Worldwide defib sales were $348 million in Q4, which was down 18% in constant currency from Q4 2010. In the U.S., defib sales were $214 million. This was down 21% compared to Q4 last year due primarily to the continued year-over-year market declines, as well as replacement headwinds in our business.","Given the earlier-than-expected approval of our new line of ICDs and CRT-Ds, we purposely managed to lower book sales in the fourth quarter to minimize customer inventory of COGNIS and TELIGEN as we prepare to aggressively roll out the new products in Q1. The U.S. defib market appears to be showing some signs of stabilization. However, despite these encouraging signs, a number of factors are still at play and visibility remains very limited. As a result, we expect it will take another quarter or 2 to confirm whether the market has truly bottomed out. We believe that our de novo share in the U.S. has remained stable over the last several quarters and are optimistic that our share outlook will improve further as we continue the launch of PUNCTUA, ENERGEN and INCEPTA in the U.S. ","International CRM sales of $204 million were down 7% in constant currency compared to the prior year quarter despite a 3% constant currency increase in international pacer revenue off of continued strong double-digit growth in Japan and intercontinental. International defib sales of $134 million represented a 12% decrease in constant currency from Q4 last year. While international defib was below our expectation from the quarter, we are launching new products in many countries outside the U.S. and expect improved performance as we move through the year.","Our worldwide Peripheral Interventions business continued on its recent growth trajectory and was up 6% in constant currency in Q4, with 1% growth in the U.S. and 10% constant currency growth internationally. We continue to make excellent progress driven by a rejuvenated pipeline as all 3 PI franchises grew sales in the quarter on the strength of multiple products, including the Epic self-expanding stent, the Carotid WALLSTENT in Japan and our Mustang and Coyote PTA balloon and dilatation catheters. In addition to these new products, we have a half-dozen more in 2012 we expect to support continued growth in this business.","Worldwide non-stent Interventional Cardiology was down 8% in constant currency. Consistent with recent periods, this decline was largely attributable to some procedural softness, share declines in IVUS and continued price erosion in PTCA balloons. As we progressed through 2012, we expect to see some improvement in vascular access, balloons and IVUS results due to planned new product launches.","Worldwide Electrophysiology was flat in constant currency. During the quarter, we experienced continued softness in the small tip market and a flat market in the large tip business. However, we did see growth in Inter Cardiac Echo or ICE capital and diagnostic product categories in the quarter. Sales of the recently released Blazer Open-Irrigated Catheter continued to ramp in Europe. As we've previously stated, this launch is a significant step in the execution of our global AFib strategy.","On a worldwide basis, our Endoscopy business continued to have solid growth, with sales up 6% in constant currency in the fourth quarter. Growth in the U.S. was 4%, while our international sales grew 8% in constant currency with strength across all geographic regions, driven by continued strong new product introductions, expanded indications and increased adoption of our single-use products.","This performance was led by strength in our biliary device franchise, supported by continued growth in the Advanix Biliary Plastic Stent for the treatment of biliary structures, our Metal Stent franchise led by our WallFlex Biliary RX Fully Covered Stent and our Hemostasis franchise on a continued adoption and utilization of a Resolution Clip for GI bleeding.","In constant currency, our Urology\/Women's Health business declined 1% on a worldwide basis, but was up 8% internationally. The Urology business maintained its leadership position and delivered 4% worldwide constant currency growth, driven by an 8% increase in our international core stone management business. The Women's Health business declined 8% on a worldwide constant currency basis as continued procedure -- pressures on electro procedures due to the weak macroeconomic environment and the recent FDA public health notice update on the use of uro\/gynecologic surgical mesh for pelvic organ prolapse more than offset strong double-digit growth of our next-generation Genesys HTA System for the treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding.","Outside of the U.S., our international Women's Health business continued to experience good growth and was up 13% in constant currency, driven by new product introductions, increased sales investments and the penetration of new therapies.","In Neuromodulation, we grew our worldwide business 6% in constant currency during the fourth quarter despite continued weakness in macroeconomic conditions. The growth was driven by our differentiated product portfolio and strong commercial execution strategies.","Let me now briefly address full-year 2011 revenue. On a reported basis, consolidated 2011 revenue was $7,622,000,000, which represents a 2% decrease from the prior year on a reported basis. In constant currency and excluding the impact of the Neurovascular divestiture and the ship hold, sales decreased 4% compared to 2010, driven largely by the decline in U.S. and euro market. For the full year, foreign currency positively impacted reported full-year sales growth by approximately 260 basis points or about $204 million.","Moving on from sales. Adjusted gross profit margin for the quarter was 64.8% or 280 basis points lower than Q4 2010. In the quarter, margins were negatively impacted by the Neurovascular divestiture, pricing pressure and inventory charge related to the U.S. launch of PROMUS Element and unfavorable foreign exchange, somewhat offset by the positive impact of manufacturing efficiencies and a continued mix shift towards self-manufactured product in DES. For the full-year 2011, adjusted gross profit margin was 65.7%. Adjusted SG&A expenses were $620 million or 33.5% of sales. This compares to $677 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. The decrease was primarily due to the divestiture of the Neurovascular business and the benefit of expense discipline and the recent restructuring activities, partially offset by higher spending on strategic growth initiatives, primarily in emerging markets and costs relating to recently acquired businesses. For the full-year 2011, adjusted SG&A expenses were $2,478,000,000 or 32.5% of sales.","Adjusted research and development expenses were $230 million for the fourth quarter or 12.4% of sales. This compares to $225 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. R&D spending was relatively flat as lower expenses due to the Neurovascular divestiture were offset by costs relating to recently acquired businesses. For the full-year 2011, adjusted R&D expenses was $895 million or 11.7% of sales. Royalty expense was $33 million or 1.8% of sales for the quarter compared to $37 million in Q4 of last year. For the full-year 2011, royalty expense was $172 million or 2.3% of sales.","On an adjusted basis, pretax operating income was $315 million or 17% of sales, down 370 basis points from Q4 2010. As a percentage of sales, the decrease in adjusted operating income was due to lower gross margins and the impact of lower sales on operating expenses. GAAP operating income, which includes GAAP to adjusted items that had a negative effect of $145 million on a pretax basis, was $170 million in Q4. ","Now I'll move on to Other Income expense. Interest expense was $72 million in the fourth quarter, which was $35 million lower than in Q4 2010, primarily due to substantial debt repayment since December 2010, and a $15 million accelerated interest charge which occurred in Q4 2010 related to the prepayment of our June 2011 bonds. Our average interest expense rate in Q4 2011 was 5.9% or about 50 basis points lower than Q4 2010, primarily due to the prepayment of our bank term loan during the first half of 2011, which had a lower average interest rate than our public bonds.","2011 interest expense was $281 million, which was $112 million lower than in 2010, primarily due to the debt repayment and accelerated interest charge I just mentioned, as well as a benefit from interest rate swaps executed on some of our public debt in 2011. Our adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was consistent with our previously forecasted Q4 rate of around 20%. During the quarter, we recognized a $24 million benefit from discrete tax items relating to our operating businesses. This benefit was offset by a slightly higher than anticipated full-year operational tax rate of 19.3% due to the timing and geographic mix of sales generated under new product launches.","For the full year, our tax rate was 12.2% on an adjusted basis and 31.3% on a reported GAAP basis. Fourth quarter EPS was $0.13 on adjusted basis and $0.07 on a GAAP basis, both of which were within our respective guidance ranges despite the fact that the negative EPS impact of inventory charges of approximately $42 million or $0.02 related to the earlier-than-expected U.S. launch of PROMUS Element Plus were not included in that guidance. GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter included $0.01 of acquisition-related net credits, $0.01 of divestiture-related net credits, $0.01 of restructuring-related costs and $0.02 of litigation-related charges, as well as the normal $0.05 of amortization expense.","Stock compensation was $32 million in the fourth quarter, and all per share calculations were computed using approximately 1.5 billion shares outstanding. And the end of 2011, we had approximately $1.45 billion shares outstanding.","For the full year, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.67 per share. This included a total of $0.12 of net onetime benefits. On a reported GAAP basis, 2011 EPS was $0.29.","GAAP earnings per share for 2011 included $0.47 per share of goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, $0.02 per share of acquisition-related net credits, $0.35 per share of divestiture-related net credits, $0.06 per share of restructuring-related costs, $0.02 per share of litigation-related charges, $0.02 of discrete tax benefits and amortization expense of $0.22 per share.","Moving on to the balance sheet, DSO of 62 days was up 1 day compared to the fourth quarter 2010 due to weakness in EMEA, partially offset by strong U.S. collections. Days inventory on hand was 130 days in Q4, which was 1 day the higher than the prior year quarter. Higher inventory to support new product leases was partially offset by the benefit of inventory reductions attributable to the Neurovascular divestiture and finished goods reduction programs.","Adjusted operating cash flow was $374 million, including the receipt of $76 million from Abbott in the quarter in settlement of our outstanding PROMUS cost adjustments in the U.S. This compares to $377 million in Q4 last year. On a reported GAAP basis, operating cash flow was $349 million compared to $449 million in Q4 2010. ","For 2011, adjusted operating cash flow was $1.45 billion, which is $377 million lower than 2010, primarily due to lower tax refunds and lower operating profit, partially offset by lower interest rate payments as a result of our recent deleveraging, the benefit from the termination of our fixed to floating rate interest rate swaps on our public bonds and the receipt of the settlement payment from Abbott in 2011. On a reported GAAP basis, operating cash flow was approximately $1 billion or $682 million higher than 2010.","Capital expenditures were $81 million in the fourth quarter. For the full year, capital expenditures were $304 million or $32 million higher than 2010, primarily due to the ongoing automation of our largest distribution center and increasing manufacturing capacity for the launch of PROMUS Element in the U.S. and Japan.","Based on the above, adjusted free cash flow was $293 million in Q4 and $1.27 billion for the full-year 2011. On a reported GAAP basis, free cash flow was $269 million in Q4 and $704 million for the full year.","As I mentioned earlier, we repurchased 52 million shares or over 3% of the outstanding common stock of the company for approximately $300 million in the fourth quarter. At a current stock price, we estimate we have over $700 million of capacity remaining in our current stock repurchase program. We continue to believe that our stock price is undervalued and currently expect to use approximately 1\/4 of our free cash flow to repurchase shares in 2012 subject to applicable law, market conditions, our stock price, business development opportunities and other factors.","We remain confident that we can balance our priorities from investing in growth and returning capital to shareholders, all while improving our investment-grade metrics on the strength of solid cash flows.","Let me now briefly provide some perspective on our outlook and walk you through our guidance for first quarter and full-year 2012. As we enter 2012, we continue to face headwinds and limited visibility in several of our markets, most notably CRM [indiscernible] and we plan to continue to invest in emerging markets and other targeted areas. However, we also expect to start seeing an increasing level of benefits from several key components of our $650 million to $750 million in cost saving and profit enhancing opportunities as we progress throughout the year. Having considered those factors, we estimate that consolidated 2012 sales will be between $7.3 billion and $7.7 billion. Assuming that current foreign exchange rates hold constant, we expect full-year headwind from FX to be approximately $86 million. On a constant currency basis, consolidated 2012 sales should be in the range of up 2% to down 3%. The upper end of this range assumes that the U.S. defib market does not deteriorate further and therefore year-over-year comparisons improve progressively through the year.","We expect our adjusted gross margin for the year to be between 66.5% and 67.5%. Although we expect to continue to see downward pricing pressure, we expect this headwind to be more than offset by lower costs due to our anticipated conversion from PROMUS to PROMUS Element in the U.S. and Japan, as well as our Plant Network Optimization and manufacturing value improvement programs. The impact of these benefits should ramp as we progress through the year. As a result, we expect Q1 margins to be below the full-year range and margin in the second half of the year to be above it.","With respect to SG&A expenses, we expect to continue to make investments in emerging markets and additional selling investments in other international markets. In 2012, the cost of these investments should be partially offset by restructuring savings, although we expect most of the benefit of these savings to be realized in the second half of the year.","For the full year, we expect adjusted SG&A as a percent of sales to be between 33% and 34%, with much of the increase compared to 2011 due to onetime benefits realized in the prior period. We expect to be near or above the high end of our SG&A guidance range in the first half of 2012 and closer to lower end in the second half for SG&A.","We continue to transform our R&D organization and refocus our spending to drive innovation and growth. In 2012, we expect R&D spending to increase slightly and to be between 12% and 12.5% of sales as we ramp spending in several of our priority growth initiative areas. We currently expect Other Income expense to be relatively flat last year.","Royalty expense is expected to be slightly lower in 2012 compared to 2011 due to product mix changes involving products that incur royalties at different rates. We expect our adjusted tax rate for the full-year 2012 to be approximately 17%. Excluding any discrete tax items that may arise during the year and assuming that the U.S. R&D tax credit will be retroactively extended for the full-year 2012, we are subject to tax authority examinations in many jurisdictions that are scheduled to include in 2012.","The final resolution of these exams may result in additional favorable or unfavorable discrete tax items during the year that are difficult to forecast, but may impact our full-year adjusted tax rate. As a result, we expect adjusted EPS for the full-year 2012 to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.70, and we encourage you to model the midpoint of that range. Excluding any onetime items that may arise, we expect adjusted earnings per share to increase sequentially as we progress through the year, driven by the timing of the cost benefits we expect to realize. On a reported GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in the range of $0.25 to $0.38.","Lastly for 2012, we expect adjusted free cash flow to exceed $1 billion, which we believe to be conservative but appropriate given the uncertain economic environment and prospects of additional austerity, particularly in Europe, CapEx of approximately $300 million, pretax amortization expense of roughly $100 million per quarter and stock comp expense of around $130 million. ","Now turning to Q1 2012, we expect consolidated revenues to be in the range of $1,825,000,000 to $1.9 billion. If current foreign exchange rates hold constant, the headwind from FX should be approximately $10 million or 50 basis points relative to Q1 2011.","On a constant currency basis, we expect consolidated Q1 sales to be in the range of flat to down 5%. On a worldwide basis, we expect DES revenue to be in the range of $365 million to $385 million and CRM revenue to be in the range of $480 million to $510 million in the first quarter. For the first quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.11 to $0.14 per share on an adjusted basis, and reported GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.02 to $0.05 per share. ","That's it for guidance. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Sean who will moderate the Q&A. Sean?","Sean Wirtjes","Thanks, Jeff. Rochelle, let's open up the call to questions. [Operator Instructions] Rochelle, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First I\u2019d like to make sure, Jeff, that I caught a couple of your comments correct. You're assuming that your free cash flow would be about $1 billion in 2012 and then on the repurchase, you would use about 1\/4 of your free cash flow to buy back stocks. Is that right?","Jeffrey D. Capello","That's correct, Mike.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And what's defining the percentage that you're assuming on the buyback? Why 1\/4 versus 1\/2 versus or some other number?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Well I think as we said, the strategy revolves around primarily driving the top line of the company. I think Hank did a good job of outlining our internal programs, particularly the ones that we expect to kind of start to get some traction in 2013. Having said that, our aspiration is to drive the growth rate of the company up to kind of the mid single digits, if not higher. And so from a shareholder perspective, I think you're going to see us get a little bit more aggressive from a business development perspective to try to drive some new technologies into the business to drive the revenue growth. However, I think we can do both. And that the 25% is just an estimate at this point in time and we'll wait and see what happens as we work our way through the year in terms of what assets are available at an appropriate price.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","With the pressure you have on the pricing side in DES and CRM and submitted parts of your mentioned cardiology bag, [ph] could you just give us your thoughts on how gross margins play out beyond 2012? You're getting at the net of in '12 obviously the conversion from PROMUS to PROMUS Element across the U.S. and Japan. But if we look beyond '12 and then step up, do you think you can hold gross margins in the face of these pressures assuming they don't moderate at some point?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes. And that's a good question. If you go back and look at the Investor Day material we laid out in 2010 and kind of look at the different factors and look at what's different one way or the other, clearly price is a little bit more of a headwind than we anticipated. And we were starting with 68% margins. We assumed that price would be about 400 basis points of headwind. That's become a little stronger, although we saw some benefit in the fourth quarter. What's important to recognize, however, is that despite the pricing pressures, unit volumes are actually increasing in Europe and in other locations relative to the DES market and other markets. So we're getting fixed cost leverage. So if you go back and look at the Investor Day model, we get a volume benefit even though revenues are not where we want them to be. In some sectors, they are growing and the bonds are growing quicker. So we get fixed cost leverage, which helps offset some price. We continue to do very well in the productivity side. We have an objective to take out 5% of the standard costs every year. We continue to do very well in that front. So that's another positive headwind -- tailwind, rather. The PROMUS Element, if you look at kind of the distribution of the $200 million, we'll get the majority of that, call it 2\/3-ish, here in 2012. There's another 1\/3 to come, though, in '13. And then we've got the plant network optimization program, which a lot of it will happen in '12. We'll get a little bit of a tailwind in '13. But also, that doesn't count. So those are all positive factors that help offset price. The other dynamic that happens is, some of these new technologies come in, Mike, they're all designed to have much higher gross margins than our average. So there should be a mixed benefit as Alair kind of starts to be a bigger piece, Atritech comes in and Sadra. These are all designed to be -- have gross margins in north of our average. There will be a mixed benefit that will start in '13 and accelerate in '14.","Operator","And the next question is from the line of Glenn Navarro, RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","2 questions, 1 on ICDs. It seems like in the quarter, you may have taken some reserves or pulled inventory here in the U.S. in front of the Progeny launch. Can you quantify that? And then provide any commentary on pricing. You gave pricing on stents, but I don't recall getting pricing on ICDs. And I just had one follow-up.","Jeffrey D. Capello","Okay, Glenn, this is Jeff. So I don't think we're going to be as specific, perhaps, as you like. But as you look at our performance for ICDs, we still think that the market -- U.S. ICD market was down kind of mid-teens, if you will. I think that's consistent with the competition we're saying. We were down kind of in the 20% -- 21%, 22%, 20%, if you will. That delta is split between kind of our -- some replacement headwind that we have that will start to dissipate as we work our way through '12. And the other piece of it is kind of what we call kind of less bulking or less -- placing less inventory on the shelves, which is driven by dynamic that we have a new exciting technology coming in. We didn't want to put more COGNIS and TELIGEN on the shelves and have it come back in returns.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And pricing?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Pricing, as you look at pricing domestically and internationally, within the CRM market, kind of mid single digits, not much change kind of domestically. Outside the U.S., a little bit -- we identified in the third quarter that pricing was a little bit more of a challenge in Europe. That's still the case. And then DES, I think we called kind of lower kind of mid single-digit price erosion in the U.S., which was very encouraging. Still kind of upper single-digit erosion outside the U.S., though.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just maybe for Hank. I'm just curious how he sees your business playing out in the ICD market in 2012. In the single and dual chamber segment of the market, you have St. Jude having to deal with, say, Riata issues that could be an opportunity for taking share. But conversely, they've also launched their quadpole, which suggests you may be -- you could lose share there. So maybe talk to us about how you see yourself positioned in the ICD market, particularly in the U.S. in 2012.","William H. Kucheman","Glenn, great question. I believe it's somewhat of a mixed bag. We believe that with the platform that we're launching that we're actually going to take share. And one of the things that I'm not sure that's well appreciated yet in terms of differentiation factors is the growing importance of our LATITUDE Heart Failure Management System, one; and then two, battery longevity. Now within the healthcare system environment today, you can argue that battery longevity has been a headwind for us due to the impact that it has on replacements. But I think there's a growing recognition on the part of various healthcare systems that as time marches on, and actually some systems are beginning to anticipate this fact this year, is that, that actually can work to their advantage and our advantage in a world of value-based pricing. So we're seeing the key differentiators of ICDs beginning to change a bit perhaps in our favor in ways that historically have not acted on our behalf. That would be quite candidly the essence of what I would respond to your question. And I think it's a play out. We're very excited by the platform, the 3 tiers, the features that we have, the DF4 connector tool that we have, we call it a green machine. That is a very key ease-of-use feature that the EPs are really attracted to, and we're getting some great feedback on it. So I think we'll have to see how the execution plays out here with the coming quarters. But basically from what I see so far, I'm very, very encouraged.","Operator","And next question from the line of Kristen Stewart, Deutsche Bank.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was just curious on the -- within the context, I guess, of cash flows, you had mentioned that you did receive money from Abbott on the adjustment. Was there any impact on the gross margin this quarter or any P&L impact with the true up with PROMUS?","Jeffrey D. Capello","No, Kristen. We made that true up back in the first half of the year.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So that was not fourth quarter specific for cash flows?","Jeffrey D. Capello","No.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then can you also just comment generally on Europe? You mentioned a couple different times that the market is more challenging. It sounds like it got worse within the quarter. So what are you seeing? It sounds like it's tougher in CRM. It doesn't sound like it's getting any better in stents, either. So any comments on Europe would be helpful.","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes, Kristen, it's Jeff. So I think what we saw in the quarter, particularly in Southern Europe, is we saw instances of certain facilities either restricting procedures or not doing any procedures as we worked our way through the fourth quarter because of budgetary issues. And that had an impact on our sales for certain. As we've opened up now for the new year, we're seeing a little bit less pressure with some of the budgets being kind of freed up again for the new year. So that's not unusual for Europe to do. The issue here is that we've got a lot more of a difficult situation ahead of some of those Southern European countries. So the answer is we're just going to have to wait and see what happens and how things play out.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Rick Wise, Leerink Swann.","Miroslava Minkova - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","It's Miroslava for Rick today. Let me start by asking about the gross margin. Can you help us ease out the impact of divestitures, the inventory changes that you had with the PROMUS -- with the Progeny line price, et cetera? And how should we think about your key assumptions for gross margin expansion heading into 2012? How much of that is PROMUS Element versus these other factors reversing perhaps?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Well, let me start with the fourth quarter. So as you look at the gross margins for the fourth quarter on a percentage basis, if you look at kind of the impact to gross margins, you can almost think of kind of the value improvement programs and the cost initiatives pretty much offset price. And really, the big delta is year-over-year. So price was negative. We take out cost every year. That's positive. Those 2 more or less offset one another from a margin percentage perspective. And so what we were then left with was a $42 million reserve, which is a sales returns reserve of $10 million and an inventory reserve of $32 million. That had a 200-basis-point impact to gross margins, negative kind of onetime impact to gross margins. We also had the divestiture of Neurovascular, which we've consistently said has weighed on gross margins by about 170 basis points. So it's really those 2 factors that compress gross margins. The good news is heading into 2012, those 2 things go away and we get the benefit of about 100 -- call it $150 million-ish operating improvement and gross margin improvement for the introduction of PROMUS Element. So if you do that as a percentage of revenue, that's a couple of hundred basis points. So that's why our guidance for gross margins, we've kind of guided 65 to 66 for this year. And absent kind of the benefits in the first quarter and the negative things in the fourth quarter, we pretty much hung in that range. Now we're putting out a slightly higher range for 2012, and we will end -- we expect we'll end 2012 above the high-end of that range and build off that gross margin trajectory.","Operator","Your next question from the line of David Lewis, Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Hank, I wanted to come back to some of your earlier introductory comments. You talked a lot more about the pipeline in much more specifics, and I guess it's been about a little over a year since the introduction of the POWER strategy. I guess as you think about this plethora of products in the pipeline and you think about the strategy and your stated goals of driving leverage, do you think you have allocated the appropriate amount of spend either in sales, marketing and R&D to drive the execution across those time lines and still deliver the same type of margins that you laid out a little over a year ago?","William H. Kucheman","Yes, I believe we have, David. I think the pipeline that you are beginning to sense and see is a result of -- we've gotten passed -- if you go back in time a little bit where the organization was internally focused a lot on in terms of some of the quality challenges that we've had, a lot of the organizational resources that we had at our disposal were focused on remediating that. They have now transitioned of getting back to what we love to do, and that's our focus on innovation. So saying that, we're spending roughly about 12% of -- on R&D. I think that's an appropriate percentage. The infrastructure that we have in terms of commercial channel is strong, particularly in the U.S. We're making incremental investments in the commercial infrastructure, especially in emerging markets as we've talked about previously. So one of the things I love about our situation is the fact that we have, especially in emerging markets, Asia Pac, we have the products. And I think you know, both those markets, if you talk specifically about India and China, are very much Interventional Cardiology markets. What we've lacked historically is the commercial infrastructure to deliver those products to the customer base. That infrastructure is building. It's being trained. And I think in the days and months and years to come, we'll see good execution that will drive growth.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then just maybe one quick follow-up for Jeff. I mean, Jeff, last year emerging markets was incrementally a surprise headwind. I wonder, could you update us in terms of the investment in '11 versus the investment in '12? And is emerging market investment still a relative EBIT headwind? Or do we start getting leverage in the emerging markets or contribution leverage at the back half of '12?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes, it's a good question, David. So we will continue to invest. That's one of the reasons you'll see kind of slightly higher SG&A percentage in the first half of this year. We still have plans to add incremental reps, particularly in countries like India and China where we've gotten approvals or we expect to get approvals for certain regions. So you'll see a little bit more heaviness with respect to OpEx, after which the back half of the year, you should start to see both acceleration of revenue growth, which we really haven't seen yet despite the fact we had pretty good results in India and China. We're not seeing the results that we expect and in terms of getting more of an acceleration. And we're seeing signs that will occur in the back half of the year and start to take off. The other dynamic is that I think people are aware that we announced plans to build a manufacturing facility in China. So we have a little bit of headwind relative to cost to get that factory up and running in 2012. But that's more in the gross margin side.","Operator","Next question from the line of Bruce Nudell of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Jeff, one of the things -- or Hank, one of the things that was never totally clear to us and maybe you could kind of like frame for us is back at the Investor Day, there was about 800 bps of operating margin improvement. What sort of top line assumption kind of went with that over that period? And if, let's say, over that initial 3- or 4-year period revenues are more like 2%, what has that 800 bps become?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes, Bruce, that's a good question. So we were clear with people that our short-term objectives relative to revenue growth were kind of in the 2% to 4% range back in 2012, and then kind of the medium term were kind of 6% to 8%. So the period of time we're talking about in terms of the expansion of margin more in 2% to 4%, that was before the CRM market. CRM market was growing in the low single digits. Now we think it's kind of contracting globally in the mid single digits. So I think we've come up recently, said kind of 0% to 3% is kind of our objective in terms of the short term and in terms of growth, which is consistent with the range of guidance we've given out for 2012. So as long as we can drive revenue growth in kind of that low single digit perspective, we ought to be able to get a lot of the margin expansion because some of it -- for example, PROMUS Element is driven by just converting our PROMUS to PROMUS Element. The Plant Network Optimization is driven by taking care of existing volumes and converting them over. And the value improvement programs are 5% of gross costs. So where we'll get hit a little bit would be on the volume side. We won't get quite as much fixed cost leverage through gross margins. Conversely, through the SG&A line, a lot of the benefit is coming out of our restructuring initiatives, which really are not volume dependent at all. So we announced the $225 million and $275 million of restructuring plant in the second quarter of 2011, that really is agnostic to revenue. So we expect to be able to get a lot of that. Some of that we'll get in '12. Really, the majority starts to come through in '13. So we still think that there's ample opportunity even in a difficult environment to expand in margins. And as Hank has outlined in his presentation, we have been riveted on doing that.","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Terrific. And one other question I had is could you give us the kind of PCI growth rates for the U.S., Japan and the other international markets?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Sure. So if you look at kind of from a year-over-year perspective, units in the U.S. were kind of down in the low single digits. Europe, they were actually up in kind of the high single digits. Japan down low single digits. Emerging markets up in kind of the mid-teens.","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So worldwide, there was a lot of price pressure?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Worldwide, the price pressure was consistent, although we saw a better fourth quarter from a price erosion perspective in the U.S. than we've seen in the last 3 years that I've been here. So that's encouraging.","Operator","Next question from the line of Tao Levy, Collins Stewart.","Tao Levy - Collins Stewart LLC, Research Division","Just wanted to be clear, in the U.S. this year, are there any more PROMUS sales or are you completely done with PROMUS sales?","Jeffrey D. Capello","You mean in 2012?","Tao Levy - Collins Stewart LLC, Research Division","Yes, in 2012.","Jeffrey D. Capello","Well in 2012, we began the rollout. The rollout will take some time, and we would anticipate probably by kind of end of the first quarter, early second quarter we'll have full rollout. So we'll still have some sales in the first quarter with PROMUS and probably a short tail into the second quarter.","Tao Levy - Collins Stewart LLC, Research Division","Got you. Okay. And then when you look at the international ICD market, you did indicate it is a little bit weaker. Do you feel like you lost share there? I mean, obviously we need to wait for [indiscernible] to report but based on St. Jude's results, it looks like things fared a little bit worse for you there, and I just -- if you had any reasons behind that.","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes, I think that's fair. I think part of that is we're in the midst of rolling out a whole new refresh of our ICD CRT-D platform. And I think in the rollout of that, we probably didn't hit the ground as hard and as fast as we thought we would have. And so I think that's one factor from an execution perspective which we're addressing right now. The other factor is other competitors have come out with some technology. So part of that is we expected some headwind relative to some other technology competitors had brought out. And now with the full rollout of our INCEPTA, ENERGEN and PUNCTUA lines, we expect to kind of take some share now back, now that we have it fully ruled out.","Operator","Your next question from the line of Raj Denhoy of Jefferies.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I wonder if I could ask sort of on the drug-eluting stent side. We've [indiscernible] in the market and obviously that was an opportunity, but you at several times talked about the ability perhaps go after this additional part of their Interventional Cardiology business. Are you starting to see any of that come through for you yet?","William H. Kucheman","I think -- a great question. In the U.S., the answer to that is yes. We have -- we had a goal set for ourselves in terms of what we wanted to garner from their departure from the market. And we hit that goal and, in fact, exceeded it. In the international markets, it's a ball in play. What I mean by that is the tender process and many of the regions outside the U.S. kind of gate when you can take advantage of those opportunities. Those tenders will come off over the course of time. And we think the full potential of what we can garner from the quarter's opportunity outside the United States will be realized starting this year and quite frankly, in some regions moving into 2013.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And maybe just ask a bit of a product question, a part of the strategy you guys laid out back in 2010, the CRV idea with the combining of the Interventional Cardiology and the CRM sales management and ultimately sales forces. As you see that play out, have you seen much of an impact in a sense in your ability to perhaps sell in the U.S. market? Is there perhaps a risk that maybe you've been a little too aggressive in pursuing that as to what's actually happening on the ground with actually individual clinician behavior?","William H. Kucheman","Well, I think a great question again. I think my answer is going to be multidimensional. First, in terms of I think what you're alluding to is the alignment of physicians within healthcare institutions. Actually, from the standpoint of why we did what we did in terms of CRV, that was one of the trends that we saw in the horizon that we wanted to address. And what we are seeing, and I think this is evident by the success that we've had with our CrossCare Program, where we've increased the number of cardiovascular service line deals, so specifically kind of a bundled deal between CRM and CV, that's increased fairly dramatically over the past year. So I would say I consider that a success. Secondly, if you look at how we've organized ourselves, we have a good percentage of the CRV sales organization in the United States that are now engaged in cross selling. And one example I'll give you is one of our reps on the IC side in the fourth quarter had 11 implants. Historically, that has not been in play. But it's more of a team orientation that I think is growing in its importance within the commercial channel and has been well received by our customers.","Operator","And the next question from the line of Bob Hopkins, Bank of America.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Jeff, just to start out, I'd love to continue with your 2012 guidance. If you could give us a sense as to how much of the $650 million to $750 million is -- you anticipate being realized in 2012, and if you're willing to break that out kind of between COGS and SG&A.","Jeffrey D. Capello","Sure. Give me a minute here. I've got that right in front of me.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","On a gross basis.","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes, sure. I'll do it in total and then try to give you some detail relative to gross margin and SG&A. So as you look at 2012, just going through the pieces, the 5% reduction in cost of goods sold is a program we have every year. It's an ongoing program and frankly, I think we've got one of the best manufacturing organizations around. So you can consistently count on them taking out 5% of cost of goods sold. That stays in all year. So that was in '11, that will be in '12. The PROMUS profit share, we said it was a $200 million opportunity. The vast majority, I said $150 million, that won't be far off for 2012. That will sit in '12, and then we'll get a benefit for that relative to '13, kind of the tail of that. Those are the 2 big pieces relative to gross margin benefit for '12 and '13. And then as we look at the restructuring, which is more of an SG&A, it really started a little bit in '10. We'll get a piece of the $225 million to $275 million in '12, a small piece. And then we'll get the lion's share kind of in '13 and '14. So as you look at kind of what I think some people have said, well, all the benefit of $650 million to $750 million really happens in '12, that's really not accurate. The benefit -- the large benefit of PROMUS Element will occur in '12, but the vast majority of the restructuring benefit will happen in '13 and then into '14. And you've got to remember that the VIP programs continue every year as well. And then you've got project transformation, which is reducing R&D costs, that's spread almost equally over the year. So we do have -- we always said that the $650 million to $750 million would start in earnest at the end of '11 and be kind of '12 and '13 and part of '14 benefits. And that's still a plan. And as Hank has highlighted and I'll reiterate, that is still a plan.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","The Plant Optimization?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes. And the Plant Network Optimization program, the majority of that really will hit in '12, and there will be a small tail of that in '13.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then just as my follow-up. I was wondering if I could get a couple of little -- just little data points. Could you give us the EMEA PROMUS Element share in the quarter? And then I just want to make sure I heard you right. On that bulk order for ICDs, is that in the $10 million to $15 million range? And was it a negative impact this quarter?","Jeffrey D. Capello","So we're not going to get in on the specifics on both. We're not going to comment on. I don't think anybody is doing that. So we'll pass on that comment. Relative to the share, in our share, it was relatively slightly unchanged relative to DES sequentially from the third to the fourth quarter. And the vast majority of that was PROMUS Element.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then buybacks, could you just comment on why those seem to tail off so much in 2012? Do you anticipate acquisitions? Is that just a function of what you have authorized? Or just -- you bought back more in this quarter than you're anticipating for next year. So I just wanted to put some perspective around that.","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes, I think as we continue to roll out the strategy and get more specific with some of the targets we're looking at and given the environment that we're in, we're anticipating that it may become a slightly better environment from a business development perspective in terms of targets that are available that may not have been available historically. So -- but I think why I threw that out there is we're getting a lot of questions saying, will you buy back? I think we will buy back and I think we're comfortable saying we will use at least 1\/4 of our cash flow to do buybacks. And then thereafter, it will all be governed by what's available and what we can get done at an appropriate price from a business development perspective.","Operator","And the next question from the line of Derrick Sung of Sanford Bernstein.","Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I wanted to go back to your outlook for the ICD market in 2012. I thought I heard you say that the upper end of your guidance assumes the ICD market doesn't deteriorate further. So are you implying that kind of midpoint of your guidance, your baseline case is that the ICD market does deteriorate further? And maybe if you can just kind of give us your baseline kind of outlook for pricing and volume for the ICD market.","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes, so Derrick, it's Jeff. So relative to our guidance, the upper end of the guidance assumes that from an ICD perspective that, that market flattens out in the back half of '12. So it started kind of eroding in the second quarter. We thought it was down mid-teens in Q3 and Q4. We're assuming that we have headwinds in Q1 and then partially Q2. And then almost like on a same-store sales basis against a comparable low benchmark, it kind of flattens out in the back half. So that's what we've assumed relative to that.","Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And how about price -- sort of your pricing assumptions for the market as well? And then maybe you could do the same -- if you could do the same for the drug-eluting stent market as well is my follow-up.","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes. So pricing, we're assuming pricing is down mid single digits here in the U.S., a little higher than that outside the U.S. and CRM. And then relative to DS, we've assumed kind of up per single-digit price erosion both in the U.S. and outside the U.S.","Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And one other question, in 2013, as you look forward towards the med tech tax, can you talk a little bit about how you expect to offset that? And do you still expect to be able to see sort of the same kind of growth trajectory and absorb that tax? Or what are your thoughts relative to that?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Well, I think we've been very clear from the beginning that this tax is going to put a lot of pressure on all corporations. And assuming that we're going to pass it through to a hospital group that's under pressure that's going to get their tax, I think it's optimistic. So we're assuming we're going to have to be kind of tighter from an OpEx perspective. And that was always in our plans back when we did the Investor Day, and that's one of the reasons why we're being pretty aggressive on the cost side. It's because we're assuming we're going to have to manage our way through that.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Matthew Dodds, Citigroup.","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just one quick question, Jeff, for you. On amortization interest, is the current run rate for the fourth quarter the $96 million amortization, is that a good carry through for 2012?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Yes. When you say amortization, your amortization of intangibles, not interest, right? That's what you're looking for?","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes.","Jeffrey D. Capello","Okay. Amortization is about $100 million per quarter.","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then for interest, it seems like when you said other would be roughly flat year-over-year, you're assuming the interest is also run rate around $70 million for next year per quarter?","Jeffrey D. Capello","Exactly flat with the current run rate.","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Then just 2 quick product questions for U.S. In 2012, do you expect to start clinical trials for an MRI compatible pacemaker and quadripolar leads early 2013?","William H. Kucheman","Right now, we do not have a plan to start a clinical trial MRI Conditional in '12.","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And how about on quadripolar leads for ICDs?","William H. Kucheman","I don't believe so. Dr. Stein, are you on the phone? Can you confirm that?","Ken Stein","Yes, I'm on. Not a chronic study. We already have started some acute testing on quadripolar leads.","Sean Wirtjes","Okay with that, we'll conclude the call.

The 5.2% organic growth was also notable against our highest growth comp of the year, as we grew 9.4% organically in Q1 2017.","We leveraged our first quarter revenue growth to deliver 14% adjusted EPS growth to $0.33 and generated $283 million in adjusted cash flow. We're also excited about 2018 and our plans to build upon our global momentum and drive sustainable long-term growth and differentiated financial performance. So, given our confidence in the outlook of the balance of the year, we are raising the high end of the full year 2017 organic revenue growth guidance. Our prior range of 5% to 6% is now 5% to 7%, plus an additional approximate 40 basis point contribution from the Symetis acquisition.","I'm also pleased that, as a result of our first quarter performance, plus the improved full year revenue outlook, we're raising our full year 2018 adjusted EPS guidance from $1.35 to $1.39, to a range of $1.37 to $1.41, representing 9% to 12% year-on-year growth.","Importantly, we also continue to invest in meaningful innovation to further strengthen our category leadership strategy and drive organic revenue and EPS growth over the long term. During the quarter, we announced four compelling tuck-in acquisitions and one investment: NxThera and nVision in Urology and Pelvic Health, EmCision in Endoscopy, Securus in EP, and Millipede in Structural Heart. These acquisitions will strengthen our faster growth core oriented business and enable over $16 billion in exciting new market expansion opportunities by 2021.","So before I discuss the business results, I'd like to review the changes we also announced earlier today in our reporting segments, which reflected better alignment in our geographic regions and businesses. Geographically, we've now combined our Middle East and Africa organizations with Europe to create the EMEA region, which results in a standalone Asia-Pac region that no longer includes the Middle East and Africa.","Additionally, we've also realigned our global Neuromodulation business to now be included with our Rhythm Management reporting segments, which includes Cardiac Rhythm Management and EP. We are renaming this segment Rhythm and Neuro, and we see benefits of bringing our active implantable devices closer together across both the cardiac and neuro markets, as this is better aligned with our shared manufacturing facilities and can drive further capabilities and best practices. As a result of this move, our MedSurg segment now includes Endo and Uro\/Pelvic Health and after 29 years at Boston Scientific, Mike Phalen has retired and we wish him the very best and thank him for his great contribution to BSC over these many years.","I'll now provide some highlights on first quarter results and thoughts on our full year 2018 outlook. In my remarks, all references to growth are organic, year over year, unless otherwise specified. So regionally in first quarter, we delivered strong and balanced growth with both EMEA and Asia-Pac growing 6%, U.S. 5%, and emerging markets gaining 17%. Strength in the Asia-Pac region was broad based, and China once again delivered 23% growth.","We also delivered balanced growth across all of our businesses. As to realigned, the MedSurg business grew 7%, Rhythm and Neuro grew 6%, and Cardiovascular was up 3%. So I'll now share some details on some of the drivers.","In Endo we posted 6% growth fueled by strong pathology and infection prevention performance as well as sales of our SpyGlass DS visualization platform, Axios Stent and continued the option of Resolution 360 hemostasis.","In addition, we're excited about the early launch of our endoluminal surgery portfolio, including the Orise platform which provides a novel means of diagnosing and treating cancers of the GI tract solely through natural orifice.","In early March, we also acquired EmCision, which offers an endoscopic bipolar RF device that coagulates tissue and relieves duct obstruction, which helps improve quality of life in patients who are living with pancreatic biliary cancers.","Our Uro and Pelvic Health business continued a strong performance trend, growing sales 9% in first quarter led by sales of LithoVue, our single-use digital ureteroscope, as well as products for Men's Health, core stone, and BPH.","Emerging market sales in Uro and Pelvic Health were strong, growing 30%, and our Greenlight therapy for BPH posted a solid growth, particularly internationally, as we continue to invest in training, while leveraging BSC's strong global infrastructure.","We also intend to strengthen and expand our leadership position in BPH with the recent acquisition of NxThera, and NxThera's developed the Rez\u016bm system, which uses water vapor to remove excess prostate tissue, thereby alleviating obstruction to urine flow and reducing BPH-related systems (sic) [symptoms]. This is a very strong complementary offering to our existing Greenlight laser therapy. Minimally invasive therapies are expanding the market beyond pharmaceuticals for the estimated 110 million worldwide diagnosed with BPH. And Rez\u016bm's key advantages are that it's simple, in-office procedure provides differentiated relief from symptoms, and data to date indicate superior durability of results and thus limited need for re-intervention.","Also, last week's announcement of the acquisition of nVision Medical is really an important and potentially game changing opportunity for women at risk for ovarian cancer and for Boston Scientific. nVision will become part of the Surg-Gyn business and we're hopeful that the nVision platform can change the landscape of ovarian cancer, which is the fifth most deadly cancer among women, given the lack of a reliable diagnostic and resulting late stage detection. We're also hopeful that the platform may one day limit the estimated 300,000 preventative surgeries done each year in the U.S. to remove ovaries and fallopian tubes, 90% of which prove to be benign. Ovaries, I should say. Studies indicate that there are 400,000 women in the U.S. who are high risk, who would be near term candidates to benefit from the nVision diagnostic procedure. We believe this diagnostic platform could ultimately result in a $500 million to $1 billion U.S. market opportunity. We plan to make nVision commercially available in the first half of 2019 and will continue to invest in clinical work to support the widest possible adoption of this platform.","Rhythm and Neuro grew 6% in the quarter led by 17% growth in Neuro, 11% in EP, and 2% in CRM. Neuro revenue grew growth of 17% in the first quarter, was driven by U.S. launches of our WaveWriter Spinal Cord Stim system and Vercise Deep Brain Stimulation platforms. In addition, our international investments in Neuro are starting to pay off as we delivered 30% plus growth outside the U.S. We're also very encouraged by the initial physician and patient clinical experience with the WaveWriter SCS launch and its unique ability to offer combined waveform therapies both with paresthesia and sub-perception.","In DBS yesterday at the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting, we presented the one-year results from the landmark INTREPID study. This is the first and only multicenter, double-blind randomized sham-controlled study in the field of deep brain stimulation. In this study, the use of Vercise DBS demonstrated a 49% improvement in motor systems in patients with advanced but responsive Parkinson's disease. This represents a greater benefit when compared to other DBS systems researched to date. We look forward to ongoing strong growth in Neuromodulation and the launch of our next generation DBS platform with directional lead in the second half of 2018.","Global CRM sales grew above market at 2%, led by double-digit growth in defib sales, reflecting a very strong global launch of our Resonate platform which includes the HeartLogic heart failure alert as well as continued double-digit growth of Emblem S-ICD. The expected benefit from our device replacement cycle is also tracking to expectations. We are now the number two global share player in the high-voltage market.","Customer interest in HeartLogic is increasing as heart failure practitioners recognize the value of the only FDA approved heart failure alert which doesn't require maintenance data monitoring. We also continue to enroll patients in the first stage of Manage AF (sic) [HF], which is a multicenter randomized trial designed to quantify the benefit of proactive heart failure management using HeartLogic.","S-ICD's strong global growth continues and we're pleased to announce that it is now included in Physician Society of Recommendations in both the U.S. and Europe, placing S-ICD on equal footing to transvenous ICDs for patients who don't need pacing or ATV therapy. Brady pacing grew below market in first quarter as we faced a tough comp and lost some modest share due to competitive launches. While we expect brady pacing sales could remain likely a headwind for the full year 2018, given the strong global momentum of our defib portfolio in both CRTD and ICD, we are confident that our worldwide CRM business will continue to grow above market in 2018.","EP sales grew 11% in the quarter led by good growth in our Rhythmia HDx mapping and nav platform. We also continue to strengthen our catheter portfolio with the upcoming European full launch of our DirectSense and IntellaNav MiFi ablation catheter. We also announced a small EP acquisition in April, Securus Medical, which has developed a thermal monitoring system for continuous measurement of esophageal temperature to avoid thermal injury during left atrial ablation procedures. We expect a launch in mid-2019, post completion of manufacturing scale-up activities.","Also, please join us for an update and webcast on our Rhythm Management and WATCHMAN programs at HRS on Friday, May 11 at 12:15, and please note this is a scheduling change from Thursday to Friday.","Our Cardiovascular group grew 3% in first quarter 2018. PI grew at 6% in the quarter, led by strong growth in both Europe and Asia. Europe, in particular, is delivering a strong growth due to our innovative drug-eluting technologies with both the Ranger DCB and Eluvia DES, as well as our JetStream atherectomies platform. We're now targeting drug-eluting U.S. launches in first half 2019 for Eluvia DES and in 2020 for Ranger DCB. Preliminary COMPARE-1 DCB data was presented in first quarter at the LINC Congress in Leipzig, Germany. This is the first randomized controlled head-to-head trial of DCBs, and the preliminary results suggested similar patency with our next generation lower drug dose Ranger DCB versus the higher dose IN.PACT DCB. Our Interventional Cardiology business grew 1% in the quarter, led by strong sales in structural heart and complex PCI products, offset by an expected challenging quarter in drug-eluting stents.","Complex PCI grew double-digits for the second quarter in a row on continued momentum from multiple new launches in 2017 and we remain on track for a strong cadence in 2018 with the WOLVERINE Cutting Balloon and our next gen rotational atherectomy system, ROTAPRO. Offsetting this growth, drug-eluting stent sales were down mid-single-digits in the quarter as declines in the U.S. and Japan due to tough comps and competitive trialing were offset by low-single-digit growth in Europe. Our structural heart programs continue to build momentum with increased capabilities and scale. The strength of WATCHMAN and ACURATE position us well to deliver $400 million in structural heart revenue in 2018.","WATCHMAN had another very strong quarter and continues to build global momentum, having now surpassed the 50,000 global implants milestone. And during the quarter, positive results from the Japan SALUTE trial were presented and we remain on track to launch in Japan in the second half of 2019. In the U.S., we expect to begin enrollment in the next gen WATCHMAN FLX IDE this quarter, and we continue to invest in multiple WATCHMAN market development initiatives focused on physician training, refer education, and patient awareness.","Our ACURATE TAVR valve platform continues to build momentum in Europe and hit sales of $21 million this quarter, up from $16 million in fourth quarter 2017. We completed training of our European sales and clinical teams in fourth quarter and we look forward to continued momentum as well as the launch of the next gen ACURATE neo2 with an advanced seal in Europe in the second half of this year. We're also expanding access to ACURATE in multiple markets and have begun the process for reimbursement in France, which is expected in 2020. Enrollment in the SCOPE I and SCOPE II studies is expected to be completed by the year end and we anticipate beginning enrollment in our U.S. IDE for ACURATE in the second half of the year. Regarding our LOTUS Edge TAVR valve platform, there's no change to our commentary from earlier in the year. In that pending our ability to clear certain technical and regulatory hurdles, our goal remains to launch LOTUS Edge in the U.S. and European markets in 2019.","So to close, I'd like to share again my enthusiasm for outlook in 2018 and beyond. We really believe that Boston Scientific continues to be uniquely positioned to drive shareholder value due to our differentiated long-term growth profile, significant room to improve operating margins, our consistent track record of driving double-digit adjusted EPS growth, and our improving ability to deploy capital. I really want to thank again our employees for their winning spirit and commitment to advancing science for life.","And Dan will now provide a detailed review of our financials.","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thanks, Mike. First quarter consolidated revenue of $2,379 million represents 10.1% reported revenue growth and 6.2% growth on an operational basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Our reported revenue reflects an $83 million tailwind from foreign exchange, which was slightly favorable to the $60 million to $70 million tailwind expected at the time of guidance.","Sales from the Symetis acquisition contributed approximately 100 basis points, which was slightly above our expectations at the time of guidance, resulting in 5.2% organic revenue growth for the quarter. This strong top-line exceeded the high end of our guidance range of 4% to 5% due to outperformance across the majority of our businesses and regions. We leveraged this strong sales performance and delivered Q1 adjusted earnings per share of $0.33, which represents 14% year-over-year growth and is above the high end of our guidance range of $0.30 to $0.32, driven by solid metrics throughout the entire P&L. Our adjusted earnings per share includes approximately $0.01 of negative FX impact in the quarter, which was in line with what we expected at the time of guidance.","Adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 72.3%, slightly above our guidance range of 71.5% to 72%, and represents a 170 basis point improvement over the prior year. However, Q1 2017 adjusted gross margin included approximately 180 basis points of net charges associated with the voluntary recall of the LOTUS platform and the discontinuance of the FUSE business acquired from EndoChoice. Excluding this charge, first quarter 2018 adjusted gross margin was roughly in line with prior year, but importantly, Q1 of 2018's result reflects our ability to offset a negative 190 basis point year-over-year impact from foreign exchange with operational improvements, manufacturing cost reductions, as well as favorable product mix, particularly in our CRM high voltage, WATCHMAN, and Men's Health franchises.","Adjusted SG&A expenses were $846 million, or 35.5% of sales in Q1 2018, down 60 basis points year-over-year and within our guidance range of 35% to 36%. We remain committed to and continue to realize the benefit of our targeted initiatives focused on reducing SG&A, like end-to-end business process streamlining and automation, expansion of global shared services, and leveraging global sourcing. Adjusted research and development expenses were $254 million in the quarter, or 10.7% of sales, which is relatively flat to Q1 of last year. Royalty expense was 0.7% of sales in Q1 this year, also roughly flat year-over-year.","As a result of the strong sales and solid performance throughout the P&L, Q1 2018 adjusted operating margin of 25.3% increased 230 basis points year-over-year and slightly exceeded our guidance range of 24.75% to 25.25%. Normalizing for the one-time charges incurred in the first quarter of 2017, related to LOTUS and FUSE that I just mentioned, adjusted operating margin improved operationally by 40 basis points year over year. There's no change to our full year adjusted operating margin guidance of 25.5% to 25.75%, as we continue to deliver against our goals, and remain on track for our adjusted operating margin goal of 28% in 2020, and 30% plus longer term.","The underlying year over year improvement in our Q1 2018 adjusted operating margin rate was driven by gains in all three of our segment operating results. The new Rhythm and Neuro segment delivered an operating margin of 20.8%, which, on a comparable basis, represents a 450 basis point increase over the prior year.","The addition of neuromodulation to what was the Rhythm Management standalone segment to create Rhythm and Neuro does not materially change the current profile or future outlook for these businesses. The teams continue to leverage strong top line results in all three businesses and make strong progress on gross margin through favorable S-ICD and Resonate portfolio product mix in CRM, focus plant network optimization, as well as manufacturing efficiencies. In addition, we are seeing results from the strong focus on expense controls and leveraging ongoing commercial synergies. The addition of Neuromodulation is slightly dilutive now to the segment, but over the next couple of years, margins are expected to be similar to where Rhythm Management margins were. And as a result, the prior goal of increasing Rhythm Management operating margin by 300 to 400 basis points by 2020 is still a reasonable goal for this combined segment.","The MedSurg segment, now comprised Endoscopy and Urology\/Pelvic Health also realized significant year over year operating margin improvements of 290 basis points in the quarter, delivering 36.4% on a comparable basis. Even as we made investments in commercial capabilities for ongoing launches across both businesses, these were more than offset by leverage from strong topline performance and cost containment initiatives.","In the Cardiovascular segment, operating margin increased 380 basis points year over year, but when you consider the LOTUS charges in Q1 last year, it's actually down slightly, primarily due to the investment in our structural heart franchise.","Now I'll move below the line to interest and other expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $61 million, compared to $57 million in Q1 of last year. Our average interest expense rate was 4.1% in Q1 this year, slightly higher than the 4.0% in Q1 of last year, as a result of our recent public offering of $1 billion aggregate principal amount, 4% senior notes due March 1, 2028. With the proceeds of this offering in the quarter, we repaid certain short-term commercial paper balances and $600 million of 2.65% notes that were coming due in October of 2018.","Adjusted other expense was $18 million in the first quarter, and primarily included dilution from our equity method investment, adjustments to our available for sale investments, as well as foreign exchange losses related to our hedging program.","Our tax rate for the first quarter was 8% on a reported basis and 13.2% on an adjusted basis, which was at the low end of our guidance range of 13% to 14%. As expected, our underlying operational tax rate was approximately 16%, and we realized a net benefit from stock compensation accounting of approximately 260 basis points in the quarter and still expect the full year benefit from stock comp to be approximately 100 basis points.","Finally, Q1 2018 adjusted earnings per share of $0.33 includes approximately $0.01 of unfavorable FX and represents 14% year over year growth, or 19% growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.","On a reported GAAP basis, which includes net charges and amortization expenses totaling $157 million after tax, Q1 2018 earnings per share was $0.21. We ended with 1,397 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $283 million, compared to $167 million in Q1 2017. In the quarter, we used cash primarily to fund previously agreed upon legal settlements, as well as business development activities, namely the investment in Millipede. We continue to expect 2018 adjusted free cash flow to be approximately $1.9 billion.","We continue to make good progress on our mesh litigation and still expect to make cash payments of approximately $800 million to fund the settlement of the remaining legal reserves related to the mesh litigation. We have now reached conditional, final or near final settlement on approximately 95% of all known claims, as we continue to reduce the risk on our balance sheet and target a resolution of the majority of our mesh claims in 2018.","Our total legal reserve, of which mesh is included, was $1,511 million as of March 31, 2018. As a reminder, this liability is released from our balance sheet as payments are made out of the qualified settlement fund, into which we've already made payments in prior quarters. In addition, finalizing the IRS stipulation of settled issues for the 2001 to 2010 tax years remains on track, and we currently believe that it will be finalized during Q2, 2018. We still expect to make net cash payments of approximately $600 million around mid-year, and we will also adjust our balance sheet to reflect the final settlement in the quarter in which that occurs.","If our timeline holds, we would expect to record a tax benefit in Q2, for both GAAP and adjusted earnings consistent with the manner in which the tax reserves were originally booked. However, to the extent that we have a tax benefit for adjusted earnings, we are exploring strategies to reinvest that tax benefit into our tax structure, with the goal of reducing our overall operational tax rate in 2019 and beyond, below our previously announced goal of 15%.","As a result, we do not expect that any tax benefit resulting from finalizing the IRS settlement will cause a modification to our full year adjusted EPS guidance. This $800 million estimated payment for mesh settlements combined with our expected $600 million payment as a result of finalizing our disputes with the Internal Revenue Service requires approximately $1.4 billion of cash flow for the year to settle our remaining significant existing contingencies. Capital expenditures for the first quarter 2018 were $60 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $325 million for the year, as we build capacity, integrate acquisitions and drive growth.","I'll now walk through guidance for Q2 and full year 2018. For the full year we expect consolidated 2018 revenue to be in the range of $9,750 million to $9,900 million, which represents year over year growth of 5% to 7% on an organic basis, with an additional 40 basis point contribution from the Symetis acquisition. We expect foreign exchange to be a tailwind of approximately $200 million to $225 million for the full year 2018.","We continue to expect our adjusted gross margin for the year as a percentage of sales to be approximately 72% for the full year, which now assumes a negative FX impact of 120 basis points or 10 basis points greater than prior guidance. We have also considered the recent proposed tariffs between the U.S. and China in our adjusted gross margin guidance. We do not manufacture in China, but we do purchase a small percentage of component inventory from China, so there may be slight pressure on our cost of goods sold, if U.S. tariffs are applied to Chinese manufactured goods. However, we also may have the ability to substitute some of those products and we expect we can manage the impact.","For goods imported to China, it appears there will not be an impact from the China 301 list because there are no devices currently on that list. We will continue to monitor developments, but as of today, we do not expect a significant impact to our business.","We continue to expect full year adjusted SG&A to be in the range of 34.5% to 35% of sales as we're seeing the benefits of operating expense control programs currently underway and there's also no change to expectations for full year adjusted R&D spend in a range of 10% to 11% and full year royalty rate to remain at slightly less than 1% of sales for 2018. This implies a full year 2018 adjusted operating margin in a range of 25.5% to 25.75%, which remains consistent with the improvement goals we outlined at an investor conference on January 9 and sets us up well to deliver on our long-term goal of 28% adjusted operating margin in 2020.","We continue to expect our 2018 operational tax rate to be between 14% and 15% and our adjusted rate to reflect an additional approximately 100 basis points of benefit from the accounting standard for stock compensation, of which the majority was recognized in our Q1 tax rate. We expect below the line expenses, which include interest payments, dilution from our venture capital portfolio, and costs associated with our hedging program to be approximately $300 million for the year and a fully-diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1,398 million shares for Q2 and 1,401 million shares for full year 2018. As a result of the improved revenue growth outlook and Q1 outperformance, we are raising full year 2018 adjusted earnings per share from a range of $1.35 to $1.39 now to a range of $1.37 to $1.41, representing 9% to 12% adjusted earnings growth. On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.90 to $0.94.","Now turning to Q2 2018, we expect consolidated revenue to be in a range of $2,450 million to $2,500 million. This represents year-over-year organic growth in a range of 5% to 7% with an additional 70 basis point operational growth contribution from Symetis, which we will anniversary at the end of May. We expect the foreign exchange impact on Q2 revenue will be a $60 million to $70 million tailwind. For the second quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.33 to $0.35 per share, representing 3% to 10% growth, and GAAP EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.21 to $0.23 per share. Please check Our Investor Relations website for Q1 2018 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q1 results as well as Q2 and full-year 2018 guidance, including P&L line item guidance.","So, with that I'll turn it back to Susie who will moderate the Q&A.","Susan Vissers Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thanks, Dan. Greg, let's open it up to questions for the next 30 minutes or so. In order to enable us to take as many as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. Greg, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Maybe one for Dan on guidance and then maybe one for Mike on some segments. Dan, just beyond the quarter it does look like getting back to 6% organic growth across the next several quarters does look, frankly, very achievable by our model. So, how do you see the rest of the year playing out across the quarters? And what could drive the low end of the 5% to 7% guidance for the second quarter as the comps get easier? And then a quick follow-up for Mike.","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah, I would say the momentum coming out of the first quarter is solid, as we said, across the majority of the businesses and regions, which is the biggest reason that led us to take the increase up to 5% to 7% for the second quarter and 5% to 7% for the year. So we're very comfortable with that range as we look at the quarter and the full year. As Mike outlined, some of the areas that we see pressure in DES and in pacer, those are probably some of the things that could put you towards that low end of the range, if those didn't go our way, but that's not what we're anticipating based on the ranges that we have and the momentum that we have in the global diversified business that is Boston Scientific.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Very clear. And, Mike, if there are two segments that stuck out to us this quarter from a momentum perspective, they obviously were Neuro, which is very good, and IC, which is a little less so. But you gave some great detail on Neuro, so I guess I'll focus on Interventional Cardiology. If there was one area of apprehension to the year, it was obviously in IC. So can you discuss the pressures you're seeing in stents, if any? And then relative to ACURATE, that's the other kind of tale of a different city. ACURATE's sequential performance was very strong and the guidance implies, I think, another meaningful step up, frankly, into the second quarter. So if you could talk about what you're seeing in stents and what you think is driving this pretty rapid change in momentum for ACURATE. Thanks so much.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah. So overall, I would say we're quite pleased with our first quarter IC performance. It was really in line with what we expected. Just a couple broader points. Kevin and the team continue to rapidly diversify that business globally. Our complex coronary business will likely be equal to the size of our DES business, probably end of 2019, and then you have a rapid growing structural heart business on top of that. So, that business continues to diversify significantly beyond DES over the years here.","You know, within DES itself, continues to be a key cash driver for the company to enable us to invest in structural heart and other initiatives. I think the good news there is you're seeing growth in Europe. So, after all the trialing of lots of competitive different offerings, you've seen low-single-digit growth in Europe. We anticipated softness in the U.S. in first quarter and through the full year due to some tougher comps in DES, but also competitive trialing, but we like our long-term prospects in DES of new products coming plus the growth over in Europe.","I think the stars that are getting larger and larger, which continue to kind of reshape the composite mix of IC, are complex coronary and structural heart. WATCHMAN continues to do extremely well. We're on track to deliver the $400 million of structural heart guidance. The utilization of WATCHMAN continues to increase, and we also are enrolling in our next gen WATCHMAN device in Europe and we'll start that in the second quarter here in the U.S.","ACURATE, really pleased with that. Sometimes you do acquisitions and this integration's been like five stars across the board. Our supply chain team has tripled production. We have next generation ACURATE. We'll launch in the second half with an advanced seal. We'll enroll that at the full clinical trial, SCOPE I and SCOPE II. And we'll launch the U.S. IDE shortly here. So that team really is delivering. And that's against in some markets where we're not approved yet. We're not approved for reimbursement yet in France. So, we're very bullish on ACURATE and WATCHMAN, complex coronary and we feel like we'll manage the near-term headwinds in DES. And if Europe's an indicator, that will get back to growth. But that's all been contemplated in the guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Oh, thanks and good morning and congrats on a great start to the year. I wanted to start with a product question, if okay. Because one thing that stuck out to me was on the defibrillator, or ICD side, very impressive results despite a tough comp. So I guess my question on the ICD side is, is the market getting better at all? Or is this all your replacement cycle kicking in and that share gains from things like HeartLogic and just the new platforms?","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","I think the market's been pretty consistent over the past probably one or two years. I think we just have very strong portfolio in defib. The product that gets the least amount of attention that continues to grow double-digit is S-ICD. So that platform has become quite significant in terms of dollar revenue and is growing strongly in all major markets: U.S., Europe, and Asia-Pac. And we have some additional enhancements to further simplify that product coming and some additional clinical data. So, that's ICD. For some reason, it floats a bit under the radar. But that's a terrific driver for us, as well as a mix driver. And then Resonate, the new platform there, that was years in the development, probably seven years of development with our HeartLogic diagnostic tool. And that's providing very unique competitive differentiation. So, that and then the replacement cycle, we talked about that contributing maybe a point of growth and that's in line. So, I think it's very strong portfolio and execution by our global CRM team.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you for that. That's very helpful. One other thing I wanted to ask about, obviously one of the things that happened over the course of the last three to four months is that you guys have executed on a number of smaller but important transactions. So, I just wanted to ask, relating to those three or four deals, just when do you think we could start to see real revenue contribution from those deals? Is that 2020 or will it take a little longer?","And then from a financial perspective, how do these deals impact the margin goals that you guys have laid out? In other words, how much dilution are you offsetting? So, just on the deals, when is the revenue growth contribution coming? And just maybe talk about the impact of those deals on margins.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Sure. So, Dan can touch on the margins. So, these are five deals, two that are more to further strengthen our core. And these two are quite small; the EmCision deal in Endo and Securus and you'll see a little bit of revenue from those. You'll see revenue from those, I should say, in 2019. And then three maybe more strategic and larger opportunities are all in either adjacent markets that are high growth, or new white space. And Millipede, clearly a larger investment where we have the option to acquire that. Both parties do, actually. That would be a longer-term play, given the mitral repair market and the clinical requirements there. So you're not going to see any revenue in 2019 and 2020 from Millipede. But NxThera and nVision, two really exciting opportunities in, call it either adjacent markets or white space. You'll see some revenue with NxThera in 2018, and we expect some strong momentum out of NxThera in 2019, and similarly in nVision. There will be a little bit of revenue in 2018 and stronger contribution in 2019.","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","And in terms of the margin, Bob, simply put, all of that's contemplated in the 25.5% to 25.75% for the year and also, the 28% in 2020. To the extent that we do a deal that has any dilution in it, we make the appropriate tradeoffs to still deliver on the commitments and then obviously everything becomes accretive in the longer term. So, all contemplated within our goals that we establish.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, good morning, guys. Mike, can you give us a little bit more color on WATCHMAN? And the reason I'm asking is ACURATE is doing very well. But you didn't change your $400 million structural heart guidance. So I just want to make sure that you're pleased with WATCHMAN here in the first quarter, given no change to the $400 million guide.","And then as my second question, can you just remind us of the trial design for ACURATE in the U.S. IDE trial? Thanks.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Sure. Couldn't be more pleased with the progress that WATCHMAN's making globally. We didn't take our number up. We do think there potentially could be some upside. So we'll see what happens later in the year with that number. But it's doing extremely well. The bulk of the growth is in the U.S., but we're also expanding into China. And we're also excited about the clinical trial completion in Japan, which will be a very big market that will launch in the second half of next year.","So for us, what's the most important metric is utilization rate. So we open up new centers, but the new center openings slow down over time given the presence that we already have. So it's really about the safety profile, great outcomes, and utilization. And we continue to see an increase in utilization rates across our base of existing centers.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then just some color on the U.S. trial for ACURATE, which I believe is going to start sometime in the second half.","Ian T. Meredith - Boston Scientific Corp.","Hi, Glenn, it's Ian Meredith. Thank you for the question. So the U.S. ACURATE IDE trial will be a randomized trial of extreme high and immediate risk patients. Approximately 500 patients. And it will be a comparison against any commercially available valve, which will be either the Edwards SAPIEN 3 valve or indeed the Medtronic Evolut R or PRO platforms. So 500 patients, randomized to either of those two, and we will leverage the SCOPE 1 and SCOPE 2 data sets to put together a larger package as a consequence of that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Mike, very nice quarter and I've really been impressed by the balance of the company. One of the things that was really exciting to me at the investor conference was the opportunity you're exploring in endoluminal surgery. BSX made an investment this quarter and I was wondering whether you or Ian could comment on that particular technology that you purchased and the likely trajectory, the broader opportunity. And I have a follow-up up on TAVR.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Great. Thank you. So I think this is very consistent across all of our businesses is growing our core markets, our traditional ones in biliary and others, for example, in hemostasis and Endo, but then branching off into faster growth and new innovative markets. And the acquisitions that we tick through really support that in new adjacencies and new white space, so we can deliver significantly above peer growth for the long term.","Specifically to endoscopy, endoluminal surgery is a investment that we've been making for multiple years under Dave Pierce's leadership and now Art Butcher. We see a large opportunity to, over time, move more general surgery procedures over to less invasive interventional approaches. The team, for lack of a better word, has pulled together a toolkit of internal organic R&D efforts as well as maybe two or three small tuck-in deals to do that. And so, this Orise product allows us to get after esophageal cancer and other cancer interventional techniques to hopefully avoid general surgery.","And so, we think we're leading the way in terms of physician training in Japan. That's actually quite a bit more mature in this market and we'll do a lot of physician training in the U.S. I think over time here our goal is just to slowly help convert more general surgery procedures to less invasive interventional techniques. And we're pulling together the capabilities and the training to do that. So that'll continue to be another branch of growth for Endo beyond our pathology and infection prevention which are also recent new markets that they've moved into.","Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. And my question with regard to TAVR is we were struck by Edwards' commentary regarding the step down and the ex-U.S. market growth from lower 20s in the fourth quarter to low teens this quarter with a broader backdrop of price sensitivity in Europe. We realize there can be dramatic quarter-to-quarter variation, both the U.S. and ex-U.S. market growth for no real fundamental reason. But we just wanted to check with you or Ian as to whether you perceive the secular shift in ex-U.S. payer perspective as to their willingness to pay for TAVR amongst largely an elderly population, which is historically not treated, or to convert surgery, which tends to be cheaper ex-U.S., to TAVR. Any change that you've really seen or is this just one of those quarters?","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","I'll make that first comment maybe on just the market and then Ian can make some other comments. Clearly, we see more price sensitivity in Europe than we do in the U.S. There's more competitors in Europe than there are in the U.S. And we see more price variation by country. We're really on offense here. We're launching into new markets. We haven't been approved or reimbursed in some markets yet. So this is all new growth for us. And we have a terrific platform with ACURATE, with the next gen seal coming at very nice gross margin rate. And then we're optimistic on the progress with LOTUS as well. But Ian, do you have any other comments?","Ian T. Meredith - Boston Scientific Corp.","No. I'd only add, Bruce, that I don't think that there's really any evidence that there's a slowing of the uptake of transcatheter aortic valve for severe aortic stenosis in the elderly patients. I think the evidence is growing stronger all the time and there's widespread understanding of the value of this technology in reducing morbidity and mortality. So I see no reason to think that this would slow.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So one on EP, one on TAVR. Let me start with EP for Dr. Stein. So, next month at HRS, Dr. Stein, we're going to see the long awaited CABANA trial results. What are your thoughts on that? Do you think that if it misses the primary endpoint, it could hurt the afib ablation market? And if it makes the primary endpoint, do you think this market could even grow faster? Just any thoughts on that study, given its importance. And I had one follow-up on TAVR. Thanks","Kenneth Stein, M.D. - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah, Larry, I think we're all holding our breath to see what CABANA shows when it's released as a late breaker at HRS. I think it's always tough to speculate ahead of the data. My feel on the trial, it took so long for them to enroll and used such a variety of different technologies for mapping and for ablation, that my own view is if it turns out to be positive, I think it would be an accelerator for the market. I think if it's negative, it depends on how it's negative. But if it's a neutral result, just given the age of the trial and the early generation of technologies and variety of different approaches that were used, I don't think it would have too much of an impact.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's helpful. And then on \u2013 let me just ask on LOTUS. Mike, I did hear your comment a minute ago that you're optimistic on the progress of LOTUS, but my question is really around once you resolve, if you resolve the technical issues, you've stated that there are regulatory steps that you need to take. So, the question is really if you resolve the technical issues, what steps do you need to take to launch LOTUS in the U.S. and Europe? I think last year at TCT you indicated that you planned to conduct additional implants on Edge, I think before launching. Is that still the case? And I just want to throw it out there. In Europe, it seems you do have the upper hand on Edwards right now in the litigation. So, I know it's sensitive to comment on litigation, but what's stopping from you enjoining them there to kind of force a global settlement? Thanks for taking the questions, guys.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Sure. On LOTUS, there really is no change there. It's our intention and our goal is to bring LOTUS back to market in Europe and the U.S. in 2019. We made the commitment that we wouldn't comment on that until we passed the technical and testing hurdles that we require of ourselves internally. So, we'll keep you posted on that. And really, I wouldn't comment any further on clinical requirements in Europe or U.S. until we get through the quality and testing that needs to be done.","On Edwards litigation, really no further comments there. We're pleased with the really strong outcomes that we've seen in Europe on the litigation front. But I wouldn't comment any further.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy from Leerink. Please go ahead. Danielle, your line is open. Please check your mute button.","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Oh. Hello. Good morning, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Our pleasure, Danielle.","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Can you hear me okay? Sorry about that.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yes, we can hear you fine.","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks so much. I just had a question on \u2013 can you give a little bit more color about the combination of the CRM and Neuromod businesses and what this can ultimately do? I know you said Neuromod was dilutive to the operating margins. But does this make you feel incrementally better about improving margins in the CRM business as well? And what is the new sort of bar set for that business from an operating margin perspective?","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah, Danielle, this is Dan. I had a little bit of this in the prepared remarks around the overall goal. So what we used to talk about was kind of a 23% for the old Rhythm Management segment, and that's kind of still \u2013 23% plus is still where we would see the Rhythm and Neuro segment going. It was a little over 20% here in Q1. So there are some good synergies and advantages to bringing the active implantables together, as Mike had mentioned, to bring the Rhythm and Neuro segments together. But at the margin level, I think we're on track for where we said this year and on track for the 28% for 2020.","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up question. I mean obviously in 2019, you'll be entering that year with a lot more flexibility on the balance sheet and I was just wondering if you could give any color at a high level on how you're thinking about potentially deploying that capital going forward. Thanks so much.","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah, it definitely is an inflection point for us. We'll have much better ability to deploy our capital than we would have over the last really five, six, seven years as we get into 2019 and 2020. But I don't think we change the playbook at that point. It's still about category leadership. It's still about being as deep in each of the verticals that we have and supporting that. You've seen an example of that, as Mike ticked through the deals we have done here and either closed or announced in Q1. And just because there's more cash available, relative to 2019 and 2020, I think the strategy remains the same.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking the question. Let's start on TAVR and just follow up, Mike, on your territories where you have not received reimbursement. To start, I was hoping to just hear any type of cadence you can help us with. You mentioned France I think in 2020. What are the other key regions where you're seeking reimbursement approval? And then maybe [Technical Difficulty] (53:41) that. And then also just with the Symetis sequential improvement, can you just help us understand where you're having the greatest success? Is that with going deeper into historic LOTUS accounts or is it a combination of that and new customer capture?","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Sure. I'll comment on the first one. There's really not much to say. On the first one, there's really not much to comment on other than the France reimbursement comment I made in 2020. Really in Europe, beyond the French reimbursement, it's been a matter of us scaling up production, which we continue to do successfully, training our clinical team and commercial team on ACURATE. And we continue to make a lot of progress there and build momentum. And we're confident we'll continue to see strong growth out of ACURATE. But we'll be selling into most major markets in Europe, with the exception of France, without reimbursement. And then we'll be hopefully enrolling, as part of the U.S. trial, Japan as well, in the future for ACURATE.","So that's probably the only comment I can make on it. We just continue to invest in the platform on the portfolio side, on the clinical capabilities. And we are seeing growth, not only in existing customers who are using it more often, but also in new customer accounts as well. We've had particular success in the UK and the Nordics and we're continuing to build up our capabilities in Germany.","Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks for that. And then just a question for Dan on the margin guidance. Stronger than expected performance in Q1, increase in the top line guide. I know you laid some of this out already in your prepared remarks, but I was hoping it might be helpful to help us walk through I think it's why you can't see even stronger [Technical Difficulty] (55:35) 2018 guidance range. Thanks for taking the questions.","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah, Josh, you were breaking up a little bit at the end, but I think it's on 2018 guidance and why can't it be a little bit higher. At the 25.5% to 25.75%, feel like that's appropriate guidance. Gross margin was a little hot in Q1 at 72.3%. You'll see from the guide we have that at a 71.75% for Q2. There's a little bit more sequential pressure relative to FX on gross margin. So we still think 72% is the right number there. So there's not, I don't think, a ton of upside on that front. We did give the EPS upside from the additional sales for the year of raising the range up to 7%. There's a piece of that in the EPS guide up to $1.37 to $1.41. So, feel like the 25.5% to 25.75% at this point in the year is an appropriate guide, given the top line raise and the bottom line raise.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Wise from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everybody. Maybe I'll focus on some CRM questions at this point. Mike, you highlighted S-ICD as maybe being underappreciated. And yeah, we're four or five years in, you're still growing solid double-digits, the evolution of technology, more favorable guidelines. How sustainable is this kind of growth? What's next? Maybe just update us on your thoughts about \u2013 some of the early days the thought was S-ICDs would only be useful in maybe 10%, 15% of patients. Do you see it as a larger opportunity? And is it pulling through ICD business? Is that helping that part of the business as well, just that double offering?","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","I can answer, but Dr. Stein's probably more qualified to answer.","Kenneth Stein, M.D. - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thanks a lot, Mike. I'm not sure about that. Yeah, Rick. I think the biggest opportunity for continued growth with S-ICD is continuing to penetrate into the traditional primary prevention market for single-chambered defibrillators. And again, you're right. The primary prevention market is the single largest market for ICDs in the U.S. and globally. And there are a number of upcoming data releases that are going to help us push that forward, as well as product releases. And so I'd highlight for everyone a late-breaking trial that's going to be presented at HRS in Boston that shows the impact of the new detection algorithm we have in a device on inappropriate shock rates. Then we're going to have eventually the release of the PRAETORIAN head-to-head trial of S-ICD versus transvenous ICD, as well as the results of our UNTOUCHED trial, specifically in primary prevention patients. And then beginning in 2019, we'll be starting clinical trials of our modular CRM offering; leadless pacemaker that's capable to communicate with the S-ICD, that in our view reduces a lot of the barriers among physicians who haven't yet adopted the device for primary prevention.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. It's great. And then just last for me on defibrillated, given again, the strong ICDs, great products, S-ICD, I'm not sure I fully understand why brady was weak and why it remains weak for the rest of the year. I know you had a tough comp in the first quarter. What are you doing, Mike, to make it better and do we have to wait until 2019 for better results there? Thanks.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah. So on brady, it's been in line with what we expected. We do have some tough comps. We had very tough comps in the first quarter. We had tough comps again second quarter and they get a bit easier in the second half of the year. So, there's a lot of efforts there. We have a couple product gaps that we're trying to fill on CRTP with MRI. That's in process that we're confident we'll move forward with. We are seeing a little bit of impact on leadless pacemaking in some markets. So there's a few product gaps that we're working to fill and some difficult comps. But we really feel like when we give guidance, we give guidance to execute upon it. We've had a really good track record on that. And a bit softer pacemaker result is anticipated in that guidance and well offset by the defib performance.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks.","Susan Vissers Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.","Okay.

Please go ahead.","Susan Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thank you, Tanya. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q2 2017 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release, as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call, to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financial Information.","The duration of our call will be approximately one hour.

These statements speak only as of today's date and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them.","At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Thanks, Mike.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thank you, Susie, and good morning, everyone. Boston Scientific delivered strong results again in second quarter 2017, organic revenue growth up 6% and operational revenue growth up 7%. We're ahead of both expectations and underlying market growth rates. It was an excellent quarter in light of a challenging 10% organic revenue growth comparison in second quarter of 2016. These results are also a reflection of our strong execution and success of our category leadership strategy. We leveraged that 7% revenue growth to deliver 18% adjusted EPS growth, or $0.32 per share and $0.01 above Wall Street Consensus. If you exclude the $0.02 negative impact of foreign exchange, adjusted EPS grew 24% year-over-year.","Key to this very high level of EPS growth was a 260 basis point year-over-year improvement in adjusted operating margin to 26%, led by a strong 72.8% gross margin result, and a 40 basis point reduction year-over-year in SG&A spending to 35.5% of revenue.","Also, as detailed at our Investor Day last month, we aim to deliver this type of consistent revenue growth and double-digit adjusted EPS growth over the long term. We continue to enhance the growth profile of the company, with plans to enter into $13 billion in new high-growth markets across our businesses over the next few years. Importantly, we believe Boston Scientific continues to be uniquely positioned to drive shareholder value and differentiated EPS growth due to our revenue growth profile, opportunity to improve operating margins, and a strengthening balance sheet.","We're also excited about the second half of 2017 and our plans to build upon our global momentum, and drive sustainable long-term growth in 2018 and beyond. We're raising our full-year 2017 operational revenue growth guidance to an estimated 7% growth with a 6% to 8% range, which includes an approximate 120 basis point full-year contribution from the EndoChoice and Symetis acquisitions. We're also raising our full-year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.01 from the previous range of $1.22 to $1.26, to a revised range of $1.23 to $1.27, representing 11% to 14% earnings growth. Importantly, this revised EPS guidance includes an expected $0.08 negative impact, or approximate 700 basis point headwind, from foreign exchange.","I'll now provide some highlights on Q2 2017 results and thoughts on our second-half 2017 outlook. In my remarks, all references to growth are on organic, year-over-year, constant-currency basis unless otherwise specified. Our Q2 organic revenue growth of 6% continues to be broad based across our product lines, with most of our businesses growing faster than the underlying markets. MedSurg grew an impressive 10%, Cardiovascular 5%, and Rhythm Management 3%. We also delivered a strong balanced organic growth across geographies, led by 7% revenue growth in the U.S. and EMEA, 14% in emerging markets, and 20% growth specifically in China. In Europe, our business was impacted from the LOTUS recall, yet they still delivered 2% growth in the quarter.","Turning to a few MedSurg highlights, the three MedSurg businesses delivered an impressive 10% organic revenue growth and 12% operational growth, including the recently acquired EndoChoice. In Endoscopy, organic revenue grew 7% in the quarter, and 12% including acquisition, led by the strength of our franchises in hemostasis, pathology and endoluminal surgery. Of note, in hemostasis we're seeing faster-than-expected conversion to our new Resolution 360 Clip platform, which led to mid-teens growth for the franchise. Regionally, Endo results were particularly strong in the U.S. and Latin America. Seven months after closing the EndoChoice acquisition, we have completed the sales integration, and revenue is slightly ahead of plan, contributing to 80 basis points of total growth in the quarter.","We continue to be pleased with the results from our expanding presence in pathology, infection control and prevention, and the Ambulatory Surgery Center market. Additionally, our recently signed agreement with Total Scope allows us to offer convenient scope repair services to this important customer base. Our Uro and Pelvic Health businesses continue the strong performance that grew 10% in the quarter, led by our single-usage digital LithoVue Ureteroscope and products to treat men's health and pelvic floor conditions. This 10% growth is particularly impressive considering an 18% growth comparison in second quarter 2016. So overall, the Uro health business grew double-digit in the U.S., EMEA, and Latin America. And the emerging markets sales were also very strong, led by our stone and men's health franchises.","LithoVue remains an important driver for our Urology business, providing single-use digital visualization and navigation capability to diagnose and treat stones and other conditions of the kidney, ureter, while avoiding the needs for repairs or sterilization that can be a very big challenge with reusable scopes. LithoVue is now in more than 900 accounts worldwide, and we're seeing faster growth and pull-through of our core kidney stone business with customers that are using LithoVue.","We continue to see important research studies that support the trend toward single-use systems, which bodes well for the longer term outlook. And the FDA has also recently determined that manufacturers of certain reusable medical devices now need to include validation data regarding cleaning, disinfection and sterilization. We remain very encouraged by the LithoVue opportunity.","Turning to neuromod. Revenue in neuromodulation grew 14% in the second quarter, driven by multiple new product launches, including the Montage MRI System and the Artisan full-body MRI paddle and spinal cord stimulation, as well as their Vercise Gevia MRI deep brain stimulation system in Europe. Gevia features our Neural Navigator 2 with STIMVIEW Technology, which allows clinicians to visualize the stimulation field while customizing DBS stimulation programs for patients. We expect to launch into the U.S. DBS market by year-end 2017 or early 2018, followed by a traditional \u2013 followed by our directional lead in MRI conditioning label in 2018.","It's really an exciting time in spinal cord stimulation, as we recently published a Lumina 24-month data, and the PROCO randomized control trial data was presented at INS. The PROCO data showed that frequency is not a determining factor in spinal cord stimulation pain relief. 1 kilohertz therapy had equivalent results to 10 kilohertz, and Boston Scientific's Precision Spectra uses 1 kilohertz, and thus uses two-thirds less energy than high frequency systems with the equivalent outcomes for pain relief. This reinforces the need and benefit for flexible technology platforms like Spectra that can enable physicians to customize therapy for the unique pain patients.","Turning to our cardiovascular group, the cardiovascular group grew 5% in the second quarter of 2017 against a very tough 13% growth comparison in second quarter of 2016. So starting off with our PI business, Peripheral Interventions in the quarter grew 7%, particularly strong performance in Asia and Europe, led by sales of our stent portfolio, our next-generation Innova Stent for the SFA, Drug-Eluting Eluvia Stent in Europe, and WALLSTENT. We also saw strong growth from our Atherectomy Jetstream platform and a promising initial launch of our Opticross Intravascular Ultrasound platform for peripheral applications. Drug-Eluting technologies contributed nicely to European growth, and in the U.S., enrollment in the IDE trial for our Ranger DCB continues on pace. We also await 12-month follow-up in the IMPERIAL trial for our Eluvia Drug-Eluting Stent.","In Interventional Cardiology, that business grew second quarter organic revenue 4% and operational revenue of 5%, despite the impact of the LOTUS recall in Europe. Our growth was led by strong sales of our WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure device, mid-teens revenue growth in PCI guidance. mid single-digit growth in complex PCI, and early contributions from the Symetis ACURATE platform in Europe.","The WATCHMAN platform had another excellent quarter and continues to build global momentum. We're focused on market development activities such as deploying therapy awareness reps, increasing our medical education programs, social media outreach, and direct-to-patient awareness programs. We remain on track in 2017 with 350 to 375 U.S. centers. We also achieved an important clinical milestone with WATCHMAN by completing enrollment in SALUTE trial. This trial is specifically designed to pursue regulatory approval in Japan. And we target mid-2019 Japan approval for WATCHMAN.","Global DS sales in the quarter were up 1% despite a challenging 9% growth comparison in second quarter 2016, led by our differentiated SYNERGY platform. Products for complex PCI procedures grew in the upper mid single-digits, led by strong Atherectomy and Cutting Balloon sales. Our PCI Guidance business continues to build momentum with strong IVUS sales and the launch of our integrated fractional flow reserve platform. On LOTUS, LOTUS remediation work remains on track. We expect LOTUS to return to the EU market by year-end 2017, and a fourth quarter submission of our U.S. PMA for regulatory approval in the U.S. We continue to estimate a mid-2018 launch in the U.S.","Nine weeks post-closing, we're on track with our Symetis integration plans, including training of our Euro TAVR field reps on the ACURATE valve platform. As highlighted at our recent Investor Day conference, we believe that our company will be uniquely and ideally positioned to address the needs of physicians and patients with our differentiated TAVR portfolio. There is no change to our clinical trial priorities, including pursuing ACURATE in the U.S. and Japan and a LOTUS intermediate risk indication. We will aim to provide more details of our TAVR clinical plans in the coming months.","We're also very well positioned in the faster (12:57) structural heart market with our strong momentum in LAAC and potential for share-taking in TAVR, via both ACURATE and LOTUS. We're also raising our expected 2017 structural heart revenue guidance from $250 million to approximately $275 million to reflect the revenue impact from the Symetis acquisition, which closed in May.","Shifting to Rhythm Management, global CRM sales grew 2%, which outpaced the challenging worldwide market growth of the industry. Our focus on Rhythm Management profitability has really paid off, resulting in extremely strong adjusted operating margin of 20.9%, which is up 720 basis points year-over-year, which Dan will detail in a few minutes.","As for product trends, Brady sales grew mid-single digits and we continue to gain share. However, our growth did slow a bit from prior quarters due to the anniversary of our ACCOLADE MRI Brady platform, as well as a competitor's launch. We also saw very strong growth globally in EMBLEM S-ICD, our Quad X4 CRT-P, and encouraging initial launch feedback of our new RESONATE platform in Europe, as well as a slight uptick in CRT-D replacement cycle sales consistent with our replacement curve models. We have submitted clinical data from our navel MRI study to FDA, and continue to expect to launch our transvenous MRI-compatible high voltage system in the U.S. by year end.","Turning to EP, we grew sales 13% in the quarter, led by improved uptake of our new Rhythmia HDx platform. We continue to roll out the HDx platform in Europe, and now in the U.S. and Japan. We look forward to launching our IntellaNav MiFi Open-Irrigated Catheter, Therapeutic Catheter \u2013 wow \u2013 IntellaNav MiFi Open-Irrigated Therapeutic Catheter in the EU and U.S. in third quarter, as well as beginning a limited market evaluation of our DirectSense technology in the EU, as enabled by our new software upgrade for Rhythmia.","So to wrap up, Boston Scientific's portfolio strategy, our globalization efforts, and execution of our global teams, continues to work, and we continue to deliver strong and differentiated results. We believe we are poised for an exciting second half of 2017, and that we are well positioned to continue our performance track record in 2018 and beyond. I really want to thank our employees again for their winning spirit and strong commitment to the company, and Advancing Science for Life.","Dan will now provide a detailed review of our financials.","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thanks, Mike. Second quarter consolidated reported revenue of $2.257 billion represents 6% growth on both a reported and organic basis, and 7% on an operational basis, which excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency. This strong top line also reflects a $23 million headwind from foreign exchange, which is $12 million or approximately 55 basis points less compared to a $35 million headwind expected at the time of guidance. The contribution from the recent acquisitions was approximately 120 basis points, which was higher than our guidance of 70 basis points as a result of the strong performance of the Pathology business acquired with the EndoChoice deal, and sales from the recently closed Symetis acquisition that was not included in guidance.","After adjusting for the performance of the acquisitions, we still exceeded our 5% to 6% operational guidance range on slightly stronger results from the core businesses. We delivered Q2 adjusted earnings per share of $0.32, representing 18% year-over-year growth and at the high end of our guidance range of $0.30 to $0.32.","I'll walk through the details of the results and guidance in a moment, but we're pleased to have exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range, and as a result are increasing our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance to $1.23 to $1.27 range. Adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 72.8%, compared to 70.7% in Q2 of last year, and includes a year-over-year negative 50 basis point impact from foreign exchange.","Adjusted gross margin for the quarter represents a 210 basis point increase over prior year, and was at the high end of our guidance range due to favorable product mix in the quarter, particularly from the strength in WATCHMAN and men's health franchises. We continue to expect our full-year gross margin to be in the range of 72% to 72.5%, which now assumes a negative FX impact of 100 basis points for the year, a slight increase from the full year 2017 outlook we gave in April.","Adjusted SG&A expenses were $801 million, or 35.5% of sales in Q2 2017, down 40 basis points year over year and at the midpoint of our guidance range of 35% to 36%. We're delivering on our SG&A improvement initiatives outlined in detail at our recent Investor Day, such as the optimization and expansion of our global shared services, and global indirect sourcing leverage. We continue to target full-year 2017 adjusted SG&A in a range of 35% to 36% of sales, which at the midpoint would represent a decrease of 60 basis points versus the full year 2016.","Adjusted research and development expenses were $239 million in the second quarter, or 10.6% of sales, which is roughly flat year over year. We continue to expect full-year adjusted R&D to be in a range of 10% to 11%, and continue to target a rate of less than 10% by 2020, driven by geographic mix, greater efficiencies and leverage.","Royalty expense was 0.8% of sales in Q2, which is similar to prior year, and we expect our royalty rate to remain approximately 1% of sales for 2017. As a result, Q2 2017 adjusted operating margin of 26% increased 260 basis points year over year, and was at the midpoint of our guidance range of 25.5% to 26.5%.","The improvement over prior year was largely driven by strong operational improvements in our Rhythm Management segment operating margin results. The Rhythm Management team delivered an adjusted operating margin of 20.9% for Q2, as the team continues to make strong progress on gross margin, focus on expense control, and leverage the improved top-line performance of the global business. As you would expect, in any given quarter you may see some variation in adjusted segment operating margin, but we now expect the full year 2017 Rhythm Management adjusted operating margin to be approximately 19% to 20%, which is an increase over our prior expectations of 18% to 19%.","The Cardiovascular and MedSurg segments also realized year-over-year improvements in adjusted operating margin of 40 basis points and a 110 basis points respectively, all while continuing to invest in commercial capabilities for key upcoming launches.","Now, I'll move on to interest and other expense. Interest expense for the quarter was $58 million, roughly flat to Q2 of last year. Our average interest expense rate was 3.9% in Q2 this year compared to 4% in Q2 last year. Adjusted other expense was $14 million in the second quarter, and includes $6 million in equity method dilution from our portfolio of venture investments. We believe this is representative of a go-forward run rate and annualizes to approximately $25 million per year. We still expect the full-year below-the-line expense, which is comprised of interest expense, dilution from our venture investment portfolio, and costs associated with our FX hedging program, to be approximately $300 million in both 2017 and 2018.","Of note, this excludes an impairment of certain of our investments of $53 million recorded in the quarter. As we mentioned at our Investor Day, we've grown our portfolio of venture investments to over 30 companies, and as you'd expect, we may see impairments from time to time, but we continue to be very excited about the portfolio.","Our tax rate for the second quarter was negative 60.3% on a reported basis, and 13.9% on an adjusted basis, at the high end of our guidance range of 13% to 14%. We continue to expect full-year adjusted tax rate to be in a range of 12.5% to 13%.","Finally, Q2 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $0.32 includes approximately $0.02 of unfavorable foreign exchange, as we expected, and represents 18% year-over-year growth, or 24% growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange.","On a reported GAAP basis, which includes net charges and amortization expense totaling $298 million, after tax, Q2 2017 EPS was $0.11. This is below our guidance range of $0.18 to $0.21, primarily due to litigation-related charges of $205 million associated with our mesh litigation. Our total legal reserve, of which mesh is included, was $1.779 billion as of June 30, 2017.","During the quarter, as we continued working through settlement discussions and the related claims processing related to our mesh litigation, more of the potential settlement claims were verified than previously expected. As a reminder, to determine our reserve, we continually assess the volume of known claims, the estimated cost to resolve each claim, an estimate of future claims, and the cost to defend each claim, in order to calculate the required reserve and make any necessary adjustments.","We have entered into or in the final stages of entering into master settlement agreements, in principle, with certain plaintiffs' counsel to resolve and an aggregate of approximately 38,000 of our approximately 48,000 known claims, which represents nearly 80% of those claims. We remain committed to reducing the risk in our balance sheet and continue to target a resolution of the majority of our remaining mesh claims in 2018.","Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $409 million, compared to $464 million in Q2 last year. In the quarter, we used cash primarily to fund previously-agreed-upon legal settlements as well as the Symetis acquisition. As of June 30, 2017, we had cash on hand of $195 million. We continue to expect full-year adjusted free cash flow to be $1.750 billion, representing 9% growth in the year, and expect the primary use of the cash generated in 2017 and into 2018 will be to fund mesh legal settlements and the IRS stipulation of settled issues, once finalized.","Capital expenditures for the second quarter 2017 totaled $68 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures for the full year to be approximately $300 million. We ended Q2 with 1.391 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding, and we expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.394 billion for Q3 and 1.393 billion for the full year 2017.","Now I'll now walk through the guidance for Q3 and the full year 2017. For the full year, we now expect consolidated revenue to be in a range of $8.890 billion to $8.990 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of approximately 7% on an operational basis, within a range of 6% to 8% growth. This guidance includes an approximate 120 basis point contribution from EndoChoice and Symetis, and represents 6% to 7% growth on a reported basis.","We now expect foreign exchange to be a headwind of approximately $30 million for the full year 2017. As I mentioned earlier, we now expect full-year 2017 adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.23 to $1.27, representing 11% to 14% adjusted earnings per share growth, and continue to assume the full-year negative impact of FX will be approximately $0.08. On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS to be in a range of $0.70 to $0.74.","Now turning to Q3 2017, we expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $2.180 billion to $2.210 billion. This represents year-over-year growth in a range of 5% to 6% operationally, including the approximate 140 basis point contribution from acquisitions. We expect the foreign exchange impact on Q3 revenue to be a $20 million headwind.","For the third quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.29 to $0.31 per share, representing 9% to 16% adjusted earnings growth. GAAP earnings per share for the third quarter is expected to be in a range of $0.16 to $0.18 per share. Please check our Investor Relations website for Q2 2017 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q2 results, as well as Q3 and full-year 2017 guidance, including P&L line item guidance.","So with that, I'll turn it back to Susie, who will moderate the Q&A.","Susan Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thanks, Dan. Tanya, let's open it up to questions for the next 30 minutes or so. In order to enable us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. Tanya, please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question we'll take will be from Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. And good morning, everybody. First off, congratulations on a, what was a very strong quarter on a tough comp. I did want to make sure I understood, Dan, the guidance for the year and your thoughts on the third quarter. It looked like, with the guidance update, that you're widening the organic sales growth range for the year from what had been 5.3% to 6.3%, to 4.8% to 6.8%. So, one, do we have that right, that actually the range on we would call organic growth, backing out EndoChoice and Symetis and currency, widened?","And then second, how do you view the third quarter comp, relative to the comp you had this quarter? Because obviously we all thought this was a pretty tough comp quarter for you guys, and you put up a very strong performance. Third quarter looks like another very tough comp for you guys. Just put it in some context, how you view the year-over-year comparison? Thanks.","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Sure, Mike. I'll start, and Mike can add in any comments he wants as well. So, relative to the guidance, I wouldn't overthink the range relative to the full year. So if you look at the range we have, the way we look at it is, 7% is what we think is a likely outcome, and we increased the top end to 8%. So as you look at it, we could have thrown a half in there and gone 6.5% to 7.5%. We chose to say 7% is the likely outcome, and just ranged it 100 basis points on either side. So I wouldn't overthink the ends of that range. Specific to comps for Q3, it's a 9% organic comp. It was 10% in Q2, and it's a 9% comp in Q3. So feel like, again, off of what are pretty heady comps from last year, the revenue growth range of 5% to 6% for Q3 is still pretty strong.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then can you spend a little more time on the men's health business? Because when you made that acquisition, we didn't view it as being a growth accretive acquisition; it's turned out to be one. It had a very strong quarter again this quarter and exceeded our expectations. Can you just talk a little bit about what's going on there?","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Sure. Good morning, Mike. The Uro business is really performing at a very high level for many number of quarters in a row now, a 10% revenue growth again in second quarter. And it's really across the board. The stone business is doing extremely well, and the catalyst for the stone business is that LithoVue disposable scope. That's very disruptive, and we see a lot of tailwinds, given some of the comments in the script regarding FDA requirements to putting on reusable scopes, as well as the healthcare economics that hospitals are starting to see in terms of the cost savings of using LithoVue. And LithoVue is enabling us to pull through greater stone share.","And then you move on to the other businesses, the men's health business is doing particularly well, really exceeding our expectations in the U.S. and globally, and that's a very strong gross margin product for us. The BPH business is doing okay. Another big catalyst for the Uro business is global expansion. Our emerging market growth is extremely, extremely strong, and we're investing in physician training in men's health, as well as adding commercials reps. So essentially having that full portfolio together is driving larger synergies on the bottom line, as well as incremental revenue synergies.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood. Okay, thank you, Mike.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. Next we go to the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Just \u2013 yeah, maybe a quick clarification and two quick product questions. Just in terms of the back half of your guidance, is a good way to think about it, basically you're kind of saying back half is sort of stable on a momentum basis, there's no underlying changes in most of the business lines, just the comp is harder, business is pretty stable; is that a good way to think about the second half?","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","I think that's fair, and then we're adding in Symetis, right? So we didn't have Symetis in guidance as of last quarter, so we're adding that in. We've obviously updated the structural heart guidance, but I think that's a fair way to look at it, yes, David.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then...","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","And then to add to that is..","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Sorry.","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","That is the right \u2013 a good summary. And particularly in Q3, we got very tough DES comp, so we have a 10% comp overall for the company, and our highest DES comp is in the third quarter \u2013 from 2016 \u2013 which is 14%.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Very helpful, Dan, and Mike. So two quick product questions. The first is just the EP business was the other business, other than urology, that looked like it got better on a momentum basis. Could you just talk about the trends in EP? And then just the early Symetis feedback, obviously taking the smaller business on your broader distribution channel, is some sense of how that's trending here? Even though I know it's early days? Thank you.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah. So, we are committed to this EP business, and we continue to \u2013 I hate to use the word \"slowly,\" but we are improving the platform and the product portfolio globally each quarter. And this new launch of this Rhythmia HDx platform has gone extremely well in Europe, and we're starting to roll that out a bit more now in Japan and the U.S., so it's giving physicians more confidence in the differentiation of Rhythmia.","And we'll be embarking on a nice cadence of therapeutic catheter launches, ideally in the second half in Europe with our IntellaNav MiFi OI launch, and that will be followed in 2018 with that same catheter, therapeutic catheter launch in the U.S. So you'll start to see more impactful therapeutic catheter launch cadence coming. Dr. Stein is here as well, any comment you'd like to make on that?","Kenneth Stein, M.D. - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah. The only thing I'd add, Dave, is that the IntellaNav's MiFi OI catheter, in combination with Rhythmia HDx, then becomes the foundational platform for our DirectSense technology, which we really do see as being revolutionary in enabling physicians to better assess tissue contact and type of tissue the catheter's in contact with, and that also becomes the foundation for our Force-Sensing technology as well.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","And \u2013 thanks, Ken, and \u2013 Dr. Stein. On the Symetis, we're really pleased, it's early days, we're just under two months. The integration's gone \u2013 going extremely well. The leadership team is in place and solidified there. We're focused on expanding supply, of the capability by ramping up manufacturing, and importantly, we're training all of our TAVR commercial team, clinical and commercial, on the ACURATE platform.","And so the great news is, when our LOTUS platform gets back in the market by year end, we'll have a clinical team and a sales force that can sell both platforms. So we're pleased with that, we upped our structural heart guidance a bit to $275 million, to reflect the impact of Symetis.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Next we go to the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping to just start off with a question back from the Investor Day just on the TAVR franchise and intermediate and low risk timelines. So the strategy behind waiting until 2019, I was just hoping you could just recap that and help us think about the start of those trials and the kind of strategy behind waiting till 2019?","Ian Meredith, M.D., Ph.D. - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thanks, Josh, this is Ian Meredith here. So, pleased to take your question. Obviously, the first and the highest priority is to have LOTUS Edge approved in the U.S. for extreme and high-risk patients, and we'll follow that with establishing a LOTUS Edge bicuspid valve registry. And then the immediate priority thereafter is high and extreme risk ACURATE approval in the U.S. and Japan. And of course our priorities hot on the tail of those immediate priorities would be intermediate and low-risk approval in U.S., Japan, for both ACURATE Symetis \u2013 the ACURATE neo\/IS platform, and indeed LOTUS Edge. So with those priorities structured that way, the highest priority obviously is to establish extreme and high risk approval for both valves as expeditiously and timely as can be achieved, and then the low-risk of course will be to follow the intermediate risk, as one would expect, it's likely to those trials would have to randomized.","Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks, Ian. And just on the follow up, the Endoscopy business, you made some comments, Mike, in your prepared remarks, but I was just hoping if there's anything else, your sequential growth for that business was phenomenal. It was one of the line items that we were little bit concerned about heading them into the quarter, but 6%, 7% sequential growth \u2013 were there any one-timers there, or is just still pure strength on SpyGlass adoption, utilization, and how sustainable is that type of sequential growth trend? Thanks a lot.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","That business performs for us each quarter, 12% operational, 7% organic, when you back out the acquisition that we made. And I think what's unique about this business is, there are core products continue to grow nicely, and they are expanding into new categories. The SpyGlass digital platform has really been a breakthrough for the company, and they continue to focus on additional enhancements to kind of extend the lead there. That pulls through some of the core portfolio. The EndoChoice acquisition has moved us into some new spaces where there's a lot of synergies, in the pathology market, and so \u2013 and then lastly it's a very global company, this business for us. Over half the sales are outside the U.S., and there's very strong growth there in emerging markets. So, we expect that Endo business to continue to put up strong above-market growth.","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thank you, Josh.","Operator","Thank you. Next we go to the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. Can we pause for a minute on your third quarter guidance? By our calculation, it looks like it's up 3.5% to 4.5%, 3.6% to 4.6% organic. Is that the right way to look at it, and if so, that's somewhat in the lower side than I would have expected. Am I looking at this right?","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Joanne, this is Dan. No, that the way I would look at it is, the guidance for Q3 is 5% to 6% operational growth. The contribution from the acquisitions of EndoChoice and Symetis is 140 basis points. So if you take that off, you get to an organic growth rate that \u2013 again, in the range of what you're saying. Some of the challenges there, in terms of the sequential growth from Q2 to Q3, you look at CRM; we anniversary some of the MRI-safe Brady technologies in the U.S. We love the growth we've had in urology, but at 18% and 10% and some very high comps there, with anniversarying some share gains from a competitor exit. And then Mike mentioned the DES comps that we have. So the organic piece is a little bit lower than Q2, but still at that 5% to 6% of that 9% comp from last year, and then another 10% comp in Q4, feel like that still stacks up pretty well compared to our peers.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah. I'd just add, a bit of a cheerleader here, but I think 6% to 8% full-year guidance, midpoint of 7%, pretty nicely above the peer group, against 9% or 10% organic growth comp for the year. So I think if we can grow the company faster than the peer group, facing that type of comparison, that's pretty strong. And then we look forward to 2018, and then as we detailed at Investor Day, the comps will be slightly easier in 2018 than there were this year. And then we're, as I've mentioned before, really excited about this $13 billion of new markets that we'll entering into. When you look at that Investor Day presentation, 2018 through to 2020. So I think it's a pretty strong performance for the team, delivering above market against a 10% comp.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Sounds good to me. As a follow-up question, WATCHMAN is really doing quite well. You raised your structural heart guidance. How do we think about the momentum in that franchise, and can you remind us about the timing of next generation products, how they start coming into the market to help you out? Thank you.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Sure. WATCHMAN is doing great. We \u2013 I think the most important thing is just the clinical success that that platform is seeing, the actual real implant success rates actually exceeding the safety rate seen in some of the clinical trials. So the performance, most importantly in the safety and efficacy, as detailed at HRS and EuroPCR clinical trials, at Dr. Stein can highlight a bit more if you're interested, are very good. So you're building physician confidence with the platform. We obviously took up our structural heart revenue guidance to $275 million, which is \u2013 a big part of that is WATCHMAN, obviously, given the LOTUS recall.","And a big part of our efforts beyond the safety and great outcomes is on market development. So we are building quite a few different swim lanes of digital capabilities, therapeutic reps to drive increased awareness, leveraging the broader commercial teams of our CRM, EP and IC teams to drive awareness and to assist the WATCHMAN sales team. And then we're looking at expanding globally, we're enhancing our contribution of WATCHMAN in China, and we're excited about bringing WATCHMAN to the Japanese market in mid-2019. On the next generation WATCHMAN product, likely to have EU approval in mid 2018 for the WATCHMAN and FLEX platform. Now, Dr. Stein, any other comments on WATCHMAN, in general?","Kenneth Stein, M.D. - Boston Scientific Corp.","Again, just to say, pleased as you say with the momentum, see it continuing as we can continue to train, bring new operators, new centers online. In terms of the clinical trial, cadence, as Mike said, expecting the enhanced FLEX to get CE mark in mid-2018 and to begin enrolling in our U.S. approval trial at that point, which would put us on track to get estimated U.S. approval roughly the same time as our competitors get approval on their first generation devices.","Likewise, just to reiterate, as Mike said, completed enrollment in Japan of SALUTE, which is the trial that will get us approval in Japan. And although we're in the early stages, pleased at this point with the cadence of our ASAP-TOO trial, which is an indication expansion trial that will get us a FDA labeling for the oral anti-coagulation contraindicated population.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Terrific. Thanks for a great quarter.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thanks, Joanne.","Operator","Thanks. Next, we go to the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Two product-related questions, starting with drug-eluting stents. I think I heard you say, Mike, there was about 1% growth on a global basis in Q2. And SYNERGY's been a great product for you guys, but that lapping. So I'm curious your thoughts, and Dr. Meredith's thoughts, on kind of what's next, how we should think about growth going forward? And we didn't hear a lot about your internal bioabsorbable program at the Analyst Day. But Dr. Meredith, I'm curious to hear how you're thinking about the future of this franchise from a technology standpoint? And I have one follow-up. Thanks.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Sure. I'll make a few comments, then Dr. Meredith can add. Our DES business really pays a lot of the bills for our investments in structural heart. So, the fact that we can continue to grow that business despite a double-digit comp is nice accomplishment by the global team there. So we do anticipate that SYNERGY will continue to be the market-leading stent, that it will grow slightly above market, and it will drive the contribution that we need it to so we can fuel all our WATCHMAN, TAVR, and eventual mitral programs.","So that's a really important part of our portfolio. And we don't see a, really a \u2013 over our LRP program, we don't see a new stent offering from a competitor that will threaten the safety and clinical efficacy of SYNERGY. So I think we're in a good position strategically. In terms of next generation, the bulk of our investment, as Kevin talked about at the Investor Day meeting, is in complex coronary as well as structural heart. So, that's the primary investment area with our cardiology business. And maybe Dr. Meredith can make some comments on fully resorbable space, if you like?","Ian Meredith, M.D., Ph.D. - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thanks, Mike. I think we're all aware of the burden of data that is now being published to show the less-than-stellar performance of the first generation bioabsorbable stents, and these scaffolds have all been associated with a higher risk of stent thrombosis at one year that led to a warning note in Europe, of course. This has meant that there's some skepticism towards this technology currently, and it certainly means that we don't need to focus primarily on this at this point in time. Obviously the RENUVIA platform has been a strut and is more of fracture resistant, but given the sort of global move away from BRS technologies at the moment, it's doesn't make sense to have that as a primary focus.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. And then, back to WATCHMAN, one of the comments you made at the Investor Day that I thought was interesting was that you expect over 30,000 implants over the next 14 to 18 months, which is roughly the number of implants since launch. And by our met, that implies about $420 million in revenue, assuming about a $14,000 ASP. Is that the right way to think about it? And do you feel that you can get them closer to 14 months at this point, or you're still keeping that range of 14 to 18 months? Thanks for taking the questions.","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah. I think on the heels of what we had said at Investor Day, we'd stick with that, and I think the commentary from Dr. Stein and Mike is appropriate, that we're really excited about WATCHMAN and the technology and what it has done, and what it can do in the future, but we'd stick with that timing over that timeframe.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, guys.","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","All right.","Operator","And next we'll go to the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Frederick Allen Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everybody. Some more TAVR first, can you give us any more color on where you are with the LOTUS fix? Last we heard, I think at PCR your input \u2013 you were implementing manufacturing changes, and is that all done? And maybe some color on the regulatory process as well? Among Symetis, it's an easy valve to learn, you're training everybody; maybe you could talk to us about when the training's going to be done, and your thoughts about with this easy to learn valve, could we see a fairly rapid Symetis uptake in new European centers?","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah. So, on Symetis, really, it will never be done, because we're going to train our reps around the world as the cadence of Symetis moves from Europe to U.S., Japan, and over Asia. So it's really part of our ongoing platform now. The good news is that all the training programs are in place, and we're building up additional staff and training capabilities to fully train the existing BSE team, and the BSE team in the U.S. that's being established to launch LOTUS. So that infrastructure is moving along quite well. Xavier and the team in the Europe are doing nice job in building that out.","And we are seeing, I would say slightly above our deal model, early days, in terms of Symetis uptake. And some of the comments that were made at the Investor Day, it's a high-performing valve that's very, very easy to use, and has very impressive kind of clinical studies that are in play, that will be reported out in the SCOPE trials. So Symetis is going well, we're very excited about that, and we're pleased that we doubled down in that market, given the size and the differentiation between LOTUS and Symetis.","On LOTUS itself, it's really nothing new to report since the Investor Day meeting. We anticipate EU launch by year end and U.S. PMA approval in the fourth quarter, so we can launch that product ideally end of second quarter in the U.S. And the R&D teams and ops teams, supply chain teams doing a really nice job. And we want to lock that down, so we can mass produce LOTUS to serve the markets. And essentially, we feel like the fix was identified months ago, and the root cause, and all the additional validation. And also the engagement with the regulatory bodies in Europe is a bit fluid, and that's where we're working through, but we feel like the timelines that we've laid out give us the proper amount of flexibility to manage any minimal clinical requirements or any regulatory discussions.","Frederick Allen Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Mike. And just on the S-ICD adoption. You highlighted the strong worldwide EMBLEM growth, which is encouraging. Just where are we in the penetration goals that you dreamt of, and do we need the MRI \u2013 I'm sorry, the leafless pace (50:29) approval to really further accelerate the growth, or is there a lot more to go even before you get there? Thanks so much.","Kenneth Stein, M.D. - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah. Hey, Rick. I'll take that. It's Ken. We're in even probably a little better than where we thought we would be when we did the deal to acquire camera on the S-ICD. In terms of where do we go with penetration, right, the key is at this point, how deeply can we get penetrated into the traditional primary prevention indicated market? And that's why I thought the data that we presented at HRS earlier this year, and we highlighted at the Investor's Day from our post approval study in the U.S., we now see that two-thirds of the implants of the device in the U.S. are in that traditional primary prevention population. And I think, even ahead of getting our modular CRM device that is the leadless pacemaker that communicates with the S-ICD, even ahead of getting that, we see that we can continue to grow that penetration into primary prevention.","And then I think the two opportunities to further accelerate that are, first of all, getting modular CRM into clinical trials and eventually into the market, so that there is an opportunity to provide anti-tachycardia pacing while staying leadless for those patients who need it. And then also our mated S-ICD trial, which is an indication expansion trial that would potentially bring in a completely new population of primary prevention patients, and that's those patients with mid-range ejection fractions, primarily myocardial infarction and diabetes. And again, that's a population, that's roughly equivalent in size to the current primary prevention market to begin with, and a population that we feel is uniquely served by the S-ICD.","Frederick Allen Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Ken.","Operator","And next we will go to the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Oh! One moment.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","We lost Bob.","Operator","I apologize. Just one moment, please. Next we'll go to the line of Matt Taylor from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Can you hear me, okay?","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Hi, Matt. We can hear you fine, Matt. Yeah, go ahead.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. So, I wanted to ask a question just on balancing cash flow. You're getting some more visibility on working through some of the settlements, and presumably that'll give you some more confidence and flexibility. Can you talk about, a, when that can happen, and how you might think about doing things differently when you have some more confidence in kind of that cash flow outlook?","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Matt. Yeah, and I think we hit this pretty well at Investor Day as well, that as we start to work through this year \u2013 this year is a big year for retiring the historical liabilities, in terms of mesh in the IRS settlement. So, put a lot of that behind us in 2017, still have to tail that into 2018, but once you get into certainly the second half of 2018 and absolutely into 2019 and 2020, you would see a significant increase in the amount of our free cash flow that will be able to put to more strategic uses like returning cash to shareholders and M&A.","So I don't think there is any change relative to the philosophy of how we would view that over that timeframe, but we're looking forward to it relative to being able to put more of that cash to use. But the underlying philosophy and the financial discipline and the category leadership strategy that we've had, I think, is alive and well and would serve us as well as we move through that timeframe.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. And just to follow up on kind of a prior question, I appreciate Dr. Stein's comments on opportunities for S-ICD. I was wondering if you could comment on any thoughts you have now, with a little bit of time since the announcement of the re-opening of the NCD for ICDs and\/or the comment period on MRI, if you think either of those things could have an impact on the market?","Kenneth Stein, M.D. - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah. Sure, Matt. We fully supported CMS' decision to reopen the NCD for ICDs and let me deal with that before the MRI. And what we gave in terms of our feedback to CMS was the recommendation they preserve coverage for the currently covered populations, and to revise the NCD so it doesn't limit device choice. And most important, I think, to liberalize some of the current restrictions so that it can be consistent with the current guidelines and appropriate use criteria as developed by the societies, ACC, HRS, et cetera.","I think with MRI, again, the question in terms of what's going to happen with their NCD really is going to be whether they're going to remove some of restrictions on performing MRI for patients with legacy devices based on the results of trials like the MagnaSafe Registry. Whether or not they do that, I don't see as having really any substantial impact on the market for devices that are being implanted currently.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks very much for the comments, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Next we go to the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good, thanks. Can you hear me okay?","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","We can hear you fine, Bob.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Sorry about that last one. So, Mike, just to start out, I've heard lots of questions here on (56:41) you provided. So maybe just to be clear, is there any change to any of the timelines that you mentioned at the Analyst Day, or any change whatsoever to your confidence in the revenue growth outlook that you discussed at the Analyst Day?","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","No. I did screw up earlier in the call, I mentioned that LOTUS was going to be approved in the U.S. in fourth quarter this year, that a miss. I meant to say the PMA filing for U.S. will happen in fourth quarter 2017. So I did a nice job in messing that answer up, but other than that one, our outlook financially is unchanged from our Investor Day.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","I even took our sales guidance up for the year, our sales guidance is up for the year, up around by a point.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just on that, so that U.S. timelines are the same as you talked about at the Analyst Day?","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah. Timelines for all TAVR, essentially timelines for everything, haven't changed over the last 45 days.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Perfect. Just wanted to clarify. And then Dan, just one quick one for you on currency. I was wondering if you could just talk about the impact of currency on this year and next. Maybe just help us understand, from where rates are right now, what the impact of hedging is versus just the impact of FX translation? Just sort of get a little bit of \u2013 of a better sense of the moving pieces and what's in your guidance?","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Sure. Let me start with revenue on that, Bob. So as we've gone through the year, the amount of headwind from FX on the top line has dissipated, right? We started off thinking about 125, it was gone to 85, now for our most recent guidance it's 30. And actually in Q4, it could flip to a tailwind for us, right? So \u2013 and that's obviously the market basket of rates that have changed over that timeframe. Primarily, the euro strengthening against the dollar, the pound a little bit the same, and then most other currencies seeing dollar strength, and the yen being somewhat flat during that timeframe. So pretty clear on that. We haven't given revenue impact guidance for 2018, we'll obviously do that as the time draws nearer to giving that guidance.","In terms of gross margin, it's actually been a little bit of a different story. It was kind of 50 basis points full-year in the February guidance, went to 90, and now is at 100. So roughly unchanged from the April guidance, and that's just simply a reflection of the hedging contracts we have, when they were entered into, and then the expiration of those. So \u2013 and which currencies are moving.","So, you don't \u2013 the reason that the top line has gotten better through the year, but we still have seen \u2013 will still see $0.08 at the bottom line is, we're largely hedged for the year. I mean, the majority of that top line benefit has been from the Euro, and we're largely hedged against the Euro for 2017, so we don't get a lot of the drop through, which is the benefit of a hedging program, you don't want the significant swings. So that's kind of the relationship in 2017 of top line and bottom line, and we were pretty clear I think at Investors Day that we see about a nickel, $0.05, of negative FX with rates where they are today in 2018.","Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much.","Daniel J. Brennan - Boston Scientific Corp.","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Thank you. Next we go to the line of Matt Miksic with UBS. Please go ahead.","Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking our questions. Just a couple of follow-ups on some of the topics that you've covered. One on the CRM share recapture, the growth in that business. Any color you could provide just on the drivers of that? Obviously MRI saved and pacers and some of the new leads you've launched, say a year or so ago, and high power. But any other competitive drivers you see or advantages you're enjoying would be helpful, and I have one follow up on WATCHMAN.","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah. So overall, really pleased, not only \u2013 particularly pleased with the margin improvement that Joe Fitzgerald's team delivered, impressive in a market that's challenging in terms of its overall growth profile. What's important for us in CRM is, we're continuing to grow above market. Our Brady results were nicely above market despite anniversarying our launch and a competitor's recent launch. So we expect some challenges there with some of the comps, but we continue to growth above market, which is kind of the trend for the company.","And then in defib, which is really important, I think an encouraging trend there, despite kind of flat overall growth, was the growth outside the U.S., where we've launched the RESONATE platform. So, in Europe in particular, we're seeing some lightness in volume, but the team has done a nice job of growing that business off the RESONATE launch. And that will be the launch that will happen in the U.S. more fully once we have MRI approved by year-end. So in 2018, we look forward to having global defib RESONATE platform with the multipoint pacing, as well as MRI capability and HeartLogic, as well as the longevity benefit. So we think we have lot of differentiation with that.","And then as Dr. Stein commented, our SIC platform really differentiates Boston Scientific. It comes at nice gross margins, and we continue to see improved utilization of that platform. So, I think the product positioning is quite strong, and we hope to see some of the benefits of the replacement cycle. That being said, of all of our markets this is likely the most challenged in terms of its overall growth rate, kind of in a low single-digit growth rate range.","Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Sure. That's very helpful color. And then on maybe one of your more rapidly expanding markets, on WATCHMAN. If you could talk a little bit about the way you're seeing sort of new centers coming up to speed in the U.S., the pace of that growth? Maybe also that degree to which other product lines are getting pulled into these conversations with your customers, either AFib or CRM or otherwise, that kind of color would be very helpful?","Michael F. Mahoney - Boston Scientific Corp.","Yeah, probably \u2013 thank you, Matt. WATCHMAN, as you said, we're very pleased with its uptake, but definitely not satisfied because we want \u2013 we expect a lot more. Every point of utilization as we highlighted at Investor Day, is another $250 million market opportunity.","So our focus, besides getting strong clinical results and training, is increasing utilization. And that's where most of our efforts are on; we have a large implanter base of approximately 350, 375. We're focused on training more doctors, more physicians at those sites, and really trying to find any friction points in those sites to improve utilization. And that's what the teams are working through, and you see a wide, quite frankly a wide range of utilization across sites and centers. And our focus is on improving that scale across the board. And we have a nice head start competitively, as you know.","I won't comment too much more on pull-through. Obviously when you have a nice platform like that, as well as a leading drug-eluting stent, I've commented on the RESONATE platform for CRM. Our overall portfolio in PI \u2013 which actually hasn't been discussed today \u2013 our overall portfolio in PI, Interventional Cardiology and Rhythm, is quite strong. And then, with our structural heart emphasis, there is some \u2013 occasionally some bundling that goes across, but I would say a lot less bundling than what's discussed with analysts, quite frankly.","Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you, Mike.","Susan Lisa - Boston Scientific Corp.","With that, we'd like to conclude the call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to your host, Susan Lisa. Please go ahead.","Susan Lisa","Thanks, Kevin. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. With me on today\u2019s call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q2 2019 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release, as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today\u2019s call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financials and Filings.","The duration of this morning\u2019s call will be approximately one hour. Mike will provide strategic and revenue highlights of Q2 2019. Dan will review the financials for the quarter and then provide Q3 \u201819 and full year 2019 guidance, and then we\u2019ll take your questions. During today\u2019s Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Ian Meredith and Dr. Ken Stein.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that on the call, operational revenue excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. And organic revenue further excludes the impact of certain acquisitions, including NxThera, Claret, Augmenix and Vertiflex in the relevant periods for which there are no prior period related net sales.","Also note, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate, and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share, new product approvals and launches, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance, including sales, margins, earnings and other Q3 and full year 2019 guidance, as well as our tax rates, R&D spend, and other expenses.","Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today\u2019s date, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them.","At this point, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike?","Michael Mahoney","Thank you, Susie. Good morning, everyone. Boston Scientific continues to grow above market, improve profitability and drive meaningful innovation to address unmet patient needs, as showcased at our recent Investor Day.","In the second quarter, our team delivered 8% operational revenue and 6.3% organic growth, with another quarter of strong balance across our businesses and geographic regions. In addition, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.39 which is at the high end of our guidance range, while generating a $406 million in adjusted free cash flow.","We do have clear line of sight to high single digit organic growth for 2019 and we reiterate our full year \u201819 organic revenue growth guidance of 7% to 8% and adjusted EPS of $1.54 to $1.58. We had increased our expected contribution from acquisitions from 110 basis points to 140, resulting in operational revenue growth guidance of 8% to 9% for the full year.","I\u2019ll now detail some of the key aspects of our second quarter results and thoughts on our second half 2019 prospects. All growth rates refer to organic sales growth versus the prior year, unless mentioned.","So, we\u2019ll start first with MedSurg. Sales continue down this solid high single digit performance and increased 7% or 8% organic, once you adjust for the one-time mesh recall impact.","As Endoscopy continued this trend of 8% organic growth quarters, it\u2019s fueled by more than a dozen product launches over the past 18 months, such as SpyGlass DS II, Jagwire and ORISE Gel. We\u2019ve also recently launched ORISE in a single syringe version to address a broader range of procedure types including polyps.","Infection prevention sales were also up very strongly driven by strong kit sales in the US, and going forward, we look for continued momentum in all these product lines, as well as AXIOS and improved supply in OrcaPod single-use valves.","We do remain on track for year end launch of Exalt-D Single-Use Duodenoscope, which is used in ERCP procedures. And we\u2019re very encouraged by physician enthusiasm for this platform and continue to believe this represents a significant opportunity in 2020 and beyond.","Urology and Pelvic Health grew 15% operationally in the quarter and 6% on an organic basis despite the two point organic headwind from the market [ph] withdrawal and customer returns of the mesh treatment of pelvic organ prolapse.","This growth was led by mid teens growth in our core Stone franchise with strong LithoVue single-use ureteroscope sales across all regions, and particularly strong emerging markets growth. SpaceOAR Hydrogel also delivered in the quarter and is tracking to $100 million for full year \u201819, which is above our original deal model as I mentioned at our Investor Day.","We also expect acceleration in UroPH sales in the second half of the year from continued LithoVue and SpaceOAR strength, the one year anniversaries of the acquisitions of NxThera in May and Augmenix in October and new product launches such as the Tactra implant in Men's Health, where trends have improved now that we fixed our sterilization challenges.","Rhythm and Neuro grew 3% in the quarter, which we believe represents above market growth in CRM at 3%, while EP sales grew 9%. Neuromodulation sales were flat year-over-year, but we continue to build momentum and of note sequential growth was 7%.","While Neuromod's flat year-over-year sales results slowed from first quarters, which were 9%, we did face a 31% comp in second quarter versus our Q1 comp of 17%. So on an operational basis Neuromod sales were plus 2% year-over-year and reflect excellent brain growth from our Vercise DBS Systems, which offset the weaker spinal cord stimulation results.","We continued to see excellent momentum in DBS due to market receptivity to our Cartesia Directional Lead in the US and Europe and we anticipate full-body MRI labeling for our Vercise systems in the second half of 2019 in the US.","In our pain franchise, Vertiflex closed on June 11, and we\u2019re excited to offer the full continuum of care for patients suffering pain, now with an option focused on those diagnosed with moderate lumbar spinal stenosis. Vertiflex remains on track to generate full year \u201819 sales of $60 million.","In SCS, we continue to see some softness in the overall market and we faced tough comps as mentioned due to our WaveWriter spinal cord stim system launch in the US early last year. While we continue to be optimistic about the long-term 7% to 10% growth potential of this market, we do expect some continued softness in 2019 given the 21% second half comp.","We do expect second half improvement in SCS post our recent WaveWriter real-world data presentations at INS WaveWriter software enhancements and initial release of the COMBO randomized clinical trial data.","Global Cardiac Rhythm Management sales grew 3% and was led by mid single digit growth in defib sales, driven by our RESONATE platform and its HeartLogic Heart Failure alert, as well as strong EMBLEM S-ICD sales.","Our replacement cycle tailwind also remains on track and pacer sales declined low single digits, which is an improvement from recent quarters, but we continue to anticipate a modest pacer headwind for the full year of 2019.","EP sales did grow 9% in the quarter which was led by good sales of DirectSense in Europe, RHYTHMIA HDx mapping and navigation platform, and LUMIPOINT software which was fully launched in the second quarter.","As we highlighted and Joe did at our Investor Day, we remain optimistic about the future for our EP franchise, particularly for the AFib single-shot market and our two platforms with this therapeutic approach. We expect approval for our Cryo-based system POLARx in Europe year end \u201819 with LUMINIZE, our RF-based balloon platform following in the first half of \u201820.","Shifting now to Cardiovascular. The group sales were up 8% in the quarter. Peripheral Interventions sales increased 8% in the quarter as well, led by the launches of our Vici Venous Stent in the US and Eluvia DES in Japan, as well as excellent regional growth in Interventional Oncology, particularly in Asia.","Post the June paclitaxel FDA panel, physicians continue to order Eluvia in line with our commentary at Investor Day. And we do expect within the next few weeks an updated summary and guidance document from the FDA. We believe Eluvia remains well positioned if the guidance continues to recommend drug-eluting technologies only for patients with a high risk of restenosis, which does represent 40% to 60% of the market. And Eluvia has potential to achieve higher share in this segment given its performance in these patient types.","For example in the IMPERIAL trial, 12 month data which demonstrated half the rate of TLR compared with Zilver PTX, 40% of patients in Eluvia ARM had severe calcium which is 4x the rate of severe calcium in the global pivotal trials of the two leading DCBs. In addition, nearly one third of the patients had total vessel occlusions in the Eluvia IMPERIAL study which is a much higher rate than in the DCB studies.","Last month, we announced the proposed divestiture of our bland and drug-loaded bead business to Varian Medical Systems in conjunction with the proposed BTG acquisition.","We continue to make progress towards closing BTG in August and look forward to the opportunity to expand our Peripheral and Interventional Oncology portfolio and continue to execute our category leadership strategy.","Our Interventional Cardiology business accelerated from first quarter\u2019s 5% growth to 8% organic and 10% operational in the second quarter. There were strong growth across all regions led by Structural Heart sales and mid teens growth in Complex PCI products, which is partially offset by DES.","WATCHMAN grew sales ahead of plan is now 600 accounts in the US as this important therapy provides patients with atrial fibrillation, an alternative to lifelong oral anticoagulants. We successfully launched our national direct-to-patient TV campaign in late March and are encouraged by their early results.","WATCHMAN FLX transition from limited market release to full launch in Europe and physicians are very pleased by the 95% plus rate of implant success and feel and no device embolization.","We\u2019re targeting a mid-2020 launch in the US for FLX. We also remain on track to launch WATCHMAN in Japan in third quarter with reimbursements and continue to advance the clinical evidence surrounding WATCHMAN as we begin enrollment in the OPTION trial in atrial fibrillation patients post ablation.","ACURATE TAVR valve momentum continues in the second quarter with 30% growth and is now available in over 40 countries and importantly, the US IDE for ACURATE neo2 was initiated and we recently began enrolment of the 600 patient study in the second quarter.","Unfortunately in Europe, we now do expect a mid 2020 launch for ACURATE neo2 as we have chosen to revise our approach and consolidate our regulatory submissions with fewer notified bodies due to challenges in the regulatory environment with a shift to European Medical Device Regulation or known as MDR.","The LOTUS Edge controlled launches is going extremely well. Positive physician feedback highlights the benefits of complete control and drama free TAVR. We are on pace to open 150 accounts in the first 12 months that we cited in Investor Day, and we\u2019re very confident that our launch approach will position both LOTUS Edge and our entire structural heart portfolio for long-term leadership in this substantial market.","We see significant opportunity in the high-risk labeling we have today and we're actually enrolling for our US REPRISE IV clinical trial to expand indication to intermediate risk patients.","And finally, the SENTINEL Cerebral embolic protection device continues to enjoy strong growth rates as supply scales up. We\u2019re now in over 400 accounts globally and we believe that Protected TAVR with SENTINEL is the emerging standard of care and we expect momentum to continue as we launch new accounts and we anniversary the SENTINEL acquisition this month.","So the combined strength of WATCHMAN, ACURATE, LOTUS Edge, and SENTINEL position us well to deliver on our guidance for $700 million to $725 million in structural heart revenue in \u201819.","So to close, once again I'd like to share again my enthusiasm for our outlook in 2019 and beyond. And as conveyed at our Investor Day, we believe that Boston Scientific continues to be uniquely positioned to drive shareholder value due to our differentiated long-term growth profile, meaningful opportunity to improve operating margins and track record of delivering double-digit adjusted EPS growth, while also improving our ability to deploy capital.","I want to thank our employees once again for their winning spirit and commitment to advancing science for life. So Dan will now provide a detailed review of our financials.","Daniel Brennan","Thanks, Mike. Second quarter consolidated revenue of $2.631 billion represents 5.6% reported revenue growth and 8% growth on an operational basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.","Our reported revenue reflects a $57 million headwind from foreign exchange slightly unfavorable to the $45 million to $50 million headwind expected at the time of guidance.","Sales from the NxThera, Claret, Augmenix and Vertiflex acquisitions contributed 170 basis points slightly higher than the 140 basis points expected and at the time of guidance, which did not include the Vertiflex acquisition. As a reminder, the operational NxThera contribution only represents one month as the acquisition is considered organic as of May 1 this year.","The resulting organic growth of 6.3% in the second quarter compared to our guidance range of 6% to 7% was driven by balanced top line performance across multiple businesses and regions as Mike has already detailed.","Q2 adjusted earnings per share of $0.39, was down 4% versus prior year, up 12% excluding the Q2 2018 net tax benefit of $0.06 and at the high-end of our guidance range.","Earnings were driven by solid P&L metrics and also reflect a $0.01 discrete tax benefit in the quarter. The FX impact on adjusted EPS was immaterial as expected at the time of guidance.","Adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 72.1% at the low end of our guidance range of 72% to 73%, but represents an 80 basis point improvement over prior year, driven by standard cost improvements reduced scrap and FX.","Adjusted SG&A expenses were $936 million or 35.6% of sales in the quarter at the mid-point of our range and up 90 basis points year-over-year as we continue to fund initiatives related to recent acquisitions and focus on key commercial launches.","Adjusted research and development expenses were $273 million in the second quarter or 10.4% sales at the low end of our guidance range and flat year-over-year. Royalty expense was 0.6% of sales also relatively flat over the prior year.","As a result, Q2 2019 adjusted operating margin achieved the midpoint of guidance at 25.5%. We continue to reiterate our full year adjusted operating margin guidance of 26% to 26.5%, which represents a 50 to 100 basis point improvement over the 2018 rate of 25.5%.","Now I\u2019ll move to below the line to interest and other expense. Adjusted interest expense for the quarter was $66 million compared to $57 million in Q2 of last year. Our average interest rate was 3.7% in the quarter, slightly higher than the 3.6% in Q2 of last year.","Adjusted other expense was $10 million in the quarter and primarily includes dilution from our equity method investments and transactional foreign exchange losses including hedging costs.","Our tax rate for the second quarter was a negative 5.9% on a GAAP basis and 7.8% on an adjusted basis, below our guidance range of approximately 11% for the quarter, due to a $19 million net discrete tax benefit. This Q2 benefit will be reflected in our updated full year 2019 tax rate, which I will discuss shortly, with no additional benefit expected in the third or fourth quarter of this year.","Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $406 million compared to $558 million in Q2 of last year. In the quarter, we used cash primarily to fund the closing of the acquisition of Vertiflex. We continue to expect full year adjusted free cash flow to be $2.2 billion.","We continue to work to resolve fully the mesh litigation with over 95% of all known claims now settled or in the final stages of settlement, including additional settlements reached in Q2.","Our total legal reserve, of which mesh is included, was $604 million as of June 30th, 2019. This is a decrease of nearly $100 million versus March 31st and includes an additional $15 million reserve for legal fees.","While the anticipated cost to litigate has increased due to various judicial orders and is reflected in the incremental $15 million reserve, importantly, the known claim count remains flat at 53,000, as does the anticipated amount required for settlement.","Therefore, we continue to anticipate full year payments into the qualified settlement fund to total $250 million, which will then resolve substantially all significant existing contingencies related to mesh. As a reminder, this liability is released from our balance sheet as payments are made out of the qualified settlement fund to plaintiffs.","During the quarter, we made cash payments of $50 million into the qualified settlement funds, which leaves approximately $200 million to fund for the remainder of the year.","Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $91 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $375 million to $400 million for the year, as we build capacity, integrate acquisitions and position the company for continued growth. We ended Q2 with 1.409 billion fully diluted weighted shares outstanding.","And now I\u2019ll walk through guidance for Q3 and full year 2019. As a reminder, the guidance I am providing does not include the proposed BTG acquisition, since it has not yet closed.","For the full year, we expect 2019 reported revenue growth to be in a range of approximately 7% to 8%. We are reiterating our prior guidance of year-over-year organic growth of 7% to 8%, now with an additional 140 basis point operational contribution expected from the NxThera, Claret, Augmenix and Vertiflex acquisitions.","As discussed in Q1, our first half 2019 average organic growth rate of 6.3% implies a second half 2019 acceleration of organic revenue and we remain comfortable with the outlook as Mike discussed, given multiple anticipated key product launches, continued momentum in our core, the anniversary of 2018 acquisitions which thus turn organic in the second half, and the normalization of selling days in the first half versus the second half of the year.","And while we expect foreign exchange to be a $170 million to $180 million headwind to revenue for the full year, we continue to expect FX to be neutral to earnings per share for the year due to our currency hedging program.","There is also no change to our expectations for adjusted gross margin as a percentage of sales to be in the range of 72% to 73% for the full year. We will continue to execute our ongoing standard cost reductions and also expect a positive full year FX impact to adjusted gross margin of 60 basis points.","Similarly, we continue to expect full year adjusted SG&A to be in the range of 34.5% to 35% of sales, a 40 to 90 basis point improvement versus full year 2018. There is also no change to the expectations for the full year adjusted R&D spend to be in a range of 10.5% to 11%.","As a result, we expect to achieve 2019 adjusted operating margin in a range of 26% to 26.5%, unchanged from prior quarter and up 50 to 100 basis points versus 2018 consistent with the improvement goals we outlined last September and reiterated at last month's Investor Day.","Due to the discrete tax benefit within the second quarter, we now expect our full year 2019 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 9%. This is based on an operational tax rate of approximately 11%, slightly more than 100 basis points of benefit from the accounting standard for stock compensation and nearly 100 basis points from the discrete tax benefit in the quarter which will not impact our tax rate outlook beyond 2019.","We expect below the line expenses which include interest payments, dilution from our venture capital portfolio and costs associated with our hedging program to be approximately $325 million to $350 million for the year and includes the make-hold call exercise in the first quarter.","We expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.413 billion shares for Q3 and 1.412 billion shares for the full year 2019. Note that interest expense related to the proposed BTG acquisition is currently excluded from adjusted results and we will provide updated guidance after we close the transaction.","We are reiterating our full year 2019 adjusted earnings per share range of $1.54 to $1.58. Although we received a $0.01 discrete tax benefit this quarter, we expect this to be largely offset by the divestiture of our embolic beads business to Varian upon the close of BTG. As a reminder, we're also offsetting the residual $0.01 impact from the mesh withdrawal.","This $1.54 to $1.58 range represents 10% to 13% adjusted earnings growth excluding the 2018 net tax benefit of $0.07 in the base. On a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share to be in a range of $0.94 to $0.98.","Now turning to Q3. We expect reported revenue growth to be in a range of approximately 8% to 10%. This represents year-over-year organic growth in a range of 7.5% to 9% with an additional 180 basis points operational growth contribution from Claret, Augmenix, and Vertiflex. Note that the Claret acquisition is included in organic guidance as of August.","We expect the foreign exchange impact on Q3 revenue to be a $30 million to $35 million headwind. For the third quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.37 to $0.39 per share, representing 7% to 13% growth and we do not expect any adjusted earnings per share impact from FX. GAAP EPS for the third quarter is expected to be in a range of $0.23 to $0.25 per share.","Please check our Investor Relations website for Q2, 2019 financial and operational highlights, which outlines Q2 results, as well as Q2 and full year 2019 guidance including P&L line item guidance.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Susie who will moderate the Q&A.","Susan Lisa","Thanks Dan. Kevin, let's open it up for the next 30, 35 minutes or so. In order to enable us to take as many questions as possible. Please limit yourself to one question and one related follow up. Kevin please go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] First question's from the line of David Lewis, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Lewis","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just thinking about the back half of the year Mike and Dan, to deliver an 8-ish like number for the third quarter, you know, momentum needs to improve in the third quarter kind of at a similar rate as it did in the second quarter. So what drives that confidence? How much is predicated on business recovery versus selling days or certain deals going organic? And then I have a quick follow up.","Michael Mahoney","Sure. Good morning, David. Thanks for the question. Yes. So I am really pleased. Essentially we\u2019re executing in line with what our annual plan was or it is. We knew that the second half required acceleration versus the first half. Now that is well thought out when we give our full year guidance as we updated that. So we\u2019re essentially in line with our plans, reiterating our full year 7% to 8% organic outlook, which does imply, obviously, acceleration in the third quarter fourth quarter.","And it's pretty straightforward how we're going to deliver that. The first two are more mechanical. The first one being we have one less selling day in the first half. And the second half we have one more selling day and another more mechanical solution is some of our acquisitions become organic, NxThera, Augmenix and Claret. So that\u2019s - those are kind of the more mechanical ones that certainly helped accelerate the growth in the second half.","But importantly in terms of the actual business, pleased to see that with the exception of EP all of our businesses continue to grow faster than their peer group. We have a lot of momentum. Specifically in the regions we\u2019re seeing Japan return to growth in the second quarter. We expect strong acceleration from our team in Japan based on the anniversary of price cuts that have recently occurred.","New product launches with Eluvia, which is building momentum in Japan. And also the recent news of reimbursement and approval for WATCHMAN, which we anticipate selling in September.","So on a regional basis, we expect Asia to continue to accelerate. The US and Europe continue to perform strong and emerging markets continue to have a lot of momentum. And beyond that just the impact of our full year launches, you\u2019ll see greater acceleration of LOTUS Edge, which we\u2019re very pleased with the initial results of the second quarter, acceleration of our VICI stent, the WATCHMAN FLX approval in Europe and as well as SENTINEL supply and I would say broadly and supply our teams did a very nice job of just of executing our supply requirements.","So we have - we're in very good position with supply across the company, momentum across our businesses, new product launches that impact the second half more greatly, as well as the mechanical pieces of additional day selling and the operational to organic. So all that gives us a lot of confidence in the third quarter and the implied fourth quarter guidance that you can derive from that.","David Lewis","Mike, very helpful and very clear. Just one quick follow-up on LOTUS. Thanks for the feedback on center traction and the number of centers. Can you give us any sense of average center of penetration from a case basis? Should we still expect this rollout to be controlled through the end of 2019? And did SENTINEL \u2013 frankly, was SENTINEL capacity still an issue here in the second quarter? Thanks so much.","Michael Mahoney","Yeah. So SENTINEL, we don't have \u2013 we do not have the supplier constraints within SENTINEL that we had call it for the first half of the year. So that the ops team done a great job with that and so you\u2019ll start to see more SENTINEL usage in Europe, in combination with ACURATE and LOTUS.","So the European team has been more constrained. So you\u2019ll start to see some enhancements and growth in Europe with SENTINEL and opening more centers in the US. I think SENTINEL will be a strong second half story for us. Just anecdotally, I was at a couple of cases last week, a couple of live cases we saw with our TAVR valve which performed very well with SENTINEL and also SENTINEL being used with some competitive valves in low-risk patients and pretty shocking to see the amount of debris [ph] that some of these physicians received. So I think physicians are becoming very comfortable once they use SENTINEL in terms of its ease-of-use, as well as the impact from that. So a lot of focus there.","On LOTUS really pleased, we're essentially delivering per our commitment. The 150 accounts that we expect to open. We\u2019re on track to deliver that. We\u2019re not going to provide kind of share data, or usage data by account. But I would say, this has been a long time coming to bring into the market. And anecdotally, I would say doctors are pleasantly surprised by the unique features that it delivers. The controlled uses of the device, the ability to reposition and the elimination of the PBL is delivering on its promise.","And given the investment that we\u2019ve made, the time that it's taken, we\u2019re really focused on quality, strong patient outcomes and proctoring. And we\u2019re in this for the long run with two valves and going to deliver as planned our financial commitment and the rollout of LOTUS.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from the line of Bob Hopkins, Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bob Hopkins","Hey. Thank you. And good morning. So two product-related questions, if okay. First on spinal cord stimulation, I was wondering, if you could give us a sense for the growth rate of that business in the second quarter. And then just broadly, any additional thoughts you have on underlying market growth trends in spinal cord stimulation here in 2019? Thank you.","Michael Mahoney","Morning, Bob. Thanks for the question. Just high level before I get right to your question. One thing we\u2019re happy about is the Neuromod team has continued to diversify that business. So we\u2019ll always be led by our spinal cord stim question.","Second, but our international growth is becoming more significant. The team in Europe is doing an excellent job with both SCS and DBS and then we further diversified with our RF platform and our Vertiflex. So that gives us multiple product categories and more multiple regions that are contributing.","On the SCS market itself for BSC standpoint, candidly we faced some brutal comps which is good from last year. We had 31% comp in Neuromod in second quarter \u201818. We did see sequential growth in the franchise within SCS in the US from first quarter to second quarter. So that's encouraging.","And our team has amped up significantly more their patient awareness activities and other kind of fundamentals that we may have gotten away from a little bit in \u201818, because the volume was strong. It really wasn't needed.","So in our view, this is - we call it a upper single digit growth market. We stick with that based on the unmet patient need that we see, the lack of alternatives, and significant survey work that we\u2019ve done.","So, we have seen less volume in the first half of 2019 and we expect that to improve slightly in the second half and then we\u2019ll - we believe we\u2019ll continue to go fast in that market.","So, when we look at our guidance for the second half of \u201819, we obviously are conservative and thoughtful about what our SCS projections are. So I think that kind of tapered view is built into our guidance. So we have a lot of confidence in the long-term growth outlook of the market and the portfolio that we have.","Bob Hopkins","Okay. Great. And then I am sorry if I missed it, but was there a specific spinal cord, I'm just curious as to the growth rate of the spinal cord stim, Boston Scientific [ph] business in the second quarter if you\u2019re willing to provide that.","And my second question was just quickly on Peripheral and paclitaxel. Just curious as to what happened to paclitaxel sales in kind of Q2 versus Q1? Is there any noticeable change there?","Michael Mahoney","Yeah. So, just specific to your question, US SCS did decline in the second quarter kind of upper single digit and the OUS was up. And so again that was - we suffered there against the significant comp and some volume softness. So we saw sequential growth in the quarter, but the - so the US SCS it did decline upper single digit.","On paclitaxel, really nothing new, since Jeff outlined that at Investor Day. We expect to hear from the FDA on their guidance document in August and we think as long as the guidance documents kind of written in line with their commentary at the panel, then we believe Eluvia will be a nice growth driver for us clearly in Japan and also in the US. So really nothing changed from Mirviss comment at Investor Day.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from the line of Vijay Kumar, Evercore. Please go ahead.","Vijay Kumar","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. A couple of quick guidance questions. The first one very simple. The days impact in back half Mike or Dan, is that split equally between 3Q and 4Q or is that more 3Q weighted?","Daniel Brennan","It just rolls in over the two quarters. I wouldn't point to one month or one particular quarter. It just - it rolls over the back half.","Vijay Kumar","Understood. And just on the EPS guidance Dan, you know, tax rate are tad below. I'm assuming this is being offset by higher OpEx spend and I think I heard you mention support commercial launches. Maybe highlight a couple of where the spend is going? And BTG given the August close any changes in the $0.02 to $0.03 contribution for this fiscal or does the math change? Thank you.","Daniel Brennan","Yeah. So, I\u2019ll hit the BTG one first. Can\u2019t comment on that, obviously, just based on the UK rules until all that deal actually closes which we say should be sometime in August.","Relative to SG&A, you think of the launches that we have, you have LOTUS. We\u2019re gearing up for WATCHMAN in Japan. We have Eluvia going in Japan. We have other momentum in Endo and some of the MedSurg franchises.","And then one of the other things in SG&A in the quarter is if you look at the Neuromod P&L it's deleveraged and because of the growth again Mike detailed that very nicely in terms of the 31% comp from last year. So we\u2019re not making any fundamental changes to that business because we think that's a fantastic market 7% to 10% as we said.","So that has a little bit of impact in the quarter, that P&L is deleveraged. We're fine with that because we're going to keep that engine going for the long-term. But that's probably the key reasons. The launches and a little bit of a deleveraged Neuromod P&L in the quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Joanne Wuensch, BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Joanne Wuensch","Good morning, everybody. And thank you for taking the question. I\u2019d like to just hit upon acquisitions. Last year you announced 10 in 2018, one so far in 2019. What are you thinking in regards to continued capital deployment in this area?","Michael Mahoney","Hey, Joanne. Thanks for the question. So we\u2019re closing our most strategic one BTG within the next \u2013 in August, we're aiming for, which will be great and we \u2013 it's been longer than we thought, given the B divestiture, but the team's ready to deliver on that. There is significant cost synergies and makes us the category leader in Interventional Oncology tools and products, I want go through all that. But we\u2019re excited about that acquisition.","In \u201819, you've seen us really do one deal thus far, the Vertiflex acquisition. So our pace of acquisitions certainly slowed down with one acquisition through almost end of July here. And so we do have capacity to do a couple of more tuck-in oriented acquisitions in 2019 if we wanted to. And some of the valuations are quite high and we do have a very prolific, I would say, DC portfolio that you'll see us acquire companies from that portfolio over the coming two years. But really to be determined whether we do anymore acquisitions this year or potentially one or two at the most tuck-in acquisitions.","So you'll see significant - significantly less volume in 2019 versus 2018. And then, we\u2019ll have additional capacity once we continue to delever as planned, as outlined at Investor Day. So we\u2019ll have nice capacity in 2020 for more tuck-in acquisitions, if the strategy works and the financials make sense for us.","Joanne Wuensch","And then on a specific product, the Exalt Model D Single-Use Duodenoscope, you submitted it to - on April to the FDA. Can you give us an update on timing of that and how we should think about just your Endoscopy business in general?","Michael Mahoney","So, the Endoscopy business in general is kind of firing on all cylinders. They have significant number of product launches throughout 2019 that they're executing on and the supply chain team continues to deliver against the requirements there. So we have a lot of confidence that quite frankly Endo will accelerate growth in the second half of 2019 versus the first half.","On the duodenoscope, the team makes good ongoing progress there and we continue to put this in our physicians hands and they continue to test the product through clinical trials that we are doing. But we do expect approval of this product and launching it by the year end. So you\u2019ll see some impact of Exalt, the duodenoscope in the fourth quarter, which also is another reason to support our second half acceleration.","So I would say it's on track. The Endo business in particular is executing at a high level, hitting the cadence of product launches and the duodenoscope is kind of on track per our discussions at Investor Day ","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from the line of Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Larry Biegelsen","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. One product question and one guidance question. So Mike, on WATCHMAN Japan do you have reimbursement yet? And what is the rate there compared to the US? And how are you thinking about the trajectory in Japan? And then, I have one follow-up.","Michael Mahoney","Yeah. So we\u2019re pleased with that. We just got a text like at two in the morning last night on WATCHMAN reimbursement approval and I\u2019ll let Dr. Stein talk a little bit about the clinical indications in a second. But just economics look good. It\u2019s quite frankly a little bit better than anticipated. The reimbursement will be in the US dollar conversion in the $13,000 range for Japan reimbursement and we\u2019ll start our launch call it the mid-September time period. So you\u2019ll see a nice benefit from that in the fourth quarter. And I\u2019ll let Dr. Stein to give any comments.","Kenneth Stein","Yeah. Thanks, Mike. Hey, Larry. Again, as Mike said right now we have PMDA approval and now MHLW approval for reimbursement in Japan, tracking to launch in September. Just sort of putting it all together, the guidelines for use are very similar to what we see in the United States and we\u2019re very pleased by it.","Larry Biegelsen","Thank you very much. And then Mike what gets you to the high end versus the low end of the guidance range for organic growth in 2019? Thanks for taking the questions, guys.","Michael Mahoney","His got some more. I think it's really - I'm really pleased. We just did the strap plan and I would say the team is executing really per our commitments for this year. This was what\u2019s the schedule for the acceleration of the second half given the days in the portfolio cadence that we have. You know, I think in terms of within that range, the structural heart business is a nice lever there with WATCHMAN, now this Japan approval with WATCHMAN, the continued momentum with LOTUS, SENTINEL and ACURATE. So I think that's a pretty good size swing factor in terms of our overall within the range there.","And then I think that Japan and Asia - I would say Asia broadly is doing extremely well, yet excellent China growth. So we need to see that momentum sustained, which it has for a number of years. The Japan getting back to healthy growth is a big lift for us in Asia Pac. So I think those are a couple.","And then you just have produced strong - with the exception of EP where we\u2019re growing slower than market and we have some exciting new launches and are coming in Europe on single shot and hopefully in US, our direct \u2013 our MIFI DirectSense therapeutic catheter launch. So we expect EP to get healthier in 2020.","So with the exception of that business in \u201819, there is a lot of momentum across them. And so I think if that ongoing momentum, the kind of the swing points is the - our execution in structural heart, which is kind of on plan and I would say the Asia growth in particular is meaningful for us.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from the line of Josh Jennings of Cowen. Please go ahead.","Josh Jennings","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Mike, I just had a quick follow-up on the FDA paclitaxel panel and their upcoming recommendations. Are you guys internally assuming that there will be a label change detailing a mortality signal paclitaxel devices. And if you are, why wouldn\u2019t that potentially be more impactful to the market?","Michael Mahoney","Dr. Meredith if you\u2019re able to hear the question or answer that one that will be helpful.","Ian Meredith","Thanks, Mike. I did hear that. I think the 24 hour summary from the FDA gives us some guidance as to what the likely outcome of the next guidance statement would be. As you know, the panel unanimously agreed that there was short-term benefits to the paclitaxel coated devices that outweigh these risks that we actually saw in the four US IDE trials, which there were methodological reasons why that mortality signal might not have been that clear.","And the other thing that\u2019s very important here is that the panel couldn\u2019t describe a class effect to paclitaxel devices, and Eluvia of course was not included in that analysis. It behaves far more like a drug-eluting stent than DCB in terms of delivery mechanism and the targeted and focal way it's actually delivered. So we feel that the panel guidance thus far actually points to a fairly reasonable outcome from the next statement. So I suspect that it will bode well for Eluvia.","Josh Jennings","Thanks for that. And just one follow-up actually with Dr. Meredith on LOTUS Edge, could you help us understand how you\u2019re marketing the pacemaker rate? Clearly, there are a lot of positive metrics to put on the table for some of your physician customers.","But I think at TVT, we saw a LOTUS Edge combined cohort of 33 patients down in the low double-digit pacemaker at 30 days. Is that the rate you guys are putting forward to physician customers?","And then I think you did do a 50 patient \u2013 you need 50 patients to get the FDA approval with Edge, we ever going to see that data? Or how is that going to be brought forward? Thanks for taking the questions.","Ian Meredith","Okay. Thanks. I'll answer the second one first and then come back to the first part of your question. As you know, there was a nested registry. The focus of the nested \u2013 50-patient nested registry was related to the pin pull [ph] issue to show that that actually didn't occur. We decided to continue enrollment in that study and that study is ongoing.","So that we will ultimately have a significant data set where we can actually assess the pacemaker rate. We believe the pacemaker rate will be competitive and in that order of magnitude that you mentioned before from both the REPRISE Edge and FIN-Z studies where we had that cohort of patients with a 12% pacemaker rate.","So that study is - nested registry is ongoing and we\u2019ll report out probably when we have 150 patients in that study. And along with that, we\u2019ll have REPRISE IV and other ISRs which will give us clearer indication of the pacemaker rate.","Thus far the \u2013 that\u2019s how we are assessing the pacemaker rate and the data that we have from that REPRISE Edge and FIN-Z studies suggest that we will have a competitive pacemaker rate along with all the other advantages that you alluded to very \u2013 the lowest best-in-class PBL and full rate position ability no need for valve in valve.","Operator","Thank you. Next question's from the line of Matt Taylor, UBS. Please go ahead.","Matt Taylor","Hi. Thank you for taking the question. I just want to ask one on the European regulatory environment. You mentioned the delay to one of your programs there. Do you think that this is something that\u2019s going to be kind of a chronic issue? Could you characterize it a little bit more in terms of the additional time lines or cost that you could incur with other EU programs?","Michael Mahoney","Yeah. So I think the MDR process certainly adding some resource requirements for Boston Scientific and others. We think in the long run, this will be good for Europe. But clearly, over the \u2013 in the short run, it's a significant investment from us and other companies to provide the request that the MDR process is requiring.","So I would think in the near term, it's more of a financial expense item and resource allocation. And I think longer term in terms of our internal processes and capabilities we\u2019re certainly equipped to do it. I think it might have a small - greater impact on some of the smaller companies than the larger companies.","Specific to the ACURATE neo2 piece, the good news there is we\u2019ve initiated our US IDE clinical trials. So were on schedule to bring that second valve to the US market per our Investor Day. We are seeing a delay of - we think like six months to 12 months in Europe for our ACURATE neo2, obviously, won\u2019t impact our existing ACURATE and our embolic protection capabilities there.","But essentially what we\u2019ve tried to do is consolidate our regulatory submissions with fewer notified bodies in Europe. And in doing that we think we\u2019ll have better long-term performance working with fewer regulatory notified bodies and it will help future ACURATE portfolio expansion and approval timeline.","So it's not a product question with a specific valve, it's more of down selecting on the number of agencies that we\u2019re working with. A number of agencies in Europe given the number of them and the new MDR requirements is quite a challenge for them as well.","And so we think working with few of them and following that process will be best for Boston Scientific, but we think in near term, obviously there is some expense challenges and some minor delays in Europe with products.","Matt Taylor","Okay. Its very clear. And then emerging market growth continues to be really strong. Is there anything to call out there? And how long can you keep up this kind of 20% operational growth?","Michael Mahoney","Yeah. We\u2019ve been doing it for quite a while and the good news is it's across a number of countries. So China clearly is the largest catalyst there and the benefit there is we used to be primarily a Japanese company in Asia and now we\u2019re much more diversified with the strength in Australia, the Korean team, and the ongoing growth of China.","But China is really the key driver for us, the emerging markets and so much of its kind of our playbook of bringing all of our portfolio to China rather than just drug-eluting stents which is what it was historically.","Our PI business is growing exceptionally well in China, as is our complex coronary business and our WATCHMAN business and Endo and Uro and other divisions are scaling up there.","So I think it's an ongoing diversification of our portfolio getting our products approved there. So we expect continued momentum in China. So we don't see a slowdown in the second half in China or the emerging markets.","Also our team in Latin America continues - despite the challenges, that market continues to grow well above market and makes profitable rates. And we\u2019re seeing nice growth in certain parts of Middle East Africa and in the ASEAN countries. So there is quite a slew within the emerging markets, but China is the biggest driver.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Pasquale, Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Chris Pasquale","Mike just wanted to understand your comments on the FDA's updated guidance document coming out of the panel and maybe Dr. Meredith can chime in here too. Do you expect them to recommend paclitaxel products only be used in high-risk patients? Was unclear if you are saying that that was something you thought would actually take place.","Ian Meredith","Do you want me to take that Mike?","Michael Mahoney","Sure.","Ian Meredith","Yeah. So we don't want to speculate on what the FDA's position will actually be. But I was trying to draw from the statements that came from the 24 hour summary and the \u2013 in that 24-hour summary, the panel agreed that \u2013 the FDA panel agreed that we should continue to approve devices with 12-month follow-up clinical data to assess the safety and efficacy. And it is very likely that there will be a need for longer-term data to fully understand the \u2013 that signal.","I think, the fact that there was no clear class effect actually established and there is clear benefit and Mike alluded to the TLR differences we saw with Eluvia at both one and two years. That the \u2013 it's very likely that there will be continued use of paclitaxel as a prevention for restenosis.","Obviously, the \u2013 it's easy to suggest that it will be \u2013 there for high-risk patients. But I think one of the important comments that came out of this was, that it should be up to the physician and the patients to decide who is appropriate for that treatment.","Michael Mahoney","I think, just also, just for broad specific to BSC, when we look at our second half, third quarter guidance and implied fourth quarter guidance, we're assuming growth significantly slower than planned originally for the year. So we derisked the Eluvia sales quite a bit in our guidance appropriately, but we do see strong uptake in Japan, because this issue doesn't seem to be as concerning in Japan.","But more importantly, I think, it's just within our PI business the other growth drivers in addition, because there is questions around what happens with paclitaxel. So, we'll know more in the next 45 days.","But even if you remove Eluvia topic from the question, with closing of Interventional Oncology with BTG, the VENITI Stent that we have recently \u2013 are launching, there's a number of growth drivers within our PI business that will continue to strengthen that. We'll know more in 30 days on the FDA piece.","Chris Pasquale","Thanks. That's helpful. And then, just a follow up on LOTUS. REPRISE IV has been up and running now for a little while. Can you give us an updated time line?","Michael Mahoney","We're not expecting a home run on all in on paclitaxel when we gave our guidance. That's not the assumption when we gave our second half guidance.","Chris Pasquale","Thanks, Mike. And then just quickly on REPRISE IV. Just any update on the timing of enrollment completion there, when you guys expect that trial to get build? Just want to get a sense for when we could get label expansion and see that data? Thanks.","Ian Meredith","Okay. Yeah. So the recruitment in the REPRISE IV trial is going well and there\u2019s a lot of positive patient feedback on the REPRISE IV study and recruitment. It's a single-arm study, as you know, and that study should be on track to sort of completion with one year follow-up, probably early 2020. That\u2019s a completion of the patients in the study early 2020.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is Jason Mills of Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","Jason Mills","Good morning, Mike, Dan and team. Thanks for taking the question. Two product-related questions, Mike. First on EP and second on Neuromodulation, specifically SCS. EP is a plus grower for you, notwithstanding the growth has slowed. You talked about new product launches. Is that what will drive growth higher on sort of in the back end of the team's range commensurate with the market?","And what over the course of let\u2019s say the next couple of years, do you envision will also augment that business profile? Do you see this as double-digit grower over the longer term?","And I'll just ask my second question now, it\u2019s a short one with respect to SCS. Based on your performance with one other competitor, do you really think that you lost share in the United States SCS market? Or is the market sort of growing commensurate with what we've seen you report and one other competitor? Thank you.","Michael Mahoney","Yeah, in SCS, we just don't know yet. We had some nice product enhancements coming in the second half of the year. If you want to do our two year growth CAGR it's 15% or so. Tough comps this year and we haven\u2019t had some of the competitive report yet. So we\u2019ll know more in 45 days or so, whether we lost any share or gain share or held share in the quarter.","But on EP, Dr. Stein can comment. I think with EP this is a long-term commitment that we have in this business, given the size of the market and the growth profile and the overlap that we have on the call point capabilities. And so it's really a tale of two cities right now. We have strong growth in Europe where we have RHYTHMIA, its doing extremely well and our therapeutic catheter launch is doing quite well.","And so Europe I would say is growing above market and US is growing below market. And US we don't have the portfolio, all the portfolio pieces that Europe has. So I think Europe's a good indicator for us for the future. And beyond RHYTHMIA, which is doing well and the DirectSense therapeutic catheter, we hope to bring a differentiated trial momentum to the market by the end of the fourth quarter time period. So that will have a nice impact for us in 2020 in Europe and we\u2019ll start our US trial in the U.S.","So I think you'll see Europe continuing to grow quite a bit faster than market, second half of this year and in 2020. And the US likely will lag until we can get the DirectSense approval in the US, which we hope to be in the first half.","So once we get that then the US will grow more effectively and then once we get single shot, so I think you'll see longer term we\u2019ll be the only company with a full suite of mapping systems, therapeutic catheters and multiple shots on goal and single-shot. So portfolio will be quite differentiated. It just lags more in the US. Dr. Stein, do you have any comments?","Kenneth Stein","Yeah. Mike just to reiterate what you said, the key to our strategy is offering the most rounded, most comprehensive portfolio of tools that EPs need to treat complex arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation. So it's two different single-shot techniques cryoablation catheter, POLARx and RF balloon or LUMINIZE cath.","It\u2019s also having high density, high mapping, high resolution mapping with RHYTHMIA with DirectSense and then with what's to come our stable point catheter, which will be unique on the market having both force and DirectSense.","And then in addition to that thing like our acquisition of Securus, which is a infrared monitor for esophageal temp monitoring and protection during ablation procedures. There is no competitor that\u2019s able to offer that kind of a comprehensive portfolio.","And then as Joe and I have talked about at Investor\u2019s Day and at HRS, the path then to double-digit growth is also moving our product mix from what had traditionally been in the low growth segments of Electrophysiology into these higher growth segments, like complex mapping, like single-shot for atrial fibrillation. ","Susan Lisa","Great. Okay. Kevin, with that we are going to conclude the call. We thank everyone very much for joining us, and Kevin will now provide the replay details.","Operator","Thank you.
