Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Zac Nagle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Zac Nagle - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thanks and good morning, everyone. This is Zac Nagle and it's a pleasure to join you for my first Ingersoll-Rand earnings call as Vice President of Investor Relations. Welcome to Ingersoll-Rand's second quarter 2016 earnings conference call.","We released earnings this morning at 6:30 AM and the release is posted on our website. This call is also being webcast and archived on our website at ingersollrand.com, where you will find the presentation accompanying our comments this morning.","Please go to slide two. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results.","The presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release.","The participants on this morning's call are Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO; Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Joe Fimbianti, Director of Investor Relations.","With that, please go to slide three, and I will turn the call over to Mike.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Great, thank you, Zac, and officially welcome to Ingersoll-Rand and your first earnings call with us.","As you can see from our earnings release this morning, we had another excellent quarter. We had outstanding execution across the company, delivering 15% EPS growth, record operating margins, share gains, and strong cash flow, despite challenging industrial markets.","We are seeing strong momentum in the operating system that we have been installing and developing in the company over the past six-plus years.","As we did last quarter, I'd like to start out spending a few minutes linking this quarter's performance to the longer-term strategic direction of the company to help investors understand how we're building a more valuable, sustainable and less cyclical company over the longer term.","With our operating system, operational excellence and growth excellence have been cornerstones of the strategy from the beginning, with our goal of becoming the very best operating company within our diversified or multi-industry peer group. This quarter, we continued to deliver best-in-class operating leverage of 47%, and our goal is to achieve top-quartile organic growth for the quarter and for the year as well.","There were a number of noteworthy milestones that showed clear progress in these areas during the quarter. Our Residential HVAC business had another outstanding quarter with record revenue and profitability. We estimate that over the past quarter and 12 months we now have benchmarked profitability in this business and are seeing the benefits of a five-year effort to refresh the product line, align and reposition the channel and dramatically improve product management, manufacturing and supply chain. Our Residential business is also a model for the deployment of product growth teams who are delivering market share and margin growth.","Our Commercial HVAC business in North America had record second quarter bookings and revenue. Similar to our Residential HVAC story, we have executed on a consistent strategy with a goal to have the freshest, most energy efficient and reliable product line in the industry, and have supported that with consistent operational improvements along the way.","We continue to see double-digit increases in our controls business and high single-digit growth in our service business, consistent with our strategy to balance equipment with controls and services.","In the second quarter, Trane Commercial led the industry with a strong pipeline of new high-efficiency products, many of which earn our EcoWise badge for innovation that improves energy efficiency as compared to legacy product platforms while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.","Examples this quarter include the North American announcement of the new CenTraVac Centrifugal chiller portfolio using next-generation low global warming-potential refrigerant. The product is for large buildings and industrial applications in the U.S. and Canada.","We also announced a service program to retrofit the existing installed base for the next-generation low global warming-potential refrigerant, which protects and provides a viable option for our customers' past investment while achieving their own sustainability goals.","In Europe, we announced another four new products. The Sintesis eXcellent, a new air-cooled chiller with nearly zero global warming potential using next-generation refrigerant.","Airfinity, a complete new range of HVAC rooftop units designed to comply with the upcoming European Union Ecodesign regulations. They are light, compact and modular plug-and-play HVAC units that are compatible with wireless technology and designed to save time and money when retrofitting and improve the efficiency of existing buildings across Europe.","XStream, a new range of water-cooled screw chillers now available in Europe and the Middle East. The efficiency and capacity ratings are unmatched by any other screw chiller in the market today. We hope this will become a preferred option for critical applications like data centers, hospitals, process cooling, and district cooling and heating.","And finally, Trane's Balance, our second generation of innovative multi-pipe systems for high-efficiency simultaneous heating and cooling. The systems repurpose energy that is rejected and use renewable energy for heating.","Within our Thermo King North America, Europe, and Middle East business, we are demonstrating that we have a more resilient business than the past, expanding margins 270 basis points in a low-growth environment.","As we noted in our initial guidance, we believe that we could maintain or even grow margins with a 15% North American trailer pullback and flat overall volumes.","Today, the Thermo King business serves the refrigerated truck, trailer, marine container, air container, bus and rail, telematics, and auxiliary power unit markets, and the completeness of the portfolio has added to margins and the overall resiliency of the portfolio.","Also of interest, both our Residential HVAC and Thermo King North America, Europe, and Middle East business units have been fully deployed on the new ERP system for the past couple of quarters, and we believe we are now seeing the expected productivity throughout these business units. We continue to deploy new sites routinely in other business units each quarter.","We continue to be pleased with the tremendous execution we are seeing in our HVAC and Transport Refrigeration business in Asia-Pacific and in Latin America. Both regions demonstrated substantial margin improvement and share growth. HVAC bookings in Latin America were up 36% on an organic basis for the quarter, a really outstanding performance by that team and that region.","In Asia-Pacific, our Transport Refrigeration business continues to grow, with another 23% increase in bookings and 25% increase in revenue. Both are examples of finding pockets of growth within generally weak markets and then capitalizing on those opportunities.","Turning to our Industrial Segment, I want to start by saying that I have tremendous confidence in our leaders running these business units and they're operating in a very challenging environment. Within Compression Technologies in North America, which is our largest market for equipment, the 250 horsepower contact cooled rotary market is down 20%, and all other size ranges are also down in the high single-digit range, with only small 5 horse to 15 horse compressors showing year-over-year growth.","Against this backdrop, we are performing well and supplementing the business with service bookings of approximately 10% in the quarter.","Remember, too, that the last time we emerged from a down industrial cycle we grew margins nearly seven full points in a 24-month period.","Our fluid management business continues to perform well with modest growth, and we are seeing continued weakness in the tools business and no sign of recovery in our material handling business, which provides hoist and winches for the oil and gas industry.","Club Car continues to broaden its strategy and reach outside of golf with small electric vehicles in the commercial and consumer segments.","Turning to growth excellence, which encompasses the full value stream from strategic analytics, product management, new product and technology introduction, sales management, and service and support, this has been another cornerstone of our long-term strategy. We believe the product, channel and service footprint investments we've made over the past five years to seven years are paying off. It's clearly evident in the HVAC and Transport Refrigeration business units and we believe it will also be the case for our Compression Technology business unit that has been doing a similar investment program over the past couple of years, which will continue the next several years.","Even as industrial markets are challenging today, we continue the investment in the Compression Technologies business because we expect we'll be rewarded as the market recovers. As one example, one of the product growth teams operates in the Compression Technology business and covers a specific product portfolio which equates to about 10% of the overall revenue of that business. Within the product growth team we're seeing year-to-date bookings increases of 30% and revenues increasing by 17%.","Its strength in our Climate segment, capacity utilization, and our shared climate and industrial plants and operations and leveraging our technology teams that's allowing us the opportunity to stay the course on critical growth programs in our Industrial segment. We have continued to invest in strategic growth programs across the company through both good and difficult times and the benefits of doing so are clear. Our designated strategic growth programs, many of which are managed through our product growth team process, are growing at a rate three times faster than the underlying growth rate of the company.","As another example, within the Commercial HVAC business in North America, Europe and the Middle East our strategic growth programs are growing at a 14% rate this year and for the company 80% plus of our growth is coming from investment and focus on these critical strategic growth programs, so as is our model will leverage the success and build and accelerate on the full deployment of this element of our operating system in the years ahead.","Going forward, we see multiple investment opportunities to deliver long-term growth through innovation and differentiation of the product, software and services we provide. I don't think anyone on this call needs another presentation on the Internet of Things and the possibilities for how that will transform competition and opportunity.","This macro trend is squarely centered on nearly every growth and productivity strategy in our company, whether it's connected buildings, intelligent monitoring and service, diagnostic and self-healing systems, telematics, consumer marketing and fulfillment and too many other digital concepts to list. We're funding a number of these ideas centrally within the corporate expense line and are likely to accelerate this incubation investment later this year. Incremental 2016 investment for this activity is already embedded in our guidance.","Finally, building on the culture element of our model, high-quality teams and deep employee engagement are critical to any sustained transformation, and I'm pleased that we continue to excel in these areas.","One source of great pride within Ingersoll-Rand is our ability to walk the talk on sustainability. To make the point, we continue to see benchmark levels for employee engagement; world-class safety performance for any segment of industry; energy reduction of 5% on an absolute, not volume-adjusted, basis; a 14% reduction in water consumption, also on an absolute basis; and similar reductions of both hazardous and non-hazardous waste.","So Sue will take you through the quarter in detail. I just felt it was important to align how today's results reinforce the strategy of the company, how we intend to keep delivering great results, and why you should believe we're building a more valuable, sustainable, and less cyclical company for our shareholders.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Sue.","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thank you, Mike. Let's go to slide four. This is a summary slide that I'd like to begin with and give you some takeaway from today's call. As Mike has discussed, Q2 was another strong operational quarter for us, and it shows through the financial results that we posted. In the second quarter, we drove year-over-year organic revenues higher by 3%, adjusted margins up 80 basis points with a leverage of over 45%, and adjusted earnings per share up 15% against the backdrop of a very slow growth environment and particularly challenged industrial markets.","Adjusted earnings per share of $1.38 exceeded our guidance range of $1.27 to $1.32 by $0.08 at the midpoint and $0.06 at the high end. Our $0.08 beat versus our midpoint was driven by exceptionally strong performance in our Climate segment, partially offset by challenged markets in our Industrial segment and about a $0.06 beat from a lower tax rate in the quarter. And as I'll discuss in detail later, we believe we'll maintain a 200 basis point lower average tax rate than our previous guidance of 24% to 25% for 2016.","We also posted strong year-to-date free cash flow of $348 million, up $293 million from the prior year. We're seeing the benefits of our focus on working capital management and our business operating system, and with that we're raising our free cash flow forecast to $1 billion to $1.1 billion, excluding the proceeds from the sale of Hussmann.","Let's turn to segment results. The Climate segment continues to exceed expectations, driven largely by outstanding execution in both Commercial and Residential HVAC with mid-single-digit growth and high-single-digit growth, respectively. Margins also showed healthy expansion, driven by strong volume, productivity improvements, and material deflation of nonferrous commodities. We also continue to invest in the business in order to drive sustainable growth.","The Industrial segment's end markets are more challenged than previously forecast, and we experienced negative growth in all the major end markets except Small Electric Vehicles, which is our Club Car business, and fluid management, where we continue to see growth.","Across Industrial, we continue to take measures to drive productivity, shift our mix further towards more profitable aftermarket services and parts markets, and to make prudent cost reductions in the business. We continue to be committed to a dynamic capital allocation strategy focused on delivering high returns to shareholders over the long term. Our strong free cash flow generation and cash balances provide us important options as the markets evolve.","And lastly, we've bumped up the bottom end of our guidance range by $0.05, and our current adjusted continuing operations earnings per share for 2016 is $4 to $4.10. This update reflects expected continued strong growth in our Climate segment and tailwinds resulting from a lower go-forward structural tax rate of 22% to 23%, partially offset by continued weakness in our Industrial end markets, where we're not seeing the signs of recovery we had originally anticipated in our prior guidance.","Now, if you'd go to slide five, let's begin discussing additional details regarding the second quarter. Our business operating system again guided us through good execution in our factories and in our cost centers. Our focus was on good operating results in a low-growth environment, and we delivered against that objective.","Enterprise revenues were up 3% organically, with Climate up 5% and Industrial down 3%. HVAC revenues grew in each of our Climate businesses, led by Commercial and Residential HVAC in North America. Thermo King North America and EMEA truck and trailer revenues continued to be strong in the quarter. Industrial markets declined in the quarter, consistent with the overall market. Club Car performed as expected, with mid-single-digit growth year-over-year.","Our adjusted operating margins grew 80 basis points year-over-year, with operating leverage exceeding 45%. Our strength in margin expansion was driven through price realization, productivity gains, and direct material deflation. We've inserted a margin table on the slide, and that'll illustrate some of the items I just talked about.","We completed the sale of our remaining interest in Hussmann on April 1, 2016, for a gain of approximately $398 million.","Let's go to slide six. Orders for the second quarter of 2016 were up 3% organically. Climate orders were up 6% organically. Organic global Commercial HVAC bookings were up high single digits, similar to the first quarter, led by low-teens growth in North America applied and unitary and strong growth of 36% in Latin America, which was against a relatively easy compare in 2015.","Asia bookings continued to be lumpy from quarter to quarter and were down in Q2 overall, while China was up low single digits. We continued to see excellent growth in service, controls and contracting, with low-teens growth in the quarter.","Residential bookings were up low teens, representing the fourth consecutive quarter of bookings growth above 10%. Organic Transport orders were down mid-single digits with order growth in overseas markets offset by declines in North America trailer and auxiliary power units.","Consistent with the expectations we set out earlier in the year, we continue to expect bookings to decline in North America trailer in the second half of the year, and this is built into our guidance. Transport orders in Asia were up 23% in the second quarter.","Overall, we anticipated some recovery in the Industrial markets as we moved through Q2 and the balance of the year. But we're seeing continued challenges and market declines. Net orders in the Industrial segment were down 5% organically. We saw a high single-digit order decline in Compression Technologies and Services.","Services continued to be a bright spot and were up high single digits as we continued to focus on the business with higher-margin product streams. We saw a low-teens decline in other Industrial products and a high single-digit increase in Club Car.","Now if you'll go to slide seven, please. This slide provides a directional view of our segment revenue performance by region. In our Climate segment, which was up 5% in the second quarter, we saw solid performance in North America and low single-digit growth across Europe, Asia and Latin America.","We saw a decline in the Middle East, consistent with the contraction in the number of building projects planned, primarily in Saudi Arabia, and we would expect this to continue for some time as low oil prices are driving an investment pullback.","Our Industrial segment performance in the second quarter, which was down 3%, is representative of the ongoing volatility and declining markets that continue across the globe in Industrial markets. Our regional Industrial markets declined except for Europe and Asia, which were up.","Let's go to slide eight, please. Climate revenues of $2.9 billion for the quarter were strong, up 5% organically. Commercial HVAC organic revenues were up mid-single digits, led by 20% growth in North America contracting and upper single-digit growth in unitary equipment shipments in North America.","Europe had equipment growth in the mid-teens and high single-digit growth in services, contracting, and parts. The Middle East revenues declined, largely due to a sharp pullback in Saudi Arabia, as I mentioned earlier.","Residential revenues were at record levels and up high single digits in the second quarter. Transport organic revenues were up low single digits in the quarter. Truck and trailer organic revenues were up high single digits overall, with improved revenues in North America, Europe, and Asia.","We also had a high single-digit improvement in aftermarket volumes. Marine container organic revenues declined more than 60% in the second quarter, reflecting a soft first half at various box builders for 2016. We also had lower sales of auxiliary power units, reflecting the decline in the Class 8 sleeper market.","Please go to slide nine. Our Climate operating margins grew 250 basis points year-over-year. Our strength was broad based, based on volume, price, direct material deflation, and productivity gains, and we continue to invest in the business for sustainable growth.","Please go to slide 10. Second quarter revenues for the Industrial segment were $753 million, down 3% on an organic basis. Compression Technologies and services' organic revenues were down low single digits versus last year and Industrial Products were down mid-teens, with growth in fluid management and declines in material handling equipment and tools.","Small Electric Vehicles, also known as Club Car, organic revenues were up mid-single digits versus prior year from gains in equipment and aftermarket. Regionally, the decline in organic Industrial revenues was led by a mid-single-digit decline in the Americas and the Middle East. Asia and Europe were up modestly, partially offsetting the declines.","Please go to slide 11. Industrial's operating margin of 9.1% was down 250 basis points compared with last year. Lower volumes were the largest driver, partially offset by pricing, material deflation, and productivity. Despite the downturn, we continued to invest in the business for the long term.","Additionally, capitalized costs related to new product engineering and development were reclassified to the income statement in Q2, which were a drag on margin of approximately $8 million, or 1.1 percentage points, for the Industrial segment. Excluding this adjustment, Industrial adjusted margins were 10.9% in Q2.","Moving forward, we expect Industrial segment performance to trend with the market. We are planning on expanding margins in a down market in the second half of the year through aftermarket growth, productivity gains, and cost controls.","Please go to slide 12. Our June year-to-date free cash flow of $348 million was favorable to prior year by $293 million. Strong operating income improvement and improved working capital performance were the primary drivers of the favorability. Because of our strong start to the year we have raised our free cash flow forecast range to $1 billion to $1.1 billion from our previous range of $950 million to $1 billion.","For the quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 5.6%. We had strong collections in the quarter with our days sales outstanding improving 0.6 days over the prior year and days payable outstanding improving 0.7 days. Inventory is on plan for the quarter and we are well-positioned to serve our customers.","Please go to slide 13. Our cash performance in the second quarter and our expectations for the year enable us to, one, continue to invest in the strategic growth programs that Mike outlined earlier. In addition to the core strategic investments, we're also investing in long-term growth through innovation and differentiated product in such areas as connected buildings, intelligent monitoring and self-healing systems, just to name a few.","Two, we will also maintain a strong balance sheet with a BBB credit metrics. And three, we will also maintain \u2013 we will also retain optionality relative to paying a competitive dividend, acquisitions to build the business and share repurchases.","Please go to slide 14. As always, our intention is to give you our best view of what we're seeing in our end markets sitting here today and how that translates to our revenue guidance for 2016. We have broken it down by major end markets and geographies.","As you can see by the variation of colors and symbols, our end markets are seeing a wide variation in trends. North America Commercial HVAC and Residential HVAC as well as European Transport and Commercial HVAC markets are generally positive while global Industrial markets are declining. We are forecasting Transport markets in North America to be down low single digits.","Our forecast for North America trailer volume has not changed and we expect the market to be down slightly for the year. This implies a decline in the second half after single-digit growth in the first half of the year. Asian HVAC markets are expected to be flat to down and Industrial markets in Asia remain under pressure.","Golf cart markets are slightly down, offset by increases in the utility vehicle markets. All of our revenue growth forecasts are shown on an organic basis. We are forecasting mid-single-digit growth in Commercial HVAC in total; high single-digit growth in Residential HVAC, which is essentially an all-North America business for us; and a flat to small decline in Transport globally.","We expect Compression-related products and other Industrial equipment to be down high single digits. We expect Club Car to be up low single digits.","Please go to slide 15. Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect our organic revenues for the full year 2016 to be up 2% to 3% versus 2015, with foreign exchange presenting a headwind of about 1 percentage point. We expect Climate revenues to be up 4% to 5% organically. For Industrial, we expect organic revenues to be down 4% to 5%.","For operating margins, we're excluding restructuring costs to get to adjusted margins. We expect adjusted operating margins in Climate to be between 14% and 14.5%. We expect adjusted Industrial margins to be between 10% and 11%, and for the enterprise we expect adjusted operating margins of 11.5% to 12%.","Please go to slide 16. Transitioning to earnings, the reported earnings per share range is estimated to be $5.47 to $5.57 and the adjusted range is $4 to $4.10, versus our prior guidance range of $3.95 to $4.10. Adjusted numbers exclude restructuring and the Hussmann gain.","Our full-year guidance reflects a tax rate forecast of 22% to 23% and an average diluted share count of approximately 261 million shares. The tax rate reflects a 200 basis point improvement versus prior guidance of 24% to 25%.","For the third quarter of 2016, revenues are forecasted to be up by approximately 3% organically. We are projecting Climate revenues to grow mid-single digits in Q3 and Industrial to decline low single digits. Adjusted third quarter earnings per share are forecasted to be between $1.25 and $1.30, excluding restructuring charges of about a penny.","For the full year of 2016, we also raised our free cash flow expectations and now expect free cash flow to be between $1 billion and $1.1 billion, excluding restructuring charges and proceeds from the sale of Hussmann.","And with that, I am going to turn it back to Mike for a few closing comments.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Okay, great. Thank you, Sue, and let's go to slide 17. So to conclude, we had an excellent quarter grounded in solid execution. I am proud of the many people within Ingersoll-Rand that continue to deliver for our customers and for our shareholders.","I am pleased with the progress and the momentum and the implementation of our operating system and the growing depth and bench strength throughout the company that makes the operating system come to life through continuous improvement.","We're building a stronger, more valuable, more sustainable and less cyclical Ingersoll-Rand than ever before and it's exciting to me and leaders throughout the company to be part of that transformation and to help create a bright future with more individual development possibilities for all our people throughout the world.","The results we reported this morning are a direct result of the strategic work, the persistence, the tenacity of the talented people that represent the unique culture we're building. It is a strategic advantage and it is the toughest thing in any business for a competitor to copy.","There are a few takeaways I want to point out to you as we head to the back half of the year and into 2017. First, the Industrial businesses are running effectively in a very tough market environment.","The management team is aggressively taking and will continue to take the right actions to reduce the overall cost structure of the business and is committed to protecting the key product and service investments that will build long-term growth and margin expansion when the markets improve.","Second, the Transport market is performing as we expected. As we said at the beginning of the year, we expected the first-half results to be up and the back half of the year would be down.","The management team has done an effective job anticipating and seeing around the corners and is proactively taking the actions to ensure strong margin performance continues.","Third, commodity deflation has been a tailwind during the first half of the year and it's going to moderate to neutral in the back half of the year. We have a long track record of managing the price-to-material input equation very effectively and we're going to continue to do so going forward.","And finally, let me say we are proactively reviewing both prior restructuring considerations as well as new actions as our business, markets and even the input variables into our own models continue to evolve.","Although we don't have any immediate additional restructuring actions to take or announce today, we won't hesitate to take additional prudent restructuring actions going forward.","So with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question today comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, good morning. Before I ask my question, I just wanted to clarify. Sue, did you mention the tax rate of 22%, 23% is now a structural tax rate going forward?","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yes, it's 22% to 23% and that's the ongoing rate.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great. That's very clear. Mike, obviously very strong booking orders, bookings for North American Commercial HVAC in North America low teens. You mentioned a 25% number on the last call. I am not sure whether you're comparing apples to apples here, but maybe just clarify that 25% is the low teens that you actually booked and maybe if you could just dig into the health of the light commercial versus applied unitary markets.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yes, Nigel, thanks for the question. Actually, I would expect two quarters of similar growth, two quarters of teens versus one 20-plus% quarter, so I think that's intact. The pipeline, frankly, has never been healthier than it is right now, and it is healthy through all the institutional large project work.","Commercial is maintaining some resiliency that we are seeing here, and unitary, at the light levels, still strong for us. So Residential all the way up through light commercial still remains very strong for us across the board.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great, so no signs of weakness there. And then just on the Climate margin outlook, you have done 13.8% in the first half of the year. The low end or the mid to lower end of your margin guidance at Climate would suggest basically flat margins in the second half of the year, which seems pretty bearish. Maybe just contextualize why you see an outlook for maybe 14% at the low end.","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","So, Nigel, let me start out and Mike can add his comments as we go forward. So as I think about a Climate in the back half of the year, you're going to have a couple of different dynamics, the first of which, as we talked about, was that direct material was going to moderate in terms of its deflationary environment. So let me talk about that for just a second.","What we expect to see in the back half of the year is we expect to see that steel, particularly in the fourth quarter, is going to turn more inflationary then deflationary. So that's part of what's happening with the flatter margins.","We're also going to continue to invest in the overall business in the back half of the year. Again, we have got some significant product launches and we see this as an area that really sets us up for success. So it is really price, a little bit of mix that comes from us lapping the 14 SEER in Residential, and then investment in the business.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","And, Nigel, I'd just say to me the biggest number on the page is we're putting half a point \u2013 50 basis points of margin back into investment, and it's a formula that's worked for us, it sets us up well for 2017, and we like what we're getting out of those investments.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thank you. Just on the Industrial margin guide for the second half, so it looks like you're looking at a margin of maybe 11%, 11.5% in the second half. The clean margin was 10.9% in Q2. So I thought maybe there'd be a bit more coming through to support margins from productivity or cost reduction. So I just wondered why maybe there wasn't a bit more urgency around getting the cost out. It looks as if the sort of margin decline is going to be similar second half as first half.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","I'm sorry \u2013 Julian, starting I would say that again for me the most important thing that's happening there is they're really, say, 40% through an investment cycle there that there's just no reason to stop and go on that. And so that continues for the balance of the year for us, and that's something that I think is vitally important.","There's a tremendous effort underway at reducing costs in that business, much of what's not just visible through what you'd say would be qualified restructuring. Much of that is just reduction in place and just other containment actions being taken in the business. So that really, when I say the business is being run effectively, I have no doubt that all the rocks are being turned over, with the exception of protecting this critical investment pool that is important to us going forward.","And I use that one example for you because it happens to be the example of the product growth team is the one product area that we have launched in that portfolio and we're getting tremendous results with that. So, again, this gives us some confidence that although it's not a great story for the third and the fourth quarter, we're not running the company for the third and the fourth quarter. We're running the company for the long run, and we hope investors see that.","And that's part of the reason I think taking good success around the Climate business, keeping utilization up through the combined factory structures that we've got, leveraging the network's excellence across the Compression-related businesses that we have, give us the opportunity to stay the course on these investments, and that's really important.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Very clear. And then my follow-up would just be you touched on the input cost impact in Q4. I think the last numbers I have on the sort of COGS (37:02) are from 2010 or 2011, the last time materials were an interesting issue. Is there any update you could give on the breakdown of COGS in terms of sort of raw materials versus processed materials and components and so forth?","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Sure. So if you think about \u2013 and what I'll do is I'll give it to you in terms of dollars. So if you think about direct material spend for the company, Julian, it's about, say, $6 billion a year in direct material spend. If you then break that down into the commodities that we're talking about, it's roughly about 10% to 12% of that. And as you think about then breaking that down even further, steel is going to be the largest component, with copper and aluminum following that. And so the price pressure that we're thinking about in the back half is on steel, because copper and aluminum are pretty much staying the course with what we've seen.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Hi, Jeff.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hey, Mike, just thinking kind of bigger picture here strategically, you guys are actually doing a really solid job operationally, and I can't help but look at Lennox at 22 times earnings and Atlas Copco at 22 times earnings and just wonder if you're actually reevaluating the portfolio. I know you went through the exercise with Allegion and the businesses that you retain are air-oriented businesses, but do you have any thought or response to that question or that idea?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah, Jeff, it's a great question, and thanks for the opportunity to step back and look at it, because I look back over the seven years that I've been in this role and I remember when Industrial was the sweetheart of the portfolio, right, from 2009 to 2011, even through 2013, and we were expanding margins so fast that it afforded us the opportunity to do all the great investment we made in the Trane res and commercial businesses, which is really why you're seeing the numbers that you're seeing today in that business.","And so now it's flipped. You remember that was all happening with no real commercial \u2013 certainly no institutional support coming from construction markets. And now that's flipped and it's allowed us the opportunity to keep factories fairly loaded. It's given us the opportunity to keep technical professionals highly engaged in development of product, and all that really just sets up where at some point when the commercial market in HVAC slows down, when institutional eventually fades, our hope is that we've got a strong, refreshed, energy-efficient, reliable portfolio sitting particularly in Compression Technologies. And we're going to leverage that, just like we did from 2009 to 2011 when it grew 7 full points. We are very leveraged here toward some of those fixed costs. Where we play in the market is in the big machine. It's not the Cameron \u2013 and when I talk Cameron I'm talking about Cameron plus all the 250 to 400 horse centrifugal air compressors, of which we're the leader now in that area. And we don't really participate much in the vacuum and blower business, which had some growth in it.","So we have a product portfolio and a position in the market in these larger machines. That's what's getting hurt right now, and we're not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater here on that, for sure. That's why in addition to \u2013 I had mentioned the product development, but the machining investments, I mentioned last call and this call, those are going to continue. And we will put $50 million into machining in this downturn, so that when we emerge out of this thing we're going to be more productive. The hope is that it's not just 7 points of margin. It's more than 7 points of margin coming back.","So Jeff, I think I really have got my head around the value of what we have created around integrating the portfolio, and over the long run not really so interested in a flash in the pan around some multiple for short cycle. I'm really interested in building the value of the company over the long run. And again, step back to 2009, Jeff. If you invested back in 2009, you are a very happy investor and I thank you for all the Christmas cards we get to that effect. But it's because we've had the portfolio that we've had.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes, I had a heroic buyback in 2009. Thanks for that perspective. Also, then, just on the balance sheet, Mike...","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Hey, Jeff, just before you do that, incremental margins every single year have been in the top quartile. Organic growth rates almost every single year have been in the top quartile. We've done that with elements of the portfolio firing and not firing at various points in time, and I just have to believe that there is value in that and there is industrial logic around what we are doing around the sustainability and energy efficiency fronts of the business. So go ahead.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","I agree. Your performance has been great. You are not getting fully paid for it. The balance sheet, what is the plan for the year-end? Sue gave us the kind of a generalized color, but with the Hussmann proceeds and the strong cash flow, would you be opportunistically looking to step in share repurchase this year? I can't imagine the M&A pipeline is that active, but perhaps it is.","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","So Jeff, let me take a shot at that, and then I'm going to let Mike jump in. But I am going to kind of use some of the same passion that Mike had in his comments on the multiples and what we have built at Ingersoll-Rand. From a perspective of our cash generation and then our ensuing capital allocation, we're really trying to create longer-term shareholder value with the cash that we are generating. And so what we have seen that has been really successful for us is investing in our products and investing in areas like energy efficiency and sustainability. Those are proven for us in terms of building our growth excellence.","If we look at operational excellence, all of the work that we've done and invested in the company, whether it is in our factories or in our overall processes with the business operating system, all of that has shown to be something that has worked very well for us. So our preference, as we think about capital allocation and your question, is to really invest and grow the company.","So to be more specific than in terms of what that means, it means I want to continue to invest. It means I want to continue to do all of those things. It means we want to look at the M&A pipeline. But what we have is an opportunity where we can be patient, we can wait for the right opportunity and not just take the cash that we are generating and run out and buy something.","So we're really, really thinking about investment. We are thinking about M&A. Dividends are extremely important to us. We understand that and we're going to continue to have dividends that are in line with our peer payout ratios, and we will also be opportunistic about share repurchase. I don't want to take that completely off the table, but if I set our preference up, it is going to be to build longer-term value through investments in the business and acquisitions.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yes, I agree, Jeff, with Sue's comments completely, obviously. But I would tell you that the competitive dividend's a given and the fact that we are controlling dilution in the share count is a given. We don't want to dilute shareholders through that, so that's a given. The optionality beyond that, we want to be really smart allocators of capital and we want to have our eyes wide open on how we do that. When you get big dislocations in the share price, we want to be opportunistic and we were in the first quarter between $48 and $51 a share. Clearly, that was a good idea. And we have been opportunistic when we saw value in long-term creation through acquisitions. And so we will continue to do that. Now all that being said, I think we have less than $1 billion in cash, so that's not a whole lot of cash we are talking about for a company our size to be walking around with.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you very much, guys. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And welcome, Zac.","Zac Nagle - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thank you.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So my first question, maybe following up on Jeff's point there on maybe just the investment that you're making in Industrial, Mike. I am just wondering how much of it is playing catch-up versus really investing for future growth? And then, how do you balance that with the idea that we're kind of seven years to eight years into this economic recovery and could be in this kind of lower-growth environment for some time?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah, Joe, actually the efficiencies of the product launch, the 40% of the portfolio I told you about, are in the range of 9% to 13% more efficient than anything out in the marketplace. That's how we're going to market, around value, around total cost of ownership, and that's why that business is up in the high teens and bookings are closer to 30%.","We know there is no purpose in us playing catch-up to a me-too. So every single thing we have done has been to leapfrog the efficiency and reliability of what's out there. And if you just look to the Trane portfolio, you would see that. In every launch we've made, not only is it more efficient than anything in the marketplace, but it is using refrigerants that go way past the HFC phase-out. So we're not meeting anybody kind of where they are; we are leapfrogging. And this whole strategic analytics piece of our business operating system of really figuring out kind of where to go attack, specifically. And then having those strategic growth programs outlined with the resources, the talent, the investments outlined and making sure that no matter what we do, we are committing to that, is why you get 80% plus of the growth happening through the areas we are focusing on. And that doesn't come from me-too catch-up.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. That makes sense. How do the investments then, maybe thinking about it through the lens of Industrial, perhaps you can provide just some color there?","Unknown Speaker","Well, I'm not sure, what the investments are specifically in Industrial, Joe?","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","No, just I guess just specifically around the investments that you're making in Industrial. You've been in like this really just this weaker-growth environment, probably expected to persist for quite some time. I'm just trying to get a sense for whether there is some catch-up to do on the Industrial side, whether your portfolio is better positioned than your peers. Just any color \u2013 any colors on the competitive dynamics in the investments that you're making.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah. I mean, the investments we're making are obviously in the areas that we're not leading, so any place we're not leading is a right spot for it. So if we're leading in 250 horse to 400 horse in the world, we'll keep that competitive and we'll make sure that we're not losing that position, but we're tacking in the other areas that we think are going to grow. That's sort of the general view. And you can understand why I'm not going to be more specific than that, because we would rather book it and have margin improvement versus just talking about it and really signaling where we're going competitively around this stuff. That's not been our style at all.","But I'll tell you that it starts with the strategic analytics being right and the investments being very specific, and the product growth teams \u2013 so engineering, operations, and product management agreeing and working toward the one or two most critically important things to grow share and margin in a very specific product line or service line has been the formula for us that has been successful. We're going to continue to do that.","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","And so the other thing that I would add, Mike, just as a practical matter, Joe, for what you're talking about is the investments that are ongoing in Industrial are going to be in the same general areas, as you would expect. They're going to be in new products. They're going to be in operational excellence, so improving our operating results, and they also include some channel investments, particularly in the Compression Technologies business. So all the areas you might expect.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got you. That makes sense. And just one real quick one for you, Sue, on just the price cost breakdown this quarter. How much did material deflation versus price contribute?","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","So it was \u2013 so let me take you back to Q1 where it was about 50-50, price and direct material deflation. In the second quarter, it was a little more direct material deflation, but really kind of a 60-40 kind of look with deflation and price, and we were price positive in both segments.","And so if you remember when we gave guidance and talked about the second quarter, we had originally called that at 110 basis points and it came in at 120 basis points. So again, it performed exactly as we expected it to in the quarter, and I'll repeat the Q1 comment of we didn't have breakage, so it was a good result.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah, Joe, I actually want to take you back to the Industrial question just for a second. I just had one more comment here. I made a comment about the strength of the management team, which ultimately I think is what really investors need to believe in and buy. And I look at our Industrial Segment management team, and I can tell you that the top five to 10 executives running that part of the business co-architected the entire business operating system with me since it began. I couldn't have higher confidence in our ability to win as the markets recover. So I want to make sure that that point is really clear. It is a very strong management team paying attention to the details in that business.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks and good morning, all.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, Steve.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey. It looks like you are certainly taking profitable share gain on the Climate side, but what's going on in VRF there? And then on the Industrial side, Atlas Copco Compressor Technique orders were up 1% in the quarter. I know they have got a different mix. I know they have got vacuum and also a slightly smaller North American presence. Maybe would that explain at all or is there something else going on as well that we should be aware of?","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yeah, look, in no particular order, Steve, if you look at Atlas Copco's business, they are going to be strong in oil-free rotary and certainly in a smaller range than our large centrifugal machines. We have got great oil-free product and are growing that business, too, but obviously that's the bulk of what you see with Atlas Copco's business. Vacuum and blowers you called out, and that's actually still been a market growing.","When you think about oil free or vacuums and blowers, you have to think about the industries that they go into, and those industries happen to be growing as well, as opposed to some of the heavier industries that would use some of the larger centrifugal machines, for the most part.","So we do a very thorough compare with all public information that we can pick up from all of our various competitors, not just a single competitor, have a good understanding of sort of how that mix looks and then we're realists about where the opportunity is for us to self-help where we can. Right now, the self-help comes into growing the service businesses and they're doing a great job with that. It also comes into refreshing and developing the portfolio in sort of the smaller-range machines. And that's where we're going to play going forward.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, and on the VRF side?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","VRF, we're \u2013 very well. It is growing faster than the underlying unitary business. We continue to have a very high share; no slowdown there from us at all.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, and then just following up on your earlier comments around the balance sheet and whatnot, but I guess, Mike, in the past you have talked about there being kind of opportunity for consolidation within the overall HVAC market. Do you still \u2013 how are you thinking about that, given the dynamics of the industry going forward? Do you think there is still room in that?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","I do. I think they are big moves and I think that you look at what we did with acquiring Cameron's compressor business, and we had synergies in the first year of 15% and we will drive it higher this year. So, look, I think great synergies exist and I think that these opportunities are happening, but I think they are bigger, more complex deals.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, all right, great. Thanks.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys, good morning.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Hi, Steve.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So what exactly is going on here in Industrial? This just seems like relative to where you were it was viewed as kind of a high-quality business with pretty solid margins, and it just seems like every single quarter we are just getting deeper and deeper into a hole here. I guess you mentioned the end markets. How much \u2013 just remind us, including Cameron, how much is oil and gas? And then, how much would be in and around oil and gas? And maybe we're just kind of mislabeling some of the end markets, perhaps, and you guys, like everybody else, do have more exposure there than we would have thought initially.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah, Steve, so I'll save the oil and gas math for somebody at the end here, but if you look at the biggest market we're in on big machines, and I use 250 to 400 horsepower as being a big machine, down 20%. Actually as you go up between 250 and 400 and past 400, those growth rates start to look like minus 50%, okay, from where they were. These are the most capital-intensive sort of factories we have, and that certainly when we have those kinds of volume drops really adversely affects our mix.","So you look at volume alone contributing 3 points of negativity on the bridge, you can see what volume does. And as a proof point, again, go back and look at 2009 through 2011, look what happened when volume came in after we had been effectively restructuring the footprint there, and that's where that 7 points came from. So we're heavily leveraged toward that any way you slice it, and that's the main reason for it. Now on the oil and gas side?","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah, so oil and gas is really going to be sort of a low single-digit percentage, Steve. I mean that's part of the issue because you don't have large projects, but it's really the derivative, so all the other projects just aren't happening, and so it sort of gets labeled with oil and gas.","So let me step back and also add to what Mike was talking about. When I started talking about Industrial early in 2016 and I was sort of breaking it down into pieces for you, what I said was that Club Car was about 20% of the business and it was going to be up sort of low to mid-single digits, that the aftermarket was about 30% of the Industrial segment and that it was going to be up low single digits. Then I talked about the big machines being down in excess of 20% and some of the small rotary and small air being up slightly for the year, and then some of the other businesses, like the material handling business and the tools businesses, being down sort of mid-single digits for the year.","If I take that and transform that now into what we're seeing in 2016 after two quarters, Club Car, the same spot. They're growing in the mid-single-digits range and that's on track. The aftermarket piece of Industrial is continuing to grow. So you have got sort of solid footing with about 50% of the business.","However, when you get over into the other side where I talked about large machines being down 20%, as Mike said, they're now down 50%, so they are down way larger than what we thought. And even some of the smaller equipment is really much more pressured than I thought it was going to be, and instead of being up sort of low single digits it's going to be down. So you really just have a lot of dynamics that are going on there with the Industrial business, and to bring it back and wrap it around your question about oil and gas and projects, again, it's really the derivative effect for us in most of our Industrial businesses, where the large projects just aren't happening and the ones that are happening are much more competitive.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yes, it's a bit of a Yogi Berra euphemism, but the business will turn when our customers start spending money on these larger plants, and so that needs to happen.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, I just don't know of anything like in my sector. I'm not blaming you guys at all. It is what it is. But just outside of \u2013 if you said, hey, it's down 50%, we can look at oil and gas CapEx and that's like, oh, that's obvious. I mean in fact in the market right now everybody's getting credit for a 50% increase in oil and gas-related spending next year, in some instances. So I don't know what in the economy, other than oil and gas, is seeing 50% year-on-year declines. Even things like big gas turbines out there, big-ticket items are certainly not seeing 50% \u2013 maybe 20% declines, not 50% declines. So I just \u2013 that's kind of the source of my question, you know what I mean?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","There's a spot between sort of small plants and energy production that is a large plant. Steel would be a great example of that, marine, these are heavy industries that use large machines for air and that's really kind of where we're suffering on that.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That makes a ton of sense, then. If it's that derivative type of stuff, that makes a ton of sense. One last question, Middle East you said was down. How much was the Middle East down in Commercial HVAC in the quarter?","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","EMEA was down about 14%.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks a lot, guys.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","And, Steve, I'm going to add one point. Material handling, if you go back and bridge over a multiyear period, it was 2, 2.5 points of op margin that went away as that business went down 90% or so for us, okay. So you don't want to look at Industrial and kind of hang it all back on a comparison to Atlas Copco on compressors. You want to make sure you understand there's a couple of points of margin there, about a point in tools. Currency is a hit, and then you got the volume impact that we talked about on the bridge.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Good afternoon. I guess I won't belabor the Industrial business. On Transportation, could you just talk as to what you saw in the quarter that your view has changed? Because before you were sort of saying how the North American truck cycle was decoupled from the reefer market, and it seems like you've changed your view.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Andrew, there's subtleties moving inside that, but the view has always been you're going to see a pullback in North American trailer, as much as 15% in flat TK, and the mix is changing slightly within that, but that's really what's happening for the full year.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And can we talk about cadence of Transportation weakening into the second half, third quarter versus fourth quarter decline, and any preliminary thoughts on 2017?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Q3 will look weak, because the compare was so strong last year that it sits the highest of high compares for us there, and then moderates a little bit in terms of the comparisons for the fourth quarter. But again, you take the first half of the year and balance it out to flat with no change and marine container being weak and really all the change coming with North American truck and trailer and a little bit coming, obviously, from APUs with just Class 8 sleeper production being down.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thank you.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And as we have reached the time allotted for our call, our final question will come from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, good morning, guys.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Good morning.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","So, Mike, just you changed your guidance in Climate from 4% to 6% to 4% to 5%, but just following up on Andrew's question, is the difference really APUs or is it marine or is it Middle East, or is it a combination of the three?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Middle East is much weaker than we anticipated at the beginning of the year, and as you can imagine, it is a large HVAC business, and so the drag on the Middle East is fairly material. We're seeing some growth in China. That growth was really around shipping product that was booked, but we really haven't seen the pickup in China, per se.","If you look at China non-residential construction, it's still negative, but for the past six months or seven months it has been trending up. I think it has gone from negative 17% up to negative 2%, but it hasn't crossed over. We really would have thought at this point we would have seen more a pickup.","The nice thing in China, buildings are built in about half the speed that we see in other parts of the world and our cycle times for delivery can be half of what they are in other parts of the world as well. So if we did see a China recovery on the HVAC side, you need to see that, say, within a six-month period, not a 12-month period, but as you get into July and you're not really seeing the bookings here, it's just a way of really de-risking the forecast.","And really, that de-risking is the theme coming into the Industrial portfolio, too. At this point, if we haven't seen bookings on large machines or bookings on midsized, even rotary, machines to this point in time, the reality is you just call it lower and it's what we've done. And so we hope we've got to the bottom of this thing.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Mike, that's helpful. And if you look at European transport and refrigeration in general, and FRIGOBLOCK in particular, it seems like it has hung in there quite well. I'm sure \u2013 have you seen any changes post the Brexit announcement? What's the outlook for that particular business?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","We haven't had a lot of change relative to Brexit. I think, like a lot of companies, there is a lot of discussion going on, but not a lot of change, and our business really \u2013 U.K. business is not that big in general. It's more the knockdown effect about what might happen in the region with GDP being shaved in general. But the business has continued to develop well. It's holding in there and we don't see things turning there as a result of Brexit or other market factors here at least over the next couple of quarters.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would like to hand the conference over to Janet Pfeffer, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead.","Janet Pfeffer","Thank you, Karen. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Ingersoll Rand's Fourth Quarter 2013 Conference Call. We released earnings at 7:00 a.m. this morning and the release is posted on our website. We'll be broadcasting, in addition to this call, through our website at ingersollrand.com, where you will find a slide presentation that we will be using this morning. This call will be recorded and archived on our website.","If you'd please go to Slide 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated. The release also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release.","A couple of things of note before I turn it over to Mike. Similar to last quarter, we will be talking to adjusted margins during our commentary this morning, which includes restructuring and refinancing costs. Our news release and tables give you a reconciliation of the GAAP to adjusted margins. This is consistent with how we gave guidance all of last year. It is our intention to report with earnings and free cash flow during 2014 on a recorded basis, meaning that it will include restructuring. For comparability, we are giving you our 2014 guidance on both basis today so that you can identify the numbers with or without restructuring.","Also, the results and outlook are reflective of the spinoff of the Security business, Allegion, completed in December. Prior-period results have been restated to reflect the impact of the spin, with historical results of the Security operations reclassified to discontinued operations.","We also realigned our segments, as announced in November, into Climate and Industrial. We filed 8-Ks in December and January to reflect those 2 changes.","Now to introduce the participants on to this morning's call: Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO; Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Joe Fimbianti, Director of Investor Relations.","With that, please turn to Slide 3, and I'll turn it over to Mike.","Michael W. Lamach","Thanks, Janet. Good morning and thanks for joining us on today's call. Today we'll cover 3 broad areas. I'll spend a few minutes this morning recapping our full year 2013 and our progress on the transformation that we've been working on in the company for the past few years. And Sue will take you through the fourth quarter results. And I will end with our outlook for 2014 before we open it up for your questions. So let's start with full year 2013.","To say 2013 was an action-packed year would be a huge understatement. We put in a terrific management team and board for Allegion and completed the spinoff exactly on schedule, on December 1, less than 12 months from the announcement. We reorganized the company into our 2 current segments: Climate and Industrial. We took aggressive actions to completely offset the costs stranded as a result of the spin. And we accomplished all of this while delivering on our growth profit and cash flow commitments for the year.","Our revenues for the year were up 3%, with growth in all major geographic regions. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.67. You may recall that our updated guidance -- updated guidance reflects the spin, which we gave at Investor Day in November, that was in the range of $2.55 to $2.60. So we came at about $0.09 over the midpoint of that range.","Volume was roughly 100 million better than the midpoint, which translates to about $0.05 of positive earnings impact. The tax rate was lower than forecast, resulting in $0.12 of tailwind. Corporate expenses were higher than forecast, mainly driven by benefit costs and IT investments for about $0.06 negative impact to earnings.","We said when we gave the guidance that things might move around a little as we finalized all the carve-out accounting of Allegion. In the end, we had about $0.02 of headwind from the final pension carve-outs for Allegion plus the $0.09 to get us to $2.57.","We grew adjusted operating margins 40 basis points. This marks 3 years of a positive gap between pricing and direct material inflation. Our Lean focus again showed significant results in the implemented value streams and we continue to invest in the future of the business, funding significant new product development, investing into new IT platform and building our services footprint. We generated $862 million of cash flow on a post-spin basis.","Our capital allocation strategy has been consistent and shareholder focused. We continue to increase our dividend with the announcement of an additional 19% increase last week. This increase is consistent with the roadmap we laid out several years ago to get our payout ratio to peer levels by 2014.","We repurchased $1.2 billion of stock in 2013 and expect to complete our current $2 billion authorization in the next couple of months. We announced a new $1.5 billion program last week, which we expect to commence in the second quarter.","Let's go to Slide 4. We have delivered steady improvements in operating margins, while investing in new products, expanding our services footprint and our upgrading our IT systems. We have restated our results back to 2011 to reflect the spin of Allegion. The data on this chart is on a comparable basis. At the segment level, operating margins are up 150 basis points over the last 2 years. Corporate expenses have been higher, mainly due to the IT investment benefit costs, resulting in overall margins up 90 basis points since 2011.","Now Sue will walk you through the fourth quarter and I'll come back to take you through our 2014 outlook.","Susan K. Carter","Thanks, Mike. Let's go to Slide 5. Let me give you a high-level summary and then we'll dive into the detail. Our bookings for the quarter were up 5%, revenues were up 6% and our operating margins without restructuring were flat year-over-year in total and up 40 basis points at the segment level.","Operating leverage in the quarter was below our normal standards as a result of higher IT investments, higher benefit costs and a flood at an industrial facility in China. Adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $0.61. Mike has already walked you through the math versus the guidance I gave you in November, so let's move on to orders.","Please go to Slide 6. Orders for the fourth quarter of 2013 were up 5% on a reported basis and, excluding currency. Climate orders were up 6%. Global commercial HVAC bookings were up low-single digits, transport orders were up mid-teens, led by container orders. Orders in the Industrial segment were up 2%, with order growth in Americas and Club Car and decline in Europe and Asia.","Let's go to Slide 7. Here's a look at the revenue trends by segment and by region. The top half of the chart shows revenue change for each sector. For the total company, fourth quarter revenues were up 6% versus last year on both a reported basis and excluding currency. Climate revenues increased 8%, with HVAC revenues up mid-single digits and transport revenues up low-teens. Residential HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits. Industrial revenues were up 1% on a reported basis and were flat, excluding currency. I'll give more color niche segment in the next few slides.","On the bottom chart, which shows revenue change on a geographic basis, revenues were up 6% in the Americas; 4% in Europe, Middle East and Africa; and Asia was up 12%, all excluding foreign exchange.","And let's go to Slide 8. This chart walks through the change in adjusted operating margin from fourth quarter of 2012 of 8.5% to fourth quarter 2013, which was also 8.5%. Volume, mix and foreign exchange, collectively, were 90 basis points positive versus prior year. Our pricing programs continued to outpace material inflation, adding 20 basis points to margin. We have been saying throughout 2013 that the GAAP will stay positive between price and material inflation but then GAAP would narrow as we move through the year, which it did.","Productivity versus other inflation was flat in terms of margin impact in the quarter. Productivity remained steady, while the offsets are in costs. Year-over-year investments and other items were higher by 110 basis points. In the box, you can see that was comprised of 40 basis points from investments, 50 basis points from higher benefit costs and 20 basis points from a flood in Shanghai, China, that occurred early in the fourth quarter.","In the gray box at the top of the page, overall leverage was 7%, which is low by our standards. Leverage in the segment was about 20%, held down by mix in Climate and by the flood damage and disruption in Industrial. Corporate costs were higher in the quarter as anticipated, due primarily to higher benefit costs and increased IT investment. The higher benefit costs were primarily due to the timing of benefit cost adjustments for items such as pension, incentive compensation programs and health and welfare programs.","Please go to Slide 9. The Climate segment includes Trane commercial and residential HVAC and Thermo King transport refrigeration. Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $2.3 billion. That is up 8% versus last year on a reported basis and also up 8%, excluding currency. Global commercial HVAC orders were up low-single digits. Orders were up in the Americas and Europe and down in Asia against the tough prior-year compare. Orders were up double digits in commercial unitary HVAC, most of which shipped in the fourth quarter. Trane commercial HVAC fourth quarter revenues were up mid-single digits and were up in all major regions. Commercial HVAC equipment revenues were up mid-single digits, while HVAC parts, services and solutions revenue were up high-single digits versus the prior year.","Thermo King orders were up mid-teens digits versus 2012's fourth quarter, with a significant increase in container orders. Thermo King revenues were up low-teens, with truck trailer revenue up low-teens and marine container revenues up significantly.","Residential HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits versus last year and unit volumes were up low-teens.","The adjusted operating margin for Climate was 10% in the quarter, 60 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2012 due to volume and productivity, partially offset by inflation.","Please go to Slide 10. Fourth quarter revenues for the Industrial segment were $771 million, up 1% on a reported basis and flat excluding currency. Air systems and services, power tools, fluid management and materials management revenues and orders were up slightly versus last year. Revenues in the Americas were flat, while revenues in Asia were up low-single digits and Europe were down low-single digits.","Club Car revenues in the quarter were up low-single digits and orders were up high-single digits versus prior year.","Industrial's adjusted operating margin of 16.1%, flat on very little volume growth compared with last year, as productivity was offset by the impact of flood, inflation and investments.","And let's go to Slide 11, please. For the full year, working capital as a percentage of revenue improved 40 basis points to 2.1%. Cash flow was $862 million on a post-spin basis. Cash conversion, defined as available cash flow, excluding onetime and restructuring costs divided by net earnings, was 108% for the year.","I've had conversations with some of you over the last few months about the definition of cash flow that we use. On a go-forward basis, consistent with Janet's remarks earlier, we will report free cash flow defined as operating cash flows, less capital expenditures. Our balance sheet remained very strong. Our return on invested capital improved to 8%.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Mike to take you through guidance.","Michael W. Lamach","Okay. Thanks, Sue. Please go to Slide 12. To give you an update on the outlook for our key markets, I'll start with North America non-residential. And as you know, we look at a collection of data to derive our forecast. To us, Put in Place outlook, which is $1.00-based estimate for 2014, shows an overall increase of 6%. I always put a caution flag on this forecast, which over the past 4 to 5 years, has kind of start high and walk down throughout the year.","For 2014, the Commercial and Industrial Put in Place forecast was to be up for 13%. Those markets were up 8% in 2013. With Commercial and Industrial, the strongest verticals are expected to be office and bank buildings, warehouses and garages meeting 2 to 3 top categories have a lower HVAC usage intensity. Institutional markets are expected to be down again in 2014 by 1% versus down 8% in 2013. So still negative, but institutional appears to be bottoming. Historically, institutional markets have used more applied product versus unitary. Within institutional, government is expected to be down double digits, education and dormitories down mid-single digits and hospitals up slightly.","The construction starts forecast for 2014, which is expressed in square footage, is expected to be up 11%, mainly due to Commercial and Industrial. Institutional starts forecast is fairly flat for 2014. Start is the longer lead indicator for us, impacting later 2014 or even 2015, depending on the type of building, equipment and services that are involved.","Based upon this backdrop, we expect low to mid-single-digit growth for 2014 in North American commercial HVAC, with applied equipment markets fairly flat, unitary equipment up low- to mid-single digits and service contracting and parts up mid-single digits. We expect Latin American, Asian, European and Middle East HVAC equipment markets in the aggregate to be up low- to mid-single digits in 2014.","Emerging markets growth will be mid- to high-single digits and mature markets will be flat, up low-single digits.","We expect North American and European transport markets to be up low- to mid-single digits on a dollar basis in 2014.","U.S. residential and new construction markets continue to show good growth. We expect industry motor-bearing unit shipments for the year to be up mid-single digits in 2014, driven again by new construction. Industrial markets will remain slow, industrial production statistics have not improved in recent reports. We expect markets to be flat, up low-single digits, led by growth in services. Golf markets are expected to be up mid-single digits.","Please go to Slide 13. Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect our revenues for full year 2014 to be up 3% to 4% versus 2013. Translating that to our full year outlook by segment, we expect Climate revenues to be up 4% to 5%. The Industrial segment revenues are forecasted to be in the range of flat to up 2%.","Please go to Slide 14. Transitioning to earnings, the adjusted earnings per share range is $3.05 to $3.20. Operating leverage for 2014 is expected to be about 35%. Segment operating leverage is expected to be about 25% and lower corporate expense accounts for the other 10 points. That EPS range excludes a full year placeholder for restructuring of $0.10. 2013 was truly an exceptional year, given the expense of spin-related onetime costs and restructuring.","As Janet said at the beginning of the call, since an ongoing $0.10 of restructuring has been a fairly normal spend rate for us over the past several years, our intention is to report on a GAAP continuing EPS basis during 2014 as we had done for the past several years prior to the spin. Therefore, for continuing EPS on a reported basis, the range of $2.95 to $3.10. This reflects the full year tax rate of 25% and an average diluted share count of 275 million shares.","To focus on first quarter guidance, refer to the right-hand column on this chart. First quarter 2014 revenues are forecast to be up 2% to 3%. Adjusted first quarter earnings per share forecast to be $0.23 to $0.28. Restructuring costs are expected to be about $0.02 for the quarter. So on a reported basis, EPS range is $0.21 to $0.26. We're assuming a share count of 283 million shares and a tax rate of 25%.","We have provided EPS bridges for both first quarter and full year in the Appendix should you have any questions. For the full year 2014, we expect to generate free cash flow of $900 million.","Please go to Slide 15. We have a strong balance sheet. During 2013, we refinanced our 2013 and 2014 maturities for lock-in attractive rates and maturity schedules. We exited 2013 with excess cash. This purely reflects the timing of the receipt of distribution from Allegion received after spinoff versus our deployment of that cash to share buyback. We should be down to a more normal cash balance in the next several months.","The bar on far right depicts our outlook for free cash flow for 2014. It's in the range of $900 million. After paying the dividend, we look to deploy about half of the excess cash flow to continued share repurchase. That will be in a range of $400 million to $500 million from cash flow and that repurchase will begin sometime in the second quarter. We have a placeholder on the remainder of the cash flow to fund acquisition. This will be small to moderate size and will fit squarely into our core. Deployment acquisition will depend on the specific set of targets and, of course, on availability and valuation. We have a disciplined review process in place in a small but active pipeline. I would not expect anything of material size to be completed before the second half of the year.","To model the pipeline, we'll update that estimate as we move through the year. If we don't find acceptable targets at attractive valuation, we'd likely redeploy those funds to further share repurchases.","Please go to Slide 16. This slide demonstrates the significant emphasis we have had and continue to have on returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. On the left you can see that steady increase of dividend since 2010, with a 19% increase we announced last week, bringing our per share dividend to $1 per annum. We are at our target for reaching a peer payout ratio in 2014, a target and date which we had established in 2010 and we're [ph] making ratable progress towards each year.","The chart on the right-hand side shows the dollars allocated to share repurchase over the 4-year period, about $4.6 billion. Our board authorized a new $1.5 billion program just last week. To break down the 2014 estimate column, given that it has several components, the tan color at the bottom is the dollar amount we expect to deploy in the first quarter and that will finish out the $2 billion authorization made in December 2012. After exhausting that authorization, we'll still have about $175 million from the Allegion distribution left to spend. We expected to deploy those funds in the second quarter. And we have the $400 million to $500 million from cash flow that I described in the prior slide. That brings you to a total of $1.375 billion to $1.475 billion for full year 2014.","Taking dividends and repurchases in the aggregate, that's about $5.5 billion of capital return to shareholders over the last 4 years.","Please go to Slide 17. In closing, we're pleased to have delivered another solid year. We have demonstrated a multi-year trend of delivering operating leverage and margin improvement. We are finally seeing some light in portions of the construction and retrofit markets, but industrial market is slowing. Our focus is on positioning the company to continue to grow earnings and cash flow with or without help of the markets. We have proactively worked to reduce costs and improve productivity, while still making prudent investments for the future. Our new product pipeline is as strong as it's been in decades. We continue to invest in new products and service offerings, our IT infrastructure and further developing our people and our operating capabilities.","We took the necessary actions in 2013 to fully offset the cost stranded by the spin. We've implemented a consistent shareholder focused of capital allocation program. So I'm proud of the progress we've made, the results we have delivered and, certainly optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead for us.","And with that, Sue and I will be happy to take the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from line of Steve Volkmann from Jefferies & Company.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just a quick one, just for clarification. When you say that in '14, you're going to report sort of your in-all numbers, are you still going to breakout for us so that we can see the restructuring? Or is that just going to be sort of varied going forward?","Susan K. Carter","No, what we'll do is we'll break it out, Steve, in our commentary so that you can see it. We're just going to report on a GAAP basis.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Understood. And then when I look at the Climate piece and your forecast for 2014, I'd like to get the onion peeled back maybe a layer and think a little bit about what you think pricing and mix is going to do there. Because it feels like your orders are up a little higher in Thermo King. I assume that's good for mix. But also the resi is probably not so good for mix, but then maybe you're getting less R-22. It just feels like there's a number of moving pieces on price and mix there that might be helpful.","Susan K. Carter","So are you thinking more about 2014 in total for the Climate business? So let me talk about the full year on the Climate side. So as you talked about with the increasing margins and what happened, we still believe that price is going to offset any direct material inflation. We also believe that productivity is going to offset the inflation that's going on. We do think that there will be some investments in the business and that's what we've projected. But I think the year-over-year bridge looks pretty similar to what we've talked about. When we look at the operating income percentages, we expect a 40 to 80% -- 80 basis points improvement in the Climate business and so that's kind of the bridge on Climate.","Michael W. Lamach","You asked a question about mix, Steve, too. I would probably add in the TK business, although units are probably forecasted to be flat in the industry, you've got the benefit of the new product, which is more expensive, the car-compliant product now launched in the marketplace. So we should see some mid-single-digit sort of revenue increase on flat volumes there. The mix there is positive. Sue mentioned sort of the commercial mix. Unitary or applied, we're fairly agnostic in terms of the margins there. The only thing about the institutional markets is they're more HVAC intensive by square foot. So we tend to see on a square foot basis larger sales going into applied markets than unitary markets. And on resi side, I think you hit it on the head. We'll see nice margin expansion there for sure. But our focus has been on repositioning the product portfolio, the dealer base. Go forward reality of a market mix, that would be 80% 13, 14 SEER and an R-22 step-down of maybe 5% to 10% of the mix in 2014. So hope that covers everything there for you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a question on margin in the quarter. Could you talk about a couple of things? A, productivity, if I look at your bridge, was 0% in this quarter. And the second thing, as we think about costs embedded in the businesses that have to do with the split, that need to be adjusted, how long until these costs go away and we just sort of run the businesses as usual?","Susan K. Carter","So let's think about the productivity first. I mean, in the comments that we made, Andrew, we talked about that the productivity itself in the quarter was pretty standard for Q4 and what was happening was some inflation in the other costs, which we also talked about and we broke out. What I would think about is as we look forward on productivity and where we're going is in 2014 the guidance reflects sort of an operating leverage of 35%, with the segments being about 25% and another 10 points added by reductions in unallocated corporate costs. So as you think about where we are and where we're going, we're saying that there is improvement embedded in our 2014 guidance that gets us back to more of a normalized level.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But is it going to be sort of a step-up or are we going to see sort of a gradual change over the year?","Susan K. Carter","Well, I think in Q1, what you'll see is that the leverage will be lighter than the back half of the year as we continue to get cost out and we continue to move forward. But again, I think overall, 35% for the full year but, again, slightly lighter in the first quarter.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just on the Industrial business, if you strip out Club Car, it looks like you're not really forecasting much growth at all within that business for 2014. That seems quite different from what a lot of other peer group is saying. Is there any kind of market share issue there or you're just being conservative in light of recent ISM data and so on?","Michael W. Lamach","Yes, for sure, it's more conservative. I think an ISM data, which I think is a reality, actually I think it's a fairly accurate predictor for us. But compressor, air compressor systems and services, Julian, has been a great story. There has been share gain. It's been in the areas that we've been targeting. There's no issues there. As you get into the smaller businesses, tool, fluid and materials, tool in particular, our emphasis in the tool business is not in the motor vehicle industry. So we're seeing strong growth there. It's not sort of where we've played historically in that particular segment. Fluid actually is doing just fine relative to the peer comparables there. And material handling has been up historically. In the last couple of years, they're very heavy in oil and gas. And depending on what you think of the outlook there, which we think will be a little softer than it was last in the couple of years, that will be a little bit of pressure in the materials management area business for us.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then just within the commercially HVAC in the U.S., you gave a lot of good color in the prepared remarks on the sort of third-party prognosis and so on. I just wondered what's your own sense of kind of incoming customer inquiries, how the bookings in Q4 shaped up versus your expectations. And again, that's the U.S. commercial HVAC, specifically.","Michael W. Lamach","Yes, maybe a little bit more color around what we saw demand-wise in the fourth quarter and how I think that rolls into 2014. So I mentioned the Trane, future revenues were up high-single in the quarter. We had high single-digit increases in the Americas. We actually had very strong growth in Asia, up over 35%. So our Unitary Asia business, which is actually now a fairly substantial business for us, it's about a quarter of the size of the North American business. It's really picking up. So we're seeing good, good growth in Unitary across-the-board. Applied equipment revenues were also up high-single digits in the quarter and that was across all geographic regions. We were double-digit plus in Europe, Middle East, Latin America and Asia and low-single digits in North America. So we think that we're really bottoming, on the institutional side, I think our forecast would not have a pronounced recovery in 2014 but clearly, it's bottoming and we would expect these numbers to improve as we gave that 3-year guidance to you a couple of months ago, where 2015 and 2016 were stronger growth years than 2014. It's pretty much fueled by that institutional pickup that we would see in '15 and '16. So I think studying improving, slow institutional growth. Still very nice commercial and industrial unitary growth, particularly in North America in the markets that I mentioned. We capitalized there to make sure improvements on the new products launched in the Unitary space. So it's fairly optimistic, I would say, what we're seeing for Unitary and applied on a go-forward basis.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So first of all, just on the resi, low-teens growth in volumes is obviously very good. Some of your competitors have talked about a pull forward due to the cold weather, especially on the furnace side. Did you see some of that as well? And has that sort of tinted your view -- I was thinking of the right word -- but is that covering your view on 1Q '14 revenue growth?","Michael W. Lamach","Actually, Nigel, it's very interesting. We've been talking now for at least 2 years around keeping on better cycle times, certainly from book to ship, but even broader than book to ship across some of the portfolio. And we really have now historically low cycle times, which is a wonderful thing. We've got very low weeks [ph] on supply on hand from a dealer perspective and we had historically high fill rates. So I feel that we're matching pretty closely as to what you're going to see with actual sell-through, as opposed to sort of the spiking and filling of the dealer. We're really trying to compete on that cycle speed and fill rate dimension.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's clear. And then just digging into the 25% segment incrementals for 2014, you mentioned that the price\/cost tapered down as you expected. How does that look now for 2014 on a go-forward basis? And the impact of the flood, it looks like it's about $6 million within Industrial. Is that all in intra-quarter and does some of that drip through into 1Q as well?","Susan K. Carter","So on the China flood, you're right, it's just slightly less than $6 million. And that's a fourth quarter charge so we don't expect to see any of that trickling over into 2014.","Michael W. Lamach","Yes, so Nigel, I just want to add before Sue goes on there that, that's really an amazing story. They had sort of let you break a particular district of Shanghai. And they actually had an inch of water a minute for the first 30 minutes, 30 inches, in that first 30 minutes. So it's quite unbelievably quick sort of damage the facility and plant. They actually moved all that plant production within 5 days to a plant up the road. To this point, we were able to stop the bleeding. But really, the damage was on the material, mechanical, electrical equipment line, all of the finished goods. And then pump the plant out being able to rebuild the plant about a 6-week period. But we got it all done in the quarter. It was just really heroic effort, I think, by our team in China to react to it and get us back to business in a roughly short period of time.","Susan K. Carter","And then the other question you had was on pricing. So we expect the pricing environment to be fairly modest in 2014, about 50 basis points or so of the price. We expect to be able to more than offset the material inflation with the -- but the positive GAAP that we see looks more like the end of 2013 sort of in the 10 to 20 basis points range. And then as we think about materials and all of that in 2014, there may be some noise around steel in the back half. But we're watching that and we also have looked at copper and aluminum positions. And we think that we've got that covered in the words that I just said around pricing offsetting the direct material inflation.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan from Nomura.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Just to clarify quick on the restructuring, in terms of where it's actually going to sit. I mean, are you going to put it in the segments or is some of that going to be incorporated? And when you talk to those year-over-year incrementals, does that include the restructuring in the prior year or is that a comment kind of on an adjusted basis?","Susan K. Carter","So the restructuring that we did in 2013, so there were restructuring actions that were in every segment as well as corporate. We actually spent $44 million in the fourth quarter and $83 million in the full year, with the majority of that being on the G&A side. And where those charges or where the benefits of the restructuring will appear is where the actual charges were incurred. So it's going to incur in the segments as well as in corporate. It just so happens that you see a big piece of the stranded costs being on the corporate side and coming out on a year-over-year basis. But there will also be benefits that are in place for both the segments also.","Michael W. Lamach","And to be clear, we have line of sight $0.02 in the quarter, which is a continuation and finalization of the work started in the fourth quarter around restructuring. But the balance, the $0.08, is really a placeholder there. We don't have sort of anything specific teed up, but we've got the flexibility in the guidance we've given you should the need arise that we're able to take advantage of the remaining $0.08.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then on Thermo King, I mean, the container stuff can obviously be really lumpy. Can you give us a sense of -- maybe a little more color on your overall view of the underlying market there for container? And I guess, just broadly, just shape out what you're thinking for '14?","Michael W. Lamach","Well, the container actually tripled for us really in the quarter. We have record ever -- record shipments in November, December around container. So the notion of being lumpy is absolutely the case. And it's been a market that very, very difficult for us to forecast. It doesn't really follow any standards. You've got a couple of large players in the marketplace as customers that buy 1,000, 2,000 3,000 containers at an order. So very difficult for us to forecast that. But on the other trailer truck market, it's sort of the mid-single-digit across-the-board, where volumes are low like in North America, meaning flat to prior year. We will see the benefit, as I mentioned, of the revenue of the new product. And then Europe, we think it will be up mid-single digits.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a follow-up to Shannon's question. So how much, I guess, just on the -- not necessarily the benefits but the restructuring costs, how much of the restructuring costs were in segments last year? Is that -- are you comparing -- is it 25% incremental compared to the newly reported last year, the adjusted -- just trying to kind of understand if the 25% incremental includes the restructuring costs year-over-year?","Michael W. Lamach","Yes. On the breakout part, Steve, the golf balance, we just played the ball where it lies. Sue mentioned that. So I don't have the data here to kind of tell you that. It happened where it happened. We can follow back up with you on that. Janet, on the second part, you want to add on that?","Janet Pfeffer","So Steve, all the data we gave on the leverage and that was x restructuring in both years.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, okay, that's great. And then with all the moving parts around corporate, what is kind of the appropriate run rate that you're assuming for this year? I mean, it would just be helpful with all the noise to kind of have at least some visibility on a range, what corporate -- whether what -- either way, whether it's a quarterly run rate or what the kind of baseline is coming out the fourth quarter? Just some visibility on trying to get to a corporate number for '14.","Susan K. Carter","So Steve, the way that we've looked at 2014 is that the unallocated corporate costs will be in the range of $200 million. So we talked in the past about sort of $195 million-ish to $200 million and that's where we expect to be in 2014. So that's down pretty significantly from 2013, which we've talk about $40 million of stranded costs, which we said have come out. And in addition to that, we've taken another $20 million or so in costs that we're planning to come out in 2014, then confronting such as indirect costs, paying attention to consulting any kind of indirect costs that are associated with the business.","Operator","And our next question comes from","[Audio Gap]","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In the New York City HVAC trade show a couple of weeks ago, there was a couple of interesting developments. One is, Mike, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the upcoming 2015 new energy efficiency standards that are going to be rolled out. We've never seen this before, where it will be -- it's proposed to be done regionally. So just like we saw with the R-22, there's loopholes that were left open. This one seems wide open in terms of how people might made gain the system according to where borders are. But is there -- or too premature to think what the impact is and going to some of the higher SEERs in regions and how you might be positioned?","Michael W. Lamach","Yes, Deane, I think, first of all, it's good for the industry and it's good for OEMs across the board. I wouldn't want to speculate on how each OEM would deal with the regulation -- loopholes in the regulation. I think that all OEMs need to work where demand is occurring. And so to the extent that it's going to be deployed on a regional basis, we're going to be right there selling into that demand with the repositioned dealer base and obviously, a lot of new products that you some of at the show.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, one of the new products we saw at the show from you guys, which I thought was interesting, was this Web-enabled thermostat. And it raises the question as to your thoughts with Google's acquisitions of Nest, whether that changes any of the competitive dynamics. This is kind of a core strength of Trane and to see an upstart come in common like this -- but you've got a product that looks like it compete well. So just your thoughts on the applications.","Michael W. Lamach","Well, it's actually a business that's been rapidly growing. It passed breakeven this year. It's about the third year that we've had it out there. #1 position in new construction, actually, as it relates to control systems being put into the home that can do more than control the HVAC system. It uses a [indiscernible] protocol, so it's got a couple of hundred plus partners that can work with it. So it's exciting, it's something that we can think we can build out from and we chose on an open protocol in an agnostic point of view about what connects to it really.","Operator","And our next question comes from line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","I just wanted to come back around to the incrementals one more time and understanding the other maybe moving pieces in here. So the -- I would assume the $0.18 of incremental investment spending is mostly in the segments. But it seemed that you have equivalent or nearly equivalent restructuring savings and pension tailwind and the like also running through the segments. So I'm wondering, a, if that's correct? And if I'm in the ballpark there, then how do I think about the 25% incremental relative to what you've often viewed as your entitlement of being in the neighborhood of 30%?","Susan K. Carter","So as we think about the leverage and what we've guided for 2014, the investments, you're correct, would be held within the segments and are part of that overall 25% coming out of the operations. And as we look at 2014, we are coming off of the restructuring where we're building, we took out the stranded costs and we're continually looking at all of the businesses. But when we look at the components, when we look at what we talked about earlier with pricing versus direct material inflation, when we look at the productivity that has been planned in the businesses and what the inflation rates are and the restructuring that we've done, where we come out is the total of 35% for the business. And again, as we said earlier, that's sort of ramps -- the first quarter is a little lighter than the other quarters, but it ramps in the other part of the year. So you get a big benefit on the corporate and the stranded costs also.","Michael W. Lamach","Yes, Jeff, the investments have really worked for us, too, historically. When we go back through that, we've had both product and services investments and we've had some share gain and margin expansion in those areas. So it's consistent. It's a pretty big lift for us this year in the applied business. As we get ready to launch some new applied platform for us in 2015. That's the big year for that. And also, as we took the old sector structure and move into the business unit structures, particularly on the smaller businesses, where we put great talent sort of added it into the business, we've looked at more stand-alone investments in those business units that we historically would have done. And those are very high-margin businesses for us, so I think there's some optimism around being able to drive growth beyond 2014.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And this is as a follow-up to that. Does the investment spending peak at this level or does it remain a headwind in your opinion as you look at the out years? Or do you kind or build a cadence in there now that sustains what you're trying to do on the new product side?","Michael W. Lamach","Yes, sort of the R&D rate of the engineering investment rate largely remains the same on a percentage basis. And my estimate would be is that although becoming more productive with the operating facility we put in place around it, that there's also more opportunities to launch new products and services. And so it's probably fairly consistent over time. The only thing that actually would change for us is we're probably around the corner on the IT and infrastructure investment, probably 2015. In fact, we're launching phase 2 last week and this week of our IT infrastructure program. So that'll start rounding the corner in 2013. We should see lots of investment there. And of course, by 2018, we'll start to see most of the capitalization of that program come off all together.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker from Sanford Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","One thing I'm still just not understanding is on the outlook for end market chart. You have that Industrial process worldwide growth of flat to low-single digits and you have golf of mid-single digits and yet you've got this flat to 2% growth in the Industrial segment. And I know you talked about mix. But is it just that the end markets you're talking about on Page 12 are different than the ones that you're competing in on Page 13? Or is this, should we just, again, interpret this as share loss? And you also talked about deceleration, but it's up a little bit since last quarter. So maybe a little clarity around the Industrial side, please.","Michael W. Lamach","Yes, there's slight differences in the markets we're serving versus what the ISM data would point to. In the air business, I think there's no concerns or worries there around share loss and margin expansion. I think on the materials management side, it begins to expose the focus on oil and gas there. On the fluids side, I think we're right sort of where the market is. And then as I mentioned, on the tools business, our focus has not been on the motor vehicle industry and that's really the growth has been there. So we're not competing there. And I think that, that will be relatively flat 2014 for tools business. So if you net it all together, flat to -- it feels about right.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then on the opportunity on the value stream coverage side, we're talking about 40% a while ago. Is that where you ended 2013, at least in terms of coverage of the cost base? And what are you looking at for -- what do you think you'll be by the end of 2014? And how did the value stream -- how was that fitting into your view of these incrementals that you're giving us?","Michael W. Lamach","X Allegion, it was actually a little above 40%. That went well because we were further penetrated outside Allegion. And we'll be around 60% at the end of this year. So that continues to go very well. And the separation, the gap between that 40-plus percent and the non-value stream is still very significant. So we'll continue to invest there and that's partly what drives the incremental margins across-the-board. So even -- Sue mentioned, with the flat Industrial business, we hope to have better than flat operating margin there. And again, that would be part of what we're with happened with the Lean work. On the Climate side, the whole sort of 40 to 80-basis-point improvement there, that has significant investments going into the business in 2014. Again, it's driven largely by all that Lean work going on.","Operator","And our final question for today comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten from Longbow Securities.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","I just have a clarification question, is that, well, tax rate is a bit higher, 25%. Is that the new normalized rate that we should use for '15? Or is that a mix issue because you're making more money in this country? And looking out, no comment on FX, I assume that you're assuming neutral, but it looks like it's a little bit of a headwind. Under the investment in 2015, you call out the $0.18 as an impact. Should we assume that there's really no incremental impact in '15 or is there a lower number? How do we think about that?","Susan K. Carter","Okay. So let's talk about the tax rate with our guidance for 2014 at about 25%. As you think about where we're at, so that's a big step up from the 2013 levels and where we're going, but it's largely due to the discrete items that occurred actually both in '12 and '13. So what I would say is that the normalized tax rate that I would use for the company without all of the discrete is in the mid-20s range. And so I think that is -- I think that's not only the 2014 rate but that's sort of the normal for going forward, if you were looking at '15 and beyond.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","And just a quick comment on FX and the investments in '15 versus '14. You called out an $0.18 incremental number this year on your bridge. But will it be much of an incremental number in '15 versus '14?","Michael W. Lamach","The investments, Eli, there, for now I would assume that as a percentage of revenue. We're going to continue on the same pace. The only thing I mentioned was the SMART sort of begins to fall off in 2015. But I can't tell you that we've got our 2015 development budget set or we can't officially tell you how much less it'll be, probably a little bit less because of the SMART investment but probably not on the product and service footprint.","Operator","And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any concluding remarks.","Michael W. Lamach","Well, Joe reminded me that you've might not remember what SMART is. We keep using the internal acronym. SMART is the IT infrastructure investments we're making, so we're on Phase 2 of SMART. My apologies for using an acronym that you may not be familiar with.","Janet Pfeffer","Thank you, everyone. And Joe and I will be around for your call later today.

Ma'am, you may begin.","Janet Pfeffer - Vice President-Treasury & Investor Relations","Thank you, Crystal. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Ingersoll-Rand's Fourth Quarter 2015 Conference Call. We released earnings this morning at 6:30 and the release is posted on our website. We'll be broadcasting in addition to this phone call through our website at ingersollrand.com, where you'll also find the slide presentation that we'll be using this morning.","If you'd please go to slide two.

Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Thanks, Janet. Good morning and thanks for joining us on today's call. This morning, I'll spend a few minutes recapping our full year 2015 results and our progress in the transformation we've been working on in the company since 2010. Then, Sue will take you through the fourth quarter results, and I'll end up with our outlook for 2016 before we open it up to your questions.","Starting with full year 2015, it was a year that I can characterize best by one word and that word is volatility; volatility in energy markets, in foreign exchange rates, in industrial markets, in emerging markets and, of course, in the stock market.","During this period of volatility, while the individual pieces might not each of it ended exactly how we had forecast some 12 months ago, our headline results were essentially right on the forecast we gave you a year ago.","The 2015 forecast we gave you a year ago was for 4% to 5% organic growth, and we came in at 5%. Our adjusted EPS forecast was a midpoint of $3.74; our actual is $3.73. That performance was with significantly more FX headwind. We had included a $0.17 earnings headwind for currency in guidance, it ended up being over $0.30. Our free cash flow forecast was $950 million to $1 billion, and we delivered $985 million.","We focused on executing within our business operating system and on the things that we can control while doing our best to anticipate the things we couldn't control and we made adjustments accordingly.","2015 demonstrated continued progress in the implementation of our multi-year strategy for growth, operational excellence and shareholder value. We invested in core businesses, mature and key strategic capabilities and delivered on our financial commitments, all while navigating shifts and challenges in global markets.","We have consistently delivered on our commitments even in volatile times, and we hope that you'd agree that there are very few companies in your coverage that have done this. I'm very proud of our team and the great people in our company that delivered another solid year. If I look back over a longer horizon over the last, say, 24 months, it's a similar story. With the exception of a single quarter almost five years ago, we've met or exceeded our earnings commitments regardless of market conditions.","For the year, our organic revenues, which excludes FX and acquisitions, were up 5%. Markets were uneven around the globe. Growth in North America was in the mid-single digits while revenues overseas, taken collectively, increased low-single digits.","Adjusted earnings per share were $3.73, a year-over-year increase of 12%. In a fairly diversified industrial peer group, we achieved top quartile performance in EPS growth again in 2015.","We grew adjusted operating margins 40 basis points in 2015. Our organic operating leverage, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange and M&A, was 35%, which is above our target range of 25% to 30%. And Climate margins improved 60 basis points.","We generated $985 million of cash flow. Our capital allocation strategy remains focused on maximizing shareholder value, and it's consistent with our overall financial strategy. We continued to increase our dividend with a 16% increase in 2015 and we announced an additional 10% increase of dividend last week.","We repurchased 4.4 million shares for $250 million in 2015. And more recently, we took advantage of some of the volatility in the stock market and accelerated our share repurchases this year, repurchasing 4.9 million shares for $250 million in January of this year. We finalized an agreement with the IRS for the years 2002 through 2011.","In December, we announced an agreement to sell our remaining stake in Hussman, and we expect that to close in April. Our performance in 2015 gives further conviction to our strategy and positions us well as we go into a challenging global economic backdrop in 2016.","Please go to slide 4. We delivered steady improvements in operating margins. As shown here, the last five years, our operating margins were up 270 basis points since 2011 despite tough years in Industrial in 2014 and 2015. During the same period, our adjusted operating leverage has averaged over 35%.","Please go to slide 5. This chart walks through the change in operating margin from 2014 of 10.9% to 2015 which was 11%. This chart is shown on a reported basis, so it includes restructuring and inventory step-up costs which are excluded from adjusted margins.","We had 20 basis points of higher restructuring year-over-year and also had a 20 basis point impact of inventory step-up on acquisitions. Adjusted margins, which exclude those items, expanded 40 basis points from 11% to 11.4%.","The 40 basis points of margin expansion was delivered from a combination of organic growth, maintaining a positive gap between pricing and material inflation through value pricing and pricing analytics, and productivity from strategic sourcing, implementing our lean operating system and overhead costs discipline, together outpacing other inflation. Foreign exchange was a drag to margins of 50 basis points.","We continue to invest in new products, IT infrastructure and systems, and service and sales footprint to underpin the future growth of the business. Those collectively were a 30 basis point investment year-over-year.","Now, Sue will take you to through the fourth quarter, and then I'll come back to you through 2016's outlook.","Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Mike. Please go to slide 6. At the summary level, our organic bookings for the quarter were up 2% and organic revenues were up 3%. Residential and Commercial HVAC organic revenues were each up 5-plus-percent.","Adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $0.94, up 15% versus last year. Consistent with Mike's commentary for the full year, the fourth quarter was in line with our earnings guidance. A slightly lower tax rate was offset by slightly higher compensation and benefit costs.","Our adjusted operating margins were up 50 basis points. Operating leverage in the quarter was excellent at 34% on an adjusted basis and 55% on an organic basis. Climate margins increased 70 basis points in the quarter. Adjusted Industrial margins were down 200 basis points but were only slightly down on 2% lower organic revenues when excluding the impact of currency and of rolling in the first year of Cameron's Centrifugal operating income and amortization.","Finally, as Mike mentioned, given the impending closing of the sale of our Hussmann stake expected on April 1 and to take advantage of market volatility, we repurchased 4.9 million shares in January 2016 for $250 million.","Please go to slide 7. Orders for the fourth quarter of 2015 were up 1% on a reported basis and up 4% excluding currency. Organic orders were up 2%. Climate orders were up 5% organically. Organic global Commercial HVAC bookings were up low-single digits with a high-single digit increase in North America and declines in Asia and Europe. Organic transport orders were up low-single digits with increases in global trailer, truck and auxiliary power units partially offset by lower marine container orders. Orders in the Industrial segment were down 4% on a reported basis and down 7% organically. We saw high-single digit order decline in air and industrial products and a mid-single digit increase in Club Car.","Please go on to slide 8. Here's a look at the revenue trends by segment and region. The top half of the chart shows revenue change for each segment. For the total company, fourth quarter revenues were up 3% versus last year on a reported basis and also up 3% on an organic basis. Climate revenues increased 2% on a reported basis and 5% on an organic basis.","Organic Commercial HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits, with increases in all major geographic regions. Residential HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits. Organic transport revenues were down low-single digits as higher truck and trailer revenues were more than offset by lower revenues in marine and APUs. Industrial revenues were up 5% on a reported basis and down 2% organically. Air and industrial products organic revenues were down low-single digit and Club Car was up slightly.","The bottom chart shows revenue change on a geographic basis as reported and on an organic basis. Organic revenues were up 3% in the Americas, up 2% in EMEA and Asia was up 9%, with strong growth outside of China.","Please go to slide 9. Operating margin on a reported basis was up 10 basis points from fourth quarter 2014 to fourth quarter of 2015. We've spinned out the restructure (11:10) impact to get you to adjusted margins as well. Adjusted margins increased 50 basis points, from 10.8% to 11.3%.","Volume, mix and foreign exchange collectively were flat, with 40 basis points of positive margin from volume and mix being offset by foreign exchange. Net pricing versus direct material inflation was favorable by 30 basis points, driven by commodity deflation. Productivity versus other inflation was positive 80 basis points, driven by strong productivity in the quarter. Year-over-year investments and other items reduced margins by 100 basis points.","In the box, you can see that it was comprised of 20 basis points from investments, 50 basis points from higher restructuring costs and 30 basis points from acquisitions. In the gray box at the top of the page, overall leverage on an adjusted basis was 34% and, if calculated on an organic basis, which excludes foreign exchange and acquisitions, was 55%.","Now please go to slide 10. Total fourth quarter revenues for the Climate segment were $2.5 billion. That is up 2% versus last year on a reported basis and up 5% excluding currency. Acquisitions in Climate do not change that rounding, so organic revenue is also up 5%.","Organic Commercial HVAC fourth quarter revenues were up mid-single digit and were up in all geographic regions. North America was up mid-single digits while EMEA and Latin America were both up low-single digit. Asia was up low-teens. The growth in Asia was led by some large HVAC projects in Southeast Asia.","Commercial HVAC equipment organic revenues were up low-single digits, while HVAC parts, services and solutions revenue were up high-single digit versus prior year. Thermo King organic revenues were down low-single digits, with truck\/trailer revenue up high-single digits, with growth in both North America and Europe. Marine and APU revenues declined against difficult comparisons to the fourth quarter of last year. Residential HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits versus last year.","The adjusted operating margin for Climate was 12.9% in the quarter, 70 basis points higher than fourth quarter of 2014 due to volume and productivity, partially offset by currency and other inflation. Climate's operating leverage was over 50% in the quarter.","Now please go to slide 11. Fourth quarter revenues for the Industrial segment were $834 million, up 5% on a reported basis but down 2% on an organic basis. Compression Technologies and","Services, power tools, fluid management and material handling organic revenues were down low-single digits versus last year. Organic revenues in the Americas were down high-single digits, while revenues in EMEA were down low-single digits and were up high-single digits in Asia due to some large project deliveries. Club Car revenues excluding foreign exchange were up slightly versus prior year.","Industrial's adjusted operating margin of 13.8% was down 200 basis points compared with last year. When excluding the impact of acquisitions and currency, adjusted margins were down 20 basis points year-over-year on lower organic revenues.","The Engineered Centrifugal Compressor business, or ECC, which we purchased from Cameron in January of 2015, executed well and came in essentially on forecast in the fourth quarter. In 2015, revenues were impacted by weakened industrial markets. However, synergies were above our acquisition model and EBITDA and cash EPS were both accretive.","Please go to slide 12. For the full year, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 4.2%. We had strong collections in the quarter with our DSO improving over the prior year. Going forward, we expect our working capital to be in the 4% range.","Now go to slide 13, please. Adjusted cash flow generation was excellent, at $985 million in 2015. Cash conversion as a percent of adjusted net earnings was 101% for the year. As you can see when we look at 2016, we expect adjusted free cash flow in the range of $950 million to $1 billion. That range excludes the proceeds from the sale of our stake in Hussmann. Our balance sheet remains very strong. We have no debt maturities until 2018.","Please go to slide 14. Over the last five years, we've returned over $6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We employ a dynamic model for capital allocation, which adjusts based on market conditions to put our strong free cash flow to the rate used for shareholder value. Last week, we announced a 10% increase to our dividend. Our dividend increases over the last five years has been a 24% CAGR. Our payout ratio is in line with peers.","We've repurchased 103 million shares in the past five years from 2011 to 2015. As we said earlier for 2016, we anticipated some market volatility in January and were able to accelerate our minimum share repurchase of $250 million to the beginning of the year. We repurchased 4.9 million shares in January.","To remind you, our free cash flow generation is heavily weighted to the second half due to the seasonality of our businesses, namely the HVAC businesses. So, a normal timing for share repurchases would have been in the second half. But given we have the proceeds from the sale of our Hussmann stake coming in April, we thought it was opportunistic and still within our leverage range to accelerate the minimum repurchase and get that done earlier in the year.","For the balance of 2016, we will use the same approach as the last couple of years, applying a toggle switch between value accretive acquisitions and share repurchases based upon relative valuation and risk-adjusted returns. We will apply our same decision-making framework to the situation at that time and leave the door open to pivot to share repurchase or M&A as it makes best sense for our shareholders.","For the ease of modeling purposes, you'll see that for the 2016 share count, we've applied excess cash to repurchases in the second half of 2016 as we turn cash flow positive.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Mike to take you through 2016 guidance.","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Thanks, Sue, and please go to slide 15. It is always our intention, is to give you our best view of what we're seeing in our end markets sitting here today and how that translates to our revenue outlook for 2016. We've broken it down by major end markets and geographies. As you can see by the variation of colors and symbols, our end markets are seeing a wide variation in trends.","North American Commercial HVAC and Residential HVAC as well as transport and Commercial HVAC markets in Europe are generally positive while global industrial markets remain weak. Transport markets in the Americas will be flat to down as lower trailer volumes will be largely offset by higher auxiliary power units, small truck refrigeration and other products. The Asian HVAC markets are expected to be flat to down. Industrial markets in Asia remain under pressure. Golf and utility vehicle markets are generally flat to slightly up. All the growth forecasts shown are on an organic basis.","We're forecasting low-single digit growth in Commercial HVAC in total, mid-single digit growth in Residential HVAC, which is essentially an all-North American business for us, and flat revenues in transport. We expect air and industrial products, which includes our Compression Technologies, power tools, material handling and fluid management SBUs, to be down low-single digits and we expect Club Car to be up low-single digits.","Please go to slide 16. Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect our reported revenues for full year 2016 to be flat to up 2% versus 2015. Overall, foreign exchange will be a headwind of about 2 percentage points as we've now completed a full year of Cameron's Centrifugal Compressor division and our results organic revenue growth and excluding FX are the same in this forecast.","Translating that to the segments, we expect Climate revenues to be up 1% to 3% on a reported basis and 3% to 5% excluding currency. The Industrial segment revenues are forecast to be down the range of 2% to 4% on a reported basis and down 1% to up 1% excluding foreign exchange. Industrial also has a high proportion of revenues outside of the U.S. than Climate. So Industrial experiences more impact of FX as compared to Climate, 3 points adverse impact versus 2 points in Climate.","For operating margins, we're excluding restructuring costs to get to adjusted margins. We expect Climate adjusted operating margins to be in the range of 13.25% to 13.75%. We expect Industrial adjusted margins to be in the range of 13% to 13.75%. And for the Enterprise, we expect adjusted operating margins of 11.50% to 12% and EBITDA margins of 14.2% to 14.7%. Operating leverage would be about 60% all-in and about 3% (21:04) excluding currency. Margin expansion would be 10 basis points to 60 basis points on an adjusted basis.","Please go to slide 17. Transitioning to earnings, the reported earnings per share range is estimated to be $3.75 to $3.95. Excluding restructuring, the range is $3.80 to $4, an increase of 2% to 7% versus 2015.","As a note, for 2016 FX as a headwind is about $0.02 to revenue and $0.19 to earnings. For this forecast, we reflected consensus foreign exchange rate forecast. So for example, the euro, average rate for the euro is $1.03, but for the first quarter the euro forecast rate is $1.06. This reflects a full year tax rate of 24% to 25% and average diluted share count of 260 million shares for the full year.","As Sue explained, for ease of modeling, we allocated all excess cash to share buyback and phased it to the back half of the year when we turn cash flow positive. This does not necessarily mean that this will be the actual deployment for the cash, but was done to simplify modeling.","The EPS outlook does not include the impact of the divestiture of our stake at Hussman. We expect that transaction to close April 1, resulting in a gain of approximately $400 million, which will be recorded in other income in the second quarter. We'll update our guidance in April to reflect the closing but we'll adjust out the gain for comparability.","First quarter 2016 revenues are forecast to be flat to 2% on a reported basis and 3% to 5% excluding currency. Reported first quarter earnings per share are forecast to be $0.28 to $0.33, adding back $0.05 restructuring to get to an adjusted basis of the EPS range of $0.33 to $0.38. There are EPS bridges in the appendix for both the full year and the first quarter's guidance.","For the full year 2016, we expect to generate adjusted free cash flow which excludes restructuring cash and proceeds from Hussman of $950 million to $1 billion. As we said earlier, we increased the dividend last week and have already completed $250 million in share repurchases, which will more than offset dilution from equity issuances.","We had $143 million of commercial paper at year-end. And after paying that down, it leaves about $675 million of cash for deployment that we utilize when there is additional share repurchase or towards M&A. We continue to build a pipeline of acquisition opportunities related to our core businesses, and we weigh those risk-adjusted opportunities against buyback in terms of returns and shareholder value.","In closing, we're pleased to deliver another solid year with top quartile performance in revenue and earnings growth. Our strategies for growth and operational excellence have delivered a multi-year trend of excellent operating leverage, margin and earnings improvement. Our focus is to continue to grow earnings and cash flow through further implementation of these strategies.","We proactively work to deliver productivity and make prudent investments for the future. We'll continue to invest in new products and service offerings, our IT infrastructure and systems, as well as further developing our people and our operating capabilities. We continue to execute a consistent value-maximizing capital allocation program.","So, I'm proud of the progress we made and results we've delivered, and I believe we're well-positioned in 2016 to again deliver on our commitments.","With that, Sue and I will be pleased to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Steve.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just a couple of questions. On the first quarter dynamics, you have a decent organic growth rate but it doesn't look like there's much contribution from operations on EPS. What's going on there?","Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, Steve, good morning, first of all. As we start to look at the first quarter bridge that you can actually see in the slides, what we're looking at is we've got restructuring costs that are in the first quarter. Our operating results are really going to be in the range of \u2013 and this includes the restructuring \u2013 negative $0.01 to a positive $0.04. We've got a little bit of lower share count. But when you think about what's happening in the headwinds, the first quarter is going to be part of that currency headwind that we talked about, particularly on the Industrial business. And the revenues we expect in the first quarter and margins for Industrial, we expect to be even lower than where we ended the year.","So in other words, we're looking at a low revenue base. We're looking at headwinds from currency. And so, I think the first quarter is just going to be a tough compares and then I think we get better as we go through the remainder of the year.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So in Industrial, that makes a bit of a sense. On this gain you guys are going to take, Mike, given the environment has clearly gotten worse over the course of the last year, you guys are doing some degree of restructuring, and you don't typically do this over time like other companies, but any thoughts to maybe using this gain to perhaps take a bigger swipe at things and get out in front of some restructuring that you may have planned for a couple of years into the future, just to kind of solidify that ability to kind of execute and deliver, like you've been doing over the last year? Is there a bigger restructuring out there, I guess, a potential for that?","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think, Steve, when you go back to 2009, we've been really consistent about particularly the factory footprint, and that's at a place right now where I think it's very productive, it's well utilized. And when we looked at ideas around us coming into 2016, paybacks were in the range of, say, five years to eight years, which is just outside the range of what we thought in this environment was doable.","That being said, when you look at areas of the business particularly around Compression Technologies, there is restructuring taking place there. And largely, it's in the areas of head count and things that we can do on a non-qualified way. So, tremendous focus on both corporate and costs within each of the businesses. So, there is a sort of drumbeat over time of doing that, but it's an effective and efficient \u2013 relatively effective and efficient footprint.","One of the things that we find is the better we've gotten at lean, the further we've gotten into that, the longer and harder it is to get a payback on a closure, which is a good thing. So we remain I think open-minded, Steve. If in fact things deteriorated further, if in fact we saw an opportunity, we certainly would look at that. We'll keep an open mind on that. But rather than putting a big placeholder out there with no specifics, we wanted to just keep it to the known actions and the announcements that we've made internally inside the company to this point.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, thanks. Good morning. First of all, congratulations on a great second half. The execution is certainly a lot better than many of your so-called high-quality peers. So, well done on 3Q, 4Q.","I just wondered if I could maybe pick up on Steve's point about \u2013 very clear answer on restructuring, but I guess the two areas that pushed back for 2016 plan would be flat Industrial and maybe flat TK. So, I'm wondering if those come in weaker through the year, to what extent do you have contingency plans in place to mitigate the deleverage that you'd see if those do come in weaker.","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, Nigel, listen, again, I'll pick it up from the point of Steve, this is where investments would be metered down. A lot of investments we're making are not only in product but in channel, and also letting attrition at times work for you. So, we will continue to work that down.","We certainly have a plan to sustain a lower revenue outlook if we see that. It's baked within the guidance we've provided \u2013 the range that we've provided. And our focus really is on the Industrial segment and it's fundamentally on the Compression Technologies piece. Todd's all over it. He's well into several months now into the role. I think he's got his eyes wide open around the opportunities. He's optimistic around what he's doing and I've got confidence in Todd and the team that they've got the plans hardwired for lots of different scenarios at this point.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Well, I'll pick up offline. And secondly, obviously you'd be aware that there's a pretty fertile debate about non-resi in North America given the broader weakness in industrial complex. The high-single digit growth in bookings during the quarter suggests that you're still seeing relatively fertile end markets. But maybe just pick up on where you stand and perhaps maybe comment on how the front is looking (30:43) right now.","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think the surprise in the fourth quarter, at least to me, was the strength that we had both in applied and unitary in North America. We had double-digit applied bookings in the fourth quarter and we had mid-teens booking in unitary in the fourth quarter. So as a backdrop going into the first half of the year, it feels like we've at least got enough out there for us to see in terms of visibility to see that.","Also, we had really good service growth, kind of high-single-digit growth in services. And controls was up nearly double digits there. So, it feels like we've caught a little bit of a lift in terms of institutional markets. Commercial hasn't turned down fully, that's why we're seeing good unitary, although some unitary spills into K-to-12 as well. So, that continues.","And then, as you'd expect, just the investments in the service network and service footprint have been good for us. So, it's a pretty good backdrop from the fourth quarter going into the first part of the year.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, I'll leave it there. Thanks, Mike.","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Nigel.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thank you. Just a question around the Climate margin guidance. It looks like you're guiding for a 40%-plus incremental margin in Climate for 2016 overall. Maybe looking at slide 15, you might have some mix headwinds in that segment this year with Resi growing so strongly, Thermo King and Trane Asia being flat to down. So I just wondered what you're embedding for mix in Climate for the year ahead.","Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, Julian, as we think about where Climate is going to go in 2016, I think you're right. You hit some of the high points. So we still see the continued trends in what we talked about in terms of Commercial HVAC in the Americas being strong, in EMEA being up, but on the Asia side being down a little bit. We called Residential up mid-single digits. You also have the factors of Latin America as part of the business. And while you have some growth in those sides, you've also got the transport revenues being flat in 2016.","So I think it's all of those mix pieces could strengthen on the commercial side in North America and Europe, a little down on the Asia side, flat Transport, down on Latin America and good mid-single digit growth in Res.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. So mix is sort of broadly neutral then, 2016 versus 2015 in Climate?","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Julian, Residential, if you look at the peer group, we're right at the top of the pack in terms of profitability. I think it's a point often lost on investors is the amount of margin improvement that we've had at Residential business. So good Residential growth is good for us. It's fine.","On the Transport side, if you look at Transport North America trailer, the industry being down 10%, our guidance embeds more of a 15% decline. We look at APUs, we had good growth for the year, we had 16% growth in APUs over the full year. We had good growth in bookings in the fourth quarter. We've got a strategy for a higher attachment rate to non-refrigerated trailers, about a 3 to 1 ratio; if we sell three APUs, that's equal to one North American trailer. So there is, between APU and some of the air businesses and other businesses that we have within TK, the ability to offset that decline. And then I'd point you back to the fact that European trailer was up nicely and, as that moves up, that's actually even more helpful than North American trailer. So net-net, we're good.","Actually, what's down for us pretty big is container. We had a big year last year in container. Container is soft, the market in general. We're against a tough comp. But container is an area where, frankly, less container is helpful on the mix. So net-net, we think we can grow margins.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up. Price\/material was a 30 bps tailwind for the quarter and the year in 2015. Are you assuming sort of similar-ish for the year ahead?","Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We are. Again, you're absolutely right with we ended the fourth quarter with 30 basis points and full year 2015 at 30 basis points to 40 basis points. For 2016, we're going to expect a 30 basis point to 40 basis point range for that gap or that spread between price and direct material inflation. You do have higher material deflation numbers. As you'll recall, we had inflation in the first and second quarters of 2015, so you do get a lift out of that. But I think as we think about the push and take between price and direct material inflation, we think all-in-all it's going to come back to about that same 30 basis point to 40 basis point range in 2016 is what we saw.","One of the other points, and you didn't ask this but I think it's relevant when we're having this discussion about price and direct material inflation, when we think about the differences between Climate and the Industrial businesses, the largest pieces of the benefit on material deflation do go to the Climate business. There is some and there still is a positive spread in the Industrial businesses, but it's much less than what you would see in Climate. And so as you're trying to compare year-over-year, you also don't have that nice benefit coming out of commodities and the direct material deflation on the Industrial side.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","Hi. Good morning. A couple quick questions. First, acquisition pipeline. Can you give us a little feel for where you're feeling the opportunities are presenting themselves most, be it geographic, end market, however you want to address the question?","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Really, David, the strategy for us has been to look at all the SBU's core businesses across all markets. And so there's a pipeline that would reflect all that from that perspective.","There are two fundamental areas that we see for investment. One is channel. We continue to see opportunities, whether it's geographically outside the U.S. for channel or even in the U.S. in terms of buying back commercial distribution. That's a continued emphasis for us.","We also find that when we can take a product, it might be a technology that we don't have, and sell it through our existing channel, particularly on the Trane Commercial side, we do very, very well with that. So obviously it's more attractive if you're buying anything that's (38:21) outside the U.S. And so we're pretty active looking outside the U.S. for a lot of that, which can be then modified and brought into the U.S. with different power requirements and different efficiency ratings, but some of the technologies can be applied. So we're seeing an active pipeline there as well.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","And given the balance sheet power and the cash flow, would you care to give us any sense of bigger than a breadbasket-type sizing of what kind of size deals are you looking at currently?","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, probably, David, truthfully that would only get us into trouble I think by doing a big breadbasket estimates. I think that you can look at where we would end the year in terms of ratios. In terms of EBITDA to debt, we end the year around the 2.4 times range. There's obviously some capacity with some of the current debt rating. We've got the cash. We talked about in the call the $675 million that's unidentified. So, there is an opportunity to do something a little bit larger. But what we're generally seeing though are small- to mid-sized deals that just make great economic sense.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","Okay. A couple of quick things. Tax rate, with the IRS settlement now behind us, can you give us some guidance on how you think about the tax rate, be it this year, next year? I saw the tax rate guidance. I must admit, I was looking for a little lower tax rate in 2016 given the IRS settlement. But can you give us some guidelines how to model the next few years?","Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. So, we were probably a little conservative on the 24% to 25% effective tax rate guidance for 2016. I think that when you think about the IRS settlement, what the IRS settlement really does is it takes the risk profile off the company and it puts to bed all of the issues around intercompany debt and any issues that would have been in the 2001, 2002 through 2011 range. But what it really doesn't do is it doesn't really affect the overall effective tax rate.","So, what you have to do in order to make that tax rate move is you have to continue to refine your strategy. Now, having all of those issues off the table certainly does give you an opportunity. And we are certainly involved in looking at that strategy in terms of the different areas that we're looking at.","So, we have a good trading hub that is in Europe. We're looking at Asia and Panama for trading hubs. We're looking at all of our intercompany debt and making sure that we're as balanced as we go into 2016 as we would like to be.","But we do also have a slight headwind, if you will, on tax rate. And that is, when you look around the globe and you think about our revenue growth in 2016, the areas that are growing the most are in North America, which does pressure the tax rate.","So, that's a long way around saying we absolutely have a goal of looking at every opportunity to bring that rate down. We're still going to be just as conscientious about the items we take on as we've always been. But I do think we'll see some opportunities in 2016. We'll continue to work that strategy and continue to communicate. But like I say, it's also a good thing that we have a little pressure on that rate coming out of the North America growth.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","All right. So in speaking quickly on cushions, just making sure, the corporate expense \u2013 I know there's rounding and you have to give ranges on segments and so forth, but it does seem to be implying your corporate expense goes up 10%, $230 million versus $210 million last year. Is that a rounding issue or should we really think that corporate expense is going up that much? But if you back from a total EBIT sort of implied by the segments, it is a larger number than I would have assumed.","Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, so it's not really rounding, but as we look at corporate expenses and \u2013 so, if you think back at 2015, where we started the year with our guidance was about $235 million, may sound familiar, and we ended the year at $210 million on the corporate side.","When we look at 2016, we took a lot of discretionary spend out of 2015. There are some investments that we need to continue to make around our IT infrastructure, around cyber security. And we also have on the corporate side. So, we talked about pension in total for Ingersoll-Rand being about flat year-over-year. However, with a lot of puts and takes in the elements of pension, pension is a little higher on the corporate side in 2016.","So it's not just rounding, it's not just putting things back in, but I'll also tell you that we're going to be very conscientious about what that spend is and in looking at not getting ahead of ourselves on any spend before we see what's going to happen in the different markets. So, it's a long way of saying that the $230 million, $235 million range is a lot more normal than $210 million but we're going to watch it closely and we're going to do everything we can to make sure that the money is spent very well and to the level that we need to.","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","David, if you take the run rate plus the pension, you're right, there was a little bit of gap there which we would normally apply to things like IT infrastructure and security that we're on a program too to refresh. But, look, if the markets turn down, we would just look to pull back from a discretionary standpoint in other areas in corporate. So, there's a little bit of flex in it that we would take if the markets are a little bit rougher than we think.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks and good morning, all.","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Steve.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, Mike. You've often talked about one of the characteristics, distinguishing marks, of the new Ingersoll-Rand it's how you hold decrementals when volumes are in the down part of the cycle. So, we're obviously witnessing that inside of Industrial, or about to.","Can you maybe talk about what decrementals you really think you're going to be able to achieve here if things do go a little bit further south? And what's giving you the confidence on just, I guess, down low-single digits in air and industrial products when it looks like bookings are a bit worse than that and the broader environment is also a bit worse?","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Steve, look, a great of example of that was what happened within Compression Technologies. If you take the legacy business, it ran almost flat on much lower volume. So, a great example of that. That was a extraordinary effort by that team to really pull all the stops out on productivity and discretionary spending and really to win in the marketplace.","It's a little bit tough to compare comps against competition. Typically, it's denominated in different currencies. But we did fairly well there on the product and service side of the business. So, that's a great example.","I would say that where we try to leverage it in the gross range of 25% and 30%, we're certainly looking to deleverage within the gross margin range but not to exceed 25% to 30%. So, that would be sort of the essence of that. It's going to depend a bit on the business.","I mean, TK has fundamentally, I think, more opportunity. It doesn't leverage up nearly as high as people think, it doesn't deleverage nearly as poorly as people think, largely because the distribution base of that business is independent. And so, we're really turning on and off sort of factory production and we got very flexible plants and labor forces that work with us on that. So, a great example is TK, where we would look to certainly work inside of normal margins in that business.","Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And, Steve, just to add on to what Mike said on the Industrial side, when I step back and think about Industrial, I kind of think about three big buckets that impacted that. Again, no excuses, the decrementals need to be at the same level as the incrementals when we go forward. But Industrial has an outsized impact from foreign exchange. So, over 50% of their revenues are impacted or they're non-U.S. and are impacted by foreign exchange. So, you have that headwind going against them. We do have the amortization from the accounting on the acquisition of Cameron. Again, took that on. You knew we took that on, but it does impact what we're looking at in 2015.","And then, as I pointed out earlier, when you think about they don't get the benefit or the big benefit coming out of direct material deflation with commodity prices because that's just not how that segment works, the air business gets the benefit out of some of that but the other businesses within the segment do not. And so, when you say you've got outsized foreign exchange, less direct material deflation, and we put an acquisition in there with some additional amortization, so I'd think about that in the total inflation, too.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks. And then, as a follow-up to an earlier question. You talked a lot about the price versus material deflation rage, spread, but a little more on the pricing environment itself absent material, what are you seeing in your big businesses in pricing, what kind of behavior are you seeing?","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, both businesses in the fourth quarter are positive-priced, which is pretty outstanding, frankly, across-the-board, and that's with pressure in Climate in Asia and of course with Industrial pressure all over the world, still able to get price in that business. So, we're still seeing positive price albeit it's pretty thin in the quarter. So that's, I think, a good indicator of sort of pricing power and just sort of the pricing structure within the industry holds pretty well through tougher times.","Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And that same will hold for 2016, with both segments projecting positive price for 2016.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Jeff.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hey. Just back to Industrial for a moment, Mike. Just thinking about the margins sequentially, if Cameron hit its targets and with the sequential revenue that you just had seasonally, I would have thought the margins would have been a little bit better there.","Can you just kind of walk us through that? And then, just help reconcile this a little bit, how we get comfortable with the kind of flattish Industrial for the year coming off this Q4 order number? Is there something in particular that you see in the pipeline that gives you some confidence in that number?","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Jeff, I'll start and then I'll let Sue finish. But what I think a lot of folks don't recognize when we talk about Industrial is impact that material handling and tools would have. Material handling is really exclusively oil and gas for us. It's 7% (50:34) of that segment has been hit incredibly hard. And, frankly, the tools business was hit very hard by that business as well.","Highest-margin businesses in the portfolio. And so when those go down, you feel it. It's a substantial headwind buried inside the segment numbers that's independent of what's happening with Cameron or Compression in general.","The other thing, if you go back to Compression Technologies specifically is we do very well from a margin perspective historically in Asia and in Latin America. And so from a mix perspective, when those markets are down, and they've been absolutely clobbered, we feel that as well from a mix perspective.","Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Right. And so, let's talk about the ECC business for just a little bit. And so, I think the overarching point that we wanted to make when we were talking about that business is that it was EBITDA and EPS accretive, which is where we had hoped to go. However, I would say that as you look at that business from the time that we looked at the acquisition until we completed 2015, I would say that that roadmap, just like we talked about with the entire company, has a few different components.","So if you think about the revenue side of that business, you certainly have the four components of the business with the plant, air side of the business being really hit by the weakened Industrial markets, and so that book and turn business definitely took a downturn in 2015.","You also have tough markets with oil prices. So on the processed gas side and on the engineered air side, you got fewer projects. You've got the same number of competitors, and so you've got some tough markets there. Then, you've got an aftermarket, which is an opportunity.","Having said all of that, what we did with the business in 2015 with a top line that wasn't perhaps as strong as what we wanted is we accelerated some of the synergies in the business and, in fact, overdrove the operating synergies \u2013 not revenue synergies, but the operating synergies in the business. And we're going to continue to do that.","So, the point wasn't that it's operating exactly as we would have called it a year ago. But I think as we look to the business and what we were going to do with it, we ended up with a pretty good result on the acquisition.","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Jeff, too, lots maybe in this is really strong execution here by the team integrating it. It'll turn out that the synergy in this thing will be about 15% of Cameron's revenues. So, that's double the synergies we thought we would have, which is a good thing because, obviously, the top line is much weaker and that's the reason it's still accretive from cash EPS perspective in the year.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Just one housekeeping item. The release says there's $250 million of repo in Q4 and $250 million in January. That $250 million in Q4 is really referring to a full year number, correct? Was there some settlement issue or something else that I'm missing there? It looks like you did $233 million through nine months.","Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think that was in October and we had some settlements in September. So there...","Janet Pfeffer - Vice President-Treasury & Investor Relations","Late October, we said we had spent I think $233 million and $250 million by the end of October, yes.","Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Did you catch that?","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Not completely, no.","Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Okay, sorry. We were joining in on the response in the room and I apologize for that. So we did do the $250 million in the fourth quarter. We talked about that roughly in the third quarter call. And then we had a separate 10b5-1 program that repurchased $250 million in January.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Right.","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","$250 million quarter four, $250 million quarter one.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","All right. I'll follow up. It says $233 million in the Q3 10-Q. That's why I'm confused. But I'll follow up.","Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","That's right. So, yeah. So what happened there, Jeff, so you're absolutely right. At the time we released earnings for the third quarter, which would have been the third week in October, we had not settled out the entire $250 million. So there was a little bit of leakage that was over into the remainder, but it was an October event.","So in other words, we were announcing that we had gone into the market just like we are now. We're not talking about the first quarter, but in the first quarter we repurchased the $250 million, we had repurchased $233 million in October and the total was $250 million for the fourth quarter.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay, got it. Thank you for clarifying.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you and good morning. This is Andrew Krill on for Deane. So going back to Residential HVAC, I was hoping you'd give a little more commentary on the mix of new buying versus repair. Have you seen any change in behavior there and I guess any margin implication this might have?","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, clearly we're seeing more that's not so much new construction and repair, it's largely new construction and replacement. And so we're moving back now towards replacement. Replacement is a very good place for us. We've got really good shares there as compared to new construction where shares are lower. So when the market moves toward replacement, we generally do much better and you saw that in the high-teens bookings in the fourth quarter and the overall good performance that we had in 2015, where we had really excellent performance in 2015.","Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, thank you. And then just a quick follow-up. I was wondering if you could give a little more color on China just by segment and then also you touched on VRF trends.","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, China, it's still rough. We're not seeing great progress in China in either business. Having said that, we're somewhat in a trough and we didn't see it really dip further in the quarter in quarter four. We saw great strength outside of China, so Singapore, Thailand, India, really sort of...","Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hong Kong.","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","...Hong Kong, kind of made the day for us relative to Asia. So, nice to see those markets finally recovering on that front.","VRF continues to do very well for us, continues to grow at or above the pace of our unitary business. And we continue to have a very high share in North America, parts of South America in the VRF business. And I think, as you know, we don't play a big role outside of those territories, we play a small role in China largely in commercial VRF or in hybrid systems.","Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you. That was it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan from UBS. Your line is now open.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning.","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Mike, in terms of the acquisitions and the currency impact on Industrial this year, I think it seems like every quarter they've been almost 200 basis points. Maybe Sue could provide us the split of what that was for 2015. How much was the acquisition impact, how much was currency? And then next year I'm assuming the acquisition impact year-over-year goes away but you still have some currency. Maybe help us on how those headwinds change.","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's split about 50\/50 in 2015. It was about 1 point both. So, translational and transactional would have been about 1 point and acquisitions would have been about 1 point of headwind.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","And for 2016?","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No acquisition headwind because everything based on the calendar, it was all a 2015 start and finish. So there's nothing there. On the FX side, it's going to be, again, a pretty tough row to hoe, probably 4 points of headwind coming into revenues and we'd see normal leverage against that. So it's probably 30 basis points, 40 basis points coming at us on that front.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And to your question on the full year of 2015, so the overall operating margins were down 140 basis points. And the math would work out roughly the same if you took out the foreign exchange and the acquisitions, that that would be the majority of what the decrement was in the overall operating margin percentage.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then as you think about eventually getting this business get past \u2013 a lot of the focus obviously currently on this call about the near-term Industrial weakness, but you do have this target you want to eventually get to for the 2017 to 2019, and now Todd is in place in the air business. Other than cost take-outs to deal with the tougher current volumes, what are the key things you think you need to clear in order to get this to be a higher-margin business a few years out?","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So the material handling piece, Shannon, probably hit for 1.5 points, maybe up to 2 points right there. So I think really an underestimation as to what the impact would be across the segment of the material handling business. So add 1.5 points there. I figure currency at least stops moving against us at some point and flattens out. That's going to be helpful to us. And then any volume we see there, we'd be leveraging that at 30%, 35% on that front.","So there's been very soft productivity in that business, as I mentioned, particularly as it relates to the integration, that work in the back half, work, once we saw the revenue outlook deteriorates through 2015. So, it's not a productivity issue. It's, again, if you look at a business like material handling, a small business with that sort of an impact \u2013 you look at currency, which they get not only translation but there's a much larger transactional component there, where it doesn't make sense for us to have too many factories at the machining and so on and so forth, so if you're putting those in the wrong part of the world it's hard to move those and you're going to absorb some of that headwind for a while.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks.","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, listen, I think that we'll update you when we're together for the Analyst Meeting, Todd will sit again (1:01:49) in that seat and give you a point of view on that. And then Robert Zafari will clearly tell you kind of the other pieces of this as well, which have material impact as they're very high-margin businesses.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Your line is now open.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question and good morning.","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","I think this has been asked a little bit already, but maybe just to put a finer point on some of the earlier questions about the Industrial assumption for flat growth given the orders have been decelerating. Just maybe, some color there on what's driving that expectation.","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, you look at 2009 when we saw customers abandoning equipments, shutting plants, we're not seeing that in 2015, we're not likely to see it in 2016. We're seeing customers that are just reducing CapEx. So, you're not seeing large machines as an example.","Now, large machines, both Cameron and existing Ingersoll-Rand, were about 10% of the total business. Now, we'll see parts and service probably in the mid- to high-single-digit range next year as these older systems need to be maintained and serviced. We even saw that begin to materialize in the back half of 2015. So again, 10% of the Compression Technology business being big machines, 45-ish percent being services. And then remember, too, you got Club Car, the tools and the fluid business which should be a tailwind. However, material handling will continue to be a headwind again going into 2016 there.","So, net that all out and the best view we have is that that math works to about negative 1 to 1.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got you. That's very helpful. And maybe just kind of, well, a housekeeping question on the Hussmann adjustment. I think you talked about $55 million from Hussmann and asbestos. I think those two items through the third quarter were just under $30 million. So, was there like a big Hussmann 4Q, or maybe you can just unpack that a little bit? That would be helpful. Thanks.","Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No, the Hussmann result in the fourth quarter were fairly normal with what they've been throughout 2015. So that really didn't have an impact. It was right on where we would have guided at the end of October.","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We'll look at what you're talking about, though, and follow back up if there's more to that question.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","A lot of my questions have been answered, so maybe just first one, on the price\/cost spread that you laid out there, Sue, if I think about how that pertains to Climate, threw the majority in there, am I to assume kind of normal volume leverage of that in the mid-20%s. Is that what you guys are essentially guiding to or am I missing something?","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, I think that would be a good assumption.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And then just a follow-up. I know we've beaten the Industrial megatrend discussion to death. But thinking about Cameron backlog presumably coming into 2016, that's a little bit lower. Probably, particularly low in the first quarter given that is more of a 4Q-weighted business. Is that something that is contemplating guidance? How should we think about that as maybe a headwind to the broader reading out of just comps getting easier on some of the resource industries and the service piece being an offset?","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Josh, no doubt we're going to see weaker big machine revenues. That's forecast into what we're doing. What we found here as an operator of the business is that the pricing in March in some of that big stuff is not very good. It's really around the service and longevity of those systems over time as opposed to sort of the impact on sale in the quarter and delivery.","So really, what we need to make up there in the weakness is service, parts. And in some of the smaller machines including oil-free and segments of the market that will continue to grow like pharmaceutical, food and beverage end markets where it's more consumer-driven, say, than it would be through heavy industry.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Got you. All right, that's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And I'd now like to turn the conference back over to Janet Pfeffer for any closing remarks.","Janet Pfeffer - Vice President-Treasury & Investor Relations","Thank you, operator. One thing I wanted to just clarify \u2013 I was a little far away from the mic. And so, on share repurchase, we completed the $250 million buy in the fourth quarter. $233 million of it was completed as of the end of September, the remainder completed out and settled in October. Just so to avoid some folks, any confusion on that, I wanted to clarify that.","And Joe and I will be around for your follow-up questions today. Everybody, have a good day. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Ingersoll Rand's third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. This call is being webcast on our website ingersollrand.com where you'll find the accompanying presentation. We are also recording and archiving this call on our website.","Please go to Slide 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release.","Joining me on today's call are Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO; and Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO. With that, please go to Slide 3, and I'll turn the call over to Mike. Mike?","Mike Lamach","Thanks, Zach and thanks everyone for joining us on the call today.","I'd like to start out today's call with a brief overview of our global business strategy that's enabling us to consistently deliver strong financial results for our shareholders. Fundamentally, our strategy as the nexus of environmental sustainability and impact, which are strong secular tailwinds for our business. The world is continuing to urbanize, while becoming warmer and more resource constrained as time passes.","At our core, we are focused on and excel at reducing the energy intensity in buildings, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing waste of food and other perishable goods and we excel in our ability to generate productivity for our customers all enabled by technology. Unless you think the world is getting cooler, less populated, and less resource constrained as time passes, these strong secular tailwinds will continue to provide opportunity for shareholders and purpose for our vision.","As we continue separation, integration planning activities related to the combination of our Industrial segment with Gardner, Denver and transformation activities related to our move towards creating the premier pure-play climate business in 2020, our aggressive pursuit of excellence in driving solutions to mitigate the impact of these secular trends only intensifies.","Our Climate businesses squarely focused 100% of our portfolio at the nexus of sustainability and global environmental impact, where our products and services can reduce the impact of these megatrends and further advance the platform for the company to grow above average global economic conditions.","Moving to Slide 4, we continue to deliver strong financial results by effectively managing through an evolving global landscape. In the third quarter, we delivered 6% organic revenue growth and 14% adjusted EPS growth, compounding on tough comps of 10% organic revenue growth and 22% adjusted EPS growth in the 3rd quarter of 2018.","We remain bullish on our strategy, the opportunities that lie ahead in our end markets broadly and particularly, and our team's resilience and their ability to execute, using our business operating system to deliver against the top tier organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS guidance targets we provided for fiscal 2019.","We continue to deliver strong and differentiated performance in Q3 in our Climate segment globally. Climate segment organic revenues were up 8% against a tough comp of 2018. Our global HVAC business performance was particularly strong, with approximately 10% organic bookings growth and approximately 10% organic revenue growth. Our performance was also broad based with North American commercial HVAC, European commercial HVAC, and residential HVAC, all significantly to contributing to the growth.","Our backlog pipeline and order rates continue to be solid and support healthy growth in the fourth quarter. This is reflected in our revised full year Climate segment organic growth guidance of 7% to 7.5% revenue growth, which is a four point above the top of the prior guidance range.","Delivering strong climate performance has enabled us to effectively offset persistent softness and global short cycle industrial spending, which drove organic revenue declines in our short cycle industrial businesses, mainly in compression technologies and tools.","In 2019 long cycle larger compressor orders are shown more resiliency and small to mid size short cycle compressors and we're building a solid backlog for these products year-over-year. However, the majority of these units won't ship or deliver meaningful revenues until 2020 and 2021.","Despite revenue declines in our high gross margin compression Technologies business, the steps we've taken to restructure and fundamentally improve our operations and service mix over the past several years, enabled us to manage the leverage of the business within our gross margin target rate, demonstrating what we believe is a more resilient business, better able to weather economic downturns.","In transport, we delivered low single-digit revenue growth in the quarter against the tough comp in 2018. We also expect revenues to moderate some in the second half versus the first half, again comparing a tough comps in the second half of 2018.","Further softening of the European economy combined with ongoing Brexit uncertainty, has softened our European trailer outlook for the back half of the year for the region. But we expect this to be largely offset by strong North American revenues for 2019.","Our outlook for mid single-digit organic revenue growth in 2019 for our overall transport business remains unchanged. We continue to effectively manage tariff and inflationary headwinds and deliver a positive price versus material cost spread.","Volume and productivity are also strong nailing us to drive solid margin expansion. As always delivering strong free cash flow and directing capital deployment towards high ROI projects remains core priorities.","Lastly, we're excited about the pending Reverse Morris Trust transaction with Gardner Denver, creating a premier industrial company, while simultaneously creating a leading pure-play Climate Technologies company, focused on HVAC and transport refrigeration. We believe both businesses have potential to unlock value for shareholders.","Please go to Slide 5. This slide provides a visual depiction of organic bookings and revenue growth in the third quarter. As I discussed on the prior slide, we delivered strong broad based bookings in revenue growth in virtually all businesses and regions and our Climate segment in the third quarter, and the business was up approximately 10% in organic bookings, excluding transport and up 8% overall in organic revenues.","Asia continues to see the impacts of trade tensions and broader economic uncertainty, remains a stable market. Commercial HVAC Asia, organic bookings were up mid single digits in the third quarter. Climate Asia organic revenues were down mid-single digits against the tough low teens revenue comp in China in the third quarter of 2018.","As I outlined on the prior slide, our Compression Technologies industrial products businesses continued to be impacted by the slowing industrial short cycle spending. Our small electric vehicle business has continued to deliver strong growth, driven largely by our consumer vehicle strategy. All in, industrial organic bookings and revenues were essentially flat in the quarter.","Please turn to Slide 6. We've encapsulated number of takeaways for our major end markets on this slide for your reference. I've covered much of this content already, so I'll just add a few brief comments before passing the call along to Sue.","First focused execution of our business strategy is enabling us to continue to deliver a very strong global HVAC performance, particularly in North America, Europe, and then the residential business. Our end markets are largely healthy, and we believe we are outperforming the underlying growth rates in these markets.","The transport market has softened a bit versus our view when we exited the second quarter, primarily really driven by the softening of the European market, which continues to be impacted by weakening economic fundamentals and uncertainty surrounding Brexit.","Overall, we believe focused execution of our strategy is enabling us to outperform global transport market conditions and we are on track to deliver mid single-digit growth in transport for 2019.","Lastly, have talked at length about slowing industrial short cycle spending impacting our quicker book and ship small and mid-sized air compressors, industrial products businesses. We expect this softness to continue through the fourth quarter, consistent with our updated 2019 guidance. And we expect to offset the softness with the strength we're seeing in global HVAC.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Sue to provide more details on the quarter. Sue?","Sue Carter","Thank you, Mike.","Please go to Slide 7. I'll begin with a summary of a few main points to take away from today's call. As Mike discussed, we delivered strong financial results in the third quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.99, an increase of 14% versus the year ago period, driven by strong performance in our climate segment. We continue to execute well in an evolving global landscape and remain on track to deliver against our full-year organic revenue growth, EPS growth, and margin guidance.","Third quarter organic revenue growth was strong, particularly in our climate segment. Orders were also strong in our climate segment. When excluding our transport business that saw outsized order growth in 2018, organic bookings were up high single digits for the enterprise and approximately 10% for our Climate segment.","In our Industrial segment organic revenues were flat versus a tough year-over-year comp of 9% organic revenue growth in the prior year. Strong revenue growth in small electric vehicles largely offset the softness in the industrial short cycle markets, we mentioned previously.","During Q3, we expanded adjusted operating margin 70 basis points and delivered 25% operating leverage consistent with our full year expectations. We continue to leverage our business operating system across the enterprise to manage direct material, tariff related, and other inflationary headwinds.","As we look to the fourth quarter, we will continue to leverage our business operating system to drive further margin expansion. As Mike mentioned, we continue to expect strong free cash flow in 2019 of equal to or greater than 100% of net income. Through Q3, we have delivered approximately $1 billion in free cash flow and are on track to hit our full year expectations.","Importantly, we continue to deliver on our balanced capital allocation strategy. During Q3, we deployed approximately $124 million in dividends and approximately $250 million on share buybacks. Looking forward, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time. ","Please go to Slide 8. Taking a step back from the details for a moment, Q3 was a very strong quarter with top quartile performance. We delivered organic revenue growth of 6%, adjusted operating margin improvement of 70 basis points and adjusted earnings per share growth of 14%.","Organic revenue growth was driven by global HVAC strength in our Climate segment, continued disciplined focus on pricing and productivity actions enabled us to effectively manage inflation and tariff related headwinds and drive margin expansion across the enterprise.","Please go to Slide 9. Our Climate segment delivered another strong quarter of operating income growth, enabling us to drive solid year-over-year EPS growth in the quarter. Our Industrial segment delivered $0.05 of EPS growth with solid small electric vehicles growth and the addition of our Precision Flow Systems acquisition that we closed in Q2, more than offsetting revenue declines in other industrial businesses.","In addition to good segment performance, third quarter corporate costs were lower than prior year, due to ongoing cost management activities, lower stock-based and incentive compensation and the timing of unallocated corporate spending. We now expect our full year corporate cost to be less than $240 million, down from our previous guidance of approximately $250 million.","Please go to Slide 10. In Q3 strong execution drove 70 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement on strong price versus material inflation and productivity versus other inflation spreads.","During the second half of 2019, we are lapping strong pricing implemented in the back half of 2018. Consistent with our expectations, we delivered 40 basis points of margin expansion from price versus material inflation. This represents our sixth consecutive quarter of positive price cost.","We delivered solid margin expansion from volume growth in the quarter. Margin expansion was tempered by mix pressure as we delivered outsized growth from commercial HVAC applied systems, as compared to other initially higher margin products like unitary or transport equipment. Over 20 to 30 year life an applied system carries high margin service and aftermarket parts, but the initial sale creates pressure on margin mix.","Additionally, consistent with last quarter, we saw a mix pressure from softness in short cycle industrial revenue which also tend to have high margins. Productivity versus other inflation across the enterprise improved margins by 80 basis points in the quarter.","In both our Climate and Industrial segments, we delivered strong productivity from operational excellence and restructuring savings. Reduced corporate costs also contributed to the margin expansion. We continue to invest heavily in growth and operating expense reduction projects with high returns on investment. Incremental Q3 investments totaled approximately 30 basis points.","Please go to Slide 11. Our Climate segment delivered another strong quarter with 8% organic revenue growth and adjusted operating margin expansion of 30 basis points. Consistent with our expectations, we delivered strong volume growth, price realization, and productivity.","Please go to Slide 12. In our Industrial segment organic revenues were flat against tough comps of 9% organic growth in the prior year. Strong revenue growth in small electric vehicles largely offset softness in the industrial short cycle markets.","Over the past several years, we have built a stronger more resilient industrial business. In our Compression Technologies business. for example, pricing. productivity, and restructuring savings partially offset volume declines to enable deleverage within gross margin rates for the second quarter in a row.","Industrial segment adjusted operating margins expanded 40 basis points in the quarter. Our high EBITDA margin PFS acquisition continues to improve our Industrial EBITDA margins. We expanded adjusted EBITDA margins 110 basis points in the quarter.","Please go to Slide 13. We remain committed to a dynamic capital allocation strategy that consistently deploys excess cash to the opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. We maintain a healthy level of business investments in high ROI technology, innovation and operational excellence projects, which are vital to our continued growth, product leadership, and margin expansion. We continue to make strategic investments in acquisitions that further improve long-term shareholder returns.","We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve. We have a longstanding commitment to a reliable, strong and growing dividend that increases at or above the rate of earnings growth over time.","With the proposed transaction with Gardner Denver growing closer, I'd like to highlight that we expect to maintain our annualized dividend of $2.12 per share post closing and through 2020.","This will deliver a very attractive dividend yield for the new Climate core. For 2021 and beyond, we will evaluate dividend increases in line with earnings growth, consistent with our longstanding capital deployment priorities. We continue to see value in share repurchases and we expect to consistently deploy 100% excess cash over time.","Please go to Slide 15. When we are on the road, we often get questions about the status of the proposed transaction to combine our Industrial segment with Gardner Denver. We continue to be excited about the prospects of creating a premier industrial company, as well as a leading pure-play Climate Technologies company focused on HVAC and transport refrigeration. I'll give you a brief update today.","First, the transaction with Gardner Denver remains on track for deal closure in early 2020. In reviewing our priorities between now and deal closure, our first priority is and will continue to be, running the business and taking care of our customers.","To maintain focus on our customers, we have dedicated teams carrying out separation and integration planning, as well as Climate core transformation activities. Separation activities encompass separation of technical and financial operating processes and systems, manufacturing operations, and supply chain services, and real estate, along with all business regulatory filings.","We have a detailed project plan and we are executing against that plan. When necessary, we are creating transition services agreements to support day one operations for certain processes and services.","At this stage, we anticipate one time separation and transaction related costs to be at the high-end of our previously communicated range of approximately $150 million to $200 million. Given that we in Gardner Denver continue to operate as two separate companies and compete in the marketplace until the close of the transaction. The integration planning work must be managed under clear rules and antitrust protocols.","We will continue to work within these rules as we progress towards day one of the new industrial business. Additionally, we expect to leverage this opportunity to further improve our Climate business to better serve our customers and unlock value for shareholders with a singular focus on reducing the world's energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions. We are building on an incredibly strong foundation with great businesses, engaged and talented people, and a distinctive winning culture, and core values.","As I said at the beginning, we remain excited about the prospects of creating a premier industrial company, as well as a leading pure-play Climate Technologies Company. On another note, given the outsize transport order growth in 2018, we often get questions on the road about our order outlook. As we look at the fourth quarter. I'll remind you that we booked a large commercial order worth approximately $200 million in Q4 of last year.","As we discussed when we booked this order, the revenues are expected to be recognized over the course of approximately 3.5 years. Excluding this large order, we have tough comps in the rest of the business where enterprise organic bookings were up approximately 11% and Climate segment organic bookings were up approximately 13%.","Please go to Slide 16. As we highlighted earlier, we continue to execute well in an evolving landscape. All in our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance remains unchanged at approximately $6.40. Our enterprise revenues and margin guidance also remains unchanged.","With our continued strong Climate segment revenue growth led by global HVAC, we now anticipate full year organic revenues to grow between approximately 7% and 7.5%, a four point higher than our original guidance.","Our Industrial segment revenues have been impacted by soft short cycle investment spending. We now anticipate Industrial organic revenue to be flat to up 0.5% for the year, as we expect short cycle softness to persist in the fourth quarter.","Our guidance for both our Climate segment and our Industrial segment margin rates remain unchanged, although we do anticipate delivering towards the high-end of the Climate range and towards the low-end of the Industrial range.","We are increasing full-year restructuring cost guidance to approximately $0.30 from $0.25 primarily related to additional footprint optimization efforts. We have a couple of elements of guidance, we also recommend tweaking including reduced corporate spending to less than $240 million and a lower expected effective tax rate of approximately 20% to 21%.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike.","Mike Lamach","Thanks Sue.","Please go to Slide 17. In summary, we're effectively managing the global landscape, as it evolves to deliver our 2019 guidance for top tier revenue growth, EPS growth, and free cash flow in 2019. Looking forward, we believe the company is extremely well positioned to deliver strong shareholder returns over the next several years.","Fundamentally, our strategy remains at the nexus of environmental sustainability and impact. Today 15% of the world's carbon emissions come from heating and cooling buildings and by 2030, it's estimated that 25% will derive from these sources. Transport, refrigeration creates another 80 million metric tons of Co2 emissions annually, which can be eliminated through electrification over time.","Earlier this year, we announced our 2030 ESG commitments, which included a commitment to reduce our customer carbon footprint by one gigaton of Co2, through our HVAC and transport refrigeration products and services.","We believe this is the largest Customer Climate commitment made by any B2B company, and our math shows that this reduction could equate to 2% of the world's total emissions. Besides the scale, it's equivalent to the annual emissions of Italy, France, and the U.K. combined.","At the Climate Summit last month, we also introduced the same challenge to like-minded companies. We are bending the global warming curve by changing the way the world heats and cools buildings and moves refrigerated cargo. New technology, we've developed can reduce up to 99% of the emissions that come from heating and cooling a commercial building and this doesn't include the substantial environmental benefit of increasing system energy efficiency, through optimized system designs, advanced controls, and data analytics. Ongoing system monitoring, and service and maintenance.","These comprehensive solutions can also dramatically reduce power generation at the source energy storage requirements. We're continually working to innovate in this way to electrify heating, electrify diesel engines used to cool trucks and trailers that transport perishable goods, and to reduce the energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions in residential and commercial buildings.","Our 2030 ESG commitments also included addressing a host of other important issues. We continue to transform our supply chain and operations to have a restorative impact on the environment including achieving carbon-neutral operations and giving back more water than we use in water-stressed areas. We are committed to increasing opportunity for all, strengthening economic mobility, and bolstering the quality of life of our people.","Additionally, we are committed to gender parity and leadership roles. The workforce reflective of our community populations, maintaining a livable market competitive wages, and broadening community access to cooling comfort and healthy foods. We've been investing heavily for years to build franchise brands and to advance our leadership market positions to enable consistent profitable growth. We have an experienced management team and a high performing culture that instills operational excellence into everything we do.","We remain committed to dynamic and balanced deployment of capital and we have a strong track record of deploying excess cash to deliver top-tier shareholder returns over the years. Lastly, we're extremely excited about the proposed transaction and the strategic combination of our industrial segment with Gardner Denver.","Combining two of the premier complementary industrial companies, offers the opportunity to drive significant innovation and growth with meaningful revenue and cost synergies supported by secular growth trends and diverse end market exposure.","We're also excited about creating the premier pure-play HVAC and transport refrigeration company, with our existing Climate segment businesses. We have a tremendous opportunity to leverage a simplified business model and design, and sharpen our sustainability focus in our investments.","Our Climate businesses have clearly differentiated performance and we see significant opportunity as a pure-play to building this performance for our employees, customers, and shareholders.","And with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Steve Tusa","I don't unusually suck up on these calls, but congrats to you guys for not getting over year ski dips after a good first half and staying conservative. It obviously is warranted in this environment. So kudos to you guys for that. On the businesses, resi, you're saying contributed to kind of orders and revenue growth. So that means there was kind of revenues up greater than a high single-digit and orders up around double digit. Is that kind of the messaging there on resi?","Mike Lamach","The resi was strong Steve, I agree with what you said. We typically don't think about residential bookings, because residential bookings turn so quickly, but we did on in the quarter with a low teens booking number. So to the extent you can read a little forward in the fourth quarter. I feel it's going to be fairly strong again.","Sue Carter","I'm going to also say, Steve, as you think about that our residential business in addition to having good revenues in the third quarter also had some tough comparisons to the third quarter of last year, where the revenues were also very high.","Steve Tusa","Clearly you guys are taking some of this year that was lost by Lanex. What are the mechanics of kind of holding on to those customers. And is that - do you feel like that's now yours to lose or is they kind of try and come back after that there is a risk that that fades?","Mike Lamach","Steve, I'll just say we're just executing our own strategy here. So this is building great stuff, having great distribution, working through all the technical and digital work that we've been working on now for a couple of years. So this is just really us executing against our own strategy more than it is anything else.","Steve Tusa","And then just a quick one on the details on the productivity and other on inflation. Even ex - the corporate kind of benefits there, it looks pretty solid, like up 50 basis points. To me it was up 80 basis points reported. Anything specific to call out there and is that kind of the benefits of recent restructuring and is that something that you guys can pull lever on into - in the future if things get a little bit weaker on your revenues?","Mike Lamach","I'll let Sue come here in a second. Steve, one thing I'd say would be on the corporate side, we worked really hard at reducing corporate cost and thought about this over the past year and a half 2 years now and putting the same lean tools toward benchmarking and executing against cost reductions there. So I'm happy to see that that's actually flowing through. And then Sue do you have any other comments?","Sue Carter","Yes, I think when you think about the productivity in general, Steve, you're absolutely right. Some of the productivity in operations comes from normal productivity projects that we have on any given year, but it also comes from some of the restructuring that we've done over the past couple of years.","And on the corporate side to Mike's point, we worked really hard at decreasing the functional spending over time. We know we've been successful at that, in that we've leveled down to spending as well as have offset any inflation that comes into the corporate arena. And just in case anyone is thinking about the less than $240 million.","The fourth quarter is when all have different accruals and other things get trued up, so we didn't want to get ahead of ourselves on what that look like. But all in all, a really good productivity quarter for the entire company.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Jeff Sprague","Maybe to pick up on that thread a little bit, should we view what we're seeing in corporate costs here kind of a running start on the stranded costs? And could you update us on what your view there is? And how that should play out maybe over the next couple of quarters?","Mike Lamach","Yes, we - Jeff, we've done a lot of work on the blueprinting to this point, about where we think the opportunity is for all of Climate across the - all the Climate - I'm sorry, all the cost structure, whether that be at corporate or what's in the segments. Also rethinking what should be in corporate and what should be in the segments.","But with that being said, there is probably 10 specific ideas we have kind of going forward into 2020 that we're beginning to execute on as it relates to the entire cost structure. And so, yes, you can think about this as getting a running start on 2020.","Jeff Sprague","And then just the order and revenue performance, certainly impressive, I'll echo that. How are you feeling about backlogs now, Mike? I mean, did you have notable backlog depletion in this quarter? I think the commercial HVAC franchise overall was at something like 21% backlog growth last quarter, if I recall correctly. Just your visibility in Q4 I'm sure is very buttoned up. But how much further around the corner can you look?","Mike Lamach","Yes, pipelines look very strong, coming in backlogs look still very strong. Jeff, I'll go back and look at the 21, you're talking on Q2 versus Q1, I'd have to go back and give you a number, Q2 to Q3. But my guess is we didn't deplete much of the backlog there. It was a strong bookings quarter again for us, so that all feels good.","Even in the industrial compressor business and we've had backlog build on - engineered order compressor is backlog build on oil-free rotary, backlog on services, so there's goodness built up I think in the backlog going forward.","The only place we saw a reduction of backlog would have been in Thermo King. It's fundamentally just a weakening Europe from the last view we had in quarter 2 and then also just some summer cancellations that occurred. But backlog there is still above where it was this year last time, it's just a little bit less than it was last time we spoke, if you heard the last quarter.","Steve Tusa","And just, finally, on TK obviously your comments are around Europe weakness, but kind of all eyes are probably on kind of the ACT numbers into next year. I think you're trying to avoid 2020 outlook here today on the call. But how do you feel about your ability to kind of counteract kind of pressure in that part of the business potentially next year?","Mike Lamach","Yes, I think the context to put it in, Jeff, would, to say that on a pro forma basis Climate Co would have about 5%, through less than 5% of its revenue is associated with North American trailer, which is really what we're talking about here.","And if you took the ACT numbers at face value it would reflect something on the order of an 18% decline between the 49.9 units this year and next year is in the 41 in change range. So if you think about that, less than 5% revenue and 18% drop you end up with something less than one point of revenue headwind to the company.","And I think that only TK has significant levers to pull with a lot of new launches and product innovation coming through in 2020. But I feel good about the HVAC businesses at large and the backlog that we're building there and what I still think is kind of early to mid in the North American institutional cycle as well.","So I feel like without giving specific 2020 guidance, we've sized that we think we've got plenty of levers to pull to have a good year in 2020.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is open.","Scott Davis","It seems like - and maybe I am over reading this that ESG has become a pretty big theme for you guys almost increasingly every quarter. And just what I'm wondering is, how much does this narrow or widen the lens I guess when it comes to M&A for once that deal is done? Meaning, are you more likely to stick to HVAC or think more broadly? Is ESG as a theme overall, kind of afford you at least the mindset to think a little bit more broadly?","Mike Lamach","Well, I think you about - I think you think about it as a funnel, really if you think about the enormity of the HVAC and transport refrigeration markets, and businesses first, that's obviously, what the go forward company is very good at.","And then you look at that in the context of any innovation or idea that we would have that would make sense from a reducing energy intensity, reducing greenhouse gas emissions point of view, it's going to be additive to that. So I think you look at those in combination as opposed to independently.","Scott Davis","I guess that kind of answers it. But I'll move on to the next one. When do you think about...","Mike Lamach","Yes, Scott, I was just - Scott just to be really clear, because I wanted to be clear on this, we've got plenty to do in our co space. And so we're not opening the lens here to think about a third leg of the stool from a sustainability perspective.","We're building the company on its HVAC and refrigeration routes, and to the extent we find things that lower energy intensity and lower greenhouse gas emissions within that, that's sort of a double check for us.","Scott Davis","And just one of the things that sometimes tough to analyze is the mix of non-resis as you think about your order book. I mean, is there a mix change as far as complexity and size of projects, and things like that, that we should think about for 2020 or something in your backlog?","Mike Lamach","In the mix really wouldn't be size of projects. The mixes that come into play here are going to be things like applied systems versus unitary systems, which applied carry a lower initial gross margin. But over the long haul we're pretty agnostic to the margins because service margins really accrue to the applied business.","And then as we're growing the HVAC business faster than the transport business of course the transport margins are higher than the HVAC business. Those are the general issues that we see. But as we look at the business regionally, the EBITDAs from the three businesses regionally are fairly close. And so we're somewhat agnostic to where in the world the growth is, but certainly the actual product or systems or services can change the mix for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open.","Julian Mitchell","Just wanted to focus on the Climate revenue guidance a little bit. So you took up the guide I think for the year, just over a points organically for Climate. I just wanted to confirm, if that's mostly resi related and you took up your resi market guide for the year. Just when you're thinking over the next 18 months or what have you - any perspective you could provide on the longevity of the resi replacement cycle in the US, understanding that resi is only 15%, 20% or so of the Climate piece.","Mike Lamach","Yes, Julian. We took up Climate really based on just universal strength across the globe and pipeline bookings and backlog in general. So it would have been commercial and residential across the board. The point you made about residential going up, I think it might have been related to last quarter, I think we had a bit of a typo in the deck, we might have said low-single digit to mid-single digit. We didn't mean to do that. It was always mid single-digit. Zack, is that about right?","Zac Nagle","No. We actually put low single-digit in the deck, instead of low to mid single digit, which is what we've always intended.","Mike Lamach","Yes, okay. So we don't really feel different about Razzall year long is playing out the way that we thought it would. And then really to comment on the cycle, we've got over the years pretty good sources of data and analytics that are proprietary to what we use. And because our business is so dependent on replacement, it's well north of 80% replacement for us, we're watching it very carefully. But we really don't see anything here in the near future that would change our view toward a strong 2020 in the residential business for us.","Julian Mitchell","And then just my second quick follow up would be around, just if you could give some more color on the Climate business in Asia. It seems quite choppy. Some of the construction trends there, you've got some tough comps. But you do have the benefits, I guess, of a lot of share gains from that distribution build out you did a couple of years ago. So maybe just give us some context as to how you see growth there in your non-res climate business in Asia and anything on competitive discipline as well.","Mike Lamach","Yes, I think that we're still seeing Asia in general, in China specifically to your question, is being a good market over the long run. You're seeing a change within China around end markets themselves. And so if you think about the three largest markets in Asia, the retail, leisure, and office, all three of those markets are down significantly. Retail is down - am talking about the market, down about 15%, leisure down about 11%, office about 6.5%. Those are big markets that are down.","Interestingly, industrial markets are up, that's good for us and things like education and transportation are up double-digit even though they're smaller markets. But those are the markets that we wanted to focus on from an applied perspectives being longer cycle but core to the economy, core to the 5-year plan in China. So we will continue to, I think, see good markets there and continue to see benefits of the direct strategy that we put in place in China.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Nigel Coe","So I just want to go back to the productivity buckets and the 80 basis points. How does that land between the two segments? I know you've been restructuring in both segments, so I'm just curious whether it was heavier in one versus the other? And then maybe just touch on the industrial business, what's changed since 2016 where we saw a lot of deleverage in that business. And I know that was partly due to the fact you just acquired Cameron. But what's changed today versus three or four years ago to kind of hold in margins a lot better through a choppy environment?","Mike Lamach","Productivity was about equal between both segments, there is nothing remarkable that we're seeing really there. Inflation would have been higher on the Climate side. So the net would have been a little bit stronger toward industrial net productivity if you think about total productivity over non-material productivity, industrial would have been a little bit stronger. And there there's been really good progress over the years, just to congratulate all our leaders in the industrial space.","Todd has done a very nice job, specifically, in the Compression Technology business around looking at some of this footprint there. And we've essentially gone from a number of larger compressor plants down to a smaller number and if executed that without missing a hitch. And so there's a very strong market work there.","I would tell you within the Club Car business they're doing an outstanding job and they have grown this consumer vehicle into a meaningful part of the business. And every time we sell a consumer vehicle versus a gol fleet vehicle we mix up in terms of the margin.","Pleased with what's happening in our tool and material handling business. And even material handling in particular has been back to the black, after pretty strong declines over the years in oil and gas. And then our fluid management PFS business, really had a record Q3 for them, and so we're proud of what's happening there. Coming out of private equity, it's always a challenge to improve margins. But the team managed to improve margins in Q3.","So just across the board good performance and to us, it's a test of the resilience that we talk about and stress testing our business to make sure that when we do see negative revenue growth that the deleverage can be maintained inside of our gross margins and we get that question a lot from investors. And so it's important point out that when we see this, and we have leverage inside that sort of 30% margin number, it's indicative of the fact that we think we're executing well against the plans.","Nigel Coe","Mike, that's good detail. And then just on the - you pointed out in the slides that big $20 million project you booked in 4Q. What's the outlook for, number one, the funnel for commercial globally? Maybe just touch on that. But specifically these large mega projects, because I'm assuming in NGL net wealth, we will see a lot more of these large projects, maybe rip and replace type projects. So maybe just touch on that please.","Mike Lamach","Yes. It's almost normal now for us to see large projects in the pipeline. It's difficult to predict when they close and what they look like when they are complete. We've got a number in the backlog. I would say not as large as that. But maybe collectively some of the large projects would total that.","So we are seeing see more of that. It is more of a sort of base business for us at this point in time in terms of our ability to execute against that. And we're set up to do that, so we've invested heavily in that business, and we do have a pipeline of larger project sitting in that backlog.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","John Walsh","I was wondering, if you could talk a little bit about what you saw in service for both the Climate business and the industrial business as well, a little more granularity around those growth rates?","Mike Lamach","Yes, I mean service for both - there has been a strategy for both, I mean, so there is nothing new in terms of our focus on the services business there at all. Service is for us spend something that's grown kind of in the high single-digit range, particularly in the Climate business over the last decade or so. That continues to clip along at about that level consistently as we're going forward.","And then, as you've seen in the Industrial segment from the reports we did here that we continue to see good service growth there - differentiated service growth there to the mix. So maybe a little bit less than what we've seen in climate over time, but again it's been a healthy mid-to-higher single-digit growth in industrial services over time.","And really when we're talking about Industrial Services, it's really in our compressor technology business, and that's generally going to be based off our largest and tropical, and engineered order or larger oil-free compressors as opposed to some of the book in turn smaller compressors, which don't have the same sort of service opportunity.","John Walsh","And then going back to kind of the M&A question. I mean, I think a lot of time we focus on the larger deals, but you did get the smaller deal done here in September? And I was just kind of curious what kind of made this particular company and interesting property for Ingersoll, was it something on the technology side, was it something to do with where their service and sales reps were located? Any color around these smaller kind of single that are out there to do in the industry would be helpful.","Mike Lamach","I appreciate you actually for raising that. We've done about 18 or so of those last few years, a lot them are sort of that size, maybe a little bit smaller. But typically it's going to be a technology that we think is nobel, it's innovative, it's not part of the portfolio today. It may come with a channel, it may not.","But generally speaking, if we can take an innovative product and then move it through the dedicated train commercial channel, it's a home run for us. In other cases, there is also strategy to maintain a second channel through independent reps and that's an important element where we might go to market the train for some of the portfolio, and in this case Arctic chiller for another part of the portfolio, so that multi-channel strategy can work for some of this as well.","This is just a nobel idea around a modular smaller chiller design for modular small applications and it just adds to our portfolio in that regard.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Andrew Obin","Just going back to Slide 10, if you look at volume leverage, anyway you can decompose it between Climate and Industrial. And specifically what I'm trying to get at, you cited applied impacting volume leverage at Climate and I'm just trying to figure out how bad it was and when does it go away? Thank you.","Sue Carter","So. Andrew, I think as you're looking in at volume in total, I think the volume - that you're talking about the volume leverage is going to come out of the Climate segment, which is what we were talking about with the markets, a little flatter on the industrial side. That isn't going to be the piece of it.","And as we were going through on the different areas, in constructing the slide what we wanted to look at was not only what it was contributing, and then the comments around mix that we've given throughout, the commentary with that being more to the applied side than to the unitary side. But it was more on the Climate side than Industrial.","Mike Lamach","And Andrew on that. I mean, I'm looking I'm seeing volume kind of flowing through pretty much at the 25% level. For Climate it was the mix that kind of pull that back a little bit from there. And if I go to the deleverage the organic side of the deleverage in Industrial, it delevered at about the gross margins of the business, hard a little bit on mix. But again this is where the productivity and imagine, then that productivity equation and price helped that out quite a bit.","Andrew Obin","Yes, that makes sense. And just a follow-up question. I know institutional market is quite important to you, seem to be constructive. If you look at construction put in place data, institutional markets, education, healthcare, it seems to be a mixed at best. So what gives you confidence that this market continues to grow into the year-end and into 2020? Thank you.","Mike Lamach","Well, thank you. What I would say is, when you look at put in place you really only get about half the visible market and the other half of the visible market is the market that you go out and create demand with by putting offers to customers that would reduce their energy intensity or improve operations in their buildings. And so, notwithstanding what you said, what I would tell you that in quarter 3, from a vertical market perspective, the strength we saw was in higher education and in health care.","We saw that and continue to see that going into the fourth quarter, and in 2020 just by virtue of the pipeline that we're chasing. Commercial and industrial, we saw strength there in energy, food, beverage and interestingly even in retail, which gets to be national accounts and some of the brick and mortar out there. So that was again really strong for us as well.","But we're seeing a very good pipeline going forward in these markets and that put in place data really tells only about half the story. Now its indicative of what we're seeing in the marketplace.","Andrew Obin","And do you guys track bond issuance in those markets, do they tell you anything in terms of visibility?","Mike Lamach","Yes. They - well, they do. They get - that's a very long leading indicator toward visibility in the marketplace. Generally speaking, when we know that a school district is going about or applying for bonds, we know generally than what they're trying to do or construct with those bonds.","And so we're doing some preliminary work with schools as they're going out for bonds to get estimates for what things might cost and sort of what it might take from an operational basis to maintain those facilities. That of course is predicated on that bond actually passing and then once that bond passes it can go through a fairly traditional cycle of detailed models and designs, all the way through procurement.","So again it's a very early indicator on a bond. But generally speaking, if we know a school district or a hospital is going for a bond vote, we're going to be working with that customer to understand what the scope of the project might look like.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Nicole DeBlase","So I just want to start on the climate margins, just to take that a step further. So understanding that you guys did 25% incrementals on volume growth. The 4Q margin assumption seems to embed a bit of a stronger performance versus 3Q. Is that all accountable or attributable to the mix headwind going away or are you anticipating stronger incrementals on volumes as well?","Mike Lamach","Nicole just to be clear, is it - there is another call in the line, right?","Nicole DeBlase","Yes.","Mike Lamach","Yes. Okay, good. I wasn't sure if I was first on the line. So are you quarter 4 Climate leverage, specifically?","Nicole DeBlase","Exactly, yes.","Mike Lamach","Sue, what's your view on that?","Sue Carter","Well - so if you look at the volume leverage in Q4, it is straightly - slightly stronger than it is in Q3. But again the environment is roughly going to be the same as what we were seeing in Q3. So in other words, growth in all of the end markets, a probably same slide towards applied versus unitary. But there really isn't a huge amount of change that comes out of the volume leverage in Q4. But again all of our businesses are going to continue to grow in Q4, residential, the commercial businesses, etc.","Mike Lamach","Nicole, when you look at total leverage for quarter 4, Sue, is absolutely right on the volume piece of it. What I would tell you is that the mix will hurt us a little bit more there. We think about more applied, less transport, we would expect less price than we would have in Q3 sequentially just because we're kind of lapping price there again.","So I would think that we'll manage the full year for the enterprise with the same 25% we talked about. But I would expect that quarter 4 will look a lot like quarter 3 for Climate, probably not any better.","Nicole DeBlase","And then you brought up price cost, it seems to me that because you're lapping tougher pricing comps and 4Q price cost impact to margins probably comes down a little bit. But thoughts on that, and then any early thoughts into 2020 just specifically on the price cost front?","Susan Carter","So if you think about Q4, I think the back half of 2019 is similar. So I think you'll see about the same thing in Q4 that you saw in Q3. And as I think about 2020 - so I am going to give you an answer and it's not going to be what you want, which is what our guide is. But when I think about 2020 and I think about tier one materials on steel, copper, aluminum, should all be on the surface deflationary.","So in a good spot, we see the spot prices coming down, we're seeing it in results. And that should be a really nice tailwind, if you will, going into 2020. However, is that - as we look at this, we want to watch this play out over the upcoming months, because we just do not know what the tariffs and all of those pieces are going to mean to 2020.","So in other words you could have deflation on those base materials and you could be offset by tariffs. You could have a change in the tariffs and that's just something that we're not comfortable with trying to give that outlook on. So I can tell you what I see on spot prices and then what we're doing on early buys of material going into 2020. But we'll just watch the environment and then as we get closer to 2020 give you a guide on what we think it looks like at that point in time.","Mike Lamach","Nicole I'd say that there has been so much as you know volatility around news and announcements coming out around tariffs that unfortunately, we've gotten pretty good at being able to react to it. It takes us about two days to get from an announcement or a change to having that flow through and understand from a growth perspective, what the impact is and it takes us maybe a week from that point in time to understand what we think we can do from a net perspective around mitigating some of that.","And therefore, then we know at that point in time, probably a week or so later, what we need to do from a pricing perspective and so volatile. That I think, we're comfortable with our ability to react and change and understand and push sort of pricing through and mitigate what we can, that at this point in time, we're not trying to guess where things go in 2020 there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Mike, just to follow-up on, I think a couple of questions trying to get at maybe kind of the shift and climate over time toward more sustainability and energy efficiency. It seems like a lot of your competitor\u2019s talk more about selling boxes and you guys are talking more about selling solutions. Can you give us a sense for how that mix has evolved in terms of just kind of straight away product sold through traditional channels versus something that, is this more kind of comprehensive sustainability path?","Mike Lamach","Yes, I think two things have happened I mean, one is that obviously the world is looking at regulations differently around greenhouse gas emissions, understanding the impact of refrigeration systems on the environment that's one. Two, as these systems become greener, if you don't do anything to the fundamental underlying system, the refrigerants tend to be less energy efficient. So you're on your end up using more power to generate the same level of cooling and heating in the system.","And so from a system level, it's really making sure that you can reduce the energy intensity while using next-generation refrigerants. And so there's a lot of innovation that goes into that. It also feeds right into how we think about the need to have a direct a very high-quality sales force at there. It's typically engineers or professional engineers selling to professional engineers and our customers in the commercial space in that model exists for us all over the world, because these are complex trade-offs. And then as you think about 30 year lives on many of these systems.","Any innovation you have an advantage you have and what the cost of maintaining those systems will be, it can be a very meaningful sort of a kicker to total cost of ownership. And so, it's just the way we go to market, it's our model and when we think about creating demand. It was the earlier question about put in place. And I said about half of it is put in place and half of it is going out and creating demand.","The half that we go out and create demand with are looking for those kinds of customers that understand this technically and are wanting to do something about it and may have systems of age, a variety where there is a particular opportunity to go have a high return on invested capital. And so, it's just a more sophisticated sale and way to market and that's what we train people to do. I mean we train them technically. And then we train them financially around how to go make the case.","Josh Pokrzywinski","So it's really all the mix has shifted toward this. It's kind of getting away from how you need a box for the top of your strip mall and we'll sell you one.","Mike Lamach","Well, it's really - time it's - you try to move away from responding to quotes to creating specifications, creating opportunities and creating your own demand and that is the control element of what we do even in a downturn. Right, as opposed to sitting back waiting for something to be built and asking you. So we asking you for a price, there is plenty to do in the world today, to go out and create an opportunity for return on investment for somebody.","I think two as in a downturn and I said this very often, we fully expect both our service business and our performance contracting business to increase, because you have to maintain or extend asset life and a few - we no longer extend the asset life. We've got a way of paying for these assets through the energy savings that we're willing to guarantee as part of the asset swap.","Operator","There are no further questions queued up at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Zac Nagle for closing remarks.","Zac Nagle","Thank you, operator, I'd like to thank everyone for joining today's call. I apologize to anyone who is not able to answer - or get a question asked in the queue. However, Shane and I will be available all day today and obviously in the coming days and weeks to answer any questions that you may have. And we encourage you to call and we look forward to seeing on the road soon. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"11356":["Ingersoll-Rand Plc (NYSE:IR) Q1 2016 Earnings Call April 26, 2016 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Janet Pfeffer - Vice President-Treasury & Investor Relations","Michael W.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Janet Pfeffer. Ma'am, you may begin.","Janet Pfeffer - Vice President-Treasury & Investor Relations","Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Ingersoll-Rand's first quarter 2016 conference call. We released earnings at 6:30 this morning and the release is posted on our website. We'll be broadcasting in addition to this call through our website at ingersollrand.com, and that's also where you'll find the slide presentation that we'll be referring to this morning. The call will be recorded and archived on our website.","If you'd please go to slide two.

Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Janet. For those of you who don't know, that's Janet's last time she'll be to read the Safe Harbor statement. She's retiring at the end of this month after a brilliant career at Ingersoll-Rand. We're going to miss Janet greatly. And, Janet, I want to wish you and Ron all the best in your retirement.","Janet Pfeffer - Vice President-Treasury & Investor Relations","Thank you.","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So with that, we delivered a very strong quarter that exceeded EPS guidance and reflected excellent execution across the whole company. The quarter really demonstrated the consistency we're seeing in our strategy, which is to deliver sustainable, profitable growth, and I'd highlight a few areas here. First, we're leading our markets in the innovation and development of energy-efficient, reliable and sustainable products and services. Second, we're deepening the penetration, the maturity of our operating system, and we're delivering operational excellence across our businesses.","Third, we're maintaining a disciplined and dynamic approach to capital allocation. And finally, as I said before, critical to any sustained cultural transformation, our employees are engaged, their scores are continuing to increase across the company. Employees continue to see Ingersoll-Rand as a great place to work, which in turn leads to a better customer experience, and that ultimately delivers shareholder value.","Our performance in the first quarter gives us confidence to raise our full-year guidance, essentially flowing through the first quarter operational beat. Now this morning I'm going to you an overview of what we're seeing in our end markets across the globe and use the opportunity to talk a bit about how we're performing against this market backdrop, give you some color on how we're progressing for the year.","I thought it would be useful to highlight where our performance maps specifically to our overall strategy, and then I'm going to turn it over to Sue and she'll take you through the quarter and our revised guidance for the remainder of the year.","So over the past 16 weeks I've spent the majority of my time on the road with leaders across the company, and during that time I've met with customers from many of our business units across vertical markets and regions of the world. I've spent considerable time with our customer-facing employees, from service technicians to sales teams.","And as always I've spent time inside our operations talking with the people who are building and engineering our products to gain their perspective on the maturity and momentum in our operating system. And I've witnessed good momentum in the deployment of our operating system and remain confident that there is still a long runway of opportunity in front of us.","With that, let's go to slide 4. And I'm going to note that all my comments are on an organic basis so they're going to exclude currency and acquisitions. And I'll turn first to the North American Climate segment, where our business remains strong overall and we expect this momentum to continue for the balance of the year. In commercial HVAC recent, put in place data continues to support mid-single-digit growth. And we believe this should continue through at least 2017.","We continue to see strong growth in the retail and office markets, within the institutional markets; education and government markets are also strong. We saw a low-teens revenue growth in the quarter coupled with high-single-digit bookings growth. I want to point out too that we expect to see a record for quarter two with commercial HVAC North American bookings, which should be up approximately 25% over quarter two as a result of some large institutional project awards.","We expect to continue to outperform the overall market for the balance of the year. Additionally, we're executing well on the volume and saw excellent operating leverage in the quarter. Growth here is a direct reflection of the constant investment we've made over the past years. And we've seen growth specifically in the areas where we have invested, whether in product growth teams, products or channel. As in 2015, we are beginning quarter one of 2016 with double-digit growth in our controls and service business. With over 4,300 company direct service mechanics and technicians, we believe we are now the largest provider of mechanical HVA service to commercial customers in the world.","Additionally, when we break out our critical growth programs from the base business, we are seeing mid-teens growth in these programs. Overall execution has been excellent. With clear discipline, the management team is running the business through our operating system. Like commercial, our residential HVAC North American business is likely to continue to outperform the market as well. We're proud of this performance and what's ahead for this business.","I'm occasionally asked what do investors misunderstand about Ingersoll-Rand, and in reading some of the sell-side reports I think there is some misunderstanding about the success we've had in the residential HVAC business, and so I want to lay out some of the facts for you. According to AHRI data, we have increased share each quarter over the past six quarters including the first quarter of 2016. For all of 2015 and continuing into the quarter one of 2016, we have a residential HVAC business with mid-teen EBITDA margins, which makes it accretive to the segment and IR as a whole. Quarter one brought mid-teen bookings growth for the second consecutive quarter and mid-single-digit revenue growth and very strong operating leverage. Our market outlook remains positive. We forecast 4% to 5% unit growth for the industry, and we anticipate our revenue growth to be in the high-single-digit range for the year.","The residential team has done an outstanding job implementing our operating system across its full footprint. The team is running the entire business in a full product growth value stream, and it's showing in the execution. And strategically, we've executed well on our complete product refresh, repositioning of our channel strategies, and in our connected home strategy, where we have a profitable business platform, robust diagnostic capabilities and nearly 200,000 Nexia enrollments to date. Additionally, connected home is a key driver of our residential Controls business, which has more than doubled since 2011 and continues to grow at around 25% annually.","Shifting to North America and transport refrigeration markets, as usual the management team did a great job in the quarter and managed to improve their margins with high operating leverage. North America continues to hold up well, especially in the truck and trailer market. Our current view of truck and trailer has improved from our original view of the market from earlier this year.","ACT raised its trailer units forecast to 47,000 units, which is up about 1% versus last year, and their prior forecast was for the market to be down 10%. We view this market data as being a bit aggressive, but we have raised our own forecast to approximately 45,000 units. And you may recall that our own prior forecast was 39,000 trailer units. So even though we do expect the market to be down over the record performance from last year, our view has improved from when we spoke in February.","Our truck refrigeration business was also solid, and the overall market for Class 3 to Class 7 trucks is showing moderate growth. And we continue to pursue growth strategies in rail, bus and auxiliary power units to continue to balance North American business into additional vertical markets.","As we look toward the HVAC and transport refrigeration markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, we plan to continue to outperform the market in the year ahead with additional new product and service launches planned in the year and excellent management teams executing on the ground, delivering good margin expansion and cash conversion growth.","We continue to do very well in Europe with organic bookings in the high-single digits against the flattish market backdrop. We are seeing excellent uptake of the new product introductions. And like North America, the service business also grew at a double-digit rate.","I visited our FRIGOBLOCK team and operations a few weeks ago. The progress made in the adoption of our operating system was absolutely amazing. With the FRIGOBLOCK acquisition, we've taken a step forward now in integrating hybrid electric technology into our product roadmap. The acquisition has been a great success for us.","Middle East markets are certainly softening. We're seeing a contraction in the number of building projects planned and we expect this to continue for some time as lower oil prices are driving an investment pullback. Moving to Asia Pacific, it is difficult to know if markets have reached an inflection point in China. The data is mixed and it's not that consistent month to month. Our performance though has been deviating from the market in a positive way due to investments in products and a focus we put on in increasing our direct channel market investment to achieve fuller market coverage.","Climate bookings in China were up mid-single digits in quarter one and up low-teens for Asia Pacific as a whole. Our strategic focus on growing the service business continues to be successful in Asia, too, achieving a mid-teens growth rate in the quarter. We're also seeing strong mid-teens bookings growth in transport refrigeration equipment as the market continues to grow, and our local engineering and manufacturing teams continue to tune the product to local preferences. Strong growth outside China is being driven by growth in Thailand, India and our performance in Singapore along with good transport refrigeration growth in Australia.","So concluding, the HVAC and transport refrigeration geographic update would take us to Latin America, where markets remain very volatile with strength in smaller but fast-growing markets in the Dominican Republic and Panama but deteriorating conditions in Brazil, Venezuela, Ecuador and Argentina. Conditions though in Mexico remain fundamentally sound. Organic revenue for the region was flat with low-teen increases in HVAC equipment. So we are pleased with our performance in the market. We have expanded margins in a very tough and volatile Latin American marketplace.","Let's move to slide five. And here we'll look at the end markets for the Industrial segment of our business, and I'll start with an overall comment that our compression technologies business bookings and revenue were down organically low-single digits in the quarter, with equipment essentially tracking the overall market but with service up mid-single digits. Again, we are focused in growing our service businesses across the enterprise and executing well on that strategy.","In North America, U.S. manufacturing capacity utilization remains relatively low, hitting 75% last quarter, which is the lowest point over the last 12 quarters. Now large equipment CapEx, typical for what we would see for large centrifugal and large rotary air compressors, historically rebounds at utilization readings above 80%.","On one visit I had the opportunity to meet with a major customer that's been around for decades building small-scale LNG plants that range from 50,000 gallons to 500,000 gallons per day. I asked this PhD physicist what the most reliable leading indicator he would look for in his end markets, and he responded very simply by saying it's when the telephone rings, and fortunately he did say the phone is beginning to ring, as is ours in that area.","So whether it's small-scale LNG systems or larger air compressors, our sense is to that even early activity in large machine quoting activity probably will have little impact on large machine deliveries in 2016.","To give you a little bit more color on this for the North American market, when you look at compressors between five horsepower and 400-plus horsepower, the market for small compressors, those between five horsepower and 15 horsepower, is off roughly 10%, while compressors larger than 250 horsepower are down more than 30% in the first two industry-reported months of the quarter. Smaller compressors quarter. The smaller compressors are quicker book and turn with inventory re-stocking occurring in that category.","We also believe we are seeing some re-stocking to the wholesale channel in our tools and fluid management business. Our material handling team has done a great job managing their business, essentially holding the business to breakeven on a 50% reduction in revenue. So again, across the business we have a management team doing a very good job exhibiting strong cost control, execution discipline on the backdrop of continued declines in projected global market growth.","In Europe we're seeing increased exports to industrial production across Western Europe. Eastern Europe continues to be fairly weak. And for Asia Pacific, the current environment continues to experience pricing pressure across the region, but we're cautiously optimistic to see if we have reached an inflection point as manufacturing indices signal pockets of improvement in countries such as China, Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea. And China's power consumption index has also shown growth in the first two months of the year, and India is seeing strong market growth in verticals like textile, pharma and food and beverage.","So rounding up the geographic update for Industrial segment, we'll go to Latin America where volatility in the markets there across the region continues to be driven by political instability, and this has contributed to reduced investment in verticals such as energy, oil and gas, mining and metals. However, other verticals like food and beverage, pharma and textile remain with positive outlooks.","So before turning it over to Sue, let me conclude by saying again we had an excellent quarter. We continue to invest in the products, service offerings and footprint of the company while using our operating systems to deliver well above industry average results.","Now I'll turn it over to you, Sue, to cover the financial review and guidance.","Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Mike. Let's go to slide 6. Let's begin with an overview of the first quarter. Q1 was a strong operational quarter across all of our businesses. As you heard in Mike's comments, end markets continue to be strong in Climate and weaker than expected in Industrial. Our business operating system guided us through good execution in our factories and in our cost centers. Our focus was on good operating results in a low-growth environment. Our results show that we did not let costs get ahead of revenues in the quarter.","Revenues grew slightly on a reported basis and were up 2% organically. The Climate segment grew 4% organically. Industrial was down 5% both on a reported and an organic basis. HVAC revenues grew in each of our Climate businesses led by commercial and residential in North America. Revenue in our Industrial businesses declined in the quarter, with tough comparisons to the first quarter of 2015.","Large centrifugal compressors and other Industrial equipment were weaker than our estimates but Club Car performed as expected with low year-over-year growth. Our adjusted operating margins grew 140 basis points year-over-year with organic operating leverage of 75%. Adjusted segment margins grew 150 basis points, which shows the alignment between our operating performance and our Q1 results. Our strength was in price, direct material deflation and mix.","Earnings per share grew 32% year-over-year, exceeding our prior guidance. In Q1 our capital deployment actions included repurchasing $250 million of shares, and we increased our dividend by 10%. We completed the sale of our remaining interest in Hussmann on April 1, 2016. All impacts will appear in the second quarter.","Please go to slide 7. I've included a slide to reconcile our Q1 EPS actual results with our prior guidance. I've said on a few occasions this morning that our results were the result of good execution and operational performance. Price and direct material deflation were the largest drivers of the margin expansion in Q1. This is an area where everything went right in the quarter, i.e., there was no breakage. Price was positive in both segments, and direct material deflation was also very positive to our guidance.","Cost savings and controls were a positive $0.03 for the quarter. Each of our businesses and corporate functions had favorable variances to start the year as we controlled spending while we evaluated our end market volatility.","Currency, share count and other income were about $0.01 each. We opportunistically repurchased shares earlier in the year than we would normally, and currency was a bit favorable to our guidance range (18:44).","Restructuring was favorable to our guidance by $0.03 for the quarter. This is timing. We have identified projects to execute and continue to work on restructuring projects that have good returns and shorter paybacks and will spend the remaining $0.03 throughout the remainder of 2016.","Please go to slide right. Orders for the first quarter of 2016 were up 4% organically. Climate orders were up 6% organically. Organic global commercial HVAC bookings were up high-single digits, led by high-teens growth in North America unitary and double-digit growth in Asia applied.","We continue to see excellent growth in service controls, contracting and parts, with double-digit growth in the quarter. Regionally for commercial HVAC, we saw high-single-digit booking increases with a high-single-digit increase in North America and Europe, up low-teens in Asia, and with declines in both the Middle East and Latin America.","Residential bookings were up 17%. Organic transport orders were down low-single digits with low-teens growth in truck and trailer in North America and Europe that were offset by lower container orders. Orders in the Industrial segment were down 5% organically. We saw a low-single-digit order decline in compression equipment, a low-teens decline in other industrial products and a mid-single-digit decline in Club Car.","Performance in compression technologies was mixed in the first quarter. We had an improvement in small compressors while freeing (20:23) in some of our component businesses like dryers and filters. We also had a small improvement in our aftermarket business. These gains were offset by declines in core industrial compressors and by large centrifugal equipment.","Please go to slide 9. This slide provides a directional view of our segment performance by region. In our Climate segment, which was up 4% in the first quarter, we saw solid performance in North America and flattish growth across Europe, Latin America and Asia. The Middle East was the only region that declined within the Climate segment. We're seeing a contraction in the number of building projects planned in the Middle East and would expect this to continue for some time as lower oil prices are driving an investment pullback.","Our Industrial segment performance in the first quarter, which was down 5%, is representative of the volatility that continues across the globe in the industrials market. Strong performance in Mexico contributed double-digit growth in Latin America. We also saw growth in Europe while Asia was flat and North America was down high-single digits.","Overall, our regional performance for the first quarter trends with the end market summary that Mike provided us earlier with a strong start in North America. Industrial segment performance is expected to trend with the market. We're planning on expanding margins in a down market in the second half of the year through productivity gains and cost control.","Please go to slide 10. Operating margin on a reported basis increased 160 basis points from 5.9% to 7.5% from the first quarter 2015 to the first quarter of 2016. Mix was favorable for the quarter, 40 basis points, largely offset by unfavorable volume and currency. Net pricing versus direct material inflation was the largest driver of margin improvement in the quarter, favorable by 160 basis points. Price realization was achieved across both the Climate and Industrial segments, which was higher than expected, and commodities remain deflationary.","Productivity versus other inflation was positive 10 basis points, driven by ongoing productivity actions partially offset by other inflation. Year-over-year investments and other items reduced margins by 20 basis points. In the box, you can see that was comprised of 40 basis points from incremental investments, 20 basis points from higher restructuring costs, which were partially offset by 40 basis point improvement related to the absence of acquisition-related step-up costs incurred in 2015. Overall reported operating leverage exceeded 100% in the quarter as we expanded margins in a low-growth environment.","Please go to slide 11. Our Climate businesses had an excellent quarter in Q1. Adjusted segment income and EBITDA margins improved by 280 basis points and 260 basis points to 9.8% and 12.4% respectively. Increased volumes, favorable mix, price, direct material deflation and productivity offset other inflation and investment spending. The leverage for the Climate segment was 118% for the quarter. Revenues for the quarter were up 4% organically. Commercial HVAC organic revenues were up mid-single digits, led by mid-teens unitary equipment shipments in North America and low-teens parts and service revenue in North America.","Europe had low-single digit equipment growth and high-single digits in services and trucking and (24:00) parts. The Middle East had parts and services growth offset by declines in equipment sales. Residential revenues were up mid-single digits in Q1 with very strong leverage and significant margin improvement.","First quarter organic revenues were down slightly, but this does not tell the whole story for Q1. North America truck and trailer organic revenues were up mid-single digits, and European truck and trailer organic revenues were up in the mid-20% range. Marine container organic revenues declined more than 60% in the first quarter, reflecting a soft start at various box builders for 2016.","Please go to slide 12. First quarter revenues for the Industrial segment were $681 million, down 5% on an organic basis. Compression technologies and services organic revenues were down low-single digits versus last year. Club Car organic revenues were up slightly versus prior year. Organic revenues in the Americas were down high-single digits, while revenues in Europe, Middle East and Africa were down low-single digits and were flat in Asia.","Industrial's adjusted operating margin of 9.6% was down 230 basis points compared with last year. Price and direct material deflation were positive, productivity offset other inflation, and volume and mix were unfavorable.","Please go to slide 13. First quarter free cash flow of negative $46.3 million was favorable to prior year by $135 million. Strong operating income improvement and improved working capital performance were the primary drivers of the favorability.","For the quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 6.2%. We had strong collections in the quarter, with our days sales outstanding improving 1.3 days over the prior year and days payable outstanding improving 0.7 days. Inventory is on plan for the quarter and we're well-positioned to serve our customers as we enter the heavier-volume second quarter. Capital expenditures of $40 million are lower than prior year due to capitalization of our ERP systems costs in the first quarter of 2015.","Please go to slide 14. Capital allocation is a key area of strategy for us. We continue to invest in our businesses and I think you'll agree that our results show the value of our product refresh strategy and our operational excellence programs, which are a part of our business operating system.","We raised the annual dividend 10% in early 2016 with a goal of maintaining a dividend payout consistent with our peers. We have an M&A pipeline that reflects our desire to add to our products, technologies and channels as outlined in our strategy. We are focused on building long-term value. We bought shares to offset benefit program dilution in the first quarter at an average share price of $51.10.","Please go to slide 15. As always, our intention is to give you the best view of what we're seeing in our end markets sitting here today and how that translates to our revenue guidance for 2016. We've broken it down by major end markets and geographies. As you can see by the variation of colors and symbols, our end markets are seeing a wide variation in trends. We also added a column to show you our current versus prior thinking on organic revenue.","North American commercial HVAC and residential HVAC as well as European transport and commercial HVAC markets are generally positive, while global industrial markets have declined. We are forecasting transport markets in North America to be flat. Our forecast for North American trailer volume has shifted from declines of 15% to down slightly for the year. Asian HVAC markets are expected to be flat to down, and industrial markets in Asia remain under pressure. Golf cart markets are slightly down, offset by increases in the utility vehicle markets.","Both the growth forecasts shown here are on an organic basis. We're forecasting mid-single-digit growth in commercial HVAC in total; high-single-digit growth in residential HVAC, which is essentially an all-American \u2013 North American business for us; and a small increase in transport. We expect compression-related products and other equipment to be down high-single digits. We expect Club Car to be up low-single digits.","Please go to slide 16. Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect our reported revenues for the full-year 2016 to be flat to up 2% versus 2015. Overall, foreign exchange will be a headwind of about two percentage points. While these revenue outlets do not show a total change, the segment numbers reflect important updates. We expect Climate revenues to be up 2% to 4% on a reported basis and 4% to 6% organically. For the Industrial segment, revenues are forecasted to be in the range of down 4% to down 6% on a reported basis and down 2% to down 4% organically.","For operating margins, we're excluding restructuring costs to get adjusted margin. We expect Climate adjusted operating margins to be in the range of 14% to 14.5%. We expect Industrial adjusted margins to be in the range of 12% to 12.5%. For the enterprise, we expect adjusted operating margins of 11.8% to 12.3%, a 30 basis point improvement from our prior 2016 guidance and a year-over-year improvement of 70 basis points. Operating leverage would be about 40% on an organic basis for the year.","Please go to slide 17. Transitioning to earnings, the reported earnings per share range is estimated to be $5.39 to $5.54. Excluding restructuring and the Hussmann gain, the range is $3.95 to $4.10, an increase of 6% to 10% versus 2015 and a $0.13 increase from the midpoint of our prior guidance range of $3.80 to $4. As a note, for 2016 currency is a headwind of about 2% of revenue. This reflects a full-year tax rate forecast of 24% to 25% and an average diluted share count of 261 million shares for the full year.","Second quarter 2016 revenues are forecast to be up 2% to 4% on a reported basis and 4% to 6% organically. We are projecting Climate revenues to grow mid-single digits in Q2 and Industrial to decline mid-single digits on a reported basis.","Reported second quarter earnings per share are forecast to be $2.75 to $2.80. Back out $0.01 of restructuring and the $1.49 Hussmann gain to get to an adjusted range of $1.27 to $1.32.","For the full-year 2016, we expect to generate adjusted free cash flow, which excludes restructuring and the Hussmann proceeds, of $950 million to $1 billion.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Mike for a few closing comments.","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Thank you, Sue. And I'll be brief. As I started out this morning, we had a strong quarter. We improved operating performance in a volatile environment. We realized price in both segments. We achieved outstanding leverage and improved our cash flow. We're growing in the areas we put a strategic focus. There's clear evidence that this won't be crated. (31:39). Our operating system is gaining momentum. And I'm confident in our management team, and we feel good about our forecast for the remainder of the year.","So with that, Sue and I will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hi, good morning, guys.","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Josh.","Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Morning.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Just on the price-cost equation here, clearly a pretty strong contribution in the first quarter. Can you help us with how that dimensions out, just based on purchasing agreements and hedges you already have in place, over the balance of the year?","Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Absolutely. So you're right. The 160 basis point spread between price and direct material deflation was a strong start to the year. What we expect for the first half of the year is strong performance on a year-over-year basis because last year we were still in an inflationary environment in the first half of 2015. So I think the second quarter will be slightly less favorable than the 160 basis points.","But what we've adjusted the full year to now, Josh, is 80 basis points of favorable spread between price and direct material deflation. And so the first half-second half reflects basically the year-over-year compares to last year. And then as we look at the 80 basis points, though Q1 performance was driven by strong price performance, and we expect some of that to continue in Q2 and also strong performance from the material side. Price is one of those areas where I think you never want to reach out and assume that you can continue to get price at a big execution level throughout the year in a strong deflationary environment.","But as it comes to the commodities themselves, here's what we expect. So we have about 70% of our copper locked in for the year through our contracts. We expect that copper and aluminum are going to be fairly stable in terms of what happens throughout the rest of 2016. You'll see some ups and downs. But generally I think those are going to be pretty stable.","We're seeing a slight uptick in steel, but I don't think that's going to impact us in 2016. Because of the way that our contracts are written we wouldn't start to see that until the very end of the year. So I think our supply base and our commodity teams have done a great job of getting us the deflation that you're seeing in the results. I expect that to continue. All of the tier 2 pricing really seemed to come in in Q1 also. So I think we had a great environment and I think we'll have a great result.","So if you recall, we had given you a look at the full year I think 30 basis points to 40 basis points when we last gave guidance. And as I said, we took that up to 80 basis points favorable spread for 2016.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Great. That's helpful. And then, Sue, just as a follow-up, I remember last quarter you talked about some of the toggles for the tax rate and specifically mentioned intercompany debt. Could you just maybe update us where we're at on the total tax strategy in light of some of the Treasury rulings?","Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Right. So I think the first way to start out that question, Josh, is to say that we've looked at all of the proposed Treasury regulations, and we don't expect those regulations to have an impact on our effective tax rate in 2016.","As we think about the tax strategy that I talked about, getting us into a low-20s% type of tax rate on an ongoing basis, I also don't expect those regulations to have an impact on us getting into those areas. And the reason that I say that is when we're looking at our tax strategy, intercompany debt is one element of some of the things that you can do \u2013 trading hubs, procurement hubs, making sure that your transfer pricing is absolutely aligned, and other tax-efficient projects can help us get to where we want to go.","We've also been looking at a project that helps us look at effective tax rates by each of our SBUs so that we're all working on taxes, we do our plans, and we do our forward looks. And I think that'll help us with an overall tax strategy that doesn't get impacted by the proposed Treasury regulations. We'll obviously continue to look at those and make sure that we understand all of the sort of derivative impact that might be out there from the regulations, but no impact on the rate and no impact on our strategy going forward.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Perfect. Thanks for the answer.","Operator","And our next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Nice quarter.","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Joe.","Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Joe.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I guess my first question, maybe starting on Industrial where you did see decelerating trends. I noticed that you didn't take up the restructuring at all for the quarter, and if I recall correctly there were some cam shipments that were expected to be released in the beginning part of this year. And so I'm just wondering is there still opportunity for further action in Industrial and I guess what's the strategy at this point?","Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. So the $0.02 of restructuring that we spent in Q1 was related to Industrial. We are continuing to work on restructuring actions for the remainder of the year, and those are going to primarily be in Industrial. So we called out in the guidance about a $0.01 for each of the next three quarters. I think what's important about the restructuring and the way that we look at it is that the restructuring really does have a payback within 2016. So we fully expect to realize the benefits of that $0.05 of restructuring, and that is also what will help us with my comment earlier in my prepared remarks about Industrial margins improving in the back half of the year. So some of that productivity kicks in and some of the restructuring actions that were actually started almost a year ago are going to kick in.","Now on the ECC side, we did have some shipments that had pushed out of Q4. We actually had some shipments that pushed out of Q1 also into Q2. But the ECC story is an interesting one. So if I look at first quarter bookings in total, bookings in total for the ECC business are actually up significantly in the first quarter. The majority of that is going to be in the products that are outside of the large centrifugal compressors. Those are really coming down, so bookings are up, which is good.","The revenues that we're seeing are really being impacted by the large centrifugals. But also importantly as we think about ECC and that business is we expect to really be on track with the revenue and the cost synergies for 2016 that we had outlined.","So lots of moving pieces in the business, but I think you see some strengths in the normal product and in the aftermarket and some bigger weakness and some shipments moving around in the large centrifugal compressors.","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Joe, remember, too, that I think that we've been serial restructurers now for years, and that's both qualified and non-qualified. So we're always improving the cost base there. When you look at the type of paybacks that we are seeing in this business, we're getting numbers like seven years, which is indicative of doing a good job around running plants, utilization that we've been able to achieve in our plants.","If you couple that with the lead time to bring on new capacity when the markets return, that's a 24-month to 30-month process, particularly in the machining centers that we would be moving or upgrading to do that. So we don't want to get whipsawed in doing any larger restructuring when this thing turns around because the margins come back very strong when the business volumes come back as well. So we're being cautious.","So we're always looking at the ideas that are on the table. If the underlying real estate values change or if tax incentives change from one location to another, it could swing something like that. So we're very cautious about looking at an upswing in the lead time to bring capacity on when you need it. And we don't want to ever be in a situation at an upswing in the market to not have sufficient capacity at that point in time.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That makes sense, Mike. I guess maybe my follow-on question, I just want to make sure I heard this correctly. Did you say that 2Q North America commercial HVAC bookings were expected to be up about 25%?","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, that's correct.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And is that the reason for the organic revenue guidance raise?","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's more of an impact in 2017 and it's got a little bit of a positive in 2016, a little bit of a positive in 2018. But the bulk of that would be 2017 shipments. So it's really the strength of the business across the board. Unitary continues to be strong. The pipeline looks strong for us. Europe has been a great success story. I think it will continue as well. And of course the residential business continues to put up some very big numbers.","And so all of that combined has got more to do with the guidance increase than the large booking number in quarter two. By the way, quarter three should look pretty good for us as well. Although I don't have a prognostication on the percentage rate, it should be a good quarter for us.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thank you. I just want to say thanks a lot to Janet for all the help, and all the best. In terms of the first question, that would really be back on the Industrial margins. They used to be at sort of 16%, 17% of the odd quarter here and there, and they are down to 9% to 10% right now. And the guidance embeds that by the end of the year I guess they climb back into the sort of low-teens in the next three quarters. So maybe just help clarify what's driving that sort of 400 point-plus margin recovery. Is it just about productivity or is there something going on with the mix as well of Industrial versus compression?","Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So Julian, great question. On the Industrial margins, your math is absolutely correct that in the back half of the year we do have the operating margins for Industrial improving into the low-teens. And as we look at what's going to happen in the back half of the year, it truly is productivity, still lower inflationary type of rates. So you've got productivity offsetting other inflation. You still have positive price in the back half of the year. And you have just a skosh more volume in the back half of the year than the front.","I don't want anyone to think there is a lot of volume recovery that we've built into this; we have not. But there is by virtue of how the quarters pan out roughly $50 million of additional revenue in the back half versus the front half. But it's productivity. It is the restructuring actions that are kicking in, and it is the continuation of the actions that the management teams are taking to work through this low revenue and market decline.","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","There was also, Julian, the cost control there is exceptional. So even though you were seeing kind of a headline $0.02 restructuring, there's at least that much, maybe more than that which would be non-qualified restructuring. So it's sort of restructuring in place, not replacing or fulfilling spending. So there is a cost for that in the first half of the year and a benefit to that in the back half of the year, which is broadly in line with Sue's productivity comment, but a big piece of that productivity is literally the cost control around head count, some of which is qualified, some of which is non-qualified in terms of how we would actually account for it.","The longer-term question that you asked about the profitability of the business, Sue did a little bit of analysis on this, and it might be useful to kind of walk through when we would see a 17% margin business.","Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","All right. That's great. So when I look at it \u2013 so the first thing that we did is we went back and said at the time that we gave the original 17% margin guidance for the Industrial business, the revenues in the business were in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.7 billion. If I look at where we're at today, we're roughly in the $3 billion type of territory.","So I think as we look at the business, we're doing all of the right actions today to get the costs in line, but I think what we need is market recoveries and I think the revenues to return to sort of that upper $3 billion range for us to get into the 17% margin. We think that's doable, but I think the timeframe is really highly dependent on when the markets come back.","Right now, we haven't seen the markets actually stop falling. So we need to stabilize first and then the markets to return, but again I think the way I'm thinking about it is once the revenues get back up into the $3.6 billion, $3.7 billion area where they were when we gave that guidance, that we'll be nearing those 17% type of margins for Industrial.","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Remember, when you look at the gross margins of that business and look at the fixed cost of that business say relative to the Climate segment, you can see very easily why that business snaps back very strongly on volume. So when volume returns to that business, we'll get very aggressive incremental margins out of that. In the short term, we're controlling the heck out of costs the best we can. However, we're not going to spite our nose to save our face as it relates to capacity.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. And then just my follow-up quickly would be, on your overall firm-wide margin bridge, Q1 you had about 10 points or 10 bps from productivity and other inflation. I guess based on what you just said, should we think the number for the year ends up somewhere between that 10 bps and the sort of the 90 bps tailwind that you had last year for the year as a whole?","Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I do think that you will \u2013 we do see other inflation to be higher in the first half versus the second half is when our salary increases takes place. That's when a lot of the benefits take place. So when I look at what we plan for the full year, I would say it probably looks more like 40 basis points to 50 basis points for the full year, Julian.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning.","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Nigel.","Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. I really hope Janet isn't calling a peak here. I don't think she is. But thanks for all the help.","Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","She is fine.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So this North American auto expenses is really interesting, Mike, and I'm assuming that's really driven by these large-type projects, finally some big spend (49:04). I'm just wondering what's changed here. I mean is it just a case of old equipment we're seeing here, so the extended replacement cycle can move through? Is it budgetary? I mean any color there would be helpful.","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Nigel, I think all that's true, but the constant persistent investment we've made over five years, six years, seven years in that business, the constant investment in the channel and the service footprint is really paying off. And I just think the focus we've had on all of that development being around energy efficiency, sustainability, new refrigerant development, all of that is such a powerful story when you look at it.","This is what we were waiting for. This is what we hoped to have seen, which is outsized growth relative to the market and outsized profitability or margin expansion relative to the market. So this is a huge effort by lots of people all the way through to the technicians providing service on the street for us. This is a real accomplishment.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And obviously very early to call 2017 at this point, but if you just look at your North American commercial HVAC operations based on the backlog of pipeline, is it reasonable to assume that perhaps you might see some acceleration next year?","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the thing you have to think about though is what happens to the office and retail business. As an example, our national accounts business has been doing extremely well into retail. Office building is doing really well, as you can see, kind of the high-teens bookings rate again. Unitary, that's been strong again.","Some point you'd think that that would begin to subside and be replaced by stronger applied growth, which I think will happen. So I think what you end up with is maybe a change in the mix between unitary and applied, but I do think continued strong performance through 2017.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, Mike. That's helpful.","Operator","And our next question from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Steve.","Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","On the Climate side, I mean just a very big margin number, obviously, and I'm trying to just wrap my head around the seasonality dynamics, 1Q to 2Q. In the last couple years you've had increases, like in 2014 you guys saw a doubling or almost a tripling of the profit number in Climate. Can you just maybe speak to maybe what you expect seasonally there or maybe just at a high level what you expect for the margin in that business as we move through the year? And my guess is the seasonality is a bit muted because you're now seeing the onset of commercial, which is a less seasonal business than some of these other things, or just maybe help us square that, just with the first quarter basis so high that just having trouble kind of getting low enough in Climate.","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Steve, so I think that looking at something certainly in the 16% margin range for the entire segment is going to make a lot of sense for us. Again, to Sue's point, price I think subsides a little bit, material inflation kind of clips along pretty much at the same rate, bookings look good, pipeline looks fairly strong. We're not seeing \u2013 the container business on the transport side being down of course is not all that problematic for us in terms of margins as long as European trailer and North American trailer are doing well. So you put that all together and you're probably dealing with something in the 16% range.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Can you at some point soon kind of get to that 17%? Will you kind of hit that at some point this year?","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't know. I mean, really looking at Q3 and Q4 at that level of granularity around guidance, Steve, I don't know. I mean Q2 is seasonally a pretty good quarter for us. Quarter three can be. So we've got an outside shot at something like that.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then just on the kind of go-forward leverage, so you had this nice pop off the bottom on margins. Should we continue to expect that if this kind of current mix holds, that if commercial HVAC does really continue to roll on here and we have a bit more of an extended cycle than I think most people were expecting probably three months to four months ago, can you still leverage that business really well, or do you have to add cost or anything like that? I mean I feel like you got to have plenty of capacity here to let it rip a little bit before you start to throw money at the business from a capacity perspective, right?","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the service business and the controls business are growing so well, too, and our margins are obviously much higher. So it's a little bit distorting about how we might think about fixed costs being factory costs. So I do think that there is some capacity we have even in our field service and controls capability that wouldn't require incremental investment. Obviously it's feet on the street, but we stay in front of that, and we typically hire long in the service business. So I don't see why having leverage for the full year \u2013 it starts with a 4 \u2013 would be a problem in the Climate business.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then one last quick one. You guys took up the price cost year-over-year by I think 40 bps you said, but you only took your margins up by 30 bps. Anything \u2013 that's just volume and mix at Industrial, is that kind of that moving part?","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, inflation kicks in just in terms of wage increases beginning in April for the full year, and we kind of see sort of the cost increase there as well. Puts a little bit of a squeeze...","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","...on margins there. But fundamentally, Steve, there's not anything really changing other than the fact that it's hard to believe that price would stay high as it normally is, and material inflation should stay about where it is, but we're looking at just closing that gap a little bit probably from the price side.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Okay. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Jeff.","Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hey. Mike, can you just elaborate a little bit more on kind of the bookings strength? And was that a \u2013 that 25% number, is that global or are you speaking to the U.S.?","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It would be the North American commercial business.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","North American commercial. It does sound like Europe, though, is fairly strong for you on share gain. How do you see that playing out over the balance of the year?","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I went \u2013 probably I saw five, six of our factories and operations in Europe a month ago. I met with the engineering teams. I saw product launching between August and December, Jeff. It's one of the best stories I've seen, absolutely the fastest cycle time between ideation and product launch. They're hitting it right on the money in terms of what the customers are looking for. It's been a great story for us on the ECC side in Europe.","But I'll also tell you, switching over to FRIGOBLOCK, FRIGOBLOCK was a family-run German company. If you put sort of a paradigm around that, you might think slow to change or difficult to incorporate in the operating system. What I found there was one of the fastest implementations of an operating system that we've put in place across the company. It's very exciting. And the openness around that \u2013 and then the openness of our transport refrigeration team to include that hybrid electric technology into the truck platform is also very positive. So I left Europe feeling very bullish.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And then could you address what's going on in 14 SEER? Probably still early in the season to know for sure, but does that price gap versus legacy 13 SEER holding in that 10% to 15% range?","Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, Jeff, it is holding. And I think the great news about the 14 SEER is what we saw was the balance of 14 SEER and greater product is still about 80% of the revenues in 2016. So we're seeing price, we're seeing the favorable mix that we expected out of the product. And we're also seeing that the balance between 14 SEER and even the 15 SEER and above has not really changed, which does create a good environment as you alluded to with the price and cost differential.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","So is that 40 basis points of positive mix, Sue, that you elaborated all in residential? Did you actually have more than that in residential than you saw somewhere else?","Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So it was not all residential. It was a combination of residential and also Thermo King. On the Thermo King side, and one of the things that we saw was we saw more strength than we expected in truck and trailer both in North America and in Europe. And then the big declines on Thermo King came from the marine container business that I said was down about 60%. So the 40 basis points of mix was primarily from res and from Thermo King. And my recollection is it was split pretty evenly.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond from KeyBank Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Jeff.","Susan K. Carter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey. So what's driving the 1Q order growth in residential, and what gives you the confidence to kind of move that forecast up ahead of the selling season?","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean first and foremost the product line really at this point has been fully developed, and we've hit stride, all the good success with the furnace product, all the good success with the new launches, the variable speed, growth in Nexia. All these things have just been really kind of coming together.","Operationally, we just find the pipeline for projects and productivity and quality to be improving. Deliveries have been exceptional in terms of on-time delivery and having product available where you need it, when you need it, really investing in the warehousing and investing in the product availability. So just a sense here that things have gone right for a long time here and that we'll do better, particularly as the mix moves up north of 14 SEER, which it is. So as the mix moves north of 14 SEER, we do better anyway. And as the mix moves more toward replacement and away from new construction, we'll do better.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then how's the M&A pipeline kind of informing how you're thinking about buyback through the balance of the year?","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","There is no doubt we want to grow the company and grow value over the long run. So we said we're looking at ideas and businesses that we know and run and are successful with. FRIGOBLOCK and Cameron were great examples; different examples but great examples of being able to take businesses, put them into an operating system, improve the businesses and deliver essentially what we said we were going to deliver from an accretion perspective. So we feel good about our capability in doing that.","We also feel patient. We feel like we don't have to \u2013 we're not compelled to do anything around M&A. We've got great positions in the marketplace, and there's not a compelling need for us to go do something and potentially do something where we pay too much in that process.","So, Jeff, we'll continue to evaluate that. When we see opportunities that fit the criteria we'll pull the trigger. And we clearly want to grow long-term value to the shareholder, and that's probably the best way to do it.","With that being said, you couldn't pass up in January. The stock price dislocated 20% from the peer group. I mean we jumped in on that and acquired $250 million in January at $51 a share. So we're going to be dynamic, we're going to be opportunistic, and we're going to grow shareholder value. If that means we find the right bolt-ons to do that, we're going to jump on those, too.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks, and good morning. And also appreciate the additional detail in the disclosure today. It's helpful. Let's see. So first of all, Mike, how are you reconciling all of this discussion about commercial HVAC strong growth relative to what is pretty lackluster Dodge data, ABI, all these macro data points? Are you attributing it all to share, renovation, control, service? Just maybe a little clarity on that would be helpful.","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's sort of all of the above, Steve, which is probably hard to give clarity on that. But if you take Latin America, we're up mid-teens in Latin America. That's clearly our people out in the street creating demand, making it happen. Mid-teens bookings growth in Asia. I mean Asia is not that strong. Again, our team is hitting the street.","Europe, we talked about product development, and the pace of product development there is best-in-class in the company and product management, best we have in the company around getting exactly right on these product growth teams and understanding where we're competing, how we're going to win against very specific competitors in the market.","These products launched, and they do exactly what they were supposed to do. That's a positive for us. So there's a lot of self-help here happening and the backdrop on the markets, with the exception of the Middle East, isn't bad. So you've got decent markets and really strong execution.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And how are you doing on \u2013 what's the growth rate on VRF in the quarter, progress, any developments there?","Michael W. Lamach - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Last year we were about 30% growth. This year we're about the same, Steve. We continue to do well on the market. We continue to sell VRF. We're beginning to also see interest in what's referred to as four-pipe chiller. So this is simultaneous heat and cooling around water circulating through buildings versus refrigerant. It's big in Europe, picking up a little bit of interest in the U.S.","The idea here is we're going to have whatever products are demanded in the marketplace, and then we're going to work with our customers to figure out what the best solution is for the building. And that's why our business was up 30% last year. It's why our business is up about the same this year as well.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Great.

My name is Virgil and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Ingersoll Rand Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question and answer session. Thank you. Zac Nagle, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Zachary A. Nagle - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thanks, Operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Ingersoll Rand's second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. This call is being webcast on our website at ingersollrand.com where you'll find the accompanying presentation. We are also recording and archiving this call on our website.","Please go to slide two. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release.","The participants on today's call are Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO and Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO. With that, please go to slide three and I'll turn it over to Mike. Mike?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thanks, Zac, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. Please go to slide three. Like to begin with a brief review of the fundamental elements of our business strategy that drive long term value creation for shareholders. This is often a helpful starting point for those of you listening who may be less familiar with the company.","First our global business strategy is at the nexus of environmental sustainability and impact. The world is continuing to urbanize while becoming warmer and more resource constrained as time passes. We excel at delivering energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing food and other waste of perishable goods and generating productivity for our customers, all enabled by digital and other exponential technologies.","Our business portfolio positioning creates a platform for the company to consistently grow above average global economic conditions aided by the strong secular tailwinds that I've outlines. Second, our business operating system is designed to excel at delivering strong top line growth, incremental margins and free cash flow. Our business operating system underpins everything we do and enables us to consistently generate powerful free cash flow which, when combined with our dynamic capital allocation strategy, drives strong returns for shareholders over the long term.","And finally, over the years, we've built an experience management team and a high-performance, winning culture which gives me confidence in our ability to deliver strong results that are sustainable for the long run. Having a strong, winning culture takes years to build and cultivate and I believe this is one of the things that the market may underappreciate about Ingersoll Rand.","As we consistently execute our strategy, we continue to build a stronger company that delivers reliable and consistent financial performance for shareholders over the long term.","Moving to slide four, midway through the year, we continue to execute well against our long term strategy and 2018 is shaping up to be a very good year for us. Our end markets are healthy and we are executing well as evidenced by the strong growth we're delivering in bookings and revenues in both our Climate and Industrial segments across virtually all products, services and geographies globally.","Our Industrial segment continues to perform well with broad based bookings and revenue growth and significant margin expansion. We're effectively managing inflation and tariff headwinds. We delivered a 10-basis-point positive price versus material inflation spread in the second quarter which reflects strong pricing discipline and efficiency. Our China growth strategy is performing well against our expectations with continued strong revenue and bookings growth and improving margins.","As we look forward, we expect our end markets to remain healthy with consistent execution of our business operating system which gives us confidence in raising our full year guidance for revenues, EPS and free cash flow. Please go to slide number five.","In the second quarter, we delivered strong growth in organic bookings and revenue across the board as indicated by the positive signs on the chart. Enterprise organic bookings and revenues were up 15% and 9% respectively. Climate led the way with organic bookings and revenues of 17% and 9% respectively. And Industrial was also very strong with organic bookings and revenues up 8% and 9% respectively. These results represent continued healthy end markets and consistent execution of our strategy.","A couple points to highlight. First, we did not see a significant impact from revenue pull-ins ahead of price increases or tariffs in the quarter, and Sue will discuss it in more detail later. And second, we didn't have any large performance contracting orders to call out in the quarter that would've skewed our results. The one minus on the chart was in small electric vehicle bookings, where results were only modestly lower. Golf was down with utility and consumer vehicles showing bookings growth as expected.","Please go to slide number six. This slide provides insight and color into the key drivers behind the chart on slide five and how we're thinking about the outlook for the year. In commercial HVAC, we're seeing sustained growth globally in both bookings and revenue, with good growth in both equipment and services and particular strength in Asia. North America growth remained solid, with gains in equipment, services, contracting and controls. Institutional growth was particularly strong, led by education, and industrial HVAC strength was also notable in the quarter.","Europe, the Middle East and Africa commercial HVAC remained strong with solid growth across the board in equipment and aftermarket, and we saw additional growth in services from our rental service business. China continued to have a very strong growth in the quarter led by the execution of our China direct sales growth strategy. Our outlook for total commercial HVAC remains healthy for 2018 and key economic and market indicators largely support our view.","Turning to residential HVAC, bookings and revenue growth were also very strong, particularly against tough growth comps versus 2017. The replacement markets where the majority of our sales are derived showed very good growth in the second quarter and this is expected to continue through 2018.","Our Transport Solutions business continues to be a diversified resilient business and the improving market conditions for North America refrigerated trailer have been a positive. North American trailer order growth was strong in the quarter and revenues were up as well.","The Americas Commercial Transportation Research Company, also known as ACT, has taken up their forecast for North American refrigerated trailers to approximately 5% growth over 2017. However, the industry capacity by trailer OEMs is constrained, so it's not clear how much the industry will actually grow at this stage.","Auxiliary power unit growth remained strong with good growth in both refrigerated and non-refrigerated segments. We're also seeing continued solid growth in Europe, the Middle East and Africa truck which is a meaningful business for us. Overall, the transport market should be stronger than we originally expected in 2018, primarily led by improvement in the North American trailer market.","Compression Technologies is seeing the continuation of an industrial recovery, consistent with industrial production and other key leading indicators. In the quarter, we delivered good growth in bookings and revenues in both equipment and aftermarket. All major geographies were solid with particular strength in Asia. For 2018, we expect to see solid growth broadly across key products, services and markets.","Small electric vehicle revenue growth was strong, driven largely by successful market penetration of our consumer vehicle and we expect that to continue through 2018. We also delivered strong growth across our Industrial Products business, which are comprised of tools, fluid management and material handling. We expect to see continued good growth in our Industrial Products businesses in the second half of the year.","And now, I'd like to turn it over to Sue to provide more details on the quarter and to discuss our 2018 guidance increase. Sue?","Susan Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thank you, Mike. Please go to slide number seven. As Mike highlighted, strong momentum from the first quarter continued through Q2. Revenue growth in both our Climate and Industrial segments is outpacing our initial guidance expectations. Margins and leverage are improving and the pull-through to EPS growth has been strong. As we look forward to the second half the year, we continue to see good opportunities for growth broadly across our end markets. We expect sustained, strong execution of our business operating system to enable us to deliver financial results that meaningfully exceed our initial full year guidance for revenues, earnings per share and free cash flow.","Looking at our second quarter results in more detail, bookings and revenue performance were both strong with robust growth in virtually every major product category and geography and in both services and equipment. We delivered record enterprise bookings and revenues with organic bookings up 15% and organic revenues up 9%.","Climate led the way with organic bookings and revenues up 17% and 9% respectively. Industrial organic bookings and revenues were also strong, up 8% and 9% respectively. Aftermarket growth outpaced equipment growth, up 12% and 11% respectively as we continue to focus on building out a greater mix of high margin, sustainable revenue and margin streams over time.","There's been a fair amount of discussion on the Street recently regarding the impact of customers' pre-buying inventory ahead of announced price increases or the anticipated implementation of tariffs, so we wanted to spend a moment addressing this question with respect to Ingersoll Rand.","While it is difficult to determine a precise number due to a number of factors, we are confident this was not a substantial factor for us in the second quarter given our channel structure and the visibility that we do have. We would estimate an impact of between $80 million and $100 million on orders spread primarily between commercial HVAC, residential HVAC and transport refrigeration. As best we can call it, this would translate into two to three percentage points of the 15% bookings growth in Q2. The impact of revenues was likely a fraction of this in the quarter and de minimis to the full year.","Through the second quarter, we have continued to execute a balanced capital allocation strategy. Our first priority is always reinvesting in high ROI projects in our business. As we outlined in our original guidance for the year, we also have a number of high ROI capital expenditure related projects in 2018. These projects are aimed at simplifying our business through footprint optimization and at innovation through new product development related projects. We've invested in a number of these higher ROI projects through the first half.","We've also maintained our commitment to a strong and growing dividend. We announced a quarterly dividend increase of 18% in the second quarter and have distributed $222 million to shareholders in the form of dividends in the first half of 2018.","Share repurchases have also remained a good investment for us as our shares have continued to trade below our calculated intrinsic value. Through June, we have repurchased $500 million at an average price of $88.53.","On the acquisition front, we closed on the Trane Mitsubishi Electric JV which is now up and running and our acquisition pipeline remains active. Through the second quarter, our total cash spend on M&A is approximately $280 million including the ICS Cool Energy acquisition and the Trane Mitsubishi JV which were previously announced. While it is still early days on the Trane Mitsubishi JV, we're already seeing good returns on the ICS Cool Energy acquisition.","Please go to slide number eight. As we've highlighted, Q2 was a strong financial quarter top to bottom. We delivered 9% organic revenue growth, 50 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, and EPS growth of 24%. Our operating leverage also significantly improved to approximately 20%.","Please go to slide number nine. Focused execution of our strategy and operational excellence drove strong core business operating income contribution from both of our business segments, which combined for approximately $0.25 or the majority of the $0.36 of EPS growth in the year-over-year quarter.","Lower share count from significant capital deployment toward share repurchases in 2017 and 2018 drove another $0.07 improvement. We also had modest positive contributions from lower interest expense associated with the company's debt refinancing earlier this year. Additionally, we benefited from a slightly lower effective tax rate year-over-year on higher pre-tax earnings.","Please go to slide number 10. Strong execution drove 50 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement in the quarter. Pricing discipline delivered greater pricing efficiency than we anticipated when we gave guidance at the end of the first quarter. Price versus material inflation improved 50 basis points sequentially in the second quarter to a positive 10 basis point spread. Higher revenue drove 80 basis points of margin expansion and investment spend was consistent with our targeted levels of approximately 40 to 50 basis points of incremental investment per year.","Productivity versus other inflation was flat in the quarter but improved sequentially. We expect productivity to continue to improve in the back half of the year and particularly in the fourth quarter as programs and initiatives continue to ramp. We expect total productivity in 2018 to exceed 2017 levels.","Please go to slide number 11. Our Climate segment demonstrated strong improvement in the quarter with flat adjusted operating margins, which was a 50 basis point sequential improvement from the first quarter driven primarily by volume, pricing, and productivity. We are successfully mitigating persistent tier 1 and tier 2 inflation, freight costs, and the known impacts of the tariffs that have been implemented to date. As you know, the majority of inflation impacts are to the Climate segment. Our China direct sales strategy continues to perform well against our expectations with continued strong growth and improving margins as we move through the year.","Please go to slide number 12. Our Industrial business delivered another strong quarter with organic revenue growth of 9% and adjusted operating margin improvement of 170 basis points. The restructuring and productivity actions in prior years are providing operating margin growth in 2018 and we continue to take further actions in 2018 that will benefit future years.","Please go to slide 13. We remain committed to a dynamic capital allocation strategy that consistently deploys excess cash to the opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. We maintain a healthy level of business investments in high ROI projects, which is helping to drive our strong growth in both our Climate and Industrial segments this year. We have also increased our capital expenditure investments that will have strong returns through new product development and footprint optimization.","We maintain a long standing commitment to paying a strong and growing dividend and have increased the dividend at a 20% compound annual growth rate over the past five years. In the second quarter, we announced a quarterly dividend increase of 18%, which reflects our ongoing confidence in our ability to drive sustained high levels of cash flow in the future.","We will continue to make strategic investments in value accretive M&A that drives long term shareholder returns. We maintain a strong balance sheet that continues to improve through high quality operating income growth. This provides us with significant optionality as our markets continue to evolve. We also continue to invest in share buybacks when the shares trade below our calculated intrinsic value. Over the past year and a half, we've spent $1.5 billion on share repurchases and have reduced our outstanding share count by approximately 5%.","Please go to slide number 15. As we touched on earlier, our strong first half financial performance gives us confidence in raising our 2018 guidance for organic revenues, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow. Adjusted earnings per share guidance moves up significantly to approximately $5.50. Organic revenue guidance is more than doubled to a range of between 7% to 8%, reflecting very strong revenues and bookings in the first half and expectations for continued healthy end market growth and continued share gains in the second half. This strength is also broad based.","By segment we expect Climate and Industrial organic revenues to each be up 7% to 8%, essentially doubling our prior guidance for revenue growth for each business segment. Please go to slide 16. This table lays out our updated guidance versus our prior guidance in more detail. We've talked to most of the data points on this slide, so we've included the table in the presentation for your reference and it includes some of the modeling related questions you'll want to have. Bottom line is that we expect 2018 to be a strong year for Ingersoll Rand.","Please go to slide number 18. Moving on to our topics of interest section, we have one primary topic to cover: tariffs and inflation mitigation. The main takeaway is that we have incorporated all known direct and indirect impacts into our guidance from the Section 232 tariffs and the Section 301 tariffs related to the first $50 billion that went into effect in July.","We're evaluating the potential impacts from the additional $200 billion in proposed Section 301 tariffs which are indeterminate at this stage. To be clear, we have seen a significant uptick in inflation from the direct and indirect impacts of the known portions of the Section 232 and 301 tariffs. At the same time, however, with the pricing effectiveness we're seeing and expect to see going forward, we believe we can maintain a flat price versus material inflation equation in the back half as we previously guided.","We expect the better pricing we are seeing to offset additional inflation in tariffs in the back half of the year. Beyond the known tariffs, we continue to closely monitor the tariff proposals and discussions taking place globally in order to react quickly if and when additional tariff pressure comes into play. First, our global integrated supply chain team is continuously monitoring tariffs from the time they are proposed.","Second, we are rigorously addressing the cost increases across the portfolio working through our supply chain team. And third, we are utilizing our business operating system to actively manage our pricing and productivity actions and pipeline throughout the enterprise. We anticipate that additional tariffs would be met quickly by pricing action across the industry.","Now I'd like to turn the call back to Mike for closing remarks before we take Q&A. Mike?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thanks, Sue. Please go to slide 19. We believe the company is extremely well positioned to deliver strong shareholder returns over the next several years. Our strategy is firmly tied to attractive end markets that are healthy and growing profitably. Our products and services portfolio is at the nexus of global energy efficiency and sustainability megatrends, which provides a tailwind for growth above average economic conditions over the long term. So unless you believe the world is getting less populated, cooler, and less resource constrained, these secular megatrends will continue to create growth opportunities for Ingersoll Rand.","We have experienced management and a high performing team culture that incorporates operational excellence into everything we do. Culture is so fundamental to a company's success yet it is often underappreciated in the short-term. For us, it is a sustainable competitive advantage that we invest in heavily to cultivate and maintain.","And lastly, our business model generates powerful cash flow and we are committed to dynamic and balanced deployment of capital. We have a strong track record of deploying excess cash to shareholders over the years.","And with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now take questions. Your first question comes from the line of Steven Winoker from UBS. Please go ahead.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Impressive performance for sure.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Good morning, Steve.","Zachary A. Nagle - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Morning, Steve.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Morning. Hey. I just wanted to come back to a couple things. One is, I guess, the order pull forward and the second one's on Climate margins. On the order pull forward from Q3, could you give us a little more color around that and how we should expect that to materialize over kind of timeframe? And do you think this is just a one quarter phenomenon? Or you think there's going to be a little bit more of this? Just anything on that front would be helpful.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah. Steve, so half of it would've been really in commercial HVAC and then a small portion would have been residential, very small, balance being TK for the most part. So that would total something in the $80 million range.","What I'd say to you is that, and I don't necessarily talk about sort of third quarter, but I will say we looked at what was happening with bookings in the first few weeks of July very carefully and they came in very strong. So I don't think that there's going to be an issue there for us with any hiccups in the quarter.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then on all the puts and takes around Climate margin performance, can you give us a little more color there too in terms \u2013 I know you walked through some of the price\/cost inflation dynamics, but and tariff impact and all these other items. But maybe just a sense for investment, inflation. The pricing's already out there. Just something to help us think about that flat margin performance on the go forward.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Sure. I think for the full year 2018, Steve, the best way to think about that, the headline would be that I'd expect Climate margins to improve say 10, 20 basis points overall. And the pricing is then loaded in. And the productivity is something that across the company I always talk about the health of the pipeline. We look to make sure that 125% of what we need is in the queue.","The calendarized version, or the part of the perpetuity pipeline that is being worked comes down to a monthly and quarterly view. And that monthly and quarterly view would support the productivity side. So I would say with bookings where they are and the health of the end markets with pricing, the effectivity of pricing being good, what I mean by that is the pace at which price was received and to the extent we were able to get the price that we were looking for, it's as good as I've seen. The productivity calendarization looks good. When you net that all it out, I think you end up with 10, 20 basis point improvement for the full year implying a pretty good back half.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","All right. That's helpful. And I could just sneak one more in, on the Trane Mitsubishi JV that launched, what kind of financial impact are you thinking about on that as you move forward?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","2018, it's not necessarily that material to the company, but the early days has been, it's been excellent. It's been exciting and the teams are off to a great start. They're active in the market and its performing as we would have hoped. So, all systems are go and positive on that front.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Look forward to hearing more later. Thanks.","Zachary A. Nagle - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Morning, Steve. You might be on mute.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hello?","Zachary A. Nagle - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Go to the next question.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Oh, there he is. Steve?","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Can you hear me now?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Got you.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Oh, great. Sorry. Yeah, I don't think I was on mute. So guidance implies some slowing in the Industrial margin expansion after really strong obviously results here. Anything going on there? Is there a mix impact or anything like that in the second half?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Actually, we think Industrial remains strong. Everything is pointing forward. We're looking at probably a two year high now in terms of Industrial productivity. We're seeing strength across the world. We're seeing services grow at about the rate of equipment. So no, I think for the most part we see sort of steady as she goes in Industrial.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And any reason why price\/cost would \u2013 why would price\/cost would decelerate in the second half if these price increases are going through? Is the inflation just that much worse in the second half?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Well, you've got a little bit of that first $50 billion in tariffs coming through in July and August on those two.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","So I think that the safe view of that at this point would be the original guidance we have which is a flat back half. We saw great price effectivity in the second quarter. It was beyond what we thought. But yeah, I think we need to pace ourselves based on changes that happened with tariffs the dates of implementation as how those looks might change. But we think that we're managing it really effectively and that we've got a plan and contingencies around how to manage changes that we would get on the tariff front.","By the way, it's not just tariffs; it's inflation. We really have a region for region strategy. And so if you think about the impact we're seeing, it's not so much on the actual tariff. It's on the derivative effect of commodities in the region increasing because they can as a result of tariffs.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. One last quick one on resi. What do you think the market \u2013 I mean Lennox was up nine, Carrier was mid-single digits. So the market's kind of all over the place a little bit here. What do you think the market's going to kind of shake out at for the second quarter for resi?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah, I think the market data was released already, Steve, so we grew share in the quarter. We know that. And if you look across the board, and I know you'd love the detail on this, but let me just tell you that on the Climate segment itself, when you think about the revenue growth rate for the segment, we didn't have more than one point of variance globally across HVAC or transport or residential. So it was really good uniform performance. And then North America specifically, when you look at applied unitary and service, everything there was say 15%, 16% plus growth. And so that was really strong across the whole range which probably tells you what you're asking I think at that point.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Wow. Okay. Great result.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Morning, Jeff.","Zachary A. Nagle - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Morning.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hey Mike just a little bit more color on price. I think earlier in the year there was a lot of optimism you could get it in the U. S. but a lot of doubt, or certainly less certainty about rest of the world. Your results here do suggest that prices moving up pretty nicely now in those markets. But could you give a little bit more color on kind of the geographic differences around price, and if you're maybe still playing a bit more catch-up outside of the U.S.?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","There's not a lot of variability around price effectivity around the globe for us at this point, Jeff, and that's part of, if you will, the surprise here. So the margin improvement in China is going really well and that would've been the point we would've been talking about a couple of quarters ago, but that's going really well. And there's not enough differentiation globally to really kind of point out here in that space.","Now, I mean, clearly we're covering and have been covering material inflation in every business with the exception of our global commercial HVAC business and what we're seeing there is that that gap is flattening and improving with the increase that have been put out in the marketplace.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And how about capacity, Mike? A good news result in year like this. I would assume you're sweating the assets a little harder than you thought. Any material change in investment or anything that you need to do to keep up with this?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Jeff, we're ready to build and ship more so send us orders and we'll get it to you. Yeah, no, it's a good time and we need to make hay when the sun's shining. We all understand that and that's what's happening. So we don't have any capacity issues at this point in time.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","I'm sorry, just one other quick one. Maybe Sue has calculated this number. But if you're at price\/cost parity, how much margin pressure just arithmetically does that create?","Susan Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","I'm not sure I understand.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Well, revenues will be higher because of price, but profit's not up because you're neutralizing cost with price. So there's a arithmetic margin headwind. If you haven't done the math or don't know it, that's fine. Just curious.","Susan Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah, I haven't done the math. But what I would say, Jeff, is when we think about this through the entire P&L is we're not just working off of that equation. We're working off of all of the different elements. And so as we point out to you on productivity, we're continuing to put productivity projects into the pipeline because there are other elements that are inflationary and moving around in the P&L, too.","So we can certainly come back to you on that answer. But my general overall answer is I'm going to manage everything that is on the P&L to get to the guidance that we've provided and that we're going to hit for 2018.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Jeff, a good example here is that it's one of the better gross productivity years, if not the best in terms of the absolute dollars that we've ever had. So although the bridge shows that to be flat, that's absorbing 20 basis points of freight in that equation as an example that wouldn't have been planned which will show up a bit in price. So this stuff, to Sue's point, is moving around between price and productivity and it improves in the back half of the year. But to get to the arithmetic math, the arithmetic equation there, we'll follow up with you.","Susan Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research","Morning, guys. Nice quarter.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Hi, Andy.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research","Mike, obviously your intention in China has been to accelerate growth through moving to the direct sales model and you did mention that one of the highlights of your overall growth this quarter is China HVAC. Can you give us a little bit more perspective on that growth in the region? Maybe how much of it is coming from your own initiative here versus what the HVAC market is doing over there.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah. The market's growing something in the 5% range so we're growing in multiples of the market there. And it's in the areas that we would expect which is the applied systems and some of the larger infrastructure projects and in some of the geographies that we weren't covering as deeply as in the past. So that is the strategy. That's what's being executed. It's being executed very well and the margin profile and linkage to service continues to improve. So it's been a great success. It's probably one of the greatest successes we've had in the past year or so has been that whole strategy and I would expect that to continue.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research","Got it. And you don't adjust and tweak that strategy given all of the tariff stuff that's going on between us and China, correct?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Well, same equation in China applies here. We build about 95% of what we sell in China in China and the supply chain's localized. So it's the same equation as we have here region-in-region.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research","Got it. And then, look, you delivered almost 9% organic revenue growth across the first half of 2018. You mentioned the 15% bookings tailwind. Maybe a little bit of pull forward as you talked about, but it's not affecting 3Q. So the implied organic growth for the second half, let's call it 6% to 7%. Is that just conservatism at the midpoint or is there anything that you would worry could slow down the second half, or it's just sort of steady as she goes?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Well, some of the bigger growers in the quarter would have been applied and it would have been Compression Technology's equipment. So in essence we're building 2019 as we speak. And I would say a lot of that is our view toward building a profile for 2019.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research","Got it, that's helpful. Thanks, Mike.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, good morning. Just wanted to circle back on the Industrial segment if you could give any color within compressors, any specific markets or regions that you thought gave the orders a particular lift? And also on the Industrial segment in general, following up on an earlier question, I mean the margin guide implies sort of flat margins I think sequentially in the second half which is quite unusual in Industrial, particularly given the sales trends. So I don't know if there's any extra color you could give on why that's the case.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah, in terms of the market, we called out Asia specifically and that's true. It was really across all of the oil free technologies which would be centrifugal and oil-free rotary combined. But also strength in some of the quick ship or the quick book and turn business short cycle compressors were strong as well. Service growth across the board is really stepping up. That team has done an outstanding job of taking the operating system for sales excellence and really putting that into how they manage for daily improvement. And so the coverage of the market, the activity we're seeing through that coverage in the market is much stronger than we've seen in the past. So that's part of the playbook that we actually saw from the HVAC China business if you will in terms of how we're thinking about covering the market more fully and differently there. So, but North America was good, was strong as well. We saw that in content coal as a (36:52) technology. We see that in plant there. Centrifugal, sort of going into general industry, that's been good as well.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Understood. And then just on the margins sort of half-on-half in Industrial, is there anything particularly weighing on that back half in terms of higher investments, or at this point do you think you've raised the margin guide enough for now and we'll just see how Q3 plays out?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","No. We wouldn't do that. If we thought it was better, we'd roll that through but that's the roll up we've got at this point in time and some of that's going to be a combination of mix and timing of projects. So I think it's a good forecast where we think the year is going to end at this point.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Morning, Joe.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Maybe just to clarify Jeff's question from earlier, when you guys made the comment around margin parity, price\/cost parity in the second half of the year, you were talking about margins, not on a dollar basis, right?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Talking about margins. Right.","Susan Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Absolutely.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Got it. Got it. Yeah, I think that that probably clarifies it. Maybe talking about the growth that you're seeing specifically on Climate and into 2019, Mike, can you provide maybe some color on some of the orders that you're booking that could potentially be longer cycle that could start benefiting 2019 as well?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah. I mean, we're seeing, again, there's very little variability between unitary, applied, controls and service. It's just a strong healthy global environment for us really all regions of the world. There were no large performance contracts in there and something that would skew the results. That's really important to know. So because you're seeing such strength in applied, you're generally finding longer lead projects. And so if anything, there, again, you're building quarter one, quarter two of 2019 backlog, which we're already well into that based on customer timing.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Cool. That's good to hear. And then, I guess my follow-up there is really just price\/cost is better than we expected this quarter. I was just wondering, did you benefit at all of from, Mike, the pullback that we started to see in copper? And then what are kind of like your assumptions for the key commodities into the second half of the year?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Well, really it's the best press price effectivity I've seen in 33 years I've gone through this, both in the urgency to get it done and in the ability to maximize what it was that we were asking for. So the combination of that got us a bit ahead of the curve which is great; further along than we thought we'd be in Q2.","And then the ability to absorb the first $50 billion into the pricing that we've put out in the marketplace would be the success there. So it's the copper specifically. We ladder and hedge and so yeah, it's great that things are moving down, but as you enter quarter three in the back half of the year, a smaller percentage of the spend is really in the spot market. We begin to lock that in. So if it continues, we'll see some benefit, but that would be reflected in the locks we would be doing going into 2019 at this point.","Susan Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah. I think that's right, Joe. And when we think about that, the goal that I would have is to get ourselves to the point where in 2019 that that blended rate gets through our locks and that dollar cost averaging that we're doing on a copper buy comes down overall. So we never lock, as we told you, to the full amount of the commodity, 75% at the beginning of a quarter. So we do get some benefits on any purchase that we're going to make from those prices coming down. But I would look at that as more of an opportunity for 2019 as we go forward. So it's always good because we are always buying all three of the commodities. So we'll certainly take advantage of any price drops that we get.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Perfect. Good to hear. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Oh, thanks. Good morning.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Hi, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, Mike. Obviously you've covered a lot of ground here and you provided good detail so I haven't got huge amount here. But I imagine you're pretty paranoid about the sustainability of the strength and obviously 15% growth is not going to be sustained. But as you look beyond July and look at the front logs RFP activity, customer conversations, what do you think you see in the next six months or so? And are we still looking at a double-digit type order cadence here? I mean, any cause of concern? Any color there would be very helpful.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah, I mean globally as we track proposal activity and we look at what's happening in the market, Nigel, things are strong all over the world for us. And it fundamentally comes down to in most parts of the world, it's a replacement business; 80%, 85% of most of what we're seeing in North America, Europe for sure and the Middle East is going to be replacement business. And even China and some of the newer economies are 50%-50% in terms of replacement, new construction.","And so what's happening as when you can build an equation, economic value and a payback related to energy productivity energy efficiency, and if we're able to couple that with a story that helps customers achieve their greenhouse gas emission or sustainability goals, there's a demand creation opportunity out there that's really not factored into how people might look at particular put in place or market data across the globe.","So it truly is a secular tailwind tied to this whole nexus of energy efficiency and sustainability. And I think that that's a long lived phenomenon. You heard me in my opening and close that really relates to the fact that I think as you see more urbanization, you see more pressure on energy and the environment and you think about what businesses we're in, where HVAC is such a major contributor to building efficiency and to greenhouse gas emissions followed by transport refrigeration followed by industrial processes, we're in the right businesses to have an impact. And so I think that's a big part of it. The product portfolio, the investments in controls and digital, the investments in the channel really just go to support that model that we think is the right model.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. That's great color. And then just on the service trends, we don't typically see service growing high single digits. And I know that a lot of that's due to your internal initiatives around connectivity, et cetera, and just obviously a lot of investments there as well. But is there any signal here that \u2013 we've seen utilization picking up, particularly in the Industrial side? And is there some sense here that we've got some Ace equipment out there which require more MR activity and then perhaps that could signal further activity on OE side.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Well, I mean, services was actually mid-teens and it's so unusual to see when equipment grows mid-teens, you get services growing mid-teens. But it really comes down to the wholesales ASO once (44:29) work being conducted across the company and that bearing fruit really over time. And even parts of the world, historically, places like China where, I can imagine in the next three to five years, you're seeing the same sorts of linkage parity that you're finding in Western Europe and in the U.S. And so, that is certainly impacting service growth.","Rental is another one. We think that's an important part of the strategy to be able to backstop customers' uptime requirements, as well as an opportunity to provide seasonal equipment and to create service opportunities through the rental business. And so, that's helping us in that regard as well. As far as Industrial...","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Right. And Industrial...","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Industrial \u2013 yeah, go ahead.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Please. Go ahead, Mike.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","You might want to just ask the second part of your question, the point you're interested, it was industrial productivity?","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Just \u2013 no, more on the industrial compressors, whether we're seeing increasing utilization of those machines driving service or just more internal IR?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Well, you're definitely seeing utilization rates across most of the economies in the world increasing up to critical points where you're finding expansion opportunities. So, to me, what's really happening in the Compression Technologies business is the market coverage we're taking on and the investments we're making in covering the service opportunities in the market has taken on a whole different sense of urgency. That connectivity strategy that Todd talked about for really a couple years at this point in time is something that's showing up in the results in a meaningful way.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","And then, just a quick one, Mike, on mix in residential. One or two of your competitors talked about slight negative mix in U.S. resi. Did you see that at all in your business?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","No. Not at all. Simple answer, no.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Thanks Mike.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Morning.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey Mike, on the performance contracting project, so nothing this quarter. Earlier in the year you said some things could hit. But at this point is it fair to say that that's all going to come in 2019?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","No. I think that we could see Q3, Q4. I think these are sort of landing gears down on a couple of these. So I think that quarter three, quarter four would be my guess.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And would those have some sort of mix-down impact on \u2013 it'd be enough to have a negative mix impact on Climate on the margin side?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","No. No, it wouldn't. The contribution there is going to be just fine. In gross margins you'd see it a little bit, but contributions will be accretive.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And institutional orders consistent with overall Climate orders, growth, organic wise?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah. I mean, really, you're seeing applied, which I would link to Institutional, growing at the same rate as unitary, growing at the same rate as service.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then two, just a question on M&A contribution. Earlier in the year you had $0.05 or $0.06 from deals done in 2017, in terms of the EPS contribution for 2018, and then something like $0.15, $0.16 for 2019. Are those numbers coming in better?","Susan Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Well, so what you did see, as we look at the M&A activity that has impacted cash flow in the first half, so $286 million, that is the announcement that, or the committed transactions, the ICS Cool Energy as well as Mitsubishi that we had committed at year end. But I think one of the things that I would do, Rich, just as you think about this is, I'll step you back to almost a capital allocation and sort of broaden out your question, which, as we think about capital allocation we think about investing in the business first, having a strong dividend second, and then having the remainder split off between M&A and share buyback, if the stock's trading below its intrinsic value.","If you look at the first half of 2018 and I follow that along. So we've got heavier CapEx in 2018 related to some of the footprint optimization as well as the new product development that I talked about in the prepared remarks. So that's actually $163 million. We've got the dividends that we talked about of $222 million. We've also got the share buyback of $500 million and the M&A of $286 million. So in the first half of the year, we've actually deployed over $1 billion of the excess cash that we've got. And so M&A's a part of it. We're going to continue to look at the pipeline, but I just wanted to take the opportunity to point out how strong the capital allocation has really been in the first half.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Rich.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Specifically on the deals done, they're integrating well and we're achieving what we thought we would achieve which had a high threshold. So I don't think anything changes with the guidance we gave you around 2018 and 2019 around contribution.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Okay. Great. Thanks. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a couple quick philosophical things, if I could. First on Thermo King, based on the data we see, it doesn't really look like the fleets of trucks and trailers are actually growing that much which would suggest that what we're seeing here is kind of a technology upgrade and I know there's much better energy efficiency with the more recent units. But how long do you think that can last? I mean, where are we in the process of upgrading the fleet do you think?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Well, I mean from a U.S. perspective first, you've got tight shipping capacity, you've got regulatory changes, you've got the impact from U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and we'd expensing, all that's going to drive some opportunity. You're right, I mean, technology is a major difference. If you think about what's going across the road in refrigerated trailer really in a Class A tractor, the need to manage the diesel engine and reduce fuel consumption, to manage the refrigeration cycle, the energy and any greenhouse gas emissions coming off those units and to supplement that with auxiliary power units when the vehicles are idling, it's a big opportunity that I think continues for a long period of time. I mean, ultimately like you're seeing with consumer vehicles, you're going to see more electrification of that over time. And that's certainly what we're doing now with some of the hybrid applications as well as telematics investments that we've made across the portfolio.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then even maybe a little more broad picture. At some point, I suppose all these price increases we should start to worry about some demand destruction in certain end markets. And some of the pricing we're hearing, especially in the HVAC, is pretty impressive. And I guess I'm just curious how you think about when that starts to crimp growth, or maybe it doesn't. I don't know. Maybe these markets are consolidated enough now. But I'm curious how you think about that and how you might even sort of measure and monitor it?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Well, history would say that it doesn't happen, that there isn't disruption over time. And so, I rely a lot on history and I would also rely a lot on the discipline that happens within the industries themselves, and so the structure of the industry. It's something we do look at, but we're not seeing any changes to historical patterns here.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joel Tiss from BMO. Please go ahead.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Ah, I made it. I just had one or two little ones. Can you break out the bookings in Industrial by the different product lines? Just because there've been a couple of questions around the edges of that. I think that would just clear a lot of things up.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Joel, Club Car was the weakest, just marginally negative and the strongest would've been CTS and material handling, albeit material handling being smaller business, but CTS would have been additive, Club Car would have been dilutive, and power and fluid management right in the hunt there. So that's the rundown there.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So you won't give us numbers. All right. And then and can you talk about...","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","I probably gave you enough of the algebra there that a smart guy like you, Joel, handle that. So...","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Once I run out of fingers, I'm done.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","All right.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And can you just give us a little sense on the second half share repurchases that are baked into the guidance? And also are there any larger acquisitions that, over the next 18 months, like you can fuzz it up a little bit, but just a little color on anything bigger that might be percolating. Thank you.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Well, let me do the second part first. Sue can tell you about share buyback. But on the first part, nothing has changed with regard to our methodology, the discipline, about how we're thinking about M&A. I think about 80% of what we look at in M&A are assets that we know and think fit the portfolio. 20% are always the good ideas that come in from additional sources that get evaluated to see if we're missing something or there's a fit.","So nothing's changed there with regard to how we look at the pipeline, how we manage it, how we think about it strategically, or how we compare that to other alternatives including share buyback. And Sue, you may want to comment on share buyback.","Susan Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah, on the share buyback, the way that we model this, Joel, for purposes of the guidance is absolutely consistent with where we started out the year. So we put a placeholder in for $500 million, which, as you know, we've completed. But that isn't the capital allocation strategy. The capital allocation strategy says we're looking to deploy the excess cash and that we're going to look at the M&A pipeline as well as more share buyback to absolutely finish out the capital deployment for the year. So, the model today with the guidance is consistent with where we started out the year with the $500 million.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning. This is Andrew Krill on for Deane.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Hey.","Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So, going back to the trucking and freight shortage and issue, I think one of your competitors noted they had a pretty, a meaningful impact in June for resi HVAC. So, I just want to \u2013 did you guys see any of that? And can you just update us on how the costs in freight and shipping are tracking year-over-year? I think you said around 15% up previously. Thanks.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","You know, I said actually refrigerated freight mile is up about 30%, which is great for our TK business and we were seeing dry freight at that time up in the market about 15%. I didn't actually say what our rate increases were.","I did say earlier on the call though that there's a 20 basis point impact in the productivity other inflation bridge that we've got. So if you take that bridge which shows flat, there's a 20 basis point headwind associated with freight in that number. So that's the impact that we're seeing.","Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then...","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","And then \u2013 hey, Andrew, and a lot of the productivity initiatives \u2013 not a lot, but a number of productivity initiatives in the third and fourth quarter are looking at ideas that we've got around freight and warehousing. And so, that's sort of an exciting thing that we're thinking about. We started that about a year ago. It's a bit fortunate, if you will, that we've got that kind of teed in for the Q3, Q4 of this year so that should help with that equation dramatically.","Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And then on the resi, did you have any impact on just shortage of being able to ship resi units in this quarter? Or maybe in 3Q so far?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Nope. We'll ship all you want. Again, send us your orders. We're happy to do that and we've got no problem building them and shipping them.","Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And then just as a quick follow-up on the \u2013 back to the China HVAC strategy. Just with all the tariffs and say around in U.S. and China, have you seen any kind of blowback against the U.S. brands in general? Or is the value proposition still that they really don't care at this point?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Well we employ a lot of people in China. We've got factories and technology and product built for the market. And so in China, we think about ourselves as a Chinese company. In the U.S., we think about ourselves about it as a U.S. company. Fundamentally we're a global company and we've got to act that way in the markets that we serve. So to your question simply, no. We haven't seen any reaction to that one way or the other.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Raso from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","Hi. Good morning.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Morning.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","On the organic sales guidance increase, the 3.25% to 7.5%, how much of that was higher price than you previously assumed?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Have to think about that. There really was a second price increase which would have happened depending on the business kind of midway through the year. So we wouldn't have had a lot in there for meaningfully \u2013 I mean, certainly would have looked at material inflation and new news around freight 232 and 301 and we were trying to get on top of that as it was happening. So David, I'll probably have to come back and answer that. But it's not something meaningfully popping out on the bridge to say that that is a such a difference from where we were originally.","Susan Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","No, because David, the way that I would think about that is with the pricing and generally again, your pricing realization in the neighborhood of 1% to 2% is going to kind of flow through. So it might move the growth slightly but it's not going to be the biggest factor in changing the growth. It's really coming out of the volume that's occurring out of the end market as opposed to pricing, or FX, or acquisitions, which basically are having about the same impact as the original guidance.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","David, I'd probably say, maybe a point to 120 basis points for the full year would be price. Everything else is going to be pretty well volume.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","Yeah, so that's not all new pricing from the previous guidance, right? That's full year, what you ...","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Right, all. That's right.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","I mean the reason I ask is when you look at the segments, and I don't know if it's conservatism or as you said a lot of the inflation's in Climate, but you just raised your revenue guidance for Climate $475 million, but you only raised the EBIT, $46 million right? So basically a 9.7% incremental profit on incremental sales you're now looking for. And that sort of begs the question, are we really seeing price versus cost maintains the margin? Or price of $100 offsets cost of $100? So just to be clear, we're saying price\/cost does not erode the margin the rest of the year, especially in Climate or is it \u2013 no. It's $100 of cost get offset by $100 of price and yes that does dampen the margin but at least we're offsetting it in dollar terms. It's just the incremental margin on Climate just seems low on what you just raised the sales by.","Susan Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Right, but I'm thinking out loud, David, as we go through this. But I think what you have to do with all of this is you can't just parse out a couple of pieces. And it really is important to understand that the majority of the big inflationary items are occurring in the Climate segment of the business and that as we're looking at the Climate segment, itself over the second quarter, you're actually seeing an improvement in the overall margins for the quarter. So we're offsetting the headwinds and continuing to improve margins in the business.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Hey, David, I guess our math's a little bit different too, by the way. I mean, to get to a 10, 20 basis point expansion in Climate for the full year we're going to have to get something like 50, 60 basis points of improvement in the back half of the year. That implied leverage organically of somewhere between let's say 23% and 25%. So we'll at least take...","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","The incremental margin year-over-year, it is 23%, but I'm talking about literally what you just raised in sales and EBIT which you would think is incremental.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Ah. Well, (01:02:02)","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","Well, that's why I asked the pricing question. If it was simple, look, I raised revenue in Climate by you name it, the $475 million. But half of it was price and all I'm doing is offsetting cost, then I can appreciate why the incremental profit on that sales is modest. Right? We're just trying to understand is there conservatism in that number or when you look at Industrial, that same math on the way you raised the sales $114 million, you are dropping through 36% more profits. So is the messaging here that yeah, the inflation's in Climate. That price\/cost might be a drag on margin but we're more than making up for it in Industrial and thus the whole company has price\/cost, no margin drag.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah, high level ...","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","(01:02:45) we're trying to figure out.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","High level, David, I'd say that, as Sue said to you, the 232 and 301 really hit the Climate segment much more, if not almost exclusively with the Industrial business. And so to my mind, you've got more headwind there to offset. There is more price in the back half obviously than there would be in the first half. You've got direct material inflation which continues in the second half to be a bit larger than the first half. But shoring up the math to the raise, we can work with you later on and kind of compare notes.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

It follows a multi-year pattern of consistently strong operating and financial performance driven by our strategic framework of sustained growth, operational excellence, excellent cash flow conversion and a commitment to our winning culture. Our strategic objective is to drive profitable growth through leadership positions in growing markets that are durable because they address a global imperative, to dramatically reduce energy demand and resource constraints in buildings, homes, industrial and transport markets around the world.","Turning to slide four, in 2016 we extended our multi-year record of top quartile performance on organic revenue growth, incremental margins, earnings growth, free cash flow and total shareholder return. We delivered free cash flow of approximately $1.3 billion and 3% organic revenue growth and operating margin expansion of 60 basis points to 11.6%.","Free cash flow was 121% of adjusted net income and more than $5 per outstanding share. Adjusted operating margin leverage was 44%. Adjusted continuing EPS of $4.13 was up 11%, demonstrating the strong leverage of the business.","We also retained a strong balance sheet with good optionality, while at the same time returning significant cash to shareholders, paying roughly $350 million in dividends and executing $250 million in share buybacks. We continued our long history of raising our corporate dividend and in 2016 we raised our quarterly dividend by approximately 40% through two increases of $0.29 per share to $0.40 per share. We're now at $1.60 annualized per share.","I'd said throughout 2016 that rigorous execution would serve us well, drive leverage in the P&L and deliver strong cash flow and margin expansion even in a low growth environment. We followed our business operating system to capture growth, improve costs and drive productivity, all of which translated into 60 basis points of margin expansion.","2016 growth was led by North American commercial and residential HVAC. The teams here are doing a phenomenal job of share gain and margin expansion and we anticipate this momentum to continue into 2017. While North American HVAC led the growth, we made deliberate choices in the selection of growth programs across the whole portfolio, and then we operationally led those programs to product growth teams. We see breakout results with this strategy. The average growth rate for our model product growth teams is more than twice our overall company average growth rate for the year.","We also drove significant innovation, launching more than 80 new products and services in 2016, with introductions happening in nearly every business and region. We realized benefits of new product and technology investments as the offerings supported our 2016 growth, share gains and margin expansion. I emphasize this to demonstrate our commitment to organic long-term strategic investment and innovation to remain ahead of our customers' expectations, the competition and the regulatory environment.","And heading into 2017, we haven't slowed down with our focus on product growth teams. A couple of weeks ago, we launched our personal transportation vehicle called Onward for the consumer market, resulting in a 10% order increase above our initial launch plan.","Getting back to 2016, we also continued our multi-year trend of service, parts and solutions growth in both segments. HVAC aftermarket outpaced equipment growth annually with high single digit growth ex foreign exchange. In compression technologies, we also realized 3% growth in our aftermarket business. This consistent performance against our strategy to deliver higher service penetration across our segments helps build strong relationships with customers and a more resilient business portfolio.","As anticipated, we continue to see more and more growth within our portfolio stemming from smart, wireless and digitally connected solutions in 2016 that are more reliable, more cost effective and energy efficient. Each one of our business units is executing a digital strategy and we are a recognized leader in this area. Our energy services and controls business, for example, is actively servicing 6,500 connected buildings, and we are one of the top providers in the space. Anticipated growth rate here is approximately 30% for 2017.","The diversity of our business portfolio helps to mitigate cyclicality in our end markets, which has enabled us to sustain strong performance over time. Growth teams dedicated to our lines of business help us create real value using a wide range of technologies and innovation. Our objective is to take advantage of growth when the market is in an upswing and to build on our competitiveness in difficult markets.","Moving to slide 5, the measure of our success is represented by our financial results and total return to our shareholders. Slide 5 demonstrates our consistent performance over time and the metrics that matter to our shareholders, whether it's revenue growth, adjusted EPS growth, cash flow ROIC or adjusted operating margin improvement. 2016 was another excellent year that extends this track record, a record year and one we're proud of.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Sue to comment on the fourth quarter.","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thank you, Mike. Please go to slide number 6. I'd like to begin with a summary of main points to take away from today's call. As Mike discussed, 2016 was a very strong year for Ingersoll-Rand and marked another year of continued top tier performance on free cash flow, organic revenue growth, operating margin improvement and earnings per share growth. While we recognize the fourth quarter contained more one-offs and noise than any of us would have liked and distorted our fourth quarter earnings report, fundamentally, it was still a strong quarter for the company relative to our core businesses. There shouldn't be any significant read through to our go-forward results.","Free cash flow was more than $350 million in the quarter, bringing our 2016 free cash flow to $1.35 billion, which is up 37% versus 2015 or more than 120% of our adjusted net income. From a segment perspective, the combined Climate and Industrial segments' adjusted operating income results were solid and a bit better than our expectations for the quarter.","Our bookings performance was very strong, with commercial and residential HVAC leading the way, with both at low teens growth. Residential revenues increased low teens. Operating margins also expanded in both businesses.","We were pleased with our Industrial business performance which showed slow but steady adjusted margin improvement after hitting a low in the first quarter. We continued to take additional actions on operational excellence initiatives, increased commercial focus on aftermarket parts and service offerings, and took additional cost reduction activities to improve operating results going forward. EPS in the quarter was negatively impacted by discrete items in G&A, negative other operating income and taxes, as I'll discuss on the next slide.","Please go to slide 7. We've provided a bridge from the fourth quarter guidance range we provided on our Q3 earnings call to our actual Q4 results. As I noted earlier, our segment operating performance was in line with our expectations, actually about $0.01 better. We incurred higher than expected corporate costs, primarily due to stock based and other incentive based compensation, given our strong cash flow performance and stock performance in 2016 and from increased information technology, infrastructure and security expenditures. These items combined for a negative impact of about $0.04. We expect our corporate G&A expenses to come back down to a more normalized run rate of about $60 million per quarter in 2017.","We also incurred higher than expected non-operating cost as a result of foreign exchange losses related to the balance sheet, given the strengthening of the US dollar, which had a non-cash impact of $0.01.","Lastly, we had a higher than expected mix of earnings from high tax jurisdictions which impacted us by about $0.03. While this was a significant negative in the fourth quarter, our adjusted tax rate for the year of 21.4% was on the low side of the 21% to 22% range we updated on our second quarter call. I feel good about the effective tax rate. And more importantly, we expect the rate to remain in the 21% to 22% range for 2017 as well.","Please go to slide number 8. Top-line organic growth of 2% was solid, highlighted by our North America HVAC businesses. Operating margins and adjusted operating income plus depreciation and amortization were both down, primarily driven by Industrial segment margin declines and the higher than expected costs we previously discussed.","Please go to slide 9. Organic orders were very strong in the fourth quarter, up 7%, led by our Climate segment and partially offset by modest declines in our Industrial segment. Climate bookings were up in every region in business globally and up 10% overall. Organic commercial HVAC bookings were up low teens in equipment, with strong results from both unitary and applied products. We also continued to drive excellent growth in service, controls and contracting with low teens growth in the quarter. Residential bookings continued to be exceptional, up low teens.","Organic transport orders were up mid single digits, primarily driven by growth in Europe, partially offset by declines in marine equipment and auxiliary power units. We also had mid single digit increase in North America trailer orders in the fourth quarter. On balance, the Industrial businesses bookings were flat to down slightly in the quarter, reflecting some stabilization in end markets.","Please go to slide number 10. This slide provides a directional view of our segment revenue performance by region. In our Climate segment, revenue was strong in North America, flat in Asia and down in Europe, Middle East and Africa and Latin America. In our Industrial segment, overall performance was down low single digits, primarily due to difficult comparisons with 2015 on large air compressor shipments in North America and Europe, Middle East and Africa. Revenues improved in Latin America and Asia. Overall, North America revenues were up mid single digits and international revenues were down mid single digits, netting a positive 2% organic revenue growth rate for the enterprise.","Please go to slide number 11. Q4 operating margin declined 50 basis points, primarily due to headwinds resulting from material inflation in steel and higher corporate costs in the quarter. On a year over year basis, lower Industrial margins also contributed to the decline. Volume and mix was positive in the quarter.","Please go to slide number 12. Overall Climate performance was strong in the quarter with organic revenues up 4% and adjusted operating margins up 70 basis points to 13.6%. Strong revenue growth in both commercial and residential HVAC was partially offset by transport revenues, which were down mid single digits in the quarter, primarily due to weak auxiliary power unit and marine markets partially offset by growth in aftermarket and in Asia. Climate operating margins expanded 70 basis points year over year. Favorable volume, mix and productivity was partially offset by material inflation headwinds and continued investments in the business.","Please go to slide 13. Fourth quarter industrial margins declined by 220 basis points compared with 2015, while organic revenues declined 3%. Revenues were down mid single digits in compressors with growth in aftermarket. Other industrial products were down by high single digits with material handling showing the largest decline, more than 50%, owing to its significant oil and gas exposure. Small electric vehicles were up slightly in the quarter from growth in golf.","Industrial's operating margin of 10.5% was down 220 basis points versus the prior year, but in line or slightly ahead of our expectations for the quarter. Looking forward, we expect margins to improve in 2017, given ongoing margin improvement actions, although we do expect some quarterly variability due to cyclicality.","Please go to slide 14. Excellent full year 2016 free cash flow of $1.3 billion improved 37% versus the prior year and was over 120% of net income. Strong operating income and working capital improvement were the primary drivers of the improvement. For the quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 3.4% versus our 2016 goal of 4% and improved 80 basis points versus 2015.","We have a proud history returning cash to shareholders. Since 2011, our free cash flow as a percentage of net income has averaged 100%. Over the same timeframe, we've returned more than $6.5 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends of $1.5 billion and share buybacks of $5.1 billion.","Please go to slide 15. Our strong cash performance in 2016 will enable us to, one, invest in our business as our number one priority. These include investments in innovation and in strategic growth programs as Mike outlined earlier. In addition to the core strategic investments, we're also investing in long-term growth through innovative and differentiated products in areas such as wireless, controls for buildings as a resource, intelligent monitoring and self-healing systems, just to name a few. Two, we've paid an annual dividend for 106 years and have consistently raised this dividend over time. Over the past five years, we've raised our annual dividend at a 20% compound annual growth rate. In 2016, we raised our annualized dividend from $1.16 to $1.60 per share or nearly 40%. Three, we also spent $250 million repurchasing sweeping shares sufficient to offset dilution. Four, additionally in 2016, we continued to develop and vet a pipeline of potential acquisition targets. And five, lastly in 2016, we strengthened our balance sheet, which provides stability and optionality as our markets evolve.","We also maintain a BBB credit rating, which at this time we believe is appropriate for the company. We will continue to create long-term value for our shareholders through a dynamic capital allocation strategy as we have consistently done for years.","And with that, I will turn it back to Mike to discuss our market outlook as we begin our guidance conversation.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thanks, Sue. And if you move to slide 17, we'll begin our guidance conversation with some color around our end markets. As always, our intention is to give you our best view as we know it today and how that translates to our revenue outlook for 2017. We've broken it down by major end markets and geographies.","We expect North American commercial HVAC and residential HVAC to show continuing growth. In North America, 50% of our commercial business is parts, service and controls, and we're seeing strong demand in all these areas as well as through upgrades and energy retrofits. Residential replacement, which makes up approximately 80% of the total market, closed the year on a strong note and we expect to see continuing growth next year in both replacement and new construction.","Commercial HVAC markets in EMEA and Asia are expected to be flat. We expect Latin America to be up mid to high single digits. Transport markets in the Americas will be down from lower volumes for trailers and auxiliary power units, partially offset by trucks. North American trailer volumes are expected to decline by low teens. Transport in Europe is expected to be up based on truck and trailer sales and a bottoming of the marine container market. Asia Pacific was up high teens last year and we expect continued growth in 2017 on its smaller base.","Global industrial markets are generally improving, but still remain soft. We believe we are seeing a bottoming trend in our general industrial markets in the US and the Eurozone as PMIs have improved over the last several months. We have also seen some order improvement in our short cycle industrial businesses. While this is a positive, the modest rise in industrial production for just a gradual recovery with bumps along the way. Industrial markets in Asia remain under pressure due to excess capacity in many key industries. The large engineered compressor market is expected to show signs of improvement due to stabilizing activity in energy markets and heavy industry.","While expecting year over year orders to be up, revenue will decline due to depressed 2016 order levels and the average lead time of 12 to 18 months for this type of product. Excluding these longer lead time products, we expect our Industrial segment to be flat to slightly up. Golf and utility vehicle markets are generally flat to slightly up across all regions. Golf is expected to be flat and we expect to see some growth in our consumer and utility vehicle markets.","All the growth forecasts shown are on an organic basis. We are forecasting mid single digit growth in commercial HVAC in total, mid single digit growth in residential HVAC, which is essentially a North American business for us, and revenues down low single digits in transport. We expect compression technologies and industrial products, which includes our power tools, material handling and fluid management businesses to be down low single digits and we expect Club Car to be up low single digits.","With that overview as a backdrop, we'll move into 2017 guidance. Before Sue takes you through guidance, I know some of you know that we recently completed in-depth interviews with the investment community to better understand how Ingersoll-Rand is perceived and what we might do better to improve in our communications.","We just received the results and we'll be incorporating changes that reflect investor feedback going forward. Thank you to all of you who participated. One of the changes highlighted in the feedback was investor preference for the timing of company guidance. Overwhelmingly, investors said they had a preference for annual guidance with quarterly updates versus quarterly guidance. So we have adopted this beginning with the annual guidance for 2017. Annual guidance is also much more aligned with the way in which we make decisions and manage the business internally with a focus on building a better business over the long term. For those of you who prefer quarterly guidance, we'll get through the transition together and make sure it goes as smoothly as it can.","And now I'll turn it over to Sue for specifics on guidance.","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thanks, Mike. Please go to slide 18. Moving on to our guidance, we expect total organic revenues to be up approximately 3% in 2017. We expect the Climate segment to continue to show good growth of approximately 4% organic. For the Industrial segment, we expect the markets overall to be pretty flat, but for our organic revenues to be down slightly given the high volume of large compressors we shipped out of backlog in 2016, which will make for tougher compares in 2017. The difference between our organic and reported revenue contemplates about 1 percentage point of negative foreign exchange from a strengthening US dollar outlook.","For the enterprise, we expect adjusted operating margins of between 12.2% and 12.6%. We expect adjusted operating margins for the Climate segment to be in the range of 14.5% to 15%, and in the range of 11% to 12% for the Industrial segment.","Please go to slide 19. We expect continuing adjusted earnings per share for 2017 to be in the range of $4.30 to $4.50 excluding about $0.15 of restructuring. The company also provides the following guidance. Share count is expected to be approximately 262 million shares. Target free cash flow is 100% of net income. The tax rate is expected to be between 21% and 22%. Corporate, general and administrative expenses are expected to be approximately $240 million and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $250 million.","Please go to slide 20. Relative to the company's plans for capital allocation investing, in the business is our highest priority, so we continue to make investments in innovation and growth in things like wireless and digital and connected capabilities, productivity, sustainability and in our employees just to name a few areas. Paying a highly competitive dividend is also a key priority for us and based on our most recent dividend raise last October to $1.60 per share, we expect to spend approximately $420 million on dividends in 2017. In 2017, we're also targeting spending approximately $1.5 billion between a combination of share buybacks and acquisitions. Maintaining a strong balance sheet also remains a priority and provides us optionality as our markets continue to evolve.","Let's go to slide 21. And now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mike to discuss a few of the key topics we know are on the minds of investors as we enter 2017.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thanks, Sue. The first topic to discuss is our US manufacturing base. I think you're all aware, we operate on a region of use philosophy. We localize manufacturing and the supply chain to help us achieve greater speed to market and implement local product preferences. 95% of Ingersoll-Rand products sold in the US are manufactured in the US.","Regarding components, we're likely less exposed as compared to other diversified industrials, because of our focus on lean and in particular cycle time reduction. We've actually through the years been willing to sacrifice some price for faster delivery, meaning the source is coming from within the US. I think this issue is a bigger issue for companies that are importing finished goods into the US, such as consumer products or electronic companies. We are definitely a net exporter.","The second topic is around the US corporate tax rate. As you know, approximately 65% of our revenues are derived from the US and therefore, we pay a significant amount of US corporate taxes. If there is a reduction in the US corporate tax rate, we would expect to benefit from it.","Turning to slide 22. I know we'll receive questions on the status of Industrial. Fourth quarter was above the guidance we gave in revenue and operating margin. We saw growth in several vertical markets, including food, pharma and tech, as well as with our compressor aftermarket business, which was up 3% as I mentioned earlier. However, we continue to see soft markets on large compressors and in the energy markets. We have seen some bottoming with orders for our shorter-cycle businesses, such as power tools and fluid management, both up in the fourth quarter.","As I indicated earlier, we expect the industrial markets to stabilize in 2017, although we cannot declare a definitive turning point. Excluding large compressors, we expect Industrial to be flat to slightly up, and we do expect to realize margin expansion through our operational excellence initiatives, new product launches, restructuring actions and ongoing cost reductions.","Covering our transport business, you'll recall last year we had a better than anticipated first half and decline in activity in the second half, as we expected. For 2017 overall, we expect Thermo King revenues to be down low single digits year over year. The North American trailer industry is expected to be down low teens year over year. We're also expecting a continuation for a relatively soft market for auxiliary power units and marine containers. Those declines will be partially offset by gains in Europe, Asia and aftermarket revenues. Through restructuring and efficiency, we would expect only a minor erosion of record 2016 operating margins.","Moving to slide 23, I'll touch on currency as a headwind for us in 2017. About 35% or $4.8 billion of our revenues are outside of the US. Our 2017 forecast has built in the continuing strength of the US dollar, which will impact us most notably in the euro and Asian currencies. Overall, we expect a 1% drag on our revenues from currency translation, which will have about a $0.10 negative impact on our EPS.","And finally, we know material inflation is top of mind. We have 10 basis points positive price covering material inflation in our guidance, and of course we're working to increase that even further. We've been through various cycles and have a strong history of capturing price to material inflation. This long track record of managing price demonstrates to shareholders the discipline that exists with our people, systems and processes.","So in closing on slide 24, we've built a stronger, more valuable and less cyclical Ingersoll-Rand. I'm proud of our employees who delivered a record 2016 performance and that make us a more sustainable company in every way. I'm confident in our management team to execute our 2017 plan.","We will maximize growth and focus on productivity and costs where markets are not accelerating. Our commercial and residential HVAC businesses are strong and focused on growth areas with equipment, controls and service. Our transport refrigeration business is diverse and agile, and will execute their strategy as they typically do. Our industrial businesses are focused on margin expansion as markets stabilize. As a result, I'm confident we'll continue to deliver a top-tier financial performance.","And with that, Sue and I will now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan from UBS. Your line is now open.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, guys.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Good morning, Shannon.","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Good morning.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, Mike or maybe Sue, on the free cash flow, just remind us why it was so particularly strong in 2016. I mean the working capital performance is great. It looks like CapEx was a little bit lower. You're bringing that up. Just maybe refresh us on the dynamics of why you see that still being strong in 2017, but not quite the conversion of 2016.","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Shannon, that's a great question for us. Free cash flow was really strong in 2016 because we really focused on all of the basic fundamentals. What we wanted was we wanted our operating income to flow through to cash flow. So, we were very focused on making sure that on the accounts receivable side that our terms for our customers were balanced with our terms for our suppliers. We went after disputes. We went and talked to our customers that had past-dues. We worked with the supply base on accounts payable terms, and we also did a lot of work on our inventory processes as part of the business operating system.","So we really, really focused on getting the operating income to drop through, getting the working capital to a level that was not only good, but also sustainable. And then our spending on other items, we didn't limit anything on CapEx, to your point. We didn't do anything like that. We asked for good investments as a part of the business. So, we actually used free cash flow in a very good way in 2016 and we had a very good result.","And I think another point to give you on \u2013 not only was free cash flow excellent based on the performance of each of our businesses and the corporate folks, but it was also pretty evenly measured throughout 2016 as opposed to being a very lumpy free cash flow. So, I think everything came together for that in 2016.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Sue won't say this, but I'll say it. She did a great job and her team training the organization on something we had fun with called in the know on cash flow. We had everybody in the organization go through that with the purpose to explain that everybody in the company has got something to do with cash flow, and people got excited about its stories. We were really kind of pushing through, and I think that level of engagement is a factor, somewhere it made a big difference around people really exceeding this.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","And then, Mike, maybe on the strength in those Climate bookings, I mean up 10% organic, it looks like you're gaining share in a lot of new product investments. When you look across either the product type as applied, unitary, or the regions, any particular area that you feel you're particularly well positioned in terms of share gain?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Shannon, it was amazing in that it was across the globe, and it was across unitary, applied, controls and service. So I mean, it was just across the board. We didn't have a single pocket of weakness really anywhere in the world which is reassuring to us, and that's a broad-based approach. And that I think gave us confidence around the guide we gave for the year around pretty good growth continuing into 2017.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, thanks. Good morning, guys. Great detail by the way, appreciate all the extra color in the slides. So, I just wanted to come back to Shannon's question on the outgrowth. It does feel like you're gaining share pretty much across the board, so a question that comes up a lot is, how sustainable is that dynamic. And maybe if you just touch on what do you think is driving that outgrowth in particularly within commercial HVAC? And then, equally it does feel like you're lagging your big competitor in compression. Maybe just touch on that as well, Mike.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah, first I would say, Nigel, that you have to go back and realize that it's been investments sustained over time and product launches have been occurring at a high rate for some time. I think we've got the best channel in the world in terms of the people out there that are systems experts, capable of bringing stuff to the market. And we've got the largest that we know of field service force in the world around HVA systems, over 4,500 people out delivering that are employees of the company.","And you combine that all together with investments in digital, and I feel like it's been not a flash in the pan around something happening in the fourth quarter. It's been good for a long time. And it's up to us to continue to innovate and to continue invest in the channel. Half the investments or more that we're making in 2017, again go back into the channel itself, not just into product.","When you look at a compression technologies, similar investments happening there and we're seeing good growth on the service side. You had asked reference to Copco. You have to look at Copco, when there's a 5 point swing just in currency, Copco would have shown a 3 point gain. We show a 2 point headwind in currency, 5 point in net. When we back out and look at the organic growth, I think they were minus 5, we were minus 4. There's always subtleties in the business, but look, we're all I think in the compressor business looking forward to brighter days. I don't think there's a read through when you do the side-by-side math between Copco and us around a difference in performance.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That was really helpful. And then on the capital allocation, the $1.5 billion of the target, what does that mean? Does that mean that there's ambition to deploy that amount, but if there's an opportunity, you won't? And how do you think about that toggle between M&A and share buybacks? And this time next year, if you haven't deployed that capital, why would that be?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah. I think you had it right in your note this morning, Nigel. $1.5 billion is what we're saying we're targeting to deploy in 2017, and $250 million of that, we've already said look, that's going to control any kind of dilution in share count. Leaves $1.25 billion left, and we're going to be really smart about how to deploy that. So very patient, very selective around the M&A front. And we're going to be patient around share repurchase. But between the two, we expect to deploy $1.25 billion and we're just going to update you as you go through the year. It's difficult to forecast that on an EPS basis, because certainly on share count, it matters when and where you buy shares during the year as they're averaged back in. And M&A clearly on a GAAP basis, EPS accretion is difficult to see in a partial year, maybe even within the first full year. So it's difficult to forecast that. It's dependent on the actual target.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Hey, guys. Good morning.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Good morning, Steve.","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Good morning.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just a follow-up to Shannon's question on free cash flow. I mean, you talked about how you kind of focused this year on all these moving parts. I guess, is 2017, was there some pull forward into 2016? 2017 is down. I wouldn't have expected it to be down that much. You've talked about the conversion rate as being sustainable and obviously above 100% is good, but just down year over year by the magnitude. Just curious if there is anything unusual about that 2016 performance?","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","No. There was really nothing that was unusual about the 2016 performance, Steve. What I did as I looked at 2017 is I did a couple of things. One, on working capital, I was really allowing working capital to go back up to around the 4% level, and I'll tell you why. As our markets are a little bit lumpy, choppy, some of them recovering, I want to make sure that our businesses have the option to have inventory on hand so that not only can we meet customer requirements, but that we can meet on-time delivery requirements. So, I'm giving us room for a little more working capital and really I'm primarily talking about inventory in terms of 2017.","The other part of that is our capital expenditures are actually going up a bit year over year. I gave you a guide of $250 million. And really the majority of the increase in the CapEx year over year is really in our factories, in productivity producing projects and things like primarily precision machining and in the factory. So, I gave a little room for all of that and that really takes it down to the $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion level.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That make some sense. And then the restructuring you guys are doing, it's a bit of a step up. Just curious as to why you're stepping that up now given the strong kind of volume picture on orders. Where specifically is that going?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Steve, so fundamentally on that, we're really going to discuss sort of where that's going as we deploy it because we want to make sure that we're in front of that internally versus speaking to it externally. But in a lot of the cases where we've been sort of on the fence with doing some things, we've found opportunities within those business cases. Examples might be where real estate values would have changed on the underlying idea and so there might be an opportunity to consolidate a footprint that we didn't have in the past. So there's a fair bit of that going on as well. So we've got sort of ideas around that $50 million and we're going to update you as we go, but it's a good placeholder for now. And you know what, Steve?","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And the payback on that? And the payback on that?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah so, yeah well on the $50 million, we'll probably see $10 million in 2017 and then we'll go to something more full run rate, probably $20 million in 2018 on that $50 million.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then one last question, just on the first quarter, maybe my clients are going to hate me because they don't want guidance anymore, but I think it's good to at least have a nice framework out there. Normal seasonality, at least how we calculate it, that gets me into the kind of the low to mid 50s from an EPS perspective. Is that too far off?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","From a seasonality perspective, Steve, we went back over five years and we're pretty much now I think dialing in. So first quarter usually is kind of 10% to 12% of the EPS for the year, and then we're kind of a front half\/back half, 45%, 55% sort of company. You shouldn't get too far off with that sort of math going. Steve, before you're cut off too, I want to thank for spending as much time as you did at the ASHRAE show with our team. They really appreciated you stopping and spending time with them.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. I love HVAC. You know that.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","We do too.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie, Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good morning, guys.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Good morning.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","First, so I guess my first question is that maybe just touch a little bit on price\/cost, clearly a little bit of a headwind in 4Q. And talk a little bit about what kind of pricing you think you can get through across your portfolio in 2017, and to the extent that you can talk about cadence, that would be helpful as well.","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Sure, Joe, let me start out and give you some basic parameters around this. So we knew going into Q4 that we were going to be in an inflationary environment for steel. Pricing did not offset the inflation in the fourth quarter, so we were down 40 basis points as you saw on the slides and heard from our commentary. As we look at 2017, we've got that currently pegged at price over material inflation at about 10 basis points. Really working towards trying to get back to our norm of 20 to 30 basis points.","But let me talk a little about what's happening in 2017. So if you think about what drives the material inflation, it's really all around steel, the nonferrous, so the copper and the aluminum. First of all, we're locked about 68% on copper going into 2017, but those should be relatively flat, so neither inflationary or deflationary as we see it right now.","Steel has two components to it, one of which is just the raw commodity that's there. And then an even bigger part of that is actually the Tier 2 materials that contain steel that become inflationary. And one of the questions that I ask our group and wanted to pass on as we think about that is, my question was can we just really negotiate with the supply base. And part of this is really on how we've done contracts and written in escalation clauses. So long story short, steel and components that contains steel are going to be inflationary in 2017. And like I say, we'll continue to work price as we go throughout the organization.","Now, when you think about price and you think about different areas, we've been successful at getting price in both of our segments in 2016. And I think we'll get price in both segments in 2017. Asia is going to be tough. That one's an interesting market. Some of the others, again price is not for us just a catalog and a price on a particular item. We're baking price into every engineered to order type of project as we go along. So again, pricing is going to be a work in progress. I think there is going to be a little pressure on that as we go into 2017, but inflation comes from steel.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","And Joe, recognizing you've been with us now a couple of years, but if you go back all the way to 2010, I know personally even late 2009, we put in place and have been adapting and in training to all the methods and tools for pricing and systems around the company. So there is a lot of rigor in the operating system around that. A lot of reporting and remediation around that, mitigation around that. So on a topic like this, you'd have to go back to a seven year record of every year, being able to deliver on that. I don't suggest that it's going to change in 2017. So it's a little bit here on the benefit of the doubt associated with the tools and the methods of training that we've done over the years.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","No, that's helpful, both you guys. I guess maybe my one follow-up, maybe just switching gears to like Thermo for a second. Orders turned positive this quarter. I know that you're calling for North America truck\/trailer to be down low teens in 2017. Your largest competitor, who we just saw at the same conference, I think is forecasting down mid single digits. Is there any reason why there would be either a lag or a change in the trajectory that either of you see for 2017?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Well, there are two factors that always play here, one is around which set of customers are buying and which are not, and you will see anomalies quarter-to-quarter about kind of who came to the table. So in the fourth quarter, certainly our customers came to the table and placed orders, which is great.","The second really piece of this thing is that it's awfully early to call ACT, (48:08) saying 43,000 units. We've got about 40,000. If you went right back to ACT (48:15), now you are sort of in that range that our competitor would have outlined for you. We tend to think historically, with the exception of last year, that they've kind of met in the middle somewhere. So, we're a little bit more conservative around a 40,000 unit ACT (48:28) number versus 43,000, and that's probably explaining the difference in how we're seeing the market.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's fair enough. Thanks guys.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, good morning guys.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Good morning, Andrew.","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Good morning.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a question about the fourth quarter reinvestment on security and IT. A, could you just talk a little bit more about it? And second, I'm just really curious, what was the timing of the decision to make this reinvestment? And what I am trying to understand, we're starting to get a sense that companies are getting more comfortable with growth and actually for the first time in several years are choosing to put money into the businesses again. And I was just trying to understand if that's what's happening at Ingersoll-Rand or if there was something else.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah. One of the things, Andrew, when it comes to infrastructure and cyber security, which are often related, I think once you have the idea that you need to do something or want to do something, I think that common thinking would be that sooner is typically better than later. If you think that you've got something you want to plug, that's generally sort of the thought process, the management decision to do that.","It's also why frankly you should also always understand, we're trying to do the right things for the long run, not for the quarter. So that in and of itself may not have been the difference. I mean, it was more the other discrete items that are difficult, but not impossible, to forecast, stock-based comp, incentive comp certainly fit that, tax by legal entity as opposed to tax by geography or business unit is more nuanced. But that's one where generally speaking, if you need to spend it, sooner is typically better than later. And that's been our approach.","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","And I would add just a little bit to that, Andrew, in terms of if you look at the full year of 2016, we started out the year, and we obviously talk pretty regularly to all of the teams around the company. And we really said, don't let our costs get out ahead of what the revenue profile is. So if you looked at corporate costs for really the first three quarters of 2016, you would see that our run rate was actually under what would be typical for a $240 million year. That doesn't mean that because you're under, you should go out and do some things.","But it also adds to part of the thinking, when you get to an area where you have some items that you need to spend money on, you go forward and say for the year, our costs, whether it's in IT, whether it's in legal, HR, finance, whatever part of our functional spending are actually flat from 2015 to 2016 and actually will be flat into 2017. So, there's also a little bit of a timing element that is a part of that too. Doesn't explain the difference in the guidance, but I also wanted to give you some context of what we were thinking as we went into the fourth quarter.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","And just to be clear in what Sue said, so 2015, 2016 and 2017, the core functional costs have been absolutely flat, which has been our objective, what we're driving to. All the swing you see are in things like stock-based comp, pensions, adjustments that are really happening sort of around those core functional costs.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got you. The other thing, you made a specific commentary about seasonality on industrial in 2017. And you did call it out, and so what's different versus history on this quarterly variability in the industrial business?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Andrew, the only comparison I think we made was comparing Q4 2016 to Q4 2015, because Q4 2015 had that mammoth load of Cameron shipments, which drove the difficult comp for quarter four. Not a lot of seasonality in industrial beyond that, that we would call out, with the exception that for some reason with large compressors, the kind that are put into gas and energy applications, have tended to been more fourth quarter loaded. But I'm not sure that that's an actual seasonal phenomenon as opposed to sort of when we're booking and shipping orders.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So just to correct, I guess I misunderstood. So, there is nothing different about industrial seasonality in 2017?","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","No, Andrew. I think the comment that we were actually making, and perhaps we didn't make it as well as we thought, was that what we didn't want anyone to do was to take and draw a straight line on margin improvement each and every quarter in the industrial business. We were saying that it could be a little bit lumpy from quarter to quarter, and would follow its typical pattern. So we just didn't want anybody to get concerned if there was some variation there. So, it was a pretty simple comment that might have been confusing.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Terrific. Thank you so much.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC. Your line is now open.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the residential bookings at up low teens, maybe some color regarding the product, the mix, where the SEER preferences look to be in 2017 and was there any pre-buy involved.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","No pre-buy involved, but yeah, I think you know that the res product is fundamentally 100% new over the past three years. We've got just a few little things we're tweaking. And we've found that as the mix has moved to 14 SEER and above, this is playing really well in our dealer base. So I think this is just going back to the commercial discussion. It's been long-term investment and getting the product portfolio right, long-term investment on repositioning our dealer base to be able to sell low, medium and high price point product, penetration into the residential construction market, penetration into the owner occupied but non-resident market which is another market that we've had some good success with. So again, just good hard product development, channel development and sticking to a strategy here over the long run.","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","And I think, Deane, from you asked the question on SEER. So as we went through 2016, the 14, the 13 and 14 SEER kind of combined for roughly about 50% of our revenues, and then the 15 SEER and greater was a smaller percent. So really, what you saw was the 13 SEER go into the 14 SEER product and the 15 SEER and above sort of stay the same.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And then just as a follow-up, there was an interesting development recently with your primary competitor in golf carts, investing in Arctic Cat. So does that change your thinking in any way of how you want to be positioned? You did mention the new product launch of Onward. I went online just now and took a look at. Those just look pretty cool rims for a golf cart, but looks like it's an organic focus for you all with Club Cart. But maybe some comments there.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah, it looks better with the lift kit too, Deane, so look at that picture. That's what you need is big wheels and a lift kit. That's what I'm going to get. Anyway, yeah, no, it's an organic focus, because we think the brand's got legs. We think that we've always focused on consumer on golf and utility, and it's a real concerted effort to penetrate the consumer low-speed vehicle market and personal vehicle market, not \u2013 this is golf and car communities, small vehicle communities, this is hospitality and recreation venues. This isn't 65 miles an hour running through rough country.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Your line is now open.","Seth Girsky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning, guys. This is Seth Girsky on for Andy.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Hey, Seth.","Seth Girsky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Last quarter you talked about expecting Asia HVAC market to be flat to down in 2017 and 3Q bookings were flat, but bookings in Asia HVAC were high teens this quarter. So can you talk about what your expectations are for Asia HVAC in 2017?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Well, it was a really great fourth quarter. I think that you're going to see sort of a more moderate view toward Asia, kind of mid single digit in Asia for the full year. So it just happened to be the opportunity to book a tremendous amount of orders with a small group of customers that are buying large, and it's going to be lumpy. But I still think it's going to be a cycle and you're going to see sort of mid single digit at the end of the day.","Seth Girsky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. That makes sense. And then in the Industrial segment, material handlings seems to still be under pressure. But can you talk about your visibility to bottoming in the material handling market as oil prices continue to recover?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah. It has to do with really the count of offshore rigs increasing. That's probably the biggest determinant. Land rigs have an effect, but the content that we provide in the land rig versus an offshore rig are going to be dramatically different. So, I'm pleased to see really utilization of offshore rigs. You're not going to see a full recovery in that business. Incredible margins, fantastic business, that's why it hurts when it's actually down. You really have a dramatic effect on the margins for the segment. Frankly, it's about 1 point in the fourth quarter, so small business, big impact. We love it when it's up; it hurts when it's down.","Seth Girsky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks for fitting me in, appreciate it. I'm over at ASHRAE right now, and one of the things that strikes me is no matter, most people I talk to, they are seeing growth in VRF in North America on the order of 15% to 20%, depending on how you count it. I know you've talked in the past about maybe I think it's 25% of that market volume going through your channels, but one thing that's been apparent is, a lot of that is non-Trane product really and the actual Trane (59:55) content sounds pretty low. So what I have seen other folks successfully transition to their own content or their joint venture content because they own part of it, et cetera, what's your plan and strategy here? It's one of the only places you don't really own it and not vertically integrated and seems like a big opportunity.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah Steve, look, one of the things here is, we have a very definitive plan of what we're doing. I'm not going to disclose it here for strategic reasons to do that, but I'll tell you that it's a source of investment in Q4. It's a large business in Asia, and it's growing and we make and co-develop our own product there with partners. Here, our growth rates are higher than the rates you're reporting. So we're seeing higher growth rates in our unitary business and higher growth rates than what you're seeing.","Our focus really is on the VRF business, not on the mini-split business. We think that's where the value is. That's where controls matter. That's where hybrid systems come into play. It's where our channel works and where service is a possibility. So again, our focus is on VRF. You've seen Trane branded product there in the US. Mini-splits, we're a bit more agnostic to that. We serve the market. We're not as caught up in whether that says Trane or Trane and somebody else or somebody else going through our market.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And also on back to the cash flow discussion for 2017. So at the midpoint, it looks like that 100% conversion, Sue, you talked about 4% working capital target. But Mike, I think it's a decade now almost that we've been talking about lean conversion and much, much better inventory and other management. So maybe a little flavor here on why couldn't you keep it at a lower inventory level to still meet channel demand. Or is it just the shift in inventory from raws and work-in-process to finish goods? What's going on there?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah. I think that whether its 3.6% or 4%, and whether the inventory turns are 6.8 or 6.9 really isn't what we're trying to do. What we're trying to do is get 100% on-time customer shipment at cycle times that competitors can't deal with and pick up all the discretionary business that's out there to get. And we want a balance between the two, and so long as we're growing margins and growing share, we feel like it's a good formula. So the place to put the gas down isn't on creating a problem where you're inadvertently creating a situation where you're not competing in the area that you want to compete.","So Steve, you know us as well as anybody that really that cycle time conversion and that compression in cycle time is worth something, not just on working capital, but on growth and operating margins. And so that's always been our focus. And so whether it's 3.6% or 4%, it's not as important to us. It's we know it's already, if not the best, it's certainly top quartile working capital, top quartile inventory turns and our return on invested capital last year was almost 24% for the company.","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Cash flow.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Cash flow return on invested capital was 24%. I mean, so let's grow the company and let's grow margins.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yes, no, that's great. I just wanted to make sure that you've had tremendous traction in this area, I just want to see that the pedal is still pushed down, that's all.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","It will never let up. I promise you, as long as I'm breathing, it will never let up.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Excellent.

Good morning and thank you for joining us on today's call. Before we dive in on the fourth quarter results, I'd like to take a couple of minutes to put the full year 2011 in context and Steve will take you through the quarterly results and finally I'll discuss our guidance for 2012. In 2011, we experienced a challenging economic backdrop in some of our key markets, remindful of the performance challenges we faced in the residential business, hindered our ability to reach our original earnings goal for the year. Notwithstanding significant hurdles some from the market and some within our businesses that we have corrected, we are pleased with the progress we made this past year in several important areas.","In 2012, despite a significant decline of revenues and profits at Residential and slightly lower volumes at commercial security and we achieved a revenue increase of over 8% including double-digit revenue growth at Industrial, Thermo King, and Trane commercial HVAC equipment. We also recorded significant growth overseas, helping us to offset weakness in non-residential and residential construction activity in North America. Our strategy to focus on innovation continued to deliver with the percentage of revenue from innovation jumping from 13% in 2008 to 23% in 2011.","Productivity gains combined with positive impacts from our pricing strategy have led to improved operating margins, which were up 1.3 percentage points. That includes significant progress in the operating margins of the Climate and Industrial segments, both up over two percentage points. Essential component of that margin improvement is our focus on steadily improving operational excellence. To this end in 2011, we continue to enhance quality and reduce our manufacturing footprint, the number of suppliers, cycle times and functional costs. Productivity savings added about $400 million to operating income, despite almost no contribution from our Residential business. Full year earnings per share of continuing operations were up 19% to $2.82.","We are also making good progress in restoring the health of our balance sheet and generated $944 million of available cash flow. We are shaping our portfolio of businesses for improved growth and value creation with our action in Hussmann is an example of those. A solid balance sheet and cash flow supported our buyback and dividend programs. We initiated share repurchases in June 2011, purchasing 36 million shares by year-end. We increased our dividend by another 33%, following a 71% raise earlier in the year.","Please go to slide 4. Excluding Hussmann, we saw 130 basis points of operating margin improvement in the year. As we can see, both Climate and Industrial expanded margins by over 200 basis points. We made substantial progress there, particularly in price cost and volume conversion. Residential was a significant drag to our performance with margins down almost 600 basis points on lower volume, poor mix and operational inefficiencies, some self-inflicted, which are now fixed. We've executed the program we laid out in mid 2011 for Residential according to plan, where we entered the market with an R-22 product in August. Get well action for the product launches have proceed on schedule and we have met cost targets. In the fourth quarter, we took 410A inventory levels down by almost $90 million, $10 million more than our original target and had opened 2012 with levels more aligned to the market. And finally commercial security essentially held margins and flat physical volumes.","Please go to slide five. We have steadily improved the flow of new products and services to the market and innovations across all sectors and regions. About 13% of our 2008 revenues were generated from products and services introduced in the last three years. Our initial target for 2011 was 20% of revenues, which we\u2019ve exceeded ending the year at 23% of revenues and our goal for 2012 was 25%. So innovation will continue to be an important product of our strategy going forward.","Please go to slide six. In 2011, we advanced our operational excellence initiative which is our long-term approach to a lean transformation in the company. This is a multi-pronged effort to reduce working capital, expand margins and ultimately increase market share across our businesses. We continue to restructure and decrease the size of our manufacturing footprint in 2011. Since 2009, we have reduced number of facilities 94 to 72. Direct material makes up about 40% of our cost base and it continue to make progress in our direct material cost reduction programs.","In November, we centralized the management of spend and consolidation of our vendor base to better leverage our strategic sourcing capabilities. We\u2019re also reducing costs and improving quality through value engineering activities in all of our businesses with regionally based teams from engineering and strategic sourcing. Since starting our lean transformation we have seen a separation in the performance of the initial 19 value streams versus the company average. The 19 value streams in 2011 have achieved a 35% reduction on average in cycle time and increase on average of 2.5 percentage points of margin and a 19 point improvement in employee engagement scores.","As we\u2019ve discussed over the next three to four years we will be systematically reducing our functional costs to move toward top quartile metrics of approximately 3% of revenues. The program entails many aspects, a key enabler as the implementation of common systems and processes across the enterprise, including common ERP platforms. That project is fully underway in the first way of the implementation will be in early 2013 and this will continue through s2015.","And now I\u2019ll turn over it to Steve to take you through the quarter.","Steve Shawley \u2013 Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","","Thanks Mike. Please go to slide number seven, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $0.76. During the quarter and we were able to more than offset the costs associated with the acceleration of the key factory consolidation in China and the absorption impact from the greater than planned inventory reduction and residential HVAC for a favorable tax rate. In the fourth quarter, we saw revenue growth of 1% excluding the Hussmann refrigeration business that we sold during 2011. We experienced a moderation in revenues in several businesses.","Most notable was a double-digit decline in residential HVAC revenues against a tough comparison as tax credits and buying in advance of announced 2011 price increases boosted volumes in the fourth quarter of 2010. Revenues were up 1%, 2% excluding FX with single digit increases in Climate and Industrial, a single digit decrease at Security and Residential down double digits. Excluding Hussmann, orders as reported were down 2% and 1% excluding currency.","Operating margin for the quarter was 9.5%, up 100 basis points. If we exclude Hussmann from both years, margin in the fourth quarter was slightly higher at 9.6% and up 70 basis points from fourth quarter of 2010. Although margins improved from pricing and productivity they were depressed by a year-over-year decline in revenues, adverse mix, and unabsorbed cost in Residential HVAC. We significantly reduced production levels in the fourth quarter in order to reduce 410A inventory levels, which we\u2019re taking down by about $90 million during the quarter. All of our businesses continuing to realize positive pricing and in the fourth quarter our pricing outpaced direct material inflation for the third consecutive quarter.","Please go to slide number 8. Orders for the fourth quarter of 2011 were down 2% overall and 1% excluding currency. During the quarter, we saw moderating bookings in Industrial, Air and productivity and in commercial HVAC. In commercial HVAC we are up against a tough comparison as fourth quarter 2010 equipment orders were up over 20% partially due to customers placing orders before the effective date of announced price increases. Additionally fourth quarter book and ship orders in the Industrial segment were negatively impacted as we accelerated the consolidation of two facilities in China. This action suppressed the Industrial orders improvements by four to five percentage points during the quarter.","Transport demand was strong in North America and in container. Our European truck trailer was down slightly. Global Security orders in the quarter were down 5%, North American Security orders were up slightly and international Security orders were down low double-digits mainly due to the lumpy order patterns in Asia. Residential orders were down 18% year-over-year impacted by a stagnant U.S. housing market and lack of consumer demand for the 410A replacement systems. The decline was compounded by higher than normal volumes in the fourth quarter of 2010 from expiring tax credits and buying in advance of announced 2011 price increases.","Please go to slide number nine. Here is a look at the revenue trends by segment. We think revenues excluding currency as shown on the bottom of the chart give a better view of our organic growth. Note that the Climate in total company data for the fourth quarter and full year excludes Hussmann from the comparisons. Fourth quarter revenues were up 2% excluding currency, fairly similar to the 3% growth we achieved in the third quarter. Industrial had strong but slightly moderating growth that 8%, again partially constrained by that factory move. Climate revenues increased 5% on top of the very strong fourth quarter 2010. Residential was down 13% against the high revenue level last year driven by the exploration of the tax credits. Commercial Security revenues were down 3%. On a geographic basis revenues were flat in the U.S. and up 2% in the international markets. ","Please go to slide number 10. This chart walks a change in operating margin from fourth quarter 2010 of 8.9% to fourth quarter 2011, which was 9.6%. These data excludes Hussmann for comparison purposes. Volume mix and foreign exchange were at 1.6 percentage point headwind to margins. This was mainly attributable to lower margin residential HVAC mix. Last year's fourth quarter had a higher proportion of high-efficiency units due to the $1,500 tax credit, which expired at the end of 2010. There was also some impact from lower volumes from the high margin Security sector. Our pricing programs continue to outpace material inflation adding 190 basis points to margin. Productivity offset by other inflation added another percentage point. And year-over-year investments were higher which impacted margins by 50 basis points.","Please go to slide number 11. This bridge analyzes fourth quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $0.76 versus our October guidance which was $0.64 to $0.70 or the midpoint of $0.67. Our revenue guidance for the quarter at a midpoint of $3.575 billion versus our actuarial $3.507 billion, a difference of $68 million. There was one structural change since we issued guidance. On December 30th, we divested our North American security integration business. Results of that business have been move to discontinued operations for all of 2011 and in all prior periods.","Fourth quarter 2011 revenue for that business of about $20 million with no OI was included in the guidance but is now in disc ops. The factory consolidation in China impacted about $30 million of revenue and is part of the $0.04 shown on the line below the volume and mix line. This leaves about $18 million in lower sales volume across mainly Residential and Security or about $0.01 of earnings. The combination of foregone revenue and incurred cost for the China factory consolidation and the inventory take down at Residential accounted for $0.04.","The favorable tax rate in the quarter was driven by three factors, one a favorable geographic distribution of operating income, two a discrete FIN 48 adjustment due to the final settlement of an open issue, and three a positive impact from the annual revaluation of our loss carry forward positions. This revaluation work is performed every year and also had a positive impact in the fourth quarter last year. In fact, the only real difference in the tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2011 and that of 2010 is the discrete settlement item I mentioned earlier. Share count was favorable adding $0.02 due to the timing of repurchases during the quarter.","Please go to slide 12. Climate Solutions segment includes Trane, commercial HVAC and Thermo King transport refrigeration. Total revenues for the fourth quarter excluding Hussmann for comparability of $1.9 billion were up 4% and 5% excluding currency. Global commercial HVAC orders were down 3% with global equipment orders down mid-single digits due to unusually high orders in the fourth quarter of last year as customers placed orders in advance of the effective dates for announced price increases.","Global commercial HVAC equipment orders were up over 20% in the fourth quarter of last year. Trane's global commercial HVAC fourth quarter revenues were up 1% versus a very strong fourth quarter last year particularly in HVAC equipment. HVAC revenues in North America were down slightly. Revenues in other regions were up mid single digits. Global commercial equipment revenues increased 1% against a tough comparison. The equipment revenues in the fourth quarter of last year were up over 15%. Global part services and solutions revenue was flat to prior year with a decrease in contracting offset by an increase in parts and services.","For the global Thermo King transport business, revenues increased mid-teens. Our worldwide refrigerated, truck and trailer revenues were also up mid-teens with strength in North America and some moderation in Europe. Global APU, marine container and aftermarket revenues showed strong growth in the quarter. Thermo King orders were up approximately 20% in the fourth quarter, with increases in all regions. The operating margin for Climate Solutions was 10.2% in the quarter, a 270 basis point improvement versus fourth quarter 2010, driven by pricing, volume gains, and productivity partially offset by inflation.","Please go to slide number 13. Industrial Technologies fourth quarter revenues were $744 million, up 8% on a reported basis and excluding FX. Air and Productivity revenues increased 7% versus last year. Air and Productivity orders were up 5% with demand moderating in all regions. Revenue and orders in Asia were negatively impacted by the facility consolidation decision that I mentioned earlier, which had as much as a 4 to 5 percentage point impact on total ITS revenue and bookings for the quarter. Club Car revenues in the quarter were up 9% and orders were flat. Industrials operating margin of 15.3% was up 2.2 percentage points compared with last year from higher revenues, pricing and productivity partially offset by inflation.","Please go to slide number 14. In Residential business, fourth quarter revenues of $443 million were down 13% compared with last year on both the reported basis and excluding foreign exchange. Bookings were down 18%. Our residential HVAC revenues were down 21% as a continued sluggish housing market depressed the market for HVAC systems. Additionally, the fourth quarter of 2010 was unusually strong; revenues were up 20% due to the timing of pricing announcements and the expiration of tax credits for higher efficiencies units at the end of 2010.","Industry unit shipments in the fourth quarter were down 15% from last year. During the quarter we significantly reduced HVAC inventory levels taking out approximately $90 million of inventory to better manage demand going into 2012. Revenues for the residential security portion of the sector were up high teens with increases in the new builder channel and in the big box customer volumes. Sector operating margin of negative 1.2% was down 10.6 percentage points compared with 2010. Improved pricing was more than offset by lower volume, adverse mix, the impact of significantly decreased production and inflation.","Please go to slide number 15. Revenues for Security Technologies were $415 million, down 3% and also down 3% excluding currency. Americas' revenues were down slightly and overseas revenues were down mid single-digits. Global bookings were down 5%. Americas was up slightly. Overseas orders were impacted by lower orders in Asia due to the timing of booking on large projects. Operating margin for the quarter was 19.1%, up 20 basis points from last year as productivity and price realization were partially offset by volume and material inflation. On December 30th, we divested our North American security integration business. The results of that business have been move to discontinuing operations for all of 2011 and all prior periods. Full year 2011 revenue was $72 million and the business had an after tax operating loss for the full year of $1 million. Disposition resulted in an after tax loss on sale of $5 million, also recorded in discontinued operations.","Let\u2019s go to slide 16, let\u2019s move to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains in good shape and in the quarter we continued buying shares under our share repurchase program. We ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of cash on the balance sheet and net debt of $2.5 billion. We purchased 19 million shares in the quarter and 36 million shares during 2011. We generated $944 million of available cash flow in 2011.","Let\u2019s go to slide 17, we finished the fourth quarter with working capital of 1.6% of revenues, which we believe is a record for the company. We achieved this through excellent performance across the board. During 2011, we decreased day sales outstanding more than one day and increased inventory turns by 10 basis points. Inventories decreased by over $100 million in the fourth quarter, with the majority of that reduction coming from residential.","With that, I will turn it back to Mike to take you through the forecast.","Mike Lamach \u2013 Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thanks, Steve. And with that, let\u2019s go to slide 18. Our revenue outlook for 2012 is based on various levels of activity in our key end markets. We believe activity levels indicate moderating growth in Industrial markets. We expect North American commercial HVAC equipment market driven mainly by replacement to grow at a slower pace. We continue to see solid growth in Asia and Latin America and a slight decline in Europe. We expect moderate growth in transport markets in North America with some contraction in Europe.","We think continuation of the current conditions in residential markets as single-family housing starts and consumer confidence remain at low levels. We expect of R-22 and lower SEER units to remain at significant portion of the flattish market in 2012. For commercial security we expect to see a continuation of challenging conditions in the U.S. non-residential and new construction market for the next year, particularly in our key institutional markets.","Foreign exchange will be a headwind in 2012 adversely impacting revenue growth by about two points. Based on the strict backdrop, our revenue target for the full year 2012 is $14 billion to $14.4 billion, flat up 3% compared with 2011 revenues, up $14 billion excluding Hussmann. Excluding FX the organic growth rate is 2% to 5%. Climate Solutions top line is expected to be up 1% to 4%, excluding Hussmann. Excluding foreign exchange they will be up 3% to 6%. We expect Industrials to show revenue gains of 2% to 4%, which include the three point drag from FX. Based on the continuation of the current market conditions, we expect Residential Solutions revenues to be flat to up 2%. Commercial Security is expected to show revenues flat to 3% down versus 2011. Adjusting for foreign exchange, Security\u2019s organic growth will be in a range of down 1% to up 2%.","Please go to slide 19. Let's turn now to full year earnings. He are some moving pieces in EPS, let me take a few minutes to walk you through the mechanics and the outlook. After removing Hussmann from the 2011 base, the starting point is $2.68 of EPS. Assuming organic growth, excluding currency of 2% to 5%, unless continued good but somewhat moderating pricing along with productivity savings by netting out inflation, operations will contribute $0.60 to $0.80 of higher earnings. At the midpoint, that\u2019s about a 60% conversion and a fairly modest revenue increase. Foreign exchange will be a drag of $0.12.","The results of our share repurchases our lower average share count of $315 million in 2012 versus the 2011 average of $339 million shares adds $0.22. The estimated tax rate will be 25% in 2012 a direct tax $0.12 of earnings. Incremental investments and cost reductions and restructuring along with some growth investments net of $0.30. And we have some part of one-timers in 2011 that we don\u2019t expect to recur which total $0.06 and that brings us to a range of $2.90 to $3.10 per share. We expect to generate available cash flow of about $1.1 billion.","Please go to slide 20. Our first quarter EPS will be lower than prior year due to the timing of restructuring and cost reduction investments. Additionally revenue will be lower than 2011 as we run up against some hard comparisons particularly in Residential. Recall the first quarter 2011, residential sales were up 10%. We have significant amount of channel restocking in HVACs following the surge in the fourth quarter 2010 from expiring tax credits. We expect commercial HVAC volumes to start the year slightly down from very strong first quarter of 2011 and to improve on a comparable basis through the year.","Transport will be slightly down in the first quarter based on the opening backlog. First quarter revenues are forecasted to be $2.975 billion to $3.075 billion. Revenue on a comparable basis excluding Hussmann are forecasted down 3% to up slightly versus the first quarter of 2011. That includes FX, which will be a headwind of about one point. That means excluding foreign exchange revenues down 2% to up 1%. Together, pricing, volume, mix, productivity net of inflation will add $0.03 to $0.09 of earnings.","FX negatively impacts earnings by $0.03. Given our revenue outlook, we have launched several cost reduction programs, including further restructuring that are frontend loaded in the year \u2013 no, they are from payback in the year. That along with some modest growth investments will have an adverse impact in the first quarter of $0.16. Restructured cost for the remainder of the year will be about flat with 2011. Share count and other items that's about a penny positive bringing us to a range of $0.20 to $0.26 per share.","Please go to slide 21. We clearly have higher long-term aspirations for the company as economic conditions improve. We know this will take time in some key markets, but we are intent and not waiting for a rising economic tide to raise the company. We're focused on continued change and improvement to ensure that we are managing our business optimally across the spectrum of economic conditions. Our focus for next year ahead, is on positioning Ingersoll-Rand to continue growing revenues, earnings and cash flow overall by employing tailored strategies across diverse markets.","As we look at both 2012 and beyond, we feel good about our company including our portfolio of outstanding market leading brands, our ability to generate high levels of cash flow even in the face of a challenging backdrop, the longer-term attractiveness of end markets in which we operate and our competitive positioning which will allow us to benefit as those sectors of the economy improve and a strong penetration and positioning in emerging markets with significant growth potential. We realized that we can't rely solely on these fundamentals to achieve our goals and our management team is committed to actively managing the company's businesses to generate sustainable profitable growth.","Again, we're not waiting for macroeconomic lift to improve our business; instead we're proactively working to reduce costs and invest in our growth markets. Steve and I have one of the best leadership team, and we look forward to talking with you in more detail about our company at our Investor Meeting on March 13th and 14th here in Davidson.","Now Steve and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","Hey good morning.","Mike Lamach","Hi Steve.","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","The question on the resi business, so you talked about I guess flat, similar product mix, but I guess you are ramping up R22 product and then I guess what does that mean for margins? How do we think about resi margins given that you had, I guess you called it, $50 million bucks plus of kind of unusual headwind this year? So how do we think about the margin in resi?","Mike Lamach","First of all just given the market, we think that the market will be relatively flat in terms of total motor bearing units. We think that we'll actually see probably a 4% increase which is a fairly modest share gain there and totals about 50 basis points, really just by being in the market for the full year. So, it would equate to something like 40,000 to 50,000 units that weren't in the market last year, it will be in the market this year, and obviously that put some pressure on margins there because that growth will come at a lower incremental margin. So, we look at that business overall is growing in the year flat to 2% and margins there probably grown about 200 basis points. So, getting back on the miscues in 2011, certainly picking up the volume in the R22 business but at a lower incremental.","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","What was the 4% number you just mentioned so if the market is flat and you\u2019re gaining share, are you \u2013 does that mean the Security business is down that offsets that?","Mike Lamach","No, it\u2019s only HVAC. So, some of the market for motor bearing units would be flat. We think that we\u2019ll actually be up about 4% driven by the unitary business.","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","Right.","Mike Lamach","Which is about a 50% market share gain for us, it\u2019s solely though as a result of actually being in the market with the product for a full year.","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","","So, then why are resi revenues flat to up 2%, if you\u2019re growing resi HVAC 4%, does that mean the resi Security business is flat or down?","Mike Lamach","No, we look at furnace, we look at air-handler, and we look at\u2026","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. Got you.","Mike Lamach","Yeah sure.","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","","Okay. And just as a follow-up. If that business is up 200 basis points, what\u2019s the total company kind of margin improvement target you\u2019re looking for in 2012 and then I guess that I would assume that it\u2019s not 200 basis points in some of the other businesses or kind of more moderate margin increases?","Mike Lamach","Yeah, Steve at the midpoint of the range ex-Hussmann it\u2019s about 50 basis points.","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","","So then the rest of the businesses are really showing kind of like in line with that to little bit late of the 50 basis points?","Mike Lamach","Yeah Climate, you might be looking at 30 to 50 basis points, Industrial probably still little bit stronger there, 110 and 130 basis points. res, we talked about and Security you could think about being fairly flat.","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","","Great. Thanks for the detail. I appreciate it.","Operator","","Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yeah, thanks. Steve, took all my questions there. Could you maybe talk about where you see the major upside and downside risks in your forecasts, and it looks like your resi forecast a pretty conservative, mostly your comps are forecasting low-to-mid single digit growth, and maybe compare and contract reality of the market versus your competitors?","Mike Lamach","Well. I mean, one thing Nigel, I think in particular as well looking at the same data, we interpreted probably less optimistically in Europe, particularly in our industrial businesses, we think which would be probably first to see that and we\u2019re seeing some softening there. So we\u2019ve got a view in Europe across the whole company as reported, which we include currency of course to be, say down 10% to 12% with currency. That\u2019s a bit more negative or less positive than I think you\u2019re hearing some other companies that at this point of time.","The other place where it\u2019s a bit of wildcard, but you look at North American in HVAC equipment, and we look at our number of data points here, but one that\u2019s fairly reliable for us is the dodge put in place number. And then, figuring from that the usage factors that we get from security product and HVAC product as it applies to the specific markets that are being built. So it breaks it down by particular verticals in those businesses. And that could imply a kind of a negative five, negative seven type equipment environment for next year, which again is a little bit more pessimistic than what we\u2019re seeing. But again this has been a fairly accurate indicator for us in the past. So to the extent that those don\u2019t materialize, that there is more put in place quicker that we\u2019ll earn sites faster, it could have an impact the other way for us as well.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Sorry. The downside seven, would that be for the Security business or the commercial HVAC equipment?","Mike Lamach","Both about the same, as they can\u2019t follow same markets with HVAC typically leading security. But it\u2019ll be the same outlook for both, of course, different usage factors and a different market mix based on what new construction is being built. So the institutional markets would hurt the security business more than it would hurt the HVAC business.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","So we\u2019re swinging from a high single-digit growth in equivalent to potentially down 5 in the U.S., what\u2019s changing from year-to-year?","Mike Lamach","Well, I mean, one thing if you look at fourth quarter last year and the first quarter of this year, I mean if you go back to the fourth quarter of last year as an example, we saw unitary bookings from fourth quarter up almost 40% and we saw applied bookings in the quarter up something like 28%. The unitary not all that shipped in the quarter, but obviously some of it did, but the applied all shipped in the first quarter of last year. So you see a weaker first quarter against really tough comps. So, we were way above sort of the market in the first quarter of last year for revenue, way above the market in 2010 fourth quarter for bookings. So we\u2019re lapping some very difficult comps there. But if you look again at sort of the just the proposal pipeline, you look at the orders in hand and look at the McGraw-Hill put in place and how that would relate to book in turn in the year and we get to a slightly recovering market in the year, so that for the full year equipment globally would be fairly flat. We would see I think good growth again in contracting parts and service, probably up in the 8% range and that would give us for the Climate Solutions business something closer to the full year, one to four range that we are forecasting.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, that's very helpful. And then you said down 10 throughout the Europe, I am assuming that's mid single ex-currency. What are you baking in for China and the emerging markets in 2012?","Mike Lamach","Good growth, Nigel, it might look slower, slower growth across the board. It will still be good growth for us. If you look at Asia for the Company, we are probably still seeing mid-teens for the year, I think a slower first quarter, but mid-teens for the year. Latin America still is exciting for us, again, slower start to the year, but a mid-teens rate in Latin America.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks Mike.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America.","Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America","Yes. Good morning, guys. Just a question on profitability drivers in Climate Solutions. We saw very nice pickup in profitability. I assume that a lot of it is Thermo King, which is pretty profitable, but could you just get us a sense of what is it Trane or cost savings versus Thermo King volumes, if you could give a sense for that?","Mike Lamach","Well, volume overall in the quarter didn't have a huge impact for us in terms of the profitability there. So, we had lower inflation. We had very good productivity across the board there. We still invested in the business. We've got some new product launches that we are putting out in the quarter. So really it's leveraging against some of the work that's been done over the past year or two around the cost base, around the manufacturing footprint. I would also tell you that we are seeing a nice separation in the value streams that we have been working on from the lean portfolio. We are seeing the 2.5 points of margin differential versus the average across the Company in the quarter. So, just to give you a sense there, I think it's really gaining traction in our Climate businesses. Steven if you want to add anything your point.","Steve Shawley","The other thing that happen I think in the quarter Andy was our Trane commercial services business leveraged a bit better and it was an area where we were investing a lot of money in last year. We intentionally invested new money in our Trane commercial contracting service and parts business. So, for most of the year it was actually flat and might be even partially negative leverage there and that improved in Q4 and quite frankly, we are looking forward to that piece of the business continuing to improve leverage going into 2012.","Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America","Terrific and just a question on pricing, if you look at the progression of pricing throughout the year, we exited the year at a very nice run rate, but if I look at your guidance for 2012, we only have one percentage point of pricing and looking at the numbers it seems that at least for the first three quarters, the comp should be fairly easy. So, I'm just wondering what do we, how should I be thinking about pricing progression throughout 2012? Thank you.","Mike Lamach","Yeah, so, Andrew for the first quarter, we think we'd have about 170 basis points of price. We think it will moderate through the year and we will probably end the year down a little over 1.1 as we said. We'll see lower inflation at this point lower inflation throughout the year as well. So, we'll maintain a positive spread in the first quarter versus material costs is probably about 90 basis points. And then over the course of the year it moderates the 70 or 80 basis points over the course of the year.","Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America","","Right, but how does it average out to 1% or is it \u2013 or is 1% just on approximation could be a little bit better than that?","Mike Lamach","Well, it's you're lapping pretty aggressive price increases. So, it's getting tougher as you get towards back of the year. I mean the fourth quarter pricing was pretty strong. The fourth quarter pricing was a margin about 2.7 points of price to margin, so that was fairly strong for us. I think as we get into the back half of next year, it's going to be little bit tougher.","Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America","Terrific, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Terry Darling of Goldman Sachs. ","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Actually Mike I'm wondering if you could expand a little bit on the view on Industrial segment margin expansion in 2012 110, 130 basis points on 2% to 4% organic, looks very strong there. One, have you talked about maybe the pieces there as well Club Car versus the other part, the compressor business?","Mike Lamach","Yeah, I would say that for the most we're talking about those gains coming really in the Industrial businesses, Club Car will leverage the great growth of the Industrial businesses. And again it\u2019s really going back over two or three year period where it\u2019s been a constant drum beat around new product introduction and launching better product, better cost position, higher quality, less warranty, aggressive on the consolidation including the move in China. The early restructuring really paying off, so what you saw here is that the 2009, 2010 and 2011 restructuring done there leveraging against those volumes. So any volume that I think we get there is going to leverage at a fairly substantial rate. They\u2019ve done a nice job around their footprint over those years.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","So this sounds like more company specific restructuring cost out\u2026","Mike Lamach","Yes. I mean, I don\u2019t know if you were at the Mocksville facility, but that\u2019s a great example for us. They\u2019ve actually gained in that product line three points a share and this is the KGI reported numbers. So this isn\u2019t our view, this is market view. Three points a share there and the first thing we saw was really good working capital management then we saw that was sustained, we saw margin improvement that\u2019s been sustained. And it\u2019s really turned down into much shorter cycle times and that\u2019s all related to higher share there of three points. And so they\u2019re doing a great job and I think it\u2019ll continue through 2012.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","It\u2019s great to see. And continued sluggish Gulf market, do we interpret that as kind of flattish?","Mike Lamach","Yeah. Flat may be up slightly, up a couple of points. They\u2019re working at their version of restructuring. They\u2019ve been working through some warranty issues on some battery problems that we\u2019ve had over the last couple of years with that business. I think that will get better. So we\u2019ll see good leverage there as those warranty issues disappear and they continue \u2013 they are only an implementation down in Augusta. So that\u2019s going well too.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And then maybe a little more color, Mike on the pieces within Thermo King. I think I heard you indicate you\u2019re expecting transport Europe down for the year, how much down and the how much up on the U.S. truck side, maybe would be helpful?","Mike Lamach","I\u2019ll speak that\u2019s a little bit detail here but if you net it all out, it will be flat to up low single-digits for the year. So the increase in North America offset by almost an equivalent size business in Europe down at same level. So kind of a \u2013 sort of a higher single-digit North America, a lower negative single-digit in Europe, offsetting just about a flat to low single-digit market.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","And then just lastly, I wonder if you could just clarify on share count. I think $19 million buyback, off of the $312 million would get you to $293 million on the ordinary and then the differential between ordinary and diluted looks like $13 million, which would take you $306 million versus $315 million, what am I missing there other pieces?","Mike Lamach","Yeah, we can\u2019t be ordinary about $299 million Terry. So you add back the dilutions, so it's more like $312 million for the diluted count at this point. End of year diluted count.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay and then some additional share issuance to get you to $315 million, is that the good assumption?","Steve Shawley","Yeah, it will be..","Mike Lamach","Like we\u2019ll go on here as we\u2019ll pick up a few shares because the share price is popped up a little bit, remember to converts, so we pick up a few shares there on the dilute count and also it seems like our share, our options kind of come above water, about mid 30s, $36 a share. It\u2019s just kind of an average number back of my head, so we will pick up a few diluted shares because of our share price.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","And there is no incremental buyback assumed in the 350 in that, right?","Steve Shawley","","No.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Okay. Thanks very much.","Steve Shawley","I\u2019ll take it back, we do have the possibility of buying back some shares in the second half to control that dilution, okay. So, what I\u2019m expecting a big \u2013 a big number coming out of any share compensation programs this year will be mainly driven by options coming into the money and so in the second half we do \u2013 I won\u2019t be surprise if we do spend some money buying back a few shares not a lot to control the dilution.","Mike Lamach","Terry, we would earmark 300 million to 400 million for buyback in the back half of 2012, just due to seasonality of the business, but if you think about that as a September kind of midpoint, it\u2019s got very little effect of the average share count for the year.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","So you do have 300 million or 400 million buyback in the 315 assumption.","Mike Lamach","The comment we\u2019re making is that we said relative to our capital allocation strategies that we\u2019re committed to controlling that dilution and we will do what it takes to maintain the 315.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Okay, thanks. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. This is (Brett Lindsey) stepping in for Jeff. A question, order rates don't suggest there is an acceleration in U.S. non-res, it feels like a lot of your peers are pointing to this as an area of optimism, any signs of improvement in terms of quoting, bidding activity to support a recovery here?","Mike Lamach","I understand your question. We are not optimistic around the first quarter. It's a very tough comp for us anyway. If we were up 10% in the first quarter of last year and this year we see that obviously being impacted heavily in the first quarter. We could probably be down 6% to 9% in the first quarter in the res business. So, maybe take it from there as to your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. And then just in terms of residential solutions, I know you guys had a significant inventory reduction in 4Q. I mean how would you characterize inventory levels at the company level now and then as you're looking and speak with distributors as we kind of start the year here?","Mike Lamach","Well, let me first of all I'm going to tell you, to get $80 million of the loan product out of the channel and then exceeding that by $10 million to $90 million was a great achievement in res business. So, I think that in terms of indication of that team executing, first of all I'd tell you that's heck of an execution on the commercial team getting that out of the channel. So, then obviously I'd say in the earlier part of the call that they're right on track with the cost reductions and all the get well actions that were in a place. So, we were in a good starting positioning kind of coming into the year there. We look a lot less now at weeks of inventory, in fact our game and a game we want to play with our independent distribution is to be able to stock less and build to a shorter, shorter, shorter replenishment cycle, and so we're looking at what was a 20 to 30 day replenishment cycle from order to arrival at the distributor to be something in the 12 to 20 day range this year. So, we're taking it down by design across the channel and taking our cycle times down. So, I look at it really as just sort of sentiment coming from the channel. I look at it from \u2013 so the order rates coming in but not at the inventory \u2013 so weeks of inventory are less meaningful to us going forward.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thanks guys.","Mike Lamach","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from line of Shannon O'Callaghan of Nomura.","Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura","Good morning guys.","Mike Lamach","Hi, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura","Hey, so on the commercial equipment business, I mean were there any price increases there in this fourth quarter or first quarter? And when do they get implemented?","Mike Lamach","Well, if you go back to when they were put in place last year, it was a combination. You had price increases in some of the more cataloged equipment, but you didn't see that this year going in, but what you do see is a lot more systems and tools and sophistication being put into the policies, the implementation of the pricing policies across the various channels and the various segments. So it's not sort of one-time sort of across the board price increase that would've seen in 2011. Much more targeted, systematic approach and that's the capability that we have been building over the last 18 months.","Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura","Okay. So, the catalog dynamic that would drive more of the pull forward where as the stuff you're doing now doesn't really create that dynamic, right?","Mike Lamach","Yeah. I mean if you recall last year, we've seen here actually fourth quarter 2010 we were surprised, we had a 40% increase in our unitary order rate and we were thinking 20%, 25% of the pull forward. So lot of pull forwards came to that price increase last year over a year ago.","Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura","Okay. And then just maybe on the $50 million of restructuring and cost reductions, can you give us a little more feel in terms of within the segments or geographies how that breaks out and what you are targeting?","Mike Lamach","Yeah, I mean first of all, you'd expect a lot of that to be in the Climate business, the largest business and so a lot of the 50 plus it's roughly $30 million and here you've got the consolidation of two plants. So there will be two fewer plants at the end of the first quarter than they were starting. So that's one piece of it, but they also gone and really began to attack the front end of the business. And to get, I would say, more synergy in the whole product management \u2013 program management areas of the company. So that's a significant piece for them. The other factors are doing a lot, you'll see industrial will finish the consolidation in China. They've also taken some action on the frontend of their business as well as security taking a smaller action on the frontend of their business as well just sort of rightsizing it and even changing some of the go-to-market dynamics about how we're looking to go-to-market in those businesses. Then, finally, what we're seeing is an investment into the information technology systems and so one of the largest single investments here is in the ERP conversion. We got 122 fulltime people dedicated today in this transition as compared to last year at this time.","By the end of the year, we'll be close to 240 and that will continue to 2015 as we deploy common ERP systems across the company. We've also continued to invest essentially in supply chain and in OpEX and so bringing in a lot of lean expertise and really a lot of talent into the sourcing organization to get to a next level there in terms of capability. So that's the other investments we're making. The investments we're making in terms of restructuring and the cost reduction investments are actually slightly accretive for the year. So, we'll put $0.16, $0.17 into it in the first quarter and we'll get say $0.20 out of it by the end of the year.","And that \u2013 that answer is a little bit of hockey stick question about how do you get from first quarter here of about 8% of your full earnings to $3. You pull out restructuring of about 12% and that's exactly what we did in 2011, but if you compare it to 2010, we were about 3%. In that year, we were much more aggressive around restructuring and I would equate our approach to 2012 to much more kind of 2010 and taking aggressive actions in the front of the year to kind of counter balance in flattish markets.","Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura","Okay. Got it. That helps. Thanks.","Mike Lamach","Yeah.","Operator","","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks a lot. Yeah, I guess, my first question was, I mean last year it was fairly sort of controversial when you guys had this contingency number in your bridge and those are all talking around bad. I mean is it fair to say that your guidance for '12 has some contingency built in just for understandable reasons? You don't want to put it in print in an EPS bridge?","Steve Shawley","Well, we base the guidance what we are seeing in the markets for a top-line and more realistic pricing expectations, you can see from the guidance we are pretty bearish on Europe. I believe we are going to see a mild recession there. We are really there and across the company, we can execute the scenario of plans that are associated with that outlook. Remember Julian, we talked a lot about building scenario plans across the businesses in the company at multiple levels and so we are working that. The euro at 1.30 versus the average in 2011 of 1.40 has an impact for it. So I say the guidance reflects a level of operational performance that we have a line of sight to achieving based on the current capabilities of the organization, and the action plans that we believe are actually solid for the year. Now you would expect too that our internal plans are going to be set higher than that than the guidance range we gave, but we feel that the current range is appropriate for what we are seeing today and appropriate for what the current execution capability is inside the company.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Thanks. And then just to \u2013 it's a revisit to the point on the balance sheet, I mean there is this $1.1 billion of available cash generation and so on. So, can you confirm that there is no appetite or whatever to go for more M&A because obviously after dividends and the $300 million or $400 million you mentioned in the second half, that still implies several 100 million of available cash after all that?","Steve Shawley","Yeah, let me give you my thoughts on capital allocation for 2012. So, as you said we've got $1.1 billion that we're planning for the year. We ended the year with $1.2 billion of cash from the balance sheet. So, we're in a good shape there. The convertible bonds that mature in April, we're going to use about $350 million, when we raise the dividend by 33% with the March payout it will use in total in about $200 million. So, we here mark about $300 million to $400 million for buyback which should be in the back half of 2012. That's going to leave around $300 million to $400 million available for deployments and as you know, we've historically used cash in the first half. So, when we get to the second half, with fewer share prices and we will make the call and if there are smaller acquisitions that are attractive and actionable at a reasonable valuation we're going to pursue them. Again this is going to impact on kind of where the share price is. We would like to build on to some of the core businesses particularly overseas, but the valuation and profit of the targets will have to be consistent with our goals and with our commitments and obviously, even if all the excess cash went to M&A, we're not talking about anything large context of a $14 billion enterprise. So as we've decided best path to put the money back into further repurchase, then we'll do that as well. But we'll make that call on the last $300 million, $400 million based on that dynamics which are always moving. We\u2019ll make that call in the back half of the year.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks a lot. And then just one quick follow-up. It seems like this year in the HVAC industry generally in the U.S., there\u2019ll be an abnormally sort of compressed supply chain effort against tough ready for the summer selling season, obviously inventories are very lean distributors and not in a rush to start ordering yet. So, on the assumption that you have a very soft Q1 and then a sort of abnormal spike into Q2 to get everything ready for the summer. How do you guys feel about the ability of your kind of manufacturing plants and supply chain to cope with that because obviously when we\u2019ve had demand spikes before in late \u201910 there were some issues around managing that.","Mike Lamach","I mean our suppliers are all in the same position looking for same sequential and they\u2019re kind of trying to look at how do they respond to the same potential in the marketplace. So we put for the major suppliers a lot of protection programs in place to be able to protect for increases. Julian of course well it depends on how much the magnitude of an increase would be, but I don\u2019t see sort of according to the plan we\u2019ve got here on the outlook that we\u2019re seeing through the new few months that that\u2019s going to be a significant risk for us at all.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And we have time for one more question today. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Thanks for fitting me in.","Mike Lamach","","Hi, Steve.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Good morning. So just you mentioned price inflation. You talked about 2.7 in price and 0.9 material inflation on the quarter. Just that 1% on productivity and other inflation, how are you, how much was the other inflation and how much was the productivity just the same beak out you gave on price?","Mike Lamach","","It\u2019s actually exactly embedded in the fourth quarter, is that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking in that. So productivity equaled inflation.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","","But it showed 100 basis point positive.","Mike Lamach","","Productivity. Okay, I\u2019m adding back material inflation into of that. So I\u2019m saying total productivity and total inflation gotten added.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","But not including price. So productivity equal total inflation.","Mike Lamach","","Right.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","","Okay. All right. And that kind of run rate when you sort of think about that going forward to get your 50 basis points, mid-point margin expansion next year. Are you thinking about in acceleration therefore in the productivity particularly as you ramp through the year given the additional restructuring and how might we dimensionalize it?","Mike Lamach","","Yeah. I mean absolutely. The restructuring and the cost reduction investments being made now in the first quarter are all about that Steve. So we would expect to ramp it up in Q3 and Q4. We would expect to has benefit of that. Q2 \u2013 we\u2019re still going to be \u2013 if you look at how we\u2019re spending that investment restructuring for the year, it\u2019s all Q1 and Q2, and the Q2 starts to be fairly early in Q2, so we would expect back half of the year.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","","And the 19 value streams, are those \u2013 are you expanding those early in the year or just sticking to those or\u2026? ","Mike Lamach","Yeah. No, we actually expanded on. What we decided to do though is take the value streams and for example we\u2019ve got several that would have been ordered to shaft and we have expanded them from a proposal to cash. So we\u2019ve lived in the value stream. We\u2019ve had a great success in taking it through the entire value stream. We\u2019ll add a few to it, but we\u2019re going to stick to our mantra, which is really to go a mile, miles each and into the time and so happy with the 19. I think we\u2019re add or had where we expect it to be. I think it\u2019s a large transformational cultural change in the company and the last thing we want to do is to bet ourselves too thin.","The \u2013 and we\u2019ll talk about this in March when we\u2019re together, but the resources and the capability building has gone out over the last couple of years they have been added to this is really outstanding and so I \u2013 more encouraged everyday looking at the capability coming into the company and maturing in the company to be able to go an inch wider as we go. So we\u2019ll expand some, we\u2019ll add a couple of new, but we won\u2019t go so far as to spread ourselves too thin and that\u2019s working for us.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Great and is the ERP benefit. I know you\u2019re building cost there still, but that \u2013 when do you start to ramp in benefits into that productivity number, or you already doing it?","Mike Lamach","","Yes, later in 2013 another thing that happened \u2013 another investment we\u2019re making is we outsourced the lot of the infrastructure for IT and so we\u2019re in the middle of transitioning about 350 people to a third-party to be able to do that for us. So we\u2019re actually transitioning in quarter one, actually quarter four, quarter one, quarter two with duplication of resources there to handle that transition. That kicks in fully in 2013, as well as the initial phase of the ERP. But that\u2019s going to be a slow fews all the way through 2016 in terms of when you really get the benefit. We don\u2019t come to North America until 2015 with that ERP transformation. So, we\u2019re doing Europe, then Asia and then North America. So it\u2019ll ramp up over time.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And then just a follow-up to your prior answers on a couple of questions. The risk on the supply chain, we just heard yesterday Emerson state pretty strongly that they have issues \u2013 potential issues in downsizing relative to the rest of their customer base. So, I guess I would just note that you feel protected even on that front with those guys? ","Mike Lamach","Well, we have number of sources to, in terms of what we\u2019re buying. Okay, so yeah, we\u2019re looking and if you think about sort of what\u2019s growing for us, it\u2019s really the res side 13 SEER, it\u2019s a quarter of the market, right. And what we\u2019re buying there and that\u2019s really isn\u2019t, you\u2019re going to be an Emerson compressor, it could be then have to be \u2013 we\u2019re fairly agnostic around that and we\u2019ve designed to be agnostic around some of that. So we\u2019ll look to protect. We\u2019ll work with great supplier like Emerson to be able to handle our demand and to Julian\u2019s question, it\u2019s always a matter of degree. So I think we\u2019re planning a some degree of sequential recovery here. We\u2019re not planning for a barn burner, and if we see that coming, we\u2019ll look to pressure test that supply chain.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Okay great. And I\u2019ll just follow up for rest of the questions offline. Thank you.","Mike Lamach","","Thank you, Steve.","Janet Pfeffer \u2013 Vice President, Business Development and Investor Relations","Thank you everyone. And Joe and I will be available to have any \u2013 answer any follow-up for the rest of the day. Thank you.","Operator","","Ladies and gentleman, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect.

All lines will remain on mute for the duration of the call. Please be advised, you are limited to one question and one follow-up question.","And with that, I would now like to introduce Zac Nagle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Zac, you may begin.","Zachary A. Nagle - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thanks, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Ingersoll Rand's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. This call is being webcast on our website at ingersollrand.com, where you'll find the accompanying presentation. We are also recording and archiving this call on our website.","Please go to slide 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results.","This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release.","Joining me on today's call are Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO, and Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO.","With that, please go to slide 3 and I'll turn it over to Mike. Mike?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thanks, Zac, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today.","Please go to slide 3. I'd like to begin with a brief review of the fundamental elements of our business strategy that underpin our quarterly results and create value for our shareholders.","First, our global business strategy is at the nexus of environmental sustainability and impact. The world is continuing to urbanize while becoming warmer and more resource-constrained as time passes. We excel at reducing the energy intensity of buildings and industrial processes, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing waste of food and other perishable goods, and we excel in our ability to generate productivity for our customers, all enabled by technology. Our business portfolio creates a platform for the company to consistently grow in above-average global economic conditions, aided by the strong secular tailwinds I've outlined.","Second, our business operating system is designed to excel at consistently delivering strong top line growth, incremental margins, and free cash flow.","And lastly, over the years we built an experienced management team and a high-performance winning culture that makes our performance sustainable. When combined with our dynamic capital allocation strategy, we have a differentiated business model that drives strong shareholder returns over the long term.","Moving to slide 4, exiting Q3 and moving into Q4, we continue to execute well and are on track to exceed the guidance we outlined for investors on our Q2 earnings call. First, our end markets remain healthy, and we have continued to deliver excellent growth in bookings and revenues in both our Climate and Industrial segments. Additionally, our growth continues to be broad-based across virtually all businesses, products, and geographies globally, and services growth continues to be especially strong.","Second, our leverage and profitability are improving, as we are effectively managing all elements of the P&L to deliver results. In the third quarter, we achieved our second half 2018 leverage target of approximately 25% through strong volume and effective management of our price versus material cost and productivity versus other inflation metrics. We saw good margin expansion across the business, led by the Industrial segment, and healthy margin expansion in our Commercial and Residential HVAC businesses.","The second half of the year has become increasingly inflationary since we updated our guidance in July. We are embedding the impacts of additional material and other inflation, tariffs, and the knock-on effects of tariffs in our forecast.","In spite of this impact, we expect to continue to effectively manage these costs as we have in the second and third quarters and to maintain our guidance of approximately 25% leverage for the fourth quarter. We have raised our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $5.55 and $5.60, up from approximately $5.50 for fiscal 2018.","In October, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of $1.5 billion, bringing our total available authorization to approximately $1.9 billion. This reflects continued confidence in our ability to generate strong free cash flows going forward and gives us increased capacity as we execute our dynamic capital allocation strategy.","2018 is shaping up to be another strong year for us. As we move through the fourth quarter, visibility into 2019 is also improving. Based on virtually everything we're seeing, our major end markets look poised for another year of good growth. Strong bookings in 2018 are also setting us up with a solid backlog picture heading into 2019.","And finally, we are managing material and other inflation and tariffs, enabling us to drive solid leverage through the P&L and further expand margins. We expect to use the same processes and tools in our business operating system to manage these risks in 2019.","In summary, we're executing our strategy well, and this is enabling us to deliver differentiated performance in 2018. The second half is progressing consistent with our expectations, and we plan to close out the year on a strong note. Looking forward to 2019, we're expecting another good year for our industry and particularly for Ingersoll Rand.","Please go to slide number 5. The third quarter was highlighted by continued strong growth across the board, as indicated by the positive signs on the chart. Enterprise organic bookings and revenues were both up double digits. Climate led the way, with organic bookings and revenues of 12% and 10% respectively. Industrial was also robust, with organic bookings and revenues up 7% and 9% respectively. These results reflect continued strong execution of our business strategy, capitalizing on healthy end markets.","The one minus on the chart was a bookings decline in Commercial HVAC in the Middle East, where orders can be lumpy, and there were a couple of large orders in the third quarter of 2017 that did not repeat in 2018. European HVAC orders continued to be strong in the quarter.","Let's go to slide number 6. The next two slides provide insights and additional color into the key drivers behind the chart on slide 5 and how we're thinking about the markets for the remainder of the year and into next year.","In Commercial HVAC, we're seeing sustained growth globally in both bookings and revenues, with good growth in both services and equipment. North America growth was strong, with continued gains in services, contracting, controls, and equipment. Institutional growth was particularly strong, led by the education markets.","As we discussed on slide 5, Europe Commercial HVAC remained strong, with solid growth across the board in both services and equipment. China HVAC growth continues to outpace the market. Weakening economic indicators in China do not appear to be impacting the HVAC markets to date. Other markets in Asia continue to be mixed, as they have been all year. Our outlook for global Commercial HVAC remains healthy, and key economic and market indicators largely support our view, with increasing visibility into 2019.","Turning to Residential HVAC, bookings and revenue growth continued to be strong. Replacement markets, where the majority of our sales are derived, showed continued strong growth in the quarter, and this is expected to continue through the remainder of 2018 and into 2019.","Please go to slide number 7. Our Transport Solutions business continues to be globally diversified and resilient. We've seen good order growth for North America trailers in 2018, and the estimates for market revenues has improved from the beginning of the year as well. The Americas Commercial Transportation Research Company, also known as ACT, has taken their forecast for North American refrigerated trailer shipments to 43,700 units, which represents approximately 3% growth over 2017. Our capacity to ship refrigeration units exceeds the industry capacity to supply trailers, so we should have solid backlog heading into 2019.","Auxiliary power unit growth was strong in both refrigerated and non-refrigerated segments. As with North American trailers, backlog will be strong going into 2019 as well. Overall, the transport markets remain healthy in 2018, and we expect this to continue heading into 2019.","Compression Technologies growth has been solid, consistent with industrial production and other key leading indicators. In quarter three, we delivered good growth in bookings and revenues in both aftermarket and equipment, with particular strength in China. We are seeing some signs of pause with our large Chinese exporter customers, as U.S.-China trade negotiations continue and China economic indicators weaken, but it's too early to call what impact this will ultimately have, but we're continuing to monitor the situation carefully. Overall, we expect to see solid growth broadly across key products, services, and markets through the year end and into next year while maintaining optimism that the U.S.-China trade negotiations will come to a favorable resolution.","Small electric vehicle bookings and revenue growth were strong, driven largely by continued success of our consumer vehicle. We're also seeing strong growth across our high-margin Industrial Fluid Management, Tools, and Material Handling businesses.","Now I'd like to turn over to Sue to provide more details on the quarter. Sue?","Susan Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thank you, Mike.","Please go to slide number 8. As Mike highlighted, Q3 was another strong quarter for us, with continued robust bookings and revenue growth, improved leverage, solid margin expansion in both our business segments, and 22% year-over-year adjusted continuing earnings per share growth.","The third quarter was right in line with our expectations regarding how the second half would play out when we provided our updated guidance on our Q2 earnings call, which gives us confidence we'll continue to trend and achieve that guidance, with $0.05 to $0.10 of upside on the EPS line, or a revised adjusted earnings per share range of $5.55 to $5.60, up from approximately $5.50.","Looking at our third quarter results in more detail, bookings and revenue performance remained strong, with sustained growth in virtually every major product category and geography. Services was once again a standout with 11% growth, outpacing 9% equipment growth, as we continue to focus on our growing mix of stable, high-margin, recurring revenue streams. We continue to target free cash flow equal to 100% of adjusted net income for 2018.","Year to date, we've been able to sustain very high levels of revenue growth across the business at 9% organic for the enterprise. We've been able to maintain this growth in part because we've appropriately raised our inventory levels to keep up with the robust demand for our products and to meet the needs of our customers. As a result, we're sitting at a higher working capital level at just over 5% of revenue. This is consistent with 2017, and we expect this to improve as we return to a more natural 3% to 4% level for us in the fourth quarter.","We maintain our commitment to a dynamic and balanced capital allocation strategy and to returning 100% of excess cash to shareholders over time, whether it be through our strong and growing dividend or through share repurchases as we've consistently demonstrated over many years, or through value-accretive M&A.","Through September, we have returned over $850 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In October, our Board of Directors also authorized an additional $1.5 billion share repurchase program, bringing our total available share repurchase authorization to $1.9 billion, demonstrating our commitment to share repurchases as an important element of our capital deployment strategy and giving us good flexibility on how and when we execute the program.","We also continue to have a healthy and accretive acquisition pipeline that presents opportunities for value-accretive M&A. Our year-to-date spend is approximately $280 million. This spend is primarily related to the ICS Cool Energy acquisition and the Trane Mitsubishi JV. Both acquisitions are performing well and ahead of our initial value-creation models.","Please go to slide number 9. As we've discussed, Q3 was a strong financial quarter top to bottom. At the enterprise level, we delivered 10% organic revenue growth, 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement, and adjusted continuing earnings per share growth of 22%.","Importantly, we also achieved operating leverage of approximately 25%, which is improvement versus our leverage of approximately 19% in the second quarter and consistent with our guidance for the second half of 2018, as we continue to manage through increasing inflation, new tariffs, and other inflation in areas such as freight and wages.","Please go to slide number 10. Focused execution of our strategy in operational excellence drove strong core business operating income contribution in both of our business segments, which combined for approximately $0.28, or virtually all the earnings per share growth in the quarter. The quality of earnings for Ingersoll Rand remains high in that we had a very clean quarter with strong results across the board.","Please go to slide number 11. Strong execution drove 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement in the quarter. Price versus material inflation was positive by 10 basis points. Productivity versus other inflation was flat. We're effectively managing tariffs, material cost increases, and other inflationary impacts consistent with our guidance for the second half of 2018.","Please go to slide number 12. Our Climate segment delivered a very strong third quarter with 10% organic revenue growth and 50 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement. Results were strong across the board, consistent with our expectations.","Please go to slide number 13. Our Industrial business also delivered very strong results with 9% organic revenue growth and 190 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement. Similar to Climate, the strength in the business was broad-based, and it was a very clean quarter. We continued to see strong leverage in our Industrial segment, driven by Commercial improvements, restructuring returns, and productivity improvements.","Please go to slide 14. We remain committed to a balanced capital allocation strategy that consistently deploys excess cash to the opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. We maintain a healthy level of business investments and high ROI projects, which is helping to drive our strong growth in both our Climate and Industrial segments this year.","As we've discussed on prior calls, in 2018 we have also increased our capital expenditure investments, primarily related to a number of footprint optimization initiatives and new product development projects. These investments will help us make a more cost-efficient and resilient business. We maintain a strong balance sheet with significant optionality as our markets continue to evolve. We maintain our longstanding commitment to paying a strong and growing dividend at or above net income growth.","We continue to invest in share buybacks when the shares trade below our calculated intrinsic value. And as noted earlier, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of $1.5 billion in October to a total available authorization of approximately $1.9 billion. Year to date through Q3, we have returned over $850 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks.","Please go to slide 16. One of the main topics of interest is how we are managing tariffs and inflation. We've discussed this topic a fair amount throughout our remarks, so I won't spend a lot of additional time on the topic here. This slide gives a good summary of how we are managing all of the associated cost risks, so we've included it in the presentation for your reference.","Please go to slide 17. A second topic of interest is our visibility into 2019. As Mike highlighted earlier in the presentation, as we move into the fourth quarter, our visibility into 2019 is improving. We expect to continue to have healthy end markets, and our business portfolio creates a platform for the company to consistently grow above average global economic conditions, aided by strong secular tailwinds. Strong bookings in 2018 should also set us up with solid backlog headed into 2019.","We're factoring in the expected impacts from inflation and tariffs into our planning process for 2019, and our objective is to effectively manage these impacts by managing the whole P&L to drive solid leverage, as we've done in 2018. We plan to provide full 2019 guidance when we hold our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call in late January.","The last topic is restructuring. We have updated our full-year 2018 guidance for restructuring cost to $0.28, up from $0.20, reflecting recently announced initiatives related to the company's ongoing footprint optimization, which drives operational efficiencies and reduces cost. Until these footprint optimization initiatives were announced, it would have been premature to include them in our estimates.","Now I would like to turn the call back to Mike for closing remarks. Mike?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thanks, Sue.","Please go to slide 18. We believe the company is extremely well-positioned to deliver strong shareholder returns over the next several years. Our strategy is firmly tied to attractive end markets that are healthy and growing profitably. Our products and services portfolio is at the nexus of global energy efficiency and sustainability megatrends, which provides a tailwind for growth above average economic conditions over the long term. Unless you believe the world is getting less populated, cooler, and less resource-constrained, these secular megatrends will continue to create growth opportunities for Ingersoll Rand.","We have an experienced management team and a high-performing team culture that incorporates operational excellence into everything we do. Our business operating system and our culture are a differentiated and sustainable competitive advantage.","And lastly, our business model generates powerful cash flow, and we are committed to dynamic and balanced deployment of capital. We have a strong track record of deploying excess cash to shareholders over the years.","And with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Good morning, Jeff.","Susan Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Good morning.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","I was wondering if you would help us out a little bit more with tariffs. I understand that it's included in your guidance. But specifically thinking about this List 3 at 10%, can you give us some idea of what headwind you are overcoming there? And obviously, the follow-on thought, obviously, is then what we're going to think about what that means if we do go to this 25% and how you take actions against that.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Jeff, everything we know on Lists 1, 2, and 3 and Section 232 combined would have been a headwind for 2018 of around, say, $30 million, probably a little bit less than $30 million, but close to $30 million. And in 2019 it would be an incremental, say, $80 million. And our view toward that has always been we're going to cover material cost with price and we're going to cover productivity over other inflation.","So we did that in Q2. We did it in Q3. We think it's flat in Q4. Price is still building through the system, and you've seen that and will see it through any of the engineered systems that we produce in the company, whether it's HVAC or air compressors, into 2019. So I feel like we've got a handle on it, managing the impact of that, can handle that with the strategies that we've had historically in the company over the last few years.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great, thanks for that. And then separately, there's been a lot of talk about consolidation and the like in the industry. I just wondered if you could update us on your thoughts on what your priorities are, whether you think the market is right for such a move, and what exactly you'd be looking for.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Our views haven't changed over the last few years, which would be fundamentally at the heart of it. We're in great shape strategically. We don't need to do anything. So anything that we would do would need to be very compelling from a shareholder's point of view. Having said that, we've played all the game theory that's imaginable on us and clearly know what would make sense for us competitively and how we'd react to all of the above. So on that, there's really nothing more to add on that at this point in time.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","All right, thanks. Solid quarter, guys.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Steve, your line is open.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Good morning, Steve.","Susan Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Good morning.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I just wanted to follow up on Jeff's question just so we level-set ourselves. I guess this year, when all is said and done, your price material inflation equation is, I guess, like modestly negative here for in total, negative 40 bps in the first quarter and then flattish for the rest of the year. Is that correct for the year?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Fundamentally, it was flat for the back half of the year, and that's where we think we're going to track is flat through the back half of the year.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So I guess just thinking about that $30 million from tariffs alone, there was obviously some pretty substantial just base inflation that you guys are covering with what, like 1.5% of price this year, something like that?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Roughly.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, so we should think about that $80 million in the context of what was in total inflation obviously a much bigger number than the $30 million of just the tariff-related stuff in 2018. And arguably, maybe that stuff is not as severe on a year-over-year basis in 2019. Is that the correct way to look at it?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","It is, Steve. I think again, the pricing that we've put in is what contemplated all of this. If anything has changed, it's been a little bit more around some of the retaliatory approach that China has taken to some of the U.S. imports. I think we've got a strategy to deal with all of that within the planning process. If we had perfect information on input costs for 2019 or if costs didn't change from this point in time, we would target the same 20 \u2013 30 basis points of margin expansion, price over material inflation, that we normally would put into effect in the planning process. I believe that that's where we'll land in 2019.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, including the $80 million, including the $80 million, correct, that you just talked about, what you know today?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Exactly.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sorry. Go ahead, Sue.","Susan Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","That's right. So I just wanted to point out that if you were looking at the total impact on Ingersoll Rand, the dollars that we're talking about would be just under $30 million and in the $80 million are from the Section 301. So there's also the Section 232 impact that we built in, in the July guidance, which was about $38 million in 2018, and it's roughly $20 million for 2019. So I don't want to lose track of the fact that we were also trying to overcome the Section 232 piece of that in our pricing and our other mitigating actions for the price material cost equation.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, I just wanted to make sure that everybody \u2013 the $80 million \u2013 anyway, I just wanted to make sure everybody understands what the all-in dynamics are because you've covered a lot more than that in 2018 successfully, and pricing obviously remains strong.","Just one other quick one, on the productivity and other inflation, you talked about it's been weak so far year to date, but you talked about a significant improvement in the fourth quarter. What is driving that significant improvement? Is that something that can carry through into 2019?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yes, Steve, that's a good point. First of all, thanks for the clarification on the $80 million support, for people to know that we're covering that still expect to get 20 \u2013 30 basis points net of Section 232, Section 301, and all of that.","As it relates to productivity, it's been the same discussion all year long, which is just the way that productivity projects will load into the year, there will be a substantial increase in the fourth quarter. Some of these were larger footprint moves or complexity reduction projects across the company that really bear fruit in the fourth quarter. So it is a step up in the fourth quarter. Those projects are underway. They're implemented. They're defined. It's a pipeline. So it's not that we're hoping that productivity comes into the fourth quarter. We've got the projects that support that estimate.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Can that carry into 2019?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","We haven't done 2019 yet. But the key with 2019, just like price material inflation, what we'll do from a pipeline perspective is look at productivity offsetting all other inflation. Anticipating wage inflation, anticipating logistics pressure, anticipating all the Section 232 stuff coming in still, we'll cover that through productivity. And if you go back again in the operating system of the company, the question we ask ourselves is do we have 125% of what we need to do in the pipeline primed and ready for 2019. And that will be the emphasis here as we exit the year is making sure the health of the pipeline is going to be the 125%, which historically is what we've done and what we think we can continue to do for some time into the future.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right, great detail, guys. Good execution, thanks.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Winoker with UBS. Steven, your line is open.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks, good morning. Nice to see the progress, everybody.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thanks, Steve.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Maybe just going back, I want to just clarify. That 25% operating leverage that you're getting this year, that is inclusive of that flattish price material inflation in the second half, or not?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","It's all in, Steve. So we're saying that it's all in for the back half of the year. Q3, Q4. 25% is a good number, and that's mitigating anything coming in.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. And maybe just on that $80 million that you just referenced and those headwinds, can you talk about the base that that's on? In other words, maybe just put that in context of the actual China import volume or dollar volume to the U.S.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Steve, probably not on this call going through that detail because we have to separate a lot of what is more opportunistic supplier pricing coming in from what's a direct tariff. It's a very difficult analysis to make. At the end of the day, the analysis of that isn't so important as to know what we think the right numbers should be and then how to offset that with productivity and price. So it would be difficult to pull out in the call and give you anything reasonable.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, fine. And then on the resi growth side, are you seeing any direct benefits from other supplier challenges in supplying their channels? And is that a meaningful amount for you guys?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah, we don't really \u2013 as you know, we don't talk about this relative to any other competitor. But it's clear and last quarter was no exception that for the past four years there has been substantial share gain and margin expansion in the residential business, and that continued in the quarter.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, all right. I will leave it there for later. Thanks.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian, your line is open.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Good morning, Julian.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning. I'm just trying to stick to two questions. The first question just on the incremental margin point, you have more productivity in Q4, but you're saying the incremental margins stay in the mid-20s, consistent with Q3, so just wondering what's moving there. And allied to that, are 25% incrementals the right level for the current macro environment as you look out with high tariffs, high cost inflation, high volume growth?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Let me do the second part first, and Sue might come back on the first part. But I think with the volatility of the environment we're in today, we've always said that we think that incremental margins should look like gross margins, but we always guided you all to think about that as 25%, allowing some room for breakage, allowing some room for investment in the business, and all the things that create a healthy business for the long run. And that's what we're saying here.","So I do think that leverage could go higher, particularly if we saw larger compressors coming back into 2019 as an example, continued mix toward services being higher than equipment. That's certainly supportive of higher leverage as well. But I think with the environment we're in, the volatility we're in, 25% incremental is pretty good performance. I think it's really good performance. And I think that that is something that we're committed to for the back of the year.","Susan Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","And, Julian, on the other side of that with the first part of your question, it's interesting as we go through the fourth quarter and all of the pieces that you see. So our pricing was in effect as we went through the guidance in July. We are adding in the impact of the additional tariffs that we didn't know in July when we gave that guidance, so you have a little bit of impact there. You have some additional productivity.","But the other part when we think about the overall bridge and those overall incremental margins, we're also continuing to invest in the business. And when I look at fourth quarter spend, we're not trying to cut back any of those good investments in \u2013 whether it's new products or whether it was in the footprint in the fourth quarter. And so we've got some good investment spend also in the fourth quarter. Again, it's not an outlier compared to other quarters in the year but it is slightly higher, and we are continuing to do that throughout the year.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. And then my second question would just be around Industrial segment demand. There seems to be more question marks around the sustainability of the backdrop for it. It sounds like, though, the only weak spot you have seen is some of those Chinese exporters around large compressors. If you could, just confirm that's the case, or if there are any watch areas that you're focused on.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Julian, let me take your question and expand it to a broader commentary around China just to give a sense for what we think is going on. And of course, we're trying to triangulate this not only with our own customers but with other companies that have reported earnings as well. The Industrial business versus the HVAC business are really two totally different worlds right now.","Think about China's desire for clean air, clean water, and the fact that 15% to 25% of all greenhouse gas emissions happen with HVAC in buildings. Compound that with Transport refrigeration, where you've got a diesel engine powering a refrigeration cycle on a trailer or a truck. Compound that with process cooling and air compressors going into industrial factories. Now anything to do with the clean air, clean water, and retrofitting the economy, the built environment in China is going to be a good business and it might diverge a bit from the narrower industrial economy.","On the industrial economy, what we think we're seeing, and this is before bookings. This is the pipeline. This is customer communications and contact that we have. Chinese customers that would have had a bit of a U.S. export model are pausing to understand what the rules of the game are going to be and whether they're going to be in play for the long term. These customers, though, with that supply are going to point that supply somewhere else in the world eventually.","So midterm\/long term, this excess capacity in China for exporters will find its way to other markets outside the U.S. Inevitably, that's going to happen. But there is a bit of a pause I think on that export model from China to the U.S. based with what's happening with the current negotiations around tariffs. And so we're just anticipating that that could impact in the short run some of that. But these are customers that make decisions very quickly when there is an opportunity, and so it's also something that could change very quickly for the positive.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, thank you.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen & Company. Gautam, your line is open.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning guys.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Hey, Gautam.","Susan Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Good morning.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Just to disaggregate the Climate bookings a little bit in Q3, first, do you still think that Q2 had a pull forward of about $80 million to $100 million? And how much did price contribute to the 10% bookings growth organically in the quarter?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Our pull-through estimate wouldn't have changed there. It was just really strong across-the-board bookings, and you really can't find a soft spot. The only one that showed up on the chart was a little red dash, which happened to be the Middle East off a really tough comp. But everything is extremely strong, whether it's Residential, Transport, Commercial across the world. If you pull apart Commercial and look at applied versus unitary versus services, everything strongly in the green there as well. So the color is good.","If you go around the world, you're seeing nice recovery in parts of Latin America for us. We're seeing of course outperformance in Asia-Pacific, particularly with what we're doing in China. So all those things are contributing to a strong growth rate, but it's across the board.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And price on a net basis in that number, the 12%?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","So price remains strong in Climate across the board. Of course, the short-cycle inventory in residential or in light commercial, very quick there to have price effectivity. On the applied longer engineered systems, that's still building through the system. Of course, it's going to be shipping well through 2019.","At this point, we built considerable backlog there, as well as building considerable backlog in the trailer market in North America and in the auxiliary power unit market for North America. So I think when those products ultimately ship in 2019, you're going to see more price carry-forward there as well. But price effectivity in Climate is the strongest I've ever seen it.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","One follow-up on your comments on consolidation. Just I noticed you underlined balanced allocation of capital on slide 4. Mike, should we expect that large acquisitions aren't really part of the plan here? It's going to be more of what you've been doing, the tuck-ins, or do you see it, in any case, for something larger to actually unfold?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","I think maybe the bigger thing to talk about first is just making sure everyone knows that we're not changing the methodology and the discipline we've had around capital allocation for a long time now. Fundamentally, where we can invest organically in the business, we tend to see the highest ROICs and the quickest ROICs, and so that's evident with share and margin expansion that we've had over time.","We believe in the fact that the dividend should grow at or equal to net income over time. So we're continuing to make sure that investors are seeing that come through with announcements that we make on dividends. Dilution, we like to control that, so there's always going to be a little bit of buyback there to control dilution.","And then look, at the end of the day, it's looking at the available pipeline. And if we're seeing that we're able to generate return on invested capital in excess of our weighted average cost of capital, that we're building economic value for the company, we've been disciplined about that, we'll continue to do that. And clearly we've bought back shares. I want to say we bought back $6.5 billion or 150 million shares since 2011. So that's been a big part of the equation. So we're looking to create long-term economic value, however we do that, through that allocation of capital. We're going to continue to do it the same way we've been doing that.","Bolt-ons, certainly easy to do and less risk. And as I said to you, on the large strategic, more transformative things, we don't need to do anything. If it was incredibly compelling from an investor's point of view, we would look at that. I'm sure investors would want us to look at that and understand what our role in that could be. But at this point in time, it's all hypothetical, and it's not really worthwhile to discuss the details around those things for us.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","I appreciate it. Thank you.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Josh, your line is open.","Breindy Goldring - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, this is Breindy on for Josh.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Hi, Breindy.","Breindy Goldring - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. You mentioned that you've been gaining some share in Residential. And we know that one of your competitors had a recent outage that would have required some share shift in the industry. Is that part of where the share gain came from? And given that it should be a greater impact in 4Q, is that included in your current guidance, or could we see some upside on share gain there?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Breindy, we about five years ago, four or five years ago redid most of the product line in res. We entered the opening price point. We modified our channel structure to be able to make sure that we have a product for every home and a channel partner for every product, if you will. So all of that has led to a long-term share gain margin expansion story for the company. And then we just don't talk about the specifics of any given competitor and share shifts between competitors. We just think it's best for our shareholders that we keep that close to our vest.","Breindy Goldring - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, that's fair. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel, your line is open.","Bhupender Bohra - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, good morning guys. This is Bhupender here filling in for Nigel.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Good morning.","Bhupender Bohra - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, can you guys hear me?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah, we do, go ahead.","Bhupender Bohra - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, this is Bhupender here for Nigel. So I just wanted to focus on \u2013 I think Sue mentioned about the service strength here in the quarter of 11%. Could you give some color from what actually is driving that growth in services, especially the contribution from digital and some software initiatives that you have in place? Thanks.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yes, it's a strategy. It's been a long-term strategy we've been executing for years to try to drive the mix of the company up in services. And if you go back historically, a decade ago that might have looked more like 30% for the company. And if you look at the service-related businesses, which would be HVAC, Commercial, and our Industrial air compressor business, it's much closer to 50% today, and for the company we're all into the 40s.","So I think that it's been a long-term strategy. It's not a single event. It's a system of things. So it's the channel, it's a direct footprint, it's investing in people and in systems and tools because people are hard to come by at this technical skill set. We've had to \u2013 and it's been a good investment around technology to help leverage the ability for our people to get out and see more customers or to handle things remotely. So a lot of the diagnostic work in the background where the connected buildings or connected equipment has been very helpful to us in that.","And then, of course, selling different value propositions, using the data and analytics out of systems to improve either building performance or industrial process has been well received. And one of the fastest-growing numbers that we have across the company is the number of connected buildings or connected assets today. It's a number that every time I report it it's up 500 or 1,000 buildings or customers the next time I report it. So that continues to be a really solid investment for us. We would say digital, but it's more than just digital. It's the whole connected experience.","Bhupender Bohra - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, that's great commentary. I just wanted to follow up here on the \u2013 you guys have given some commentary on 2019 visibility here. When you look at the backlog, would you be able to comment on how Commercial HVAC backlog actually look by geographical regions, puts and takes basically going into...","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","It's record backlogs coming in. What you see here is institutional backlogs that are very strong that are continuing. We've talked in the past about large projects flowing through. It's interesting, the numbers that we've been reporting all year haven't actually included any what we would think to be large projects. These large projects are still out there. We still think they're in scope for even this year, let alone 2019. That starts to set up very long-term visibility into 2019 and potentially even to 2020 on some of these larger projects. So backlog there is great.","Thermo King, it's pretty clear that the industry is under-capacitized for trailers and for tractors. The demand is there. So as soon as a tractor needs an APU or a trailer needs a refrigerated unit, we're ready. We're able to meet that demand. So that's a definite backlog build going into 2019.","And then large compressors, we'll wait and see what happens here for the balance of the year. We're coming off a tough comp, quarter four of 2017, as it relates to large compressors, but we'll see how that plays out. But that gives us great visibility into 2019 as well, these large engineered compressors that we sell.","Bhupender Bohra - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, just one more actually because you brought in the large compressor here. I just wanted to get a sense of China industrial compressor business, if you look at that. Do you think the margins would be comparable to the fleet average, or they would be like the segment average or below that? Just to get a sense of...","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","They're above. They're average to above. They're excellent. They're great. So China is important for the compressor business for us, and China is important for compressors globally in the market. About half the world's air compressors are sold into China. So it's important to keep an eye on China.","And as I said to you, that capacity in China is going to go somewhere. Maybe it goes along one belt, one road, which you can think about that might be brilliantly timed in terms of where that capacity may end up. But these customers are aggressive. They'll make decisions quickly. That capacity will go somewhere. But in the short run, that's where I was cautioning that there could be a pause in some of that business.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott, your line is open.","Scott Reed Davis - Melius Research LLC","Hi. Thank you for fitting me in, guys. Good morning.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Hi, Scott.","Scott Reed Davis - Melius Research LLC","I want to back up a little bit. Obviously, the market over the last month or so sees something \u2013 thinks it sees something daunting out there. And you guys have come up with a pretty darn good quarter, one of the best quarters I think I can remember. How do you reconcile really what \u2013 you've seen homebuilding stocks drop 50%. You've seen anything that touches even non-res construction get hit hard. How do you reconcile that fear that you see out there with the fact that what you see is still a fairly healthy environment?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","When you think about the markets we're serving, again, 15% to 25% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions are happening from HVAC systems in buildings. And if we've launched technology two years ago in the applied space that eliminates greenhouse gas emissions by 99.9%, that's going to be a great business. If you think about trailers with a refrigeration cycle running off a diesel engine that can be electrified using again a refrigeration cycle that eliminates 99.9% of those greenhouse gas emissions, and you walk in industrial plants, process cooling and air, we are center cut for a world looking to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.","And so I don't know that you can just lump us into an Industrial business selling machinery. I think you have to look at the businesses we're in. We happen to be in great businesses with technology that's differentiated and a channel that's differentiated, and a service model that's differentiated. I think this is a long-term great story. So when you see these disconnects in the market, we hope there's investors out there saying this is a great entry point in a company like ours that's got great businesses and a track record of executing very well, with smart capital allocation supporting all that.","Scott Reed Davis - Melius Research LLC","Got you, it's a fair point. And again, just to back up a little bit, do you get a sense, Mike and Sue, that it's easier to get price out there now than it has been in the past, partially just because of the front page news that tariffs have been and maybe partially just because of the answer you just gave, just some differentiated technology? Does it feel easier to you guys at least or seem easier because you seem to catch up to the price\/cost curve pretty quickly?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","If you think about the engineered systems, it could be large applied systems, large air compressor systems. That's where 10% of the cost of the total lifecycle is the actual purchase price, 90% is the energy, the maintenance, the refrigerants, et cetera, used. It's easier if you've got a value proposition that allows customers to see the efficiency advantages, the refrigerant advantages and so on, and so forth to get price. So certainly that helps.","But as you get sliding into more of the commodity products, you get into residential HVAC with standard SEER levels, this is where operational excellence matters and where the dealer and distributor matter and why it's so important for us to have the best dealers and the best technology and the most cost-efficient operating footprint that we can to be able to really survive in that model. So there's mixed models around price, but clearly, where you're able to differentiate on technology is an advantage.","Scott Reed Davis - Melius Research LLC","Sounds good. Okay, I'll pass it on. Thank you, guys, good luck.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Andrew, your line is open.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, good morning guys.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Good morning, Andy.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Mike, so I think you mentioned last quarter that the Chinese HVAC market you thought was growing in about 5% range or so, and that Ingersoll was growing in multiples of that. From what you could you tell, is the market still growing at close to that rate? And have you been able to actually accelerate your outperformance from that market given you now have obviously the direct service model in place for a while, but you also talked about that service pull-through beginning to kick in?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yes, I think you're going to find over time that HVAC in China and the built environment in China might differentiate from the industrial economy in China as it relates to this tariffs discussion. The built environment in China is 10 times larger than the built environment in the U.S. A lot of that environment was built not at the highest level of code, standards, or efficiency levels, and so enormous retrofit opportunities to go in, make them more efficient, and clean the air in doing this. So I think that that is going to potentially be a good market for a long time independent of what's happening in the narrower industrial economy.","This is why we put the strategy in place to do what we did last year and made the investments that we made. And we're really pleased with what's happening not only with the penetration into the equipment side of that, but the linkage rates that are happening with services are very high, and it's giving us a lot of confidence that not only was it the right strategy, but the pace at which it's working is faster than what we would have thought. So I feel good about what's happening there, and I think we'll continue to outperform in China specifically.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Maybe a similar question on North America institutional HVAC. So when you look at that strength, obviously, some of the strength is just the market itself. But could you give us some more color on your performance in the markets in the sense that \u2013 I know you do performance-based contracting. Your digital came to $1 billion, your big applied jobs has improved. So has penetration there actually accelerated versus the market? And so as you look into 2019 and 2020, that's what results in this good visibility because you're really going to outperform the market based on what you see?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","If you take a $4.5 billion to $5 billion Commercial North American HVAC business and you just split it and said half of it is service and half of it is equipment, and of the equipment, 85% of that is going to be replacement, it's a real opportunity to go create demand around the installed base and go create demand around energy efficiency.","What you're finding now in addition to that is the institutional cycle started last year probably in earnest, still I think relatively early to mid-cycle in that. And then some of the larger projects tend to happen later in the cycle as it relates to larger campus environments, larger customers that have got more complex solutions to put in place, take more time to get that designed, engineered, and implemented. And so I think we enter that phase here in the next year or two.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks, Mike. Appreciate it.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thanks, Andy.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe, your line is open.","Evelyn Chow - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, this is Evelyn Chow on for Joe.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Hi, Evelyn.","Evelyn Chow - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Maybe we'll just start on the Industrial incrementals, have seen really nice progress on those incrementals throughout the year. If I think about it, it sounds like the mix of bookings of large compressors and service all seeming to grow. It seems like you're getting price. What are the offsets to get us from the mid to high 30% type incremental range we're seeing in 3Q down to that 25% number we've talked about for the enterprise?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Industrial leverage is higher than that. It's running in the high 30s, and it will continue to leverage into the 30s throughout fourth quarter. They're doing it across the board though. They're executing well at the plant and operational level. They're executing well at the service level as well, so in the field, and they're investing in the business.","And so the investments really have been relatively substantial, in fact, as you think about what they've been trying to do to upgrade some of the product portfolio over the last year with that kind of leverage in place. So they're building it for the long run, and I think that this continues to get leverage well north of 30%, and we'd expect it to lever north of 30% in 2019. And we've always said is these larger compressors, if they do come back in at some point in time, we tend to get very high leverage off those, so larger fixed costs that we have in place.","Evelyn Chow - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's great, Mike. And then maybe just turning to the $80 million of tariff-related inflation and ways that you might mitigate, is there any thought on potentially pre-buying some of your inventory instead of letting working capital normalize into 4Q? And then maybe as an addition to that, Sue, if you could provide us any color on how much metal spend you either bought or hedged into 4Q and 2019, that would be great.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","I think every time we look at fundamentals of lean versus pre-buying lots of inventory, it comes down to you want to really run the business as lean as possible and you want to make sure the supply chain is as short as possible. It tends to favor suppliers that are more localized than long-distance suppliers. And so I think we continue on the journey that we've been on around lean throughout the company and look at that, the supply base or the extension of our lean efforts there.","So I won't on that front \u2013 I don't see us doing any pre-buys other than where there are constraints in the industry. So if there's a constraint around semiconductor boards or circuitry or a constraint around diesel engines, those are places that we buy ahead or make larger commitments. But for the run-of-the-mill stuff we buy and the bill of materials, we would continue to run that in the leanest way possible.","Susan Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","And, Evelyn, I think when you think about our strategy around purchasing materials and all that and the impact on 2018 and 2019, we're obviously doing buys each and every quarter for not only the commodities, but some of the Tier 2 components. So if you think about 2019, I would say that you might be 50% \u2013 60% bought or committed for the first half of the year and then less so in the second half of 2019.","But I think the more important piece of how we buy, whether it's the commodities or some of our other materials, is I don't think you'd want to assume that because of where things are today that you would go and buy that, even if it meant that you were a slightly higher percentage of revenue.","And why I say that is the tariffs and the whole discussion around inflation is a really volatile equation, and you can find yourself buying because you think it's a great idea, and then all of a sudden maybe something goes away or speculation comes out of a commodity, say copper, and you have a lower price. I think you're better off following a routine, following a process, and layering in your materials as you go throughout the year and making sure that you have the right blended rate for the materials that you're buying in, and that's exactly what we do as we think about that.","And my comments around working capital and where it goes, the 3.5% to 4% is a really natural level for us to really be able to support on-time deliveries and to support our customers. So while it comes down from Q3 to Q4, it isn't because we're unnaturally forcing it down. That's really just the normal cycle of inventory for us. So if there is an opportunity to have something that would be different, we'd certainly look at that. But I really think that ratably buying and following our natural processes is the right way to go.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. John, your line is open.","John Walsh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, good morning.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Hi, John.","John Walsh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","So definitely a lot of ground covered. And I just want to make sure I understand or maybe put a finer point around the visibility into 2019. But we have talked about applied backlog being stronger, service growth, what's going on in Industrial around compression. Is there a way to quantify the better visibility you see into 2019 as of today versus maybe historically or even last year? It would feel like you would have more visibility just given the way the dynamics are playing out than you've historically had into 2019.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","The merchant services business being what it is, you get more visibility because you have to believe service is going to continue. And in fact, if there's a downturn, you're going to see service go up as people extend the asset lives. So I would think that service growth as it relates to visibility is a better way of thinking about the mix over the long run. That helps.","And then if you take the equipment and systems businesses, nothing has really changed there other than the fact that you can see the backlogs building. And you can understand from a correlation of the metrics that we use to establish a demand forecast that they still tend to be favorable. So between what's in the backlog, what's in the pipeline, and the metrics that are before the pipeline that would be the leading indicators that we use, and there are different indicators for different businesses and different segments of the business and products even if the business, we're able to feel good about 2019 at this point shaping up. Unless there's a dramatic geopolitical event, a dramatic event that's not seen today, we feel like 2019 is shaping up to be a good year.","John Walsh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you. And then as we think about the energy retrofit business in the U.S., obviously that's driven by replacement, the age of the asset if it breaks, energy code or new regulations. But are you seeing any changes around customer demand due to new financing mechanisms as new money enters that market to fund some of these upgrades? Is that helping drive some of this growth, or is that not something you're seeing at all yet in the market?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","The vast majority is going to come through traditional customer financing, their own deals. Then there's performance contracting, which lends itself toward institutions that may not have the capacity at all times, plus this is an asset that they can \u2013 it's one of the few assets that an institution has that can have a return. If you think about the assets an institution will generally hold, buildings being one of them, it's fortunate that the largest driver of their operating budgets often is going to be utilities and some of the maintenance facilities. So that's always a great place that they would use financing in other areas and then use performance contracting as the way of getting at facility upgrades and improvements at their facilities. So no real changes though in how customers think about that today.","John Walsh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, thank you.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Your last question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo. Rich, your line is open.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, good morning, everyone, just a couple for me, Mike. Mike, on the mix for 2019, knowing what you know now with your backlog and understanding there's still short cycle stuff in the business you can't necessarily predict, would you say the mix is neutral, better, or worse than what you've seen in 2018 mix of sales?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","We're pulling every piece together now. We haven't taken a look at mix yet. But what I'd say is it comes back to running the whole P&L, understanding that we want to get leverage, EPS growth in the business, cash flow ROIC to be where it's been historically, and we'll work with each of our business to figure out what that's looks like. But we don't have an early read on mix. At this point, if you're modeling anything, I'd model neutral mix. We wouldn't have any better advice for you at this point.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then institutional, I think you're thinking it will be probably be a better year 2019 than 2018, right? So does that end up having been a positive to mix with service or neutral?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Long run it's a positive because it's where the service business gets built is on the engineered systems. And then in the short run, you get a little bit of a gross margin hit, but overcome eight-fold over the long run with the service business that tails on top of that. So as you're modeling 2019, it's negligible, but it would lean toward a little bit more compressed margin. But as you lean toward the out years, the service starts, even in the warranty period, it tends to be a very good story.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then last one on Industrial, on compressors, can you level-set us on service? You noted that is growing, outpacing equipment this quarter on orders. Where are you in terms of percentage of revenues on compressor service?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","About 50%, it's about half the business.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Half the business. Okay.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great.

I would like to hand the conference over to Janet Pfeffer, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma\u2019am.","Janet Pfeffer","Thank you, Karen. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Ingersoll-Rand's first quarter 2014 conference call. We released earnings at 7:00 a.m. this morning and the release is posted on our website. We'll be broadcasting, in addition to this phone call through our website at ingersollrand.com, where you can find a slide presentation that we will be using this morning. This call will be recorded and archived on our website.","If you'd please go to Slide 2.

Lamach","Great. Thanks, Janet. And good morning and thanks for joining us on today's call. In the first quarter, we delivered GAAP earnings per share of $0.27, which includes $0.02 of restructuring, translating to adjusted EPS of $0.29. That's $0.01 above the top of our earnings guidance range and a 32% increase versus the first quarter of 2013. Revenues were $2.7 billion up 3% versus last year. Revenues were consistent with our guided revenue range of up 2% to 3% for the quarter.","Orders were up 5% in the first quarter with climate up 7% and industrial down 1%. Against the top industrial comp, last year\u2019s first quarter include two significant project awards. Adjusted operating margin which excludes restructuring from both years was up 60 basis points. Climate margins increased 210 basis points. Pricing exceeded direct material inflation marking three, four years of 12 consecutive quarters of consistent execution and our pricing capability.","We did experience severe weather in the quarter which impacted our ability to produce HVAC parts and ship in several locations. In most instances, the teams were able to makeup those shipments during the quarter. Club Car's performance was the most severely impacted with two significant interest loans in Augusta, on top of an already full first quarter order book.","While the team was able to makeup total loss days of production, some shipments were delayed until the second quarter. And Sue, will give you some color on Club Car in a few minutes. So the tireless efforts of our employees were able to overcome this challenge and deliver to our customers as well as for our shareholder in the quarter. Like to thank and acknowledge our employees for dedication during some very long days and weeks in the first quarter. We repurchased 13 million shares in the first quarter and have completed the December 2012 $2 billion repurchase authorization.","Now Sue will walk you through in more detail on the first quarter and I\u2019ll then take you through our second quarter and 2014 outlook.","Susan K. Carter","","Thanks Mike. Let me give you a high level summary and then dive into the details. Our bookings for the quarter were up 5%, revenues were up 3% and our operating margins without restructuring were up 60 basis points year-over-year. Reported earnings per share were $0.27 and adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter were $0.29 versus guidance rising in volume were a little bit better and more than offset the operating inefficiencies we experienced due to the weather, taking as $0.01 above our guidance range.","Now let\u2019s go to Slide 4. Orders for the first quarter of 2014 were up 5% on a reported basis and excluding currency. Climate orders were up 7%. Global commercial HVAC bookings were up low-single digits. Transport orders were up high-teens led by container orders. Orders in the Industrial segment were down 2% excluding currency. As Mike noted, there were two significant awards in the first quarter of 2013 making an external challenging comparable. Club Car orders were up low-single digits.","Now let\u2019s go to Slide 5. Here's a look at the revenue trends by segment in regions. The top half of the chart shows revenue change for each segment. For the total company, first quarter revenues were up 3% versus last year on a reported basis and 4% excluding currency. Excluding currency, climate revenues increased 5% with HVAC revenues up low-single digits and transport revenues up low-teens. Residential HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits. Industrial revenues were essentially flat on a reported basis and excluding currencies. I will give more color on each segment in the next few slides.","On the bottom chart, which shows revenue change on a geographic basis, revenues were up 3% in the Americas, 6% in EMEA and Asia was up 3%, all excluding foreign exchange.","Let\u2019s go to Slide 6. This chart walks through the change in operating margin from the first quarter of 2013 of 4.5% to first quarter of 2014 which was 5.7%. This chart is on a reported basis, however we have clearly found out the impact of restructuring cost for you. Volume mix and foreign exchange collectively were 20 basis points positive versus prior year. Our pricing programs continue to outpace material inflations adding 40 basis points to margins.","Productivity versus other inflation was 50 basis point positive margin impact in the quarter and this is particularly good performance in my view given the inefficiencies we know were experienced from the ERP base to go-live much of which were planned and the disruptions and resulting inefficiencies from weather. Year-over-year investment and restructuring were lowered by 10 basis points in total.","In the box, you can see that this is comprised of 50 basis points of headwind from investments and a 60 basis point benefit from lower restructuring cost. So if you prefer to look at this on an adjusted basis, adjusted margins increased in net of 60 basis points versus 120 basis points on a reported basis.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 7. The Climate segment includes Trane commercial and residential HVAC and Thermo King transport refrigeration. Total revenues for the first quarter were just over $2 billion. That\u2019s up 4% versus last year on a reported basis and up 5% excluding currency. Global commercial HVAC orders were up low-single digits. Orders were up in the Americas and Europe and down in Asia. Trane\u2019s commercial HVAC first quarter revenues were up low-single digits. Revenues were up mid-single digits in Europe and Asia and flat in the Americas. Commercial HVAC equipment revenues were up low-single digits, while HVAC parts, services and solutions revenues were up mid-single digits versus prior year.","Thermo King orders were up high-teens versus 2014's first quarter with a significant increase in container orders. Thermo King revenues were up low-teens, with truck trailer revenue up high-single digits and marine container revenues up significantly. Residential HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits versus last year. Unit volumes were also up mid-single digits and mix was positive in the quarter. The adjusted operating margin for Climate was 6.6% in the quarter, 210 basis points higher than first quarter of 2013 due to volume and productivity, partially offset by inflation. Notably the North American HVAC businesses, commercial plus residential leveraged at over 200% in the quarter.","Let\u2019s go to Slide 8. First quarter revenues for the Industrial segment were $682 million, up slightly from last year\u2019s first quarter. For the Industrial segment excluding Club Cars, revenues were up low-single digits and orders were down low-single digits versus last year.","Revenues in the Americas and Asia Pacific were up low-single digits while revenues in Europe, Middle East and Africa were up mid-single digits. Revenues in the air compressor business were up mid-single digits with strong gains in centrifugal and oil free products. Club Car revenues in the quarter were down high-single digits while orders were up low-single digits versus prior year. Increased revenues from golf cars were more than offset by delayed shipments in utility vehicles and by lower demand as a result of weather and aftermarket. Club Car\u2019s revenues in the quarter were negatively impacted by weather. Cold temperatures across the U.S. negatively impacted demand for their products as well as aftermarket. Rounds played were down almost 20% year-over-year.","In addition, two severe storms hit Augusta, Georgia causing production to shutdown for several days in January and February as well as causing inbound and outbound logistics delays. Well in most of our businesses, we were able to compensate for any loss days due to weather by increasing capacity in March. Club Car seasonal business was already scheduled at full capacity in March, already working in multiple shifts in weekends as they do every March. And much of that revenue shifted out of the first quarter. The logistic issues from the storm also resulted in incremental costs incurred for premium freight less than optimal outbound loads and additional overtimes. Industrial's operating margins of 11.6% was down to 320 basis points on flat volumes compared with last year as productivity was more than offset by the disruptions of Club Car inflation and investment.","Now let's turn to Slide 9. Working capital as a percentage of revenue was 4.4% of revenue in the quarter. We normally use cash in the first quarter as we build for the cooling season. First quarter free cash flow was an outflow of $177 million with revenues in the quarter back-end loaded in March, ending receivable balances were higher than expected and will be worked down over the coming months.","Please go to Slide 10. We have repurchased 13 million shares or $800 million in the first quarter and as expected that completed our $2 billion repurchase authorization. As you know, a new $1.5 billion authorization was approved by the Board in February. As we indicated in our last earnings release, we have begun to spend under that authorization in April utilizing the final portion of the distribution from the Allegion spin-off. Our forecast for the year remains to spend between $1.375 billion and $1.475 billion and repurchased with $400 million to $500 million of that coming from free cash flow. We expect the majority of that to be spent in the second half of the year.","And with that I will turn it back to Mike to take you through guidance.","Michael W. Lamach","Okay, thanks Susan. Please go to Slide 11. As you know the first quarter comprises only 10% of our annual earnings given the seasonality of our businesses. In the aggregate, markets were about what we thought they would be some of them better and some of them weaker, but in total the bottom-line with our outlook going into the year. You saw that in our first quarter revenues which were in line with our guidance. Guys put in place forecast for 2014, shipped it somewhat in the latest update. The commercial and industrial forecast was revised up, while the institutional forecast was revised downward. In total, the 2014 forecast is slightly higher. Again commercial and industrial buildings tend to use more unitary equipment, while the institutional markets tend to use more applied equipment.","Single family housing activity was adversely impacted by weather although a full-year forecast is still from mid to high single-digit growth in industrial unit volumes. Transport markets had a good start for the year particularly in Europe and in marine. We continue to expect the full-year North America trailer market to be flat to slightly up on a unit basis and industrial markets were fairly slow in the quarter. All that said the second quarter as a much more excelling quarter in which engage the balance of the year. Given that and as is our normal practice, we\u2019re maintaining our full-year guidance for both revenue and earnings at this time. We will be taking a look at the full-year outlook again and we talk to you in July.","Please go to Slide 12. The second quarter guidance referred to the right hand column on the chart shown. Second quarter 2014 revenues are forecasted to be up 4% to 5%. We expect relatively stronger in Climate than in industrial but those should be in a low to mid single digit range. Second quarter GAAP, continuing earnings per share are forecasted to be in the range $1.08 to $1.12. Restructuring costs are expected to be about $0.01 in the quarter. So on an adjusted basis, the EPS range is $1.09 to $1.13. We are assuming an average share count of $275 million and a tax rate of 25%. For full-year 2014, we expect to generate free cash flow of $900 million.","So in closing, we\u2019re pleased to have delivered at above our earnings commitment in the first quarter, despite some challenges. As we ahead into the seasonally important second quarter, I feel good about our positioning and our focus for the balance of the year. Now Sue and I will be happy to take your questions and Karen I will turn it over you to moderate.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you.

Bernstein & Co., LLC","","Nice quarter, a couple of questions. One, I got hearing a lot about these systems in ERP issues through the quarter that I think it pushed out expectations as well. Can you maybe give us some color on what actually happened on that front? How you have mitigated it and what the status is if it\u2019s all through all that?","Michael W. Lamach","","Yes, Steve, I kind of thought it would be managed (indiscernible) that might be first on the list. So I will give a bit more of an extensive answer here, I think trying to help anybody else in the queue from serving a question, so I will cover pretty my detail. We went live with phase II and again the sixth phase ERP implementation in mid-February, actually February 10 was the date that we went live. It included a large portion of our European transport business that was a small portion of our compressed air systems and services business and it include ordering, warehouse, logistics, modules for North American commercial unitary and residential HVAC businesses. So we planned for a post go-live on a stabilization period of about four to six weeks, which was normal when you have a system go-live.","And then for stock businesses, we built an inventory buffer to compensate, so we expect a lower productivity during the system downtime, just prior to go-live and then as people get used to new standard work-in processes going forward. And then our experience and that of all the folks were working with would be that it takes about six months post launch to achieve the expected productivity benefits than from a conversion of like that. So the TK and the airs business launches went very smoothly and unitary conversion was much more typical, and productivity grew by just mentioned a second ago.","We planned an additional ten days inventory to be held at the unitary warehouses and we have that in place by the end of January. On the 29th and 30th of January, several plants were shutdown due to the first snow storm and ice storm that Sue alluded to. And then of course with the knock-on impact and (indiscernible) all the way in that process as well. And what usually happens after something like that as you see demand play after this one clear which we saw and that\u2019s depleted a portion of the buffer that was in place.","Now the second storm actually hit two days after the go-live, which shutdown a number of factories for about 4 days and to have the same logistics and demand knock-on effects, I mean that one as well. So by February 15, our 10 day buffer stock was largely depleted. And so we had a full core process on from mid-February until we ended the quarter and I would say by quarter end we were able to keep shipping pace with incoming order flow. And I\u2019ll further say that in April, we continue to see better productivity each week.","So as of today, we think has past few backlogs, forecast shipped in the second quarter primarily in the residential business and I would say it\u2019s about one week of higher backlog than we saw last year whether we would like to have at this time. But as you saw, Steve, leveraged 57% and then specifically the Trane North-America businesses which we raised and in commercial delivered 230% operating leverage in the quarter which was phenomenal, so net, net with all disruptions from weather and the new systems, we delivered a really great quarter in Climate.","And I just want to say again I couldn\u2019t be anymore proud of our customer service and our warehouse people and the operation of the business teams that went really the extra mile to satisfy customers during weather disruptions and the system transition that was a beautiful thing. We expect to hit business case productivity levels inline with what I said earlier that would be in the August timeframe, I think we would be running that the business case, (indiscernible) productivity.","Steven E. Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC","","Hey, great.","Michael W. Lamach","Yes.","Steven E. Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC","And then may be higher level of question. On Nelson Peltz rejoined from the Board that we saw, are you likely to still the feet, and what kind of skill set that are you thinking you have answered? What\u2019s been lost and how are you thinking about that?","Michael W. Lamach","","Well, the Nelson coming off in June and two directors come off next year. We\u2019ll go out and look at it, Christchurch ideally would love to have somebody with international large scale P&L experience in the industrial setting. So we\u2019re out there and over the next 15 months or so, we\u2019ll be kind of looking through at the Head of the Board around those three departures that have planned over the next year, 15 months. Probably looking to fill two and have a Board size of about 11.","Operator","","Thank you and our next question comes from the line of David Raso from the ISI Group.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","Hi, good morning. On the margins for the year by segment, I am just going to get a feel for how are you thinking about the full year for both margins, obviously climate had a greater quarter, industrial disappointment. Could you jut update us on the thoughts for margins free segments for the year and then I have a question related to that for 2Q?","Susan K. Carter","","David, it is Sue. So as we think about the full year and again we haven\u2019t changed our guidance for the full year outlook, so this is going to be pretty much information you know. Climate operating income margin, we expect 40 basis points to 80 basis points improvements over last year and on the industrial segment flat to up about 20 basis points.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","Okay. So on the industrial, it gets back on track for that, it appears what the second quarter is implying for margins. I assume you\u2019re looking for a nice snapback in industrial margins for the quarter where industrial margins will be up year-over-year in 2Q?","Susan K. Carter","Yes, so let\u2019s talk about the second quarter, so the guidance we would be looking at sort of low single-digits on revenue growth for the business and operating margins, backing perhaps the 16% and 16.5% range.","Operator","","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research.","","Jeffrey T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners, LLC","","Thank you. Good morning. First just on price and cost, Mike, you said price overcame materials cost inflation, but did you actually have net materials cost inflation or material is actually grinding a little bit lower here?","Susan K. Carter","So let me, I jump in and look at your question. So when we think about the first quarter, I mean obviously the direct material inflation is pretty same and perhaps there is a little noise in that, as we get towards the end of the year, but if you think about in total if we saw about 50 basis points of price and then as we talked about in the call about 40 basis points overall for price versus direct material inflation.","So when we think about the price we\u2019ve got positive points in both of our segments and no positive in TK, positive in Trane, commercial and res and so we feel pretty good about that pricing and again direct material inflation pertained in Q1, probably pertained through the first half and then maybe some noise around CO in the back half of the year.","Jeffrey T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And then my second question is on the investment spend, should we still expect something in the neighborhood of $0.18 for the year and that kinds of appears from your commentary that most of that spend was in industrial this quarter, is that correct, have you addressed both of those spends?","Susan K. Carter","","Yes, so I think the full-year remains about the same. And as we think about the first quarter versus the full-year, I would say that more of the investments spend, it had a bigger impact on the industrial margins in the first quarter but again it will be pretty balanced as we go through the year, but the total hasn\u2019t really changed.","Operator","","Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Jo Blackshaw from Goldman Sachs.","","Jo Blackshaw \u2013 Goldman Sachs International","","Hi, good morning everyone.","Michael W. Lamach","","Hi, Jo.","Jo Blackshaw \u2013 Goldman Sachs International","So I thought the incremental margins this quarter were pretty doing good in north of the 25% number that we talked about last quarter despite the ERP issues, the weather issues and Climate and Club Car disruptions, is there a potential catch-up embedded into your 2Q guidance and perhaps. Maybe you can talk a little bit about whether your incremental margins are conservative for the remainder of the year?","Susan K. Carter","","So Jo, as we think about leverage in our terminology obviously you know the Climate businesses had very good leverage in the first quarter at 57% and then overall for the company about 26% for the business. So when you think about Q2 and what that means, the guidance would sort of give you the implication that the overall leverage for the company is up around the 40% level with just north of 30% coming out of the operating segment and then you start to get some tailwind out of the corporate expenses also.","And so you, obviously as we look at it, in the second quarter the guidance looks right to us. Again the business is just over 30% total, just over 40% as we do start to get some of that corporate uptick. The full year, obviously what we haven\u2019t changed anything, we\u2019re still sticking with the story that we had in the upper 30s for the full year with 25 coming out of the businesses but in fairness as we go through the second quarter and we come back in the month of July and talk about the total year, we will take another look at that.","Joe Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs","That's helpful, Sue. And just one follow-up question, it looks like you took up your free cash flow guidance to the upper end of your range. I think you had $850 million to $900 million last quarter, now you're at $900 million. Pretty good free cash flow as the year progresses. Talk to us a little bit about your uses of that cash specifically as it relates to buy back and MM&A?","Susan K. Carter","So we talked about what we were going to do on share repurchase and we said that that we completed the $2 billion authorization that we\u2019re spending on the remaining of Allegion money about $175 million in the second quarter, and then we said we take about $400 million to $500 million of the free cash flow and applied to share buyback in the year and that\u2019s \u2013 that sort of get you the first quarter plus the second, the final Allegion dollars and then the $400 million to $500 million get you to that, $1.375 billion to $1.425 billion that we talked about in the script.","And so then if you think about that with the $900 million of free cash flow guidance that\u2019s roughly about half of the free cash flow and we said that what we would do is with the remainder is it\u2019s toggled between M&A and investments in the business in share repurchase for the remainder of the free cash flow.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse.","Julian C. H. Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities, LLC","Hi, thanks a lot. I guess the first question was around the mix of business within the climate segment. If you look at the institutional facing businesses, I think those were down slightly. The applied business was down slightly. You talked before about applied being flat for the year. Are you still sticking with that? And maybe just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in your applied customers in terms of quotation and order activity?","Michael W. Lamach","So it\u2019s mixed globally Julian, but I think North America tends to be the focus of the question typically. Interestingly, when you look at bookings in the first quarter, the North America applied, they are actually up high-single digits. If you look at unitary North America, they\u2019re actually up high-teens. And one thing that you probably had identified here is that there is a buy, sell component of what we do often tied to contract and we might do a performance contract and have a pump set made by somebody else that we sell through to the end customer. That\u2019s actually the business that\u2019s down. So what we\u2019re seeing in terms of an uptick in our bookings for resourcing of our plants, absorption of our plants, it would lend toward a decent back half of the year, kind of recovering back up to the level that we have thought. So it\u2019s actually a very good quarter in both applied and unitary in North America.","I would say that that the weakness is probably more around the mature economy which we could include China and Asia-Pacific. And it\u2019s just a matter of which segments of the market are going to be working there and not specifically in China, it\u2019s easy to identify it\u2019s going to be areas like nuclear, pharma, food and it\u2019s going to be away from some of the housing industries like shipbuilding and so on and so forth. So we will adjust accordingly, and how we are looking at that, so. And then Europe has been very strong for us as well, in fact the applied business in Europe was up high-single digit. So it\u2019s pretty good quarter for bookings and I think we\u2019ll see that flow through to the balance of the year and obviously for the Climate segment, we should end on higher note.","Julian C. H. Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities, LLC","Thanks. And then in terms of the gross productivity measures, is it fair to say that those have been fairly steady the past six months? I guess in Q4 you just have a costs rising up to offset that and then they fell back again in Q1, but overall gross productivity should be fairly steady through the balance of the year, there was nothing special in Q1?","","Michael W. Lamach","Well, remember too that the gross productivity really hasn\u2019t changed much between Q4 and Q1 for operations. That uptick we saw was really on headquarter spending, it related to lot of the benefit plans and changes that had to be approved from the fourth quarter on a strong year. So but operationally, what we were planning to run was about 120% of the pipeline that we think we needed the productivity in a given quarter or year and that\u2019s been a pretty good mechanism for us to make sure we\u2019ve got enough on the productivity pipeline to keep things coming. So it was a good quarter, but the underlying productivity in quarter four was good too. I think it was a little bit misunderstood because of the blurring all the adjustments and accruals made outside of operations in the fourth quarter.","Operator","","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin from BofA Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Obin \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Hey guys. Just a question on the industrial side. And I'm just surprised that given all the excitement about short cycle industrial recovery, industrial even ex the Club Car business is sort of not doing better. Can you talk about what kind of visibility we have on industrial in mature markets in North America and Europe?","Michael W. Lamach","Well, visibility on compressed air systems and services is pretty good, Andrew and we got a pretty look there for the most part when you \u2013 as you look at the quarter about two-thirds of the leverage missed expectation would have been through the Club Car and they did a fantastic job getting golf fleets out in the quarter, but what had to give was the ability to get some of the utility vehicles that go with that out which will be through second quarter and third quarter of this year.","The remaining one-third on the deleverage piece of that was heavy in terms of the investments question was asked earlier and a lot of that is not just in channel and not in product, but it\u2019s also in kind of putting the right level of talent into these business units power tools, fluid management, material handling. We are seeing really good bookings in material handling, as an example. We are seeing very good bookings and fluid managements little weaker \u2013 little weaker in capacity, and Club Cars as we have mentioned has got low-single digit growth. So I feel like for the long cycle businesses, which really are minor at our Club Car, material handling and the compressed air assessment services business, pretty good visibility for the year. Power tools tends to be motor spot buy and fluid management attracts with a lot of what you are seeing in comparables in other companies as well. So and just that core visibility too at this point. I feel good about the plan, we\u2019ve got for the balance of the year to bring margins back up over the balance of the year.","Andrew Obin \u2013 Merrill Lynch","And just to clarify on orders, do you think orders were impacted by the weather? And if yes, you think you're going to get them back in second quarter?","","Michael W. Lamach","Orders not so much, shipments of Club Car, absolutely but orders not so much. And so I wouldn\u2019t think there will be much or more of a push there. I would suppose that I would think about it being something more fundamental being pushed in the second quarter. We think didn\u2019t have any issues in any of our factories whether it would be Climate or Industrial, I don\u2019t think we lost a minute of downtime to anything other than weather. So we were able to keep up the inventory levels where we had stocking in tools and fluids were pretty good.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies.","Stephen E. Volkmann \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning. I might be splitting hairs a little bit here, but I guess I'm just trying to think through this order question as well. You put up a couple quarters of 5%, but they are only kind of guiding the year up 3% to 4% in terms of revenue. Is there anything that would lead you believe things will decelerate going forward or is this just kind of normal conservatism?","","Michael W. Lamach","I think it\u2019s got a more of a long cycle view as to whether or not we think things will happen in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year that picked on some of the bookings we\u2019re seeing, a very large compressed air business services and very large applied HVAC orders and that\u2019s two areas that as you look through that and sort of some delays on these projects are particularly from some of the matured economies in Asia, it\u2019s a little bit hard to pinpoint exactly when we would see those, revenue for the year.","So that\u2019s probably the one blind spot. I would also say that as you look at our year, 10% in the first quarter of earnings, really there is a lot of runway left here for the balance of the year and for us pressure conservative a view, so much of it is a pragmatic view that we got a long way to go for the year. So I think July for us is a much more useful update for you than it would be, I would try to pinpoint here in April.","Stephen E. Volkmann \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Okay. I can appreciate that. And maybe if I could ask you to comment on the tenor of the quarter? Did things get kind of better into March? And any early read on April yet?","","Michael W. Lamach","March was pretty good for us. You know I will tell you that, you know, we have good strength, even in the HVAC res business, January and February just picked up the second hearty sell through. We actually matched the five in January and the nine in February. March we haven\u2019t seen yet. So we\u2019re anxious at some point to get that data as well but we're matching at least the hearty segment there, and I think that we were happy with March\u2019s performance. I am not going to give you much more of a read in the second quarter, it\u2019s pretty early for us and I think I said all along so much of the year, we really delivered in the last couple of weeks of June for us.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from Citi Research.","Deane M. Dray \u2013 Citigroup Inc","","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Michael W. Lamach","","Good morning.","Deane M. Dray \u2013 Citigroup Inc","","Mike, I had a question on the potential that Douglas systems would gain more adoption in the U.S. and in Europe. So just looking in your crystal ball today, how fast might you see the take on Douglas? What might be gaining factors be in this Trane, have the right capacity in place to response to this demand, if it does comes through?","Michael W. Lamach","","Yeah, we\u2019re counting on the world being a Douglas placed and being a player across the world in all geographies. It is interesting that we don\u2019t hear as we much about Douglas portions in other parts of the world, but our unitary business in Asia was the larger business; it is actually a 35% in the quarter. So we\u2019re growing in that business as well. We want to have a full product suite, we want to have Douglas systems, we want to have applied and unitary systems and then we want to have hybrid systems where it XSense of, it\u2019s really a matter of building up portfolio. Relative to your question about do we have the product portfolio, I would say yes we do and if we don\u2019t we have the right partnerships, but I think we\u2019re doing the right things for the results in position to be a global player in all technologies.","Deane M. Dray \u2013 Citigroup Inc","","Great and then for Sue, I was hoping you comment on the stranded cost from Allegion size first where it stands and what\u2019s the Horizon is for taking those costs out?","Susan K. Carter","","Okay so the best way to think about all of that is to think about most of those stranded costs being in the corporate number. So as we have talked about corporate and what we think corporate will look like, the unallocated portion of it for 2014, we expect that to be about $200 million for the year. 2013 and that corporate number was $260 million, so there were about $40 million of stranded cost which came out and then about $20 million of other savings that we planned into 2014. So in the fourth quarter, we did all our restructuring actions that again some of those fell over into the two senses that we saw in Q1, but those costs are primarily out of Ingersoll-Rand. We are completely with that restructuring in the stranded cost have gone away.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Well, thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to (indiscernible) of North-American Trane leverage, you call that 20% incremental margins and that\u2019s going volumes are still pretty like that, but I\u2019m wondering could you just talk about base cost productivity pricing and how does that\u2019s been leveraged as the volumes pickup 15 years, types of those, what sort of incremental margins could you get from Trane North-America?","Michael W. Lamach","Well, Nigel, it was about point of productivity looking at core gross productivity, less total inflation and then from a price perspective, about 70 points on price alone. So in general they just done a good job of consistent productivity to keep the pipeline full, there\u2019s not been a silver bullet, same things as we\u2019ve talking about four, five years there and just a very excellent quarter, excellent execution of that. The startup, it wasn\u2019t weather related. We did lose a minute in production in many of our factories, so I\u2019m proud of that. I\u2019m not sure what else I could really to tell you on that one.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","How that business will leverage as particularly the commercial HVAC volumes start to pick up?","Michael W. Lamach","","Nigel, as we think we\u2019ll leverage at about the gross margin of the business and so I\u2019d be looking potentially if that would be as high as 30 and as we set as low as 25, this is where the guidance is.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan from Nomura Securities.","Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities Co. Ltd","","Good morning.","Michael W. Lamach","Hi, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities Co. Ltd","Hey Mike, maybe just to follow-up on that. I mean the 57% conversion in climate, and I think you said 230% North American Trane, I mean I know you're expecting good leverage going forward, but I guess what are the things that make it come down from that level?","Michael W. Lamach","","Well it is a timing of productivity. I mean there were no one half that happened; it\u2019s somewhat on low growth, the law of small numbers working for you in this case as well. So I just think as you would kind of get into a fuller year with larger numbers and more normalized in margins incrementals going forward. You\u2019re going to tend to revert back to gross margins business. That's fundamentally what the view is.","Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities Co. Ltd","Okay, no, that makes sense. And then just maybe update, you talk about potentially toggling to M&A, I mean what are your current views of that market in terms of what's out there and how active do you think you might be?","Michael W. Lamach","","Well, we\u2019ve been very selective. We got a small in the first quarter on energy supply company that we didn't take any headlines with that but \u2013 so we\u2019re looking selectively. We've got a few smaller things that are really tucked into the commercial channel for HVAC that we\u2019re looking at. But it\u2019s been and continues to be a pretty disciplined process, really nothing or chattering, simply nothing transformational in the cars, but those, probably I would say active ideas we\u2019re looking at, it will be based as Sue said on evaluation and a holding in Europe to our share price however our investments has been, what we think as best of the shareholder year out. So that\u2019s our view.","Operator","","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski from MKM Partners.","Josh C. Pokrzywinski \u2013 MKM Partners LLC","","Hi, good morning guys.","Michael W. Lamach","Good morning.","Josh C. Pokrzywinski \u2013 MKM Partners LLC","So just maybe to beat this operating leverage question to death, looking at 2Q, it seems like a lot of that strength persists and I know you mentioned that 1Q, some of that's just a function of good productivity on smaller absolute volume numbers. I guess that implies some decel there in second half. Is that a comprehensive view on maybe some of that problematic steel pricing that you mentioned or lower productivity pipeline for the second half or is that just we don't have the visibility yet to make that call?","Susan K. Carter","","As I think one of the ways I would look at it, and Mike can add his thoughts afterwards. As we talked about where we expect the second quarter to be and that we really haven\u2019t updated the guidance for the full year and that we were talking more about that in the July. I think what you are seeing on that leverage and the calculation is just a math at this point in time, I think we feel good about, we feel very good about where climate came out in the first quarter. We feel very good about where we\u2019re looking at both businesses as Mike said in roughly the gross margin territory for the second quarter and as we get into July, we\u2019ll give you more color on what we think of the full year will look like.","Michael W. Lamach","","Yes, Josh, I'd probably add what I am looking at quarter one and quarter two from both segments and the productivity really says same which is exactly what we were looking for as that 120% pipeline drum beat that with breakage products that you get so what you, you thought you would get 100% maybe do better that\u2019s always a good thing, if you can do better, but it is split, is there going to a pipeline. I would say that investments would pickup, particularly in the climate business a little bit, tying with the things, like new product launches, but and also you get second quarter the effect of all the wage increases, which across the company start in April 1.","So you\u2019ve got a little bit of a run rate change there and the wage fixtures up, every (indiscernible) back or something like the gross margins, and that\u2019s a pretty steady drumbeat that we look to obtain overtime. So we are going to have great quarters like we had \u2013 and we are going to have some weak quarters in there, but 25 is a good number we have planned with 30 that would be the gross margins of the business. So that\u2019s what we look to do.","Josh C. Pokrzywinski \u2013 MKM Partners LLC","","Okay, that's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, and I think Nigel asked this question, I don't know if you addressed it directly, any differences between applied and unitary? I know you've done some big product refreshes on both sides. Any differences there when we start to see that applied business pick up? Whether it is mix positive or negative, I guess should we expect that to attained differently when that finally comes around?","Michael W. Lamach","","Yes, with all the restructuring has been done over the last four to five years, all the five allotments taking place. We are in different really as \u2013 if unitary or applied goes up, there is really not a change in the contribution margins of the business and so, it\u2019s the nice thing is we\u2019re \u2013 I think, we are levered either way, and I wouldn\u2019t expect that things would change, one way or the other with the higher applied versus unitary mix. So I mean right now, of course we are using how unitary and applied eventually it will take a back around.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.","","Stephen Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","","Hi, good morning.","Michael W. Lamach","Hi Steve.","","Stephen Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","","The way you guys started this year, Mike, maybe you can contribute and offset some of these rounds played that are down, should be a pretty good spring for you guys sounds like.","Michael W. Lamach","Good.","Stephen Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","The incremental margin question, I guess I want to get a little more precision on this because to get to $1.10 in EPS, using kind of the 4% to 5% growth rate, it seems like there is a little bit of a higher kind of implied incremental. What is corporate going to be in the second quarter? I guess and then I can kind of guess back into what that implies for the segments.","Susan K. Carter","","So when you think about corporate and we are spending it should be roughly $15 million-is, can you take that $200 million for the year and it\u2019s roughly the same throughout the quarters. And what we\u2019ll find, when you are thinking about this in terms of leverage is that the quarters in 2013 the corporate cost and the corporate components rationally increasing. Therefore, taking out this stranded cost and taking out some of the G&A cost will provide a bigger list in terms of leverage as we go through each of the successive quarters and we do see that in the second quarter.","Stephen Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sure. And then I guess just for the so \u2013 you can kind of based on, you told us what the industrial margin range is going to be, I'm getting something around 14% for the climate margin in 2Q?","Susan K. Carter","","Yes, 13.5%, yes, somewhere nearly, you are not far off.","Michael W. Lamach","","Yes, if we look at 40 to 80 basis points maybe for the full year and last year it was around 12.7% so, kind of 13.5% is public view much better number than 14% there. The incremental Sue, mentioned really in her comments, our 30% and even said, probably more precisely like 31% from the businesses together. 10 points of lift comes from the high quarter\u2019s reduction and so there is a little better incremental margin in Q2 versus Q1. That was planned. Of course weather wasn\u2019t planned, but the transition to the ERP system was planned and so that didn\u2019t really change much in terms of what we had expected there.","Operator","","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","","Hey, guys. Just a couple loose end items. Can you just talk about the sustainability, the strength you\u2019re seeing in Thermo King? And then also, the commercial HVAC orders down in Asia. Is that bad lumpiness or is that kind of the trend you\u2019re seeing over in Asia?","Michael W. Lamach","","Well, the lumpiness really has to do with just sort of the macro economy in China and we\u2019re dealing with that like everybody else. There are some very, very big deals in Asia that would swing that, but absence of hotels, hospitals and pharma, some nuclear \u2013 there is some real weakness in some of the other segments of the market, really actually the weakness in industrial plays through the HVAC where, if not the largest, one of largest process cooling providers out in that marketplace. So then semiconductor businesses go down. We feel that in the HVAC business. They\u2019re actually just to sustain. So that\u2019s an example there.","Your question on TK and the outlook there, it\u2019s a good start to the year. Containers have run more like 5% of our total TK mix. It was 10% in the quarter. Those are very, very lumpy in terms of how that works. And so the underlying businesses, we\u2019re strong in Europe, I think that that moderates and normalize for the balance of the year. And North America, truck and trailer is about what we thought in fall of the year, little difference there. Well, that\u2019s flat industrial volumes, but our revenue picked up some mix with the new product and more expenses with the new curve of compliance.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","","Thanks a lot.","Michael W. Lamach","Welcome.","Operator","","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jamie Sullivan from RBC Capital Markets.","Jamie Sullivan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","","Good morning. Thanks. Mike, maybe just some of the market commentary you mentioned with the Dodge revisions? You also talked about in North America, your applied orders were up in the quarter, but you\u2019ve also been a little more cautious on the market forecast. Just wondering if you can maybe give us an update on if these trends maybe change your view on the cycle at this point?","Michael W. Lamach","","Yes, and we always look at a group of indicators. I think I say that every time. We make, but I\u2019m always cautious. Somebody might be new to listening to a call. One of the key areas of the Dodge putting in place the starts data, which we triangulate with a couple of other metrics, one that we also think is important. This is what\u2019s happening in terms of our own proposal pipeline that we can look at the same. So related Dodge forecast for 2014 put in place up about 8% versus 2013.","And you got to look at the underlying trends by verticals within that institutional. It\u2019s over half of the put in place dollars, is actually forecasted to be down 2% in this revision and that\u2019s for sixth consecutive of that happening. Of course the AVI numbers were a little bit weak this morning as well, but the commercial industrial activity is forecasted to be up 18%. So really on the commercial industrial activity, my view would be that will come down slightly from 18%. I don\u2019t think it will stay there. I think they\u2019ll revise it down. And I think that the applied market, at least what we\u2019re seeing, it might be a little bit stronger than what we\u2019re seeing there.","One of the interesting things that we saw today was that property tax receipts in the county now or at the 2008 pre-recession levels and that\u2019s always a pretty good indicator of one institutional spending comes back, schools, K-12, healthcare, bond issuances for infrastructure, I mean those are typically, that\u2019s a cycle we look for there. Anyway that sort of the mix that we\u2019ve got to kind of maybe hedging back a little bit on the industrial and commercial forecast on a team, we probably (indiscernible) on the applied side, so that doesn\u2019t really change much for the year for us.","Jamie Sullivan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","","Thanks. And then just a follow-up on the resi side, maybe you can just comment on what you're seeing on the mix of efficiency levels that you're seeing in revenues and orders? And then maybe your expectations for a pre-buy or inventory build ahead of the January cut off for the new efficiency standards next year?","Michael W. Lamach","","Yes things are trending toward higher efficiency, so trending up towards 2014, at this point using the 2013 there and that change is good for us, good for the industry as well. Relates to any sort of a pre-build, the nice thing here is that we\u2019re going to have a pretty good opportunity to look at the price gap between 2014, 2013 stay at the end of the year in the marketplace. That\u2019s going to drive a lot of what happens in terms of the pre-build of course the larger the gap, the more pre-build that you would see, the smaller the gap, less you would see.","We\u2019ll rollup a view from all of our dealers and distributors and closer to the end of the year, a nice thing about all of that is we would be building air conditioning \u2013 our air conditioning plants in the fourth quarter which is a very seasonally low quarter. So all of that pretends to being able to take a relatively late look in the summer at that and then planning accordingly for fourth quarter based on the variables, dynamically I just mentioned.","Jamie Sullivan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","","Thank you.","Michael W. Lamach","","Thank you and our final question for today comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Securities.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities","Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Just to clean-up issue, you had a very impressive first quarter despite all the weather and issues and postponements, stuff like that. You have any measure of how much production was actually pushed into the second quarter from the first quarter? Particularly, looks like in industrial it's got to be measurable at this point?","Michael W. Lamach","","Yes, it was exception of Club Car, everything else with the push, we had higher demands of parts and services and lower demand for few industrial parts but generally we have pushed, but Club Car was the big out layer there for us. From a production standpoint, nothing else really pushed from a distribution standpoint, I mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve got a week more in backlog and we would like to have a residential business that can shift more orders and what we flushing that out of the next weeks or too.","","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities","","Great, and could get some quantifications? Is that like $20 million or $30 million worth of production that we're going to see in catchup in the second quarter? That's looks like it's something to that effect?","Michael W. Lamach","","If I looked at the resi keys of that is probably not too far off, the club car piece, second, third quarter that will kind of picking there as well. I would say that you\u2019re probably in the ballpark on that and that\u2019s for the quarter, you can take in the second quarter up from 4% to 5% reflects that we\u2019ll see a little bit of that, whether it\u2019s a 25% to maybe 40% in total but some of that.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities","","That's helpful. And then finally, your restructuring I guess is implying $0.07 in the second half of the year, a little bigger. Is there any change causing the back half orders? Is it always been that way? And does it say anything about 2015 restructuring, since your numbers are strong in the second half of the year than the first half?","Michael W. Lamach","","Maybe there were a lot of restructuring for the long time I would say. I think that what you got here is the maintenance piece, the $0.10 which has been typically what it\u2019s run for us. And so the $0.03 being that is in the first half, we selling from the back half, that\u2019s again one of those things you like that, in July. I think we\u2019d have better a view, clearer view of any projects, we want to undertake third, fourth quarter and update you there, but for now that threshold that I think stands and it\u2019s a good number to rely on.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any concluding comments.","Susan K. Carter","Thank you Karen We don't have any further comments. Joe and I will be around for follow-up today. Everybody have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may now disconnect.

Zac Nagle, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Zachary A. Nagle - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thanks, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Ingersoll-Rand's first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. This call is being webcast on our website at ingersollrand.com, where you will find the accompanying presentation. We are also recording and archiving this call on our website. Please go to slide 2.

The participants on this morning's call are Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO; and Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO.","With that, please go to slide 3 and I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thanks, Zac, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Please go to slide 3. We're off to a strong start for the year. But before I get into the details, I'd like to begin the call with a brief review of the fundamental elements of our business strategy which drives long-term value creation for shareholders. The first element of our strategy is to continually deliver profitable growth through leadership positions and durable markets. Our end markets are underpinned by global megatrends such as sustainability, and the need to dramatically reduce energy demand and resource constraints in buildings, homes, industrial and transport markets around the world.","We focus on innovation and delivering the most reliable energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly products and services available, enabled by digital and other exponential technologies. We excel at delivering energy efficiency, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing food waste, preserving natural resources and generating productivity for our customers. We invest heavily in products and solutions to support our competitive edge here, and this continues to be a winning formula for us with our customers and our end markets. Our continued strong growth rates reflect that advantage.","We also take the same advice we give our customers seriously. In 2014, we publicly committed to increase our energy efficiency and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions related to our operations and products. The commitment includes a 35% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from our own operations by 2020, which we achieved earlier this year, two years ahead of schedule. We conducted an energy audit of our own large facilities and upgraded air-conditioning systems, building controls and lighting, eliminated energy leakage from our compressed air systems, while measuring validating, and reporting the results.","We are continuing to deepen our commitment with investments in renewable energy, both on-site at some of our large locations, and offsite through a power purchase agreement. We engaged our own Trane energy services business to provide a roadmap and how to be smarter about our energy purchases into organized investments that are responsible for the environment and good for our business. As it relates to energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, we're proud to be walking the talk. Second, our business operating system is designed to excel at delivering strong top line incremental margins and free cash flow over the long term.","Our business operating system underpins everything we do, and enables us to consistently generate high levels of free cash flow, which drives our dynamic capital allocation strategy. And finally, over the years we built an experienced management team and a high-performance culture which gives me confidence in our ability to deliver strong results consistently over the long term. As we consistently execute our strategy, we continue to build a stronger, more sustainable company for the long term, well positioned to deliver strong shareholder returns.","Moving to slide 4. I'd like to spend some time discussing how things are shaping up at this early stage in the year. It's important to note that given the seasonality of our business being heavily weighted towards Q2 and Q3, we are just a small fraction of the way into 2018. As I said earlier, we are off to a strong start and there are a lot of things that are going well. Our end markets are strong, and we are executing well as evidenced by our high levels of growth in both bookings and revenues globally in both our Climate and Industrial segments.","Our Industrial segment continues to make steady improvement ahead of our expectations. All the hard work our Industrial team has done to transform the business commercially and operationally and to restructure the business to take costs out of the system is paying off. The Industrial end markets are also showing steady signs of recovery which is positive. Our China direct HVAC sales strategy that we've been highlighting since early 2017 is performing as expected with continued exceptional growth in the marketplace and with improving financials. We're also seeing positive signs the North American Trailer market will likely perform better than most had anticipated entering the year, based on tight industry capacity, regulatory changes in U. S. tax reform.","Lastly, we're achieving positive pricing that is consistent with our expectations in targeted end markets to combat material cost inflation. On the other side of the ledger, material inflation across the industry and for Ingersoll-Rand is both volatile and persistent, and continues to be a headwind. We realized adjusted operating margin expansion of 20 basis points despite these increasing headwinds through strong volume and price. Commodity headwinds are broad-based across tier 1 and tier 2 markets and in freight where tight industry capacity is ratcheting up freight cost materially.","We're managing the entire P&L to drive margin expansion in 2018, and are taking decisive actions across volume, pricing, productivity and our cost structure to help mitigate further impacts from inflationary headwinds. There are also a few wild cards in play including potential tariffs, potential for trade wars, and significant geopolitical uncertainty that challenge visibility into full year 2018. On balance, whilst it's still very early in the year, our Q1 results and our positive outlook for the balance of the year are encouraging and gives us confidence that we are well positioned to exceed the top end of our annual guidance ranges on both revenues and earnings per share. We'll provide a detailed guidance update after we have a couple of quarters under our belt on our Q2 earnings call consistent with our guidance cadence.","Please go to slide 5. We've adopted a somewhat different format this quarter. We'll continue to provide transparency around the directional changes in bookings and revenue. Historically, the level of detail we provided combined with success of our strategic growth programs has offered a high level of specificity on our performance for investors but can create competitive challenges. Our intent is to provide additional insight into the key qualitative factors behind the numbers that are driving performance without providing a comparative roadmap. This format should provide investors a greater fundamental understanding of our business, which we believe is in the best interest of the company and our shareholders over time.","So the sell-side analysts out there that follow the company, we really aren't trying to drive you crazy, but we are trying to be pragmatic on how we run the business. In the first quarter, we drove positive growth in bookings and revenue across the board as indicated by the positive signs on the chart. Over the past few quarters, we have seen positive signs of a steady recovery in our Industrial end markets. Combined with continued healthy growth in the majority of our climate businesses globally, we saw positive growth across the board in the first quarter.","Please go to slide number 6. This slide provides insights and color into the key drivers behind the chart in slide 5, and how're thinking about the outlook for the year albeit still at an early stage. In commercial HVAC, we're seeing positive growth in the markets globally with good growth in both equipment and services. North America growth was solid with gains in equipment, and particular strength in services, contracting and controls. Institutional growth was solid led by the education and healthcare markets. Europe, the Middle East and Africa commercial HVAC had solid growth across the board, and we saw additional growth in services from our rental service business, ICS Cool Energy, which we discussed on our fourth quarter 2017 earnings call, and closed early in the first quarter.","Our direct sales strategy in China is on track with our expectations where we're seeing continued strong revenue growth and expect improving financials in 2018. Our outlook for total commercial HVAC remains healthy for 2018, and key economic and market indicators largely support our view. Turning to residential HVAC, revenues were also strong with continued share gain. Our market-leading Trane Go, our online total installed pricing transparency tool that we referenced during our Investor Day last year, is delivering well against our expectations with significant growth in leads and high conversion rates from leads to sales.","Key economic indicators in this market also support continued growth through 2018, although we and the industry are lapping tough compares versus high growth rates in 2017. So that's an important factor to keep in mind. Transport continues to be a good news story for us. Our business remains diversified and resilient. We're also seeing improvement in the North American trailer outlook for 2018 fueled by tight shipping capacity, regulatory reforms and the benefit of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that allows for the immediate expensing of certain capital equipment purchases. We saw solid order momentum in quarter one.","APU growth remained strong. The marine market is showing considerable strength through the first quarter, although we have a relative modest sized marine business. Bus and rail were mixed, again off a relatively moderate sized base for us. We're seeing continued solid growth in Europe, the Middle East and Africa truck and trailer. We built this into a nice size business for us over time. Overall, the transport market should be stronger than we originally expected in 2018, primarily led by improvements in North America trailer and continued solid performance elsewhere. Compression Technology services is seeing continued signs of an industrial recovery, consistent with industrial production and other key indicators.","Quarter one bookings and revenue growth was led by North America and China, with particular strength in services. For 2018, we expect to see solid growth in the majority of our markets and products. Small electric vehicle growth was healthy, driven largely by successful market penetration of our consumer vehicle, and we expect that to continue through 2018. We also expect to see continued good growth in our Industrial Products business, which is off to a strong start in quarter one. I hope this provides you with additional insight into our business and what we're seeing at this stage in the year.","And now I'd like to turn it over to Sue to provide more details on the quarter. Sue?","Susan Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thank you, Mike. Please go to slide number seven. We delivered strong operating results in the first quarter, headlined by 23% year-over-year adjusted earnings per share growth. Gains were driven by operating income improvement in both our Climate and Industrial segments. Revenue growth was primarily driven by strong volumes and supported by the realization of positive price on key products. Inflation was higher than we planned and a significant headwind to margin expansion.","As Mike outlined earlier, netting out our Q1 performance and our visibility into the balance of the year, we are confident that we will exceed the high end of our guidance ranges on both revenue and earnings per share. We took $44 million in restructuring charges in Q1 driven primarily by footprint optimization in our Compression Technologies business as we continue to work to optimize that business for peak future performance. It's important to note that this restructuring was planned for Q1 as a part of our annual guidance of approximately $0.20 of restructuring. This is unchanged.","Our Industrial business continues to perform well with good growth and 190 basis points of adjusted margin expansion. The investments we've made in fundamentally restructuring the business operations are paying off. Capital allocation was balanced in the quarter. We paid $112 million in dividends and repurchased $250 million in shares. Our acquisition pipeline remains active, and we anticipate regulatory approval of the Trane JV with Mitsubishi in the second quarter.","Please go to slide number 8. As we've discussed, strong organic revenue growth coupled with adjusted operating margin expansion led to strong adjusted earnings per share growth in the quarter. Foreign exchange and acquisition-related growth also provided tailwinds on reported revenues.","Please go to slide number nine. Operating margin improvement was primarily driven by strong volume and positive price, partially offset by inflationary headwinds and continued investments in high ROI projects. Productivity in the quarter was low year-over-year but consistent with our expectations based on the timing of projects, and we expect improvement for the balance of the year. The 40 basis points negative price versus material inflation was largely consistent with our expectations for sequential improvement on this metric, despite significantly higher inflationary headwinds in the quarter.","Please go to slide number 10. Strong operating income expansion in both our Climate and Industrial segments combined for approximately $0.14 of earnings per share, and were the primary drivers of our 23% earnings per share growth in the quarter. We saw a negative impact of about $0.01 from higher corporate expenses related to stock-based compensation primarily tied to time-based vesting. $0.01 from discrete interest expense associated with the company's debt refinancing in the quarter and $0.01 from modestly higher effective tax rate year-over-year. We also saw a $0.02 benefit from the impact of share repurchases in 2017 and 2018 year-to-date.","Please go to slide number 11. Climate delivered 8% organic revenue growth in the quarter. Adjusted operating margins were lower by 50 basis points, impacted primarily by strong volume and positive price, more than offset by persistent inflationary headwinds in tier 1 and tier 2 materials and freight. Our direct sales strategy in China performed as expected, and we expect margins to sequentially improve as we move throughout the year.","Please go to slide 12. Our Industrial business continues to make solid steady improvements in its operating performance. In the quarter, we delivered 9% organic revenue growth and 190 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion.","Please turn to slide number 13. We maintained a strong balance sheet providing continued optionality as our markets evolve. Free cash flow was consistent with our expectations given normal seasonality in Q1, and we remain on track to deliver free cash flow equal to or greater than net income for the year.","Please go to slide 14. We remain committed to a dynamic capital allocation strategy that consistently deploys excess cash to the opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. We maintain a healthy level of business investments in high ROI technology and innovation, which are vital to our product leadership and market momentum.","We have a long-standing commitment to a reliable, strong and growing dividend that increases at or above the rate of earnings growth over time. We will continue to make strategic investments in value-accretive technology and channel acquisitions that further improve long-term shareholder returns. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve, and we maintain a minimum commitment to repurchase shares sufficient to offset dilution. We also see value in share repurchases when shares trade below their intrinsic value.","Please go to slide number 16. Moving on to our topics of interest section, we have one topic to cover that we know are on the minds of investors and worth addressing in our prepared remarks. Tariffs. I think the most important takeaway for the market is that we follow an in-region, for-region sourcing and manufacturing strategy. More than 95% of our products sold in the U.S. are sourced from the U.S. Net, the direct impact from U.S. tariffs on foreign imports should be relatively small. Additional tariffs have been proposed by the U.S. and other countries, but the details of those tariffs and the likelihood of their implementation is uncertain and negotiations are ongoing. So it's unclear how that will play out. We continue to watch this space closely. Over the long term, we are in an industry that recovers cost increases through price.","Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Mike for closing remarks before we take Q&A. Mike?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thanks, Sue. Please go to slide 17. We believe the company is extremely well-positioned to deliver strong shareholder returns over the next several years. Our strategy is firmly tied to attractive end markets that are healthy and growing profitably, supported by global megatrends such as energy efficiency and sustainability. We've been investing heavily for years to build franchise brands and to advance our leadership market positions to enable consistent profitable growth. We've experienced management and a high performing team culture that breeds operational excellence in everything we do. And lastly, we are committed to dynamic and balanced deployment of capital, and we have a strong track record of deploying excess cash to shareholders over the years.","And with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Steve Winoker of UBS. Your line is open.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks all, and good morning.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Good morning, Steve.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, nice to see this level of growth. I just want to get a sense. Last quarter, you had talked about 1Q earnings contribution kind of being lower than seasonal norm. I think you talked about the low end of a normal 12% to 14% range for EPS. Should we expect that to still hold, or when you look at the changes late in this quarter, anything that would lead us to not believe in kind of normal seasonality now that we are hitting Q2, normally I guess, 32% \u2013 30% to 33%?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah, Steve, the business over time has diversified in every way. We talked about that with Transport being more resilient, more diverse. The same thing is true in our commercial HVAC business globally, where service was a major contributor to us in the quarter, that's stripping equipment growth and that's through the form of contracts generally. So it's not just repair fix based on weather. Those sorts of things are helping smooth out a bit of the earnings. So it's hard to probably just go back to historical trends and say that that's the business going forward, because over time like we did with cash over many years, we've been working on smoothing out the cash profile of the company. So there's an operating side of the company to make sure that we are smoothing out between quarters as best we can. Even in the Club Car business, which has got it's own seasonality, the consumer vehicle strategy is a way of offsetting some of that golf seasonality that we normally see there.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","So what does that mean then in terms of what should we think about for the seasonality in Q2?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah, I think Q2 and Q3 will always be our strongest quarters. I just don't know that you can take 10% to 15% of quarter one and quarter two or 45% of quarter one and quarter two, and 55% in quarter three and quarter four anymore. I think at this point in time, we do know we're going to exceed the top end of our guidance. We don't know yet by how much. And we're going to get back to you in quarter two once we've seen quarter two, and I think we'll be more accurate at that point in time.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. On productivity versus other inflation, I think that's the first negative one I've seen overall in like 12 quarters. Maybe, is that just \u2013 and you've put investments elsewhere. So may be a little bit of clarity on that. What's your color on that one?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","There are a lot of major large projects that we invested in and executed in quarter one. And you saw that through structuring as an example. So we think we've loaded up the year and 2019 with good productivity to follow. So I expect to be our normal good productivity offsetting inflation for the year. It's just going to be heavier loaded on larger projects, meaning that there were probably fewer smaller projects we saw in the quarter, but it doesn't change the pipeline where we try to get 125% of what we think we need for the year into the pipeline, and the pipeline remains healthy.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And just on pricing. So you've already put kind of run pricing increases through parts of commercial resi. I mean, where are you relative to kind of the price increases given the commodity behavior already?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Pricing is really hitting expectations for us. We across the board achieved what we thought we would do in quarter one. We closed the gap quite significantly from quarter four. And believe that quarter one might look a little bit like quarter two, but what we've priced and will ship in the back half of the year and how we're thinking about price increases going forward throughout the year should lead to good performance in Q3, Q4. So the guidance we gave last time which was sort of a plus 30-basis point, minus 30-basis point and then biasing you towards the minus 30-basis point, we're really operating right within that minus 20 basis points, minus 30 basis points window.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. I'll hand it off.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Your line is open.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Nice quarter.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Hi, Andy. Thank you.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Mike, this was the best quarterly Climate booking that we've seen in the last couple of years. If we go back to your guidance for the year, you had talked about mid single-digit accepted organic revenue growth for commercial HVAC. But it seems orders are trending a bit higher than that early. So maybe give us a little more color on the acceleration you've seen in orders. You previously mentioned that you can win some bigger applied projects or any of those in the bookings growth that you've had.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thanks, Andy. The nice news is there was nothing in the quarter one bookings that we would have called out are spiked out. That would be a difficult comp for next year. It was very broad based across the globe. And so if you think about going across the globe, North America is shaping up not the way we thought it would shape up, solid growth in equipment. And in institutional markets, education specifically would be around K-12 say versus colleges and universities, K-12 is strong typically with mid-year elections coming, we're seeing more bond issuances that are passing or on the dockets for updating aging school infrastructure. That's good news. Healthcare is strong. It's not so much in acute care. We're seeing that in a lot of the clinics and specialty hospitals there. That's good. There are more of them that's been positive.","Other verticals are generally stable and positive. So if you look at ABI, auto sales, GDP growth, retail sales, non-resi fixed construction, vacancy rates, they all look good. They're all stable, are healthy, and they would point to low single to mid single-digit markets, and we would think that Trane will grow at or above the markets in North America. Europe is strong for us, particularly we're seeing that with a very high activity in our own sales pipelines. We're seeing obviously good contribution from the rental services business that we acquired in the quarter. Economic indicators there are positive around mid single-digits. Brexit is a bit of a wild card, but right now it's not showing up as much of an issue for us.","Asia is led by China. Very strong for us, that's fundamentally the direct sales strategy we put in place. We are very pleased with what we're seeing there, including service growth that we had in the quarter. Realizing it's about half of Asia, other important markets for us like Singapore and Taiwan will be down just a little bit. India will be strong probably out mid single-digit. And Thailand is a nice market for us as well. We'll see modest growth. So anywhere across the world, and I probably would throw Brazil in there as well. Brazil was a good market for us in the quarter and we think that that's on the road to recovery. So just about every place we're running commercial HVAC operations, we're seeing good growth.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Mike, that's great color. So Mike or Sue, just shifting gears for a second. You previously mentioned that you could get 50 basis points of margin expansion overall for Ingersoll in 2018. Is that kind of margin expansion still possible in this environment given your price increases, and you're going to hit productivity projects harder here, or do you get to sort of the higher than your guidance previous guidance from better organic growth, and maybe some modest margin expansion? Like how do we think about that and specifically focusing on Climate margins as well?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah. And it's early in the year. But I think that when you fundamentally boil it down to operating leverage, we'll see better operating leverage in the back half of the year. Some of this is price cost relationship. Some of this is the way that productivity and products are loaded into system. Part of it's based on the assumption that we see continued good volume and mix in the portfolio. So that goes the way it should go then I would say that we would see operating leverage for the company along the lines of what we guided to for the full year of 25%.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks, Mike. I appreciate it.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thanks, Andy.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joseph Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Usually my name is pretty easy to pronounce, but good morning, guys.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Joe, we know who you are. Good morning.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah, so it's a nice quarter. I want to kind of touch on the price cost discussion. Mike, 40 basis points of price cost headwinds this quarter. I know that you guys don't typically love to talk about cadence. But is the right way to think about it that like this is kind of the low watermark for price cost for the year just given the pricing actions that you've taken, or is 2Q going to look similar to 1Q? I'm just trying to get a sense for what your expectation is.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah, I think Q1 and Q2 will look relatively similar, but Q3 and Q4 will pick up. I think Q3, Q4 is relatively flat, particularly quarter four, meaning we're at that point matching cost increase. Now all that's predicated on us having an understanding of what's happening with inflation to the best of our ability. But from a pricing perspective we're layering in prices where prices are given to the market. So as an example HVAC will have a May increase as well. But on project specifically, which have unique pricing, it's factored into those tools as well for pricing into the market place. So I think the back half of the year is stronger, and that's how we kind of get to that minus 20 basis points , minus 30 basis points for the end of the year.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And then maybe just I heard you talk about increased freight earlier. But maybe talk a little bit about how that impacted the quarter, and what you're seeing on the wage inflation side as well, and what you're doing to offset both.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Well, it's a double-edged sword, because if you think about our transport refrigeration customers, they are seeing a 30% increase in their rate per mile and great demand. And if you couple that with what they are doing in terms of taking advantage of tax reform, you're seeing growth in the transport refrigeration market. But on the flipside of that, if you think about the industry, and I'm not a comment specifically on what we've seen, but I'm going to tell you from an industry perspective on dry freight, it's up about 15% over the prior year. So what I would say is that sort of number in the marketplace that is out there, and it's a meaningful number to companies like ours.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's helpful. Maybe one last one. And just thinking about the guidance for the year; historically, you guys have provided an update in 1Q. Is it really just a wildcard to play at this point, the tariffs and the trade wars on why you decided at this point to just wait until Q2 even though your commentary suggests that things are going to be better as the year progresses?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah, there was a year Joe that we did give quarter one update. But generally speaking over a long period of time, we've always reserved for that until later in the year. To us, there are a lot of wildcards out there, inflation being one, but tariffs and trade wars is also something that's I think on a lot of people's minds. And we're seeing that, frankly, on larger industrial projects, decisions being made by customers there, where in that particular customer set, I think it's more concern about tariffs and the cost of input and the location of plants or lines that they would be thinking about either expanding in the U.S. or somewhere else as opposed to tax reform. So where in the transportation markets, our trucking customers have taken advantage of tax reform, as an example, not as worried about tariffs. We're seeing a little different response with our Industrial customers, I think delaying some actions.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Good morning, Steve.","Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Can you just talk about how that price cost headwind, I think you said negative 40 basis points in the first quarter, how that kind of trends throughout the year? How much worse that \u2013 I would assume it gets a little worse in the second and then recovers into the back half.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Well, price gets better in the second, so that's true. We think that inflation probably creeps up a little bit again in the second quarter. So you end up Q1, Q2 relatively flat, kind of think minus 40 basis points is probably a pretty good number there. As you trend through the back half of the year, there's a more meaningful increase in price. And you're really then offsetting which should be relatively flat inflation at that point, because you're lapping pretty high inflation numbers at that point as well. So I think that the back half of the year tends to look flat. The front half of the year tends to look at minus 40 basis points. So you're in that minus 20 basis points, minus 30 basis points range.","Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then when you \u2013 I'm not sure you gave this, but can you just talk about what your resi performance was in the quarter from a bookings and revenue perspective?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah, very solid. Very solid. Continued share gain there, and that was consistent with our expectations. Replacement and new construction, both healthy for us, obviously driven by unemployment and GDP being stable and other indicators that are favoring that. The Trane Go platform, which is the whole total installed pricing transparency tool, is really delivering some significant growth for us, and we're seeing higher leads, higher conversion rates, that's again driving the share gain, I think, there for us as well. And you know this very well, Steve, the tougher market compares Q2 to Q4, but we still think the market will be up low to mid single-digits and we expect share gain to continue there for us.","Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Were you up double-digit in the first quarter?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Not going to comment on specifically there. But I would say that there was share gain in the quarter. And obviously, you all know that it was a pretty good quarter for the industry.","Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from Robert McCarthy of Stifel. Your line is open.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Good morning.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. So two questions. I mean, I guess, one, Mike, as you think about making the turn, this puts a fair amount of pressure on your third quarter just to kind of stand and deliver, right? You become a third quarter team because the seasonality in association with your business. And I know you don't want to get into quarterly guidance or the quarterly cadence. But what will be the expectations for incremental margins in the Climate business in the third quarter to cause you to raise your guidance for the full year? What do you think is implied, the line in the sand for the margin conversion we should expect to see in the third quarter?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah. I'd start with there's really good visibility around Q3 as we stand here in April with half the business being service and the other half being equipment. Most of that equipment being in the backlog and really not relying heavily on book-and-turn to drive the business. So I think that the only wildcard we really have is, if you think about it, is inflation. Pricing will be set on deliveries that were going to be made. The backlog is being built. The service business is humming along. So I feel good about the ability to say that we're going to top the guidance that we gave at this point in time. I just don't want to be more specific about that until we actually see what happens in quarter two.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And then turning just to capital allocation, any kind of update there of how you're thinking about things, particularly given stocks have pulled back there a little bit, cycle definitely looks like a little bit of concern. I mean any way you're thinking about underlying acquisitions or investments or your own stock through the prism of what is maybe a tougher industrial market?","Susan Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","So Robert, as we think about capital allocation and we think about Ingersoll-Rand, the first part that I want to start with is that we continue to have a strengthening balance sheet. Our process around cash flow, around managing investment has been good and will continue to be good. So when we think about capital allocation, and we talked about this in some of the prepared remarks, I don't think it's different than what we've said before. We're going to continue to invest in the business and investing in the business can be CapEx, which we guided at $300 million for the year. It can be in new products, it can be in our sales force, but continuing to invest in the business and that is really important to us.","It's having that strong dividend with growth in the dividend being equal to or greater than our net income. And then when you come to the remainder of the cash flow, I think what you think about is that we are going to deploy the excess cash flow, and how we deploy that last couple of pieces of it is highly dependent on what transpires from the M&A side and the timing of that.","We don't have to do anything on M&A, but we do have a good active pipeline as you can tell from the last four months or five months we've had some technology, some channel, some other things come through the pipeline that have turned out well for us. And what I'd like to see on the M&A side is our ability to grow earnings and to grow a long-term cash flow stream out of the M&A. And on share repurchase, you're right. Shares and the intrinsic value are showing a positive, and we'll see how that turns out. We've committed offsetting dilution. We told you in the original guidance that we had modeled $500 million of share repurchase. But on that toggle between those two, I really would like to see us work the M&A side, work the earnings and cash flow growth side of that, and then be really smart on share repurchase and other aspects of capital allocation.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for your answers.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Hi, Jeff.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Mike, you may have partially answered my question on kind of the project industrial comment. But I wonder if you could elaborate there, I was thinking Industrial orders could have been stronger in the quarter. Obviously, you had kind of a pretty solid back half and there's some lumpiness there. But how do you see the trajectory in the Industrial business playing out maybe kind of on the larger capital side of the business versus maybe some of the shorter cycle elements?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah. Let's first talk about two thirds of the Industrial segment, which is the compressor technology business. And here, we saw really strong growth in services and expect services to continue to grow stronger than equipment which is great to our focuses. We also saw a really good growth on short cycle compressors. We saw growth with some OEM work we do, selling components to other OEMs. And we saw a nice growth in oil-free rotary. So that was excellent growth, and I made a comment already about North America and Asia being stronger regionally. We do see lumpiness though in the very large centrifugal projects, and we're seeing some delays there. And it is driven by micro uncertainty related to tariffs and some of the risk associated there, but we do expect that to recover as well. North America manufacturing looks healthy.","All the verticals there are strong. Processed gas and air separation are expected to be strong this year as well. Key economic indicators are supportive here. Industrial production is at a two-year high. Defense-related aerospace forecast is strong. So we think the markets there will be good. AP will be strong regionally, it's strongest regionally for us. We think that China probably is tapering a little bit from 6% GDP, but we're seeing that there's still good growth in the market there as well. On the other third, the other $1 billion of the Industrial market, really strong growth in small electric vehicles, particularly as it relates to the consumer strategy. And we saw good growth, if not excellent growth in the Industrial products, which for us is going to be material handling, it's going to be our tools and our fluid management business, which is a very high margin business for us.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And then just shifting back to HVAC and then probably really it's more of a resi question. But was there or has there been kind of pre-buying in the channel in front of kind of the next wave of price increases? Does that kind of distort things here as we kind of try to figure out Q2?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah, I don't think the price increase or the time they were given was that different than what the expectation would have been in the prior year. So there could be specific distributors that might have done more than they would have done. But as we look at inventories across the backlog, they're pretty appropriate for where they need to be at this point in time. So I don't see tremendous risk there.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And maybe just one other quick one. How about hedging? I mean, with materials whipping around the way they are, your strategy change, do you want to hedge more, do you want to hedge less? You obviously don't want to be kind of \"betting\" on these items. But any color there would be helpful.","Susan Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah. Jeff, I think, you've got that exactly right. We don't want to be in the speculation business. But let me give you a couple of thoughts on what we're doing today, and maybe options for the future. So today, again, we've got visibility on steel. You can't lock, you can't hedge it. We've got visibility of about six months, three months on pricing and about three months on inventory. So we know what that looks like, and we know what we have to do in terms of price on the steel side of the market. On copper, we lock copper prices, and so we're locking in volumes with our supply base throughout the year. We enter any given quarter at about 70% locked on copper. Actually we're about 66% locked for the year on copper. But what happens on that lock, and I think this is important is, we're giving volume commitment and we're getting pricing commitment out of the supply base.","So in other words, the fluctuations on that copper price are actually belong to the supply base, so any financial hedges are being done on that side of the house. Now, is there pressure for maybe us to take on a little bit more of that with the change in hedge accounting rules and things like that? The answer is perhaps, and in it's perhaps a way to do that. But I think what you would do even if we hedged the actual copper or aluminum, is you would still layer in your purchases so that you're almost doing $1 cost averaging type of move on buying in those commodities. I think you probably end up in about the same place with a financial hedge versus the locks that are out there. So we continue to refine our thinking around that. We continue to work on the processes, which is getting really good and projecting the volumes really good and projecting the timing of those, but I really do think it kind of works like it does today with us getting visibility on our costs so that we can react with pricing if need be.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Your line is open.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thank you.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Good morning, Julian.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Morning. Maybe the first question just on what's happening in your Climate business in China. That was something you called out a few times last year as being a pretty big margin headwind. I think you mentioned that the financials are looking slightly better there. So maybe flesh out that a little bit. And also just strategically, how you're progressing with that market share push?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah, actually I'm going to answer your question and then I'm going to probably add on a little bit which gets to maybe a little bit of Steve Tusa's last question regarding specific kind of guidance or results in different businesses. But the strategy is going very well for us. There's exceptional equipment organic bookings happening there. Just to give you a point of color, the visibility that we have in our project pipeline that we would put all projects into a pipeline that are out there for us to pursue were up 100% year-over-year, meaning they doubled. So we have visibility to twice as many projects as the prior year.","The number of proposals that we provided were up 130%. So the projects were actually finding or even better projects for us to go pursue albeit they might be larger or longer cycle, projects that perhaps distribution wasn't getting at, but our company-owned resources are our direct team is getting at. So very strong growth in bookings there, very strong growth in service there as well, and that is the most important thing. That is mapping how we wanted it to map, which means that the financial pressure there on the margin is getting better as it was planned and should be getting year-over-year. And I would say that, I've got high level of confidence that we'll see 2018 margins that are flat to 2017 margins on a much higher revenue base for the year. And I think in 2019 and beyond it will be a nice tailwind for us as the service business grows.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Understood. Thank you for the color. And then secondly, I guess within the Climate business, you did see an acceleration in the organic bookings growth in Q1 from late last year. I realize you don't want to get into too much detail, but was that all about Thermo King accelerating or the overall transport refrigeration business, or did you also see some improvement in the commercial Trane side?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah. One versus the other was not remarkable in terms of what drove the business. So there wasn't sort of an outstanding performance in one business covering up for another. And getting back to the question that Steve asked a little bit as well, over the last say five years, I've never seen a better linkage from strategy to execution as it relates to the ability for us to identify strategic growth programs, invest the talent and the resources into those, and then get really good results often a multiple of what the underlying growth rate is of the business. And they're mapping exactly to what we planned, and we provide so much detail on these calls, particularly in a tough pricing environment, all we do is put a bull's-eye into back of our salespeople out in the marketplace around sort of where we're penetrating and who we're beating.","So it doesn't really help the company, which means it doesn't help the shareholder for us to be providing too much of that. It also invites a lot of short-termism into the way that people would think about the business because a quarter, whether we have a blowout number or don't, really doesn't change the long-term dynamics of what we're trying to do strategically around growing the business. And so again, we thought long and hard about that, I apologize for the sell-siders who really use that to model, but believe it's in the best interest long-term, certainly of the company's shareholders that we don't provide that much granular information on a go-forward basis. But back to your question, really good growth both in HVAC and in TK. The surprise to us has been the TK business, which is strengthening globally, but also strengthening in North America, specifically around the trailer business that we talked about.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you. It makes sense.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Wojs of Baird. Your line is open.","Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, everybody. Good morning.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Hey, Tim.","Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","I just had a question maybe on just the order growth and backlog, and maybe this will just kind of help us a little bit with the back half of the year. Anyway in Climate to just kind of think about what the margins are in terms of what your booking for orders or what's in backlog maybe relative to what we saw 12 or 18 months ago?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Well, you think about backlog margins being higher because they're going to have higher price on the backlog margin. So if you think about standard cost being roughly the same first half to back half, we're not going to change standards midway through the year. What's different is the pricing coming into that, plus you're seeing, hopefully seeing additional absorption coming into the factory volumes on the higher revenue. So the margins in the back half of the year are better than the front half of the year, and that's sort of the outlook that we've got on why leverage and ultimately margin expansion for the full year happens.","Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. And then just with some of the movements on the debt side in the quarter, any update in terms of how we should think about interest expense for the year?","Susan Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah. Tim the 8-K and the information that we put out there, so let me parse this into two parts, which is 2018 and then post 2018. So in 2018, the benefit on interest expense is about $11 million. On Q1, specifically, actually, our interest expense is up very slightly because of actually having interest on both the refinanced tranches, as well as the new tranches for a short period of time. If I look beyond 2018, the guidance that we gave was about $19 million of benefit 2019 and beyond.","Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Good luck on the rest of the year.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thanks, Tim","Operator","Your next question comes from Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Hi, Rich.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Just following up on one of the earlier questions around price cost. So at the beginning, there was a band of plus 30 basis points to minus 30 basis points for the year, Mike. It sounds like you're in the lower part of that range, but obviously comfortable with how the guidance is going to play out for the year and from an earnings standpoint? Is that the right way to interpret this?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah. In fact, what we talked about was the fact that typically we'd be plus 20 basis points, plus 30 basis points. We said look, let's not be so precise because we've had so much inflation here and it's so volatile that, let's say, it's minus 30 basis points, plus 30 basis points. But within that window, we're confident at that point in time that we're going to be able to get the leverage in the business that we had thought about and communicated to you by managing the entire P&L. And that's the intent. Now within that, we said, let's bias it toward the bottom end of that range. Let's play it safe. Let's look at minus 30 basis points as probably being closer to the reality.","And what we're seeing transpire in the marketplace with price is that we are certainly within the band that we've communicated, say minus 30 basis points. If you looked at a spot forecast, we could say minus 20 basis points today. Understand the volatility in that is moving quite a bit. So I feel good about being in that kind of minus 20 bps, minus 30 bps range at this point, and that will evolve over the course of the year as these wildcards play out.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And I know it's really, really early, but as we think about lap-over impact into 2019 from commodity at this point, and any early thoughts there, early reads there as you think about it. I mean, obviously, you have some time here from a productivity standpoint to execute some things. But just curious on how you're planning for this, looking out 12 months or so.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah. As volatile as it is right now, we're certainly looking at what's happening for the year. So it's not that we're not thinking about 2019, but we'd be really stretching to prognosticate much at this point in time. We want to make sure we can call Q3 and Q4. So at this point in time, I'd hold back on comments there.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks so much.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joel Tiss of BMO. Your line is open.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah, I made it. How's it going? Almost everything has been answered for me, but I just \u2013 can you break apart the pieces of Thermo King? You usually give us a little bit of a better sense of what's happening across some of the pieces, and I just wondered if you could do that again.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah. And it'll take a minute because again it is a diversified business here. But let's talk first about North America trailer, which is where some of the news is. And here you've got tight shipping capacity. You've got tight labor supply in terms of drivers. All driving the 50% sort of industry increase that I've mentioned. You've got regulatory changes here which are also impacting. So this is electronic logging devices specifically. And then you got the benefit of the U. S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. So Act raised their outlook to 44,600. I think last time we spoke, we were kind of biasing around 41,000 and that was a little better than the original plan which is around 39,000. I think, frankly, it's somewhere between 41,000 and 44,600, which is what Act has.","Act may not have thought through some of the constraints around cabs or even about inventory in the marketplace. And so perhaps in the number is 2,000 units or so less than that. It's all good news. Europe should be very solid for truck, for trailer as well broadly, some markets are stronger than others. Interestingly, Russia is about 15% of the market and it's growing a little faster than Europe as a whole. So there is a wildcard there on anything would happen there with further sanctions in Russia. But generally speaking, it's good growth. The APU market is strong and that is really tracking Class 8 sleeper cabs and then our bolt-on rate kind of where we measure the bolt-on from our units on to these sleeper cabs is increasing and that's looking like the plan we laid out for you at the Analyst Day over a year ago at this point in time.","The marine market is strong. I want to say in the quarter, it was up over 220%. The market was up over 220%. It's relatively small business for us, but good growth there. And then bus, rail and air would be mixed. Rail is longer larger projects that are good for us. Bus is a lot of the city kind of transit buses and air is an interesting but small portfolio where we're seeing more biopharma moved through this route. You're seeing sort of 10% increase in the market for moving biopharma in refrigerated containers via air. So that's a strong sign around those businesses. But collectively, those bus, rail, air businesses are something like 10% of the portfolio, so not a large part of the portfolio. Good growth in Latin America, specifically Brazil, and continued good growth in Asia.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And are the prices of acquisitions high enough at this point that we should expect the overall share count to drop a little bit more or you guys are going to keep your kind of methodical approach and try to balance everything out?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","The methodical approach really is just keeping intrinsic value in front of us as we're looking at an acquisition and trying to make the right long-term decision around the acquisition. So obviously, as the share price drops, it makes the intrinsic value greater, it makes acquisitions little bit more difficult. But look, if what we see persists, the price of acquisitions should come down too as well.","So look, let's just let this thing play out, but I think we've shown a very disciplined process over the past few years about why we buy and what we pay for. And I could tell you that what we've bought in 2017 is generating far greater EPS in 2018 and 2019 than share repurchase but that's because we looked at intrinsic value versus the acquisitions and made good decisions and integrated them well into the company.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right. Thank you very much.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Barry of Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Good morning.","Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yeah, I guess I just wanted to, on the margin walk, to get a sense of how you expected the investment spending to track as we progress, does that maybe stay at a 40, 50 basis point headwind through the year?","Susan Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah, I think on investment spending, let's call that similar to 2017 as we go through the year. I think what is important, Robert, on the investment spending itself is what that actually is going into. So we're continuing to work on new products. We're continuing to work on our operational excellence initiatives. There's a small amount of IT. But in terms of how we're going to do that throughout the year, it would look similar to 2017. And the changes that we may see as we go through this and this is an important part of our process is, we've got an investment review board that looks at all of the different components of investments that we do and make sure that we've got the right business cases, the right value creation for all of those investments and that's a really sound practice for us as part of our business operating system that may impact some of the timings somewhat, but I don't expect it to be terribly different.","Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got it, got it. And listen, I can appreciate if you don't want to say any more on this front, but \u2013 and others have touched on this. But you were guiding Climate up 3%, 3.5% and you started out 8% with orders up 11%. So I think we're all just trying to get our heads around like what, if anything, is so materially different or maybe your plan kind of factored something like what we're seeing or there is some shoulder season volatility in there. But just any thoughts on...","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","It actually gets, yeah, it gets very much to my point \u2013 it gets very much my point that strategy is mapping very closely the strategic growth programs and the product growth teams is a success in these markets. And in some cases, I think, we're surprising ourselves around the growth here and that's great. So, it was a very strong quarter delighted to have sort of book that and put it into the backlog and we're going to see how quarter two and quarter three progress.","Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got it. Okay, great. Well, congrats on the solid start. Thank you.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Now we've covered a lot of ground here. I did have a follow-up question for Sue. In your answer to Jeff's question on inflation in steel, I think you said that you can't lock in the prices, but just if you could refresh us my understanding you engage in advance purchasing, so you basically pre-buy or commit 100% of the volume expect each quarter and then ladder that out. Is that still the same practice? But aren't you locking that in for the quarter each time? So is that really locked in or not?","Susan Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","So Deane, great question. On steel, what my comment was meant to be is you cannot do a financial hedge or something of that nature on steel. However, it is a lot like a locking program where we get visibility from spot prices and commitments, contractual commitments from the suppliers on steel that will go out three months. So that we've got visibility to the pricing and then we've also got inventory. So we've got about six months of visibility to price increases or decreases. It's just a matter of there isn't a financial hedging mechanism that's out there on steel, which could be on copper and aluminum.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. That's helpful. And then for Mike, could you update us on the whole initiative around connected buildings. That was a big focus at the analyst meeting. What the take rate is, the number of buildings, the kind of investment you're making, but any color there would be helpful.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah. I'd say the whole digital strategy for the company is probably the largest investment when you look through that across the company if you look at the product growth. It is definitely in the results that we're seeing around why the controls business was up as much as it is. And then specifically on the connected strategy and growth rates there, we talked about sort of 30% compound growth rates and we're continuing to see that take shape. We just made an acquisition in the quarter around another company a small company, a lot of intellectual property and many, many hundreds of thousands of connections through smart meter technology into our platform. So there is more investment happening there as well and we're trying to extend and get a larger footprint. But the strategy is growing roughly 30%. You were seeing that show up in our controls business and it's intentional. That's about all I could say there.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will now return the call to Zac Nagle for closing comments.","Zachary A.

With that, please go to slide 3, and I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thanks, Zac, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. 2017 is on track with a strong first quarter. Our results mark another quarter of proven top-tier financial and operational performance, and are indicative of successful execution of our strategy powered by our business operating system. Our principal approach and the values inheriting our culture have created a unique and lasting commitment to continuous improvement and focus on our customers.","That focus and winning culture translates into the sustainable business results we expect for 2017, and I thank our people around the world for their dedication.","While it's still early in the year, our first quarter performance gives us confidence in raising the low end of our earnings per share guidance range by $0.05, from $4.30 to $4.50 to $4.35 to $4.50. Our free cash flow guidance continues to be 100% of net income, or approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion for fiscal 2017.","And as we indicated in our fourth quarter call, in January of this year we'll be sharing more color on our strategy and longer-term targets out to the year 2020 at our upcoming Investor and Analyst Day in Davidson, North Carolina, on May 10. I know many of you will be able to join us at the event or via the webcast, and we look forward to doing a deeper dive on our business at that time.","I'll start this morning with discussing our business strategy and how that enables us to deliver top-tier performance for our shareholders, our customers and employees over the long term. We'll also give some color on our outlook for our key markets in 2017, which is largely unchanged from the comments we provided on our Q4 2016 earnings call. Sue we'll discuss our first quarter performance in more detail and address some topics we know are on the minds of investors before we take your questions.","Our strong first quarter performance underscores that our strategy continues to deliver results. We continue to deliver profitable growth through leadership positions in growing markets, that are durable because they address a global imperative to dramatically reduce energy demand and resource constraints in buildings, industrial processes, and transportation.","Sustainability is central to our strategy, and we think of that as a lens on the business to identify opportunities to help our customers manage their sustainability impact. Our strategic focus of served us well in the first quarter. We followed our business operating system to capture growth, improve costs, and drive productivity to deliver adjusted continuing EPS of $0.57 and 4% organic revenue growth.","We also expanded adjusted operating margins 20 basis points. Free cash flow was a negative $73 million, but consistent with our expectations given the normal seasonality for the quarter. Additionally, we paid $103 million on dividends and spent $417 million on share repurchases year-to-date.","Growth was led by North American commercial and residential HVAC. The teams here are doing a terrific job of share gain and margin expansion, and we anticipate this momentum to continue through 2017. The residential business had record quarter one revenue and margin performance, combined with market share gains. Looking elsewhere geographically, we also had strong HVAC performance in China. Year-over-year organic revenue growth improved more than 20%.","Our industrial businesses continue to maintain focus on delivering improved operating margins through increasing the service mix, new product development, and cost reductions. Our compression technologies business, for example, realized the highest mix of services to equipment in its history, with quarter one record revenue and bookings for global service agreements.","Moving now to slide 4, I wanted to spend a few minutes providing some color on how we're thinking about our key end markets and businesses on an organic growth basis. So far 2017 is shaping up largely as we expected. The North American commercial HVAC and residential HVAC businesses showed strong growth in the first quarter, and is expected to continue in 2017, driven by all areas of the business, including applied, ducted and ductless unitary, and residential equipment and building controls and services.","Our focus on sustainability is a growth driver here, and our robust new product pipeline to provide highly efficient systems and expand our offerings for HVAC systems with next-generation refrigerants, for example, is having an impact on the business globally. It's allowing us to take share in regions like the Middle East, where we have district cooling opportunities, and in Europe, where we can offer customers products and services ahead of regulatory deadlines.","For Ingersoll-Rand we continue to forecast mid-single-digit growth in commercial HVAC in total, and mid-single-digit growth in residential HVAC, which is essentially a North American business for us. Global industrial markets are generally improving, and we saw that in quarter one. We've seen more positive signs in our general industrial markets in the U.S. and the Eurozone as PMIs have improved. We've also generally seen order improvement across our industrial business. We have had year-on-year growth in orders in our compression technologies business for the past four consecutive months, which is encouraging.","We continue to plan for a modest rise in industrial production and a gradual recovery with bumps along the way. The large engineered compressor market is expected to show signs of improvement due to stabilizing activity in energy markets and heavy industry, and we saw some positive signs of this in the first quarter. We still see year-over-year orders rising in 2017. Even with this, though, we're still planning for revenue to decline due to the depressed 2016 order levels and the average lead time of 12 to 18 months for this type of product.","Excluding these longer-lead-time products, we expect our industrial segment to be flat to slightly up. We continue to expect the transport markets in the Americas to be down from lower volume for trailers and auxiliary power units, partially offset by truck volumes. Transport in Europe is expected to be up modestly, primarily based on truck and trailer sales. We expect continued growth in Asia Pacific on its relatively smaller base. Given the work we've done building out the transport business into a more diversified and durable business, we expect to mitigate the impact from North American trailer declines, and for revenues to be down low single digits.","Golf markets are expected to be flat, and we expect to see some growth in our consumer and utility vehicle markets. The recently launched personal transportation vehicle I mentioned last quarter continues to perform well. Overall we expect club car to be up low single digits. And for those attending our upcoming Investor Day, you'll get a chance to experience one firsthand.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Sue to discuss the first quarter in more detail.","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thank you, Mike. Please go to slide number 5. I'd like to begin with a summary of main points I'd like you to take away from today's call. As Mike discussed, we've started 2017 on a strong note, with continued strong bookings growth, organic revenue growth, adjusted operating margin improvement, adjusted earnings per share growth, and free cash flow in line with our expectations. Our results are on track at this stage in the year, with continued strong bookings growth, and we're therefore adjusting our full-year earnings per share guidance up $0.05 at the bottom end of the range, as Mike discussed earlier. We have a detailed breakout of our guidance for your review in a few slides.","Our bookings and revenue performance were both strong, with growth in both segments. Commercial and residential HVAC led the way, both with high single-digit growth in bookings and revenues. Adjusted operating margins also expanded in both businesses.","We were pleased with our industrial business performance, which is demonstrating steady adjusted operating margin improvement. We continued to take additional actions on operational excellence initiatives, increased commercial focus on aftermarket parts and service offerings, and took additional cost reduction actions to improve operating results going forward. We also drove strong organic bookings growth in the quarter on both equipment and services, which was encouraging.","Earlier in the year we identified our dynamic capital allocation priorities for 2017, including spending $1.5 billion on a combination of share buybacks and acquisitions, and approximately another $415 million on dividends. Year to date, we can report we've spent $417 million on share buybacks and $103 million in dividends. We also made one modest-sized acquisition. We are continuing to follow the capital deployment plan we announced in January.","Please go to slide 6. Our focus on execution of our strategy and operational excellence drove solid year-over-year performance. Net revenues were up 4% organically, and adjusted operating margins improved 20 basis points. Strength in revenue performance was driven by our Climate segment, while operating margin improvement was broad-based across our Climate and our Industrial segments.","Please go to slide 7. Organic orders were strong in the first quarter, up 7% with strong results in both our HVAC and industrial businesses. Climate booking strength was broad-based with growth across the globe and up 6% overall. Organic commercial HVAC bookings were up low teens in equipment, with strong results from both unitary and applied products. Residential bookings again showed strong growth, up high single digits, and continued share gain. We also drove good growth in parts, service, and controls, which is helping us to build a more sustainable business by increasing our income from recurring income streams.","Transport organic bookings were down low single digits, primarily driven by the expected decline in North America refrigerated trailers. Our diversification strategy enabled us to partially offset the decline in trailers through growth in truck and international bookings in the quarter.","The Industrial businesses bookings were up 9% organically in the quarter, led by strength in compression technologies and small electric vehicles. In compression technologies, we saw solid growth in both the long-lead engineered-to-order business, which were coming off a weak first quarter of 2016, as well as in our small to midsize shorter-cycle products. In electric vehicles, we are seeing good growth in our new consumer vehicle, Onward.","Please go to slide number 8. In our Climate segment, organic revenue was up high single digits in North America and Asia, and up mid-single digits in Latin America. Climate organic revenues were down marginally in Europe and down high single digits in the Middle East off a small base. In our Industrial segment, overall organic performance was up slightly. Modest declines in North America and Europe, Middle East and Africa were offset by improvements in Latin America and Asia. Overall North America revenues were up mid-single digits, and international revenues were up low single digits, netting a positive 4% organic revenue growth rate for the enterprise.","Please go to slide number 9. Q1 adjusted operating margin improved 20 basis points, primarily driven by strong volume and productivity, partially offset by material and other inflation. We continued to make significant investments in business innovation and operational excellence to further improve our competitive positioning.","Please go to slide number 10. Overall Climate performance was strong in the quarter, with organic revenues up 6% and adjusted operating margins up 70 basis points to 10.6%. Strong revenue growth in both commercial and residential HVAC was partially offset by transport revenues, which were down mid-single digits in the quarter, primarily due to softening North America trailer and auxiliary power unit markets, partially offset by growth in aftermarket and in Asia. Climate adjusted operating margins expanded 70 basis points year over year, driven by strong execution across the Climate businesses. The impact of higher volumes, productivity, and price far exceeded headwinds from material inflation, ongoing business investments, and other inflation.","Please go to slide number 11. Our commercial focus on aftermarket, operational excellence initiatives, and cost-cutting measures continued to drive operating margin improvement in Industrial in the first quarter. Industrial adjusted margins increased 60 basis points on slightly higher organic revenues. Aftermarket growth was solid, more than offsetting modest declines in compressor equipment. Adjusted operating income and depreciation and amortization was higher by 100 basis points.","Please go to slide number 12. Free cash flow was negative in the quarter, consistent with our expectations and normal seasonality. Our guidance for free cash flow remains unchanged from the $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion range we provided in January. Additionally, our balance sheet remains strong and gives us optionality as our markets continue to evolve.","Please go to slide number 13. Our expected 2017 cash flow continues to enable us to drive a dynamic capital allocation strategy, employing capital where it earns the best returns. In our 2017 guidance, we highlighted our capital allocation priorities. The first was investing in our business as our number one priority. These include investments in innovation and in strategic growth programs. As I moved through the earlier slides I discussed investment in the business multiple times, as it's at the heart of our innovation, growth, and margin expansion story.","The secondary is maintaining a strong balance sheet. We're BBB rated today, and believe this is the appropriate structure for the company. The third area is our commitment to paying a competitive dividend. We've paid an annual dividend for 106 years and have consistently raised this dividend over time. In fact, the compound annual growth rate of our dividend is 20% over the last five years.","The fourth priority is strategic acquisitions and share repurchases, and not necessarily in that order. In 2017 we committed to spend $1.5 billion between these two areas, and year-to-date we've spent $417 million on share repurchases and a modest incremental amount on a key strategic acquisition in the Climate space. We intend to spend the balance of the $1.5 billion during the remainder of 2017. We will continue to create long term value for our shareholders through a dynamic capital allocation strategy, as we have consistently done for years.","Please go to slide 15. As discussed earlier, while it's still early in the year, our first quarter performance gives us confidence in raising the low end of our earnings per share guidance by $0.05. We have largely maintained the other elements for our guidance for the year, so the next few charts will be similar compared to the ones we covered in January.","The main thing I'd like to point out on slide number 15 is that our operating margin guidance targets have gone up somewhat, to reflect the new pension accounting treatment that moves a portion of the cost from the operating line to the other income and expense line below operating income. Net adjusted margins rise by about 10 basis points for each segment, and 20 basis points across the enterprise. We've provided current and restated numbers in our news release tables that outline the impact of the change in more detail.","The difference between our organic and reported revenue contemplates about 1 percentage point of negative foreign exchange from a strengthening U.S. dollar outlook. We continue to expect Climate revenue to be up approximately 4% organically, and for Industrial revenue to be down approximately 1% organically, which is consistent with our prior guidance.","Please go to slide number 16. We've raised the low end of our continuing adjusted earnings per share for 2017 to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.50, excluding about $0.15 of restructuring. We had a large planned restructuring charge of $0.10 in the first quarter related to the consolidation of three plants to further optimize our footprint. We have a number of actions we forecast taking for the balance of the year, but we think approximately $0.15 for the year is still our best estimate at this time.","Please go to slide number 17. There are two FASB accounting changes we adopted January 1, 2017, and want to make you aware of them. First, we were required to adapt accounting standard update 2016-09 in the first quarter. The primary change is to recognize in the P&L any tax windfall or shortfall from stock option exercises and stock vesting, where previous recognition was deferred to the balance sheet. Our planned adoption of the new accounting standard was built into the 2017 guidance we provided in January, and increases the effective tax rate volatility versus the prior accounting.","In the first quarter of 2017, we recognized a non-cash tax windfall of approximately $15 million, which is reflected as a benefit to our tax expense and effective tax rate. Our full-year effective rate guidance of 21% to 22% includes the $15 million benefit recognized in the first quarter, and anticipates a much smaller benefit to be earned in the rest of the year. Excess tax benefits that were not previously recognized in December 2016 were also $15 million. This amount was reclassified to retained earnings as of January 1, 2017, with no impact to the P&L per the new standard.","The second accounting change is related to pension and postretirement benefits. The new standard, ASU 2017-07, impacts where certain components of pension and postretirement benefit expense is recorded in the income statement. However, there's no change to net earnings or earnings per share. Under the new accounting standard, the traditionally more volatile components of benefit expense are now reported in other income and expense, including interest cost, expected return on assets, and amortization of deferred amounts. Service costs remain in operating income, as it represents the services rendered in the current period by participants of these plans.","We adopted this accounting standard in the first quarter of 2017, and re-classed approximately $8 million to other income and expense in the first quarter. 2016 amounts have been revised for comparability and were approximately the same amount in Q1 of 2016. Our 2017 estimate of expenses to be re-classed from operating income to other income and expense is $26 million.","Please go to slide number 18. Our Q1 spend for planned restructuring was approximately $33 million, related to consolidating three manufacturing plants and distributing their products to other facilities in the same region. Facilities were in both our Climate and Industrial segments. The actions further our region-of-use philosophy to localize manufacturing and the supply chain to help us achieve greater speed to market and implement local product preferences. We expect to spend approximately $0.15 per share for total restructuring expense for full-year 2017.","Our corporate costs of $68 million for Q1 were generally consistent with our initial forecasts for the quarter, and were higher than last year due to planned incubator investments in technologies that benefit all businesses. These investments are heavier in the first half of the year versus the second half. We also had an increase in other employee benefits and stock-based compensation timing. We continue to expect full-year corporate spend to total $240 million for the year.","Please go to slide number 20. As we've done for the last couple of quarters, I'll comment on a few topics that we know are of the interest to you before we open it up for questions. I'll first touch on currency as a headwind for us in 2017. About 35% or $4.8 billion of our revenues are outside the U.S. Our 2017 forecast has built in the continuing strength in the U.S. dollar, which will impact us most notably in the euro and the Asian currencies. Overall, we continue to expect a 1% drag on our revenues from currency translation, which will have about a $0.10 negative impact on our earnings per share.","We also know price and material inflation is top of mind. Price was positive for us in the first quarter in both segments. Material inflation offset positive price, driven by steel and Tier 2 components. We have 10 basis points positive price covering material inflation in our guidance. We've been through various cycles and have a strong history of capturing price to material inflation. For 2017, we expect a negative first half price-to-material-inflation gap, and expect to recover in the second half.","Please go to slide 21. Covering our transport business, we are on track with expectations. For 2017 overall, we continue to expect Thermo King revenues to be down low single digits year-over-year. The North America trailer industry is expected to be down. We're also expecting a continuation for relatively soft market for auxiliary power units and marine containers. Those declines will be partially offset by gains in Europe, Asia, and aftermarket revenues. Through restructuring and efficiency, we would expect only a minor erosion of record 2016 operating margins.","And finally, I know we'll receive questions on the status of Industrial. Industrial drove strong first quarter organic bookings, up 9%, and organic revenue growth was a result of significant aftermarket growth in the compression technologies business and continued growth of Club Car. Looking at a regional perspective, organic revenue growth in Asia and Latin America was partially offset by declines in North America and Europe, Middle East, and Africa.","As we indicated earlier, we expect the industrial markets to stabilize in 2017, although we cannot declare definitive turning point yet on large equipment. Excluding large compressors, we expect Industrial to be flat to slightly up, and we do expect to realize margin expansion through our operational excellence initiatives, ongoing cost reductions, restructuring actions, and new product launches.","And now I'll turn it over to Mike for closing remarks.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thank you, Sue. So in closing, on slide 22, we are executing on a 2017 plan and building a thriving, more valuable Ingersoll-Rand. I began today's call talking about our principled approach, the values inherent in our culture, and how that translates to sustainability of our business. I'm proud of our employees who delivered a strong Quarter One performance. I'm proud that we tackle challenging customer problems, and we solve them. We take on tough issues and applied some of the best minds in the industry to solve them. Within our company, we have some the most impressive emissions reductions and efficiency stories in the world. That's what we excel at.","Looking ahead our strategy is unchanged. We will maximize growth through innovation and channel expansion, continue our focus on productivity and costs, deliver strong cash flow with disciplined capital allocation.","Our commercial and residential HVAC businesses are strong and focused on growth areas with equipment, controls and service. Our transport refrigeration business is diverse and agile, and will execute their strategy as they typically do. Our Industrial businesses are focused on market share and margin expansion as markets stabilize. And our culture remains as strong as ever. As a result, I'm confident that we will continue to deliver a top-tier financial and operating performance.","And with that, Sue and I will now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities","Hi, good morning.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Hi, Julian.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities","Hey. Just my first question would be, again, on that point that Sue just touched on around the Industrial business. So should we think about the long-lead-time business being about $200 million of sales, probably down high single digits this year? Is that about the right scale of the piece within Industrial that's offsetting everything else?","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah, Julian. It's Sue. I think that's right, It's a little heavier than $200 million, but not significantly. So \u2013 and I think what you have to think about there, and I know you are, is that bookings in that area last year was really the largest point of decline in, especially, the compression technologies business. So we saw some positive bookings in the first quarter, but those are going to translate into 2018. But you've got the right order of magnitude.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities","Thank you. And then just my second question would be around the transport market. When we're thinking about bookings here over the balance of the year, they were down, as you said, in the first quarter, up a little bit in the fourth. Should we expect bookings, or are you expecting bookings to grow in that segment overall at any point in this year, and if you could just remind us of the lead time in Thermo King from bookings to billings?","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","So let me start out with the bookings and the expectations. So we talked about in Q1 that the bookings were down slightly. One of the things that I'd like to point out in that area is they were actually down about 1% year over year, which translates to about $6 million. So we knew that we were going to see the North America trailer markets down, we knew that we were going to have some strength in Europe in the truck markets. We also saw some strength in North America on truck, with the marine business being down.","So there's a little bit of a mixture there, but we do still see that the biggest market that, I guess from a focus standpoint on North America trailer, is that that's going to be down for the year. We're a little bit more conservative than ACT with their 44,000 units, but we are calling that down.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities","Thanks. And then just the lead time of bookings to billings?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Julian, the timing there is typically going to be dependent on the customer, and what we're going to get there is sort of an indication of the order quantity for the year, and they're going to take those sort of as they would see their fleets needing to be replenished. So that varies. Varies dramatically.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Your line is open.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","That was sneaky. Rob McCarthy here. How are you doing? I guess the question I have is with respect to the performance across commercial HVAC and residential HVAC. Could you just cite areas of where you're taking outsized share? I mean obviously the narrative has been of structural share restoration or share gain over the past several years, but could you just give us some principal examples, because I think you called it out in your results?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah, I think it's broad-based again. I mean we looked at North American equipment bookings, up roughly 20%, we're seeing applied North America up in the mid-20s, successful in the Middle East in terms of bookings. China was up significantly, 20-ish percent in the quarter as well. Controls continue to \u2013 we're doing well with the controls business and services business, so really across the board, Robert, we're having success there. Anything specific you'd want to know more than that, feel free to follow up on it.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Then I just, could you talk about kind of your expectations for kind of incremental margin lift this year, and conceptually going forward, in terms of maybe puts and takes around incremental compensation expense, or any other items we should be thinking about as we think about margin conversion here? Because we're coming out of a shoulder quarter and we're kind of going into the back half, or the prime season, at least on the Climate side.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah. I'll start and let Sue finish. But if you look at, from operation's leverage around 25% of the business coming off last year's really sporty price-to-material-deflation mix, it was really good performance in the quarter there. We think good performance over the long run is leveraging incrementals at the gross margin of the business, and we would expect things to be in that 25% to 35% range, and have no difference in expectation this year. Of course, Industrial will leverage at a much, much higher rate, and you saw that in the quarter where we had a slight decline in sales, we had an increase in operating income in that business, and that'll continue to be an outsized leverage there.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","The third and final question is basically \u2013 I hate to ask a banker question, but I'll ask the question nonetheless \u2013 I mean, you've executed very well, you've had strong growth on EPS revisions, but you do have this mix between Climate and Industrial. Maybe, Mike, you could talk about the commonality of why you can run the assets together? Because in this environment of conglomerates and deconglomeratization, an argument could be made you could sell or spin this entity into strength. And some of your peers have looked or actually done this. And it might be a value creation event, particularly given with respect to what pure-play Climate companies are trading at right now.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah, Rob, we'll cover that, really, I think in more detail, there'll be more time in May, first of all. So I don't want to absorb too much time on that. And clearly we believe that what we're seeing today through the operational integration, this is both the technologies that we would have, the networks of excellence that we would have around engineering across the business, the purchasing power we have, and even in the plant consolidation, some of which we did in the quarter, consolidating more of these plants together in larger scale, all lead to a pretty big dyssynergy number pulling it apart.","But also the cash flow cyclicality inherent between the two businesses, and there's a bit of a negative correlation between Industrial and Climate, historically for us anyway, and I think that that is something that has bode well for the ability to continue to have strong cash flow, to allocate that toward investment in the business which is out of cycle, which you even saw I think today, we announced we've now launched that large rotary refresh of the oil-flooded air compressor business. That was the project that, I don't know, five quarters ago we talked about pulling forward into 2015 versus 2016 to accelerate it, because we had such good success with the small air compressor using the same technology.","So that sort of thing wouldn't have happened, I think, in this cycle. And that again, if you flip it around and look back in the 2010-2013 timeframe, all the success in Industrial at the time fueled what you're seeing in the Trane business. So I think we look at that all the time, we try to understand some of the parts of the portfolio. When we apply a range of dyssynergies against that, it's not a value-creating idea.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks and good morning, everyone.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Hi, Nigel.","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Good morning.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I've got a few, I guess, modeling questions, probably for Sue here. So just thinking about, you mentioned no significant debt matures until 2018, and you've got a pretty big one, $750 million, at high cost, 6.75% and you could refi that at much, much low interest rates today. So I'm just wondering how you're approaching that maturity? Are you looking to refi early? And what kind of rate do you think you could refi for, because it looks like 6.75% could become 2%, so that's a significant savings. Any comments there would be helpful.","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Well, so the maturity is August of 2018, and we're continually evaluating that, And I'll tell you what I'm balancing on that interest of rate 6.75% versus what we could get today, and I don't know if 2% is the right number, but let's assume that it's much lower than the 6.75% is. What's the right timing, in terms of the breakage of costs that go along with that? So in other words, if I want to refi now and do that, there is going to be a cost associated with that. And while I could easily disclose that to you, I sort of have a bias towards protecting shareholder value and saying, I'm not going to do that unless there is a really good reason to do that.","So what drives a really good reason would be, is if I thought the rates were going to change dramatically, or I get more within the window. So continuously thinking about it, Nigel, but so far we haven't pulled the trigger on that, and we'll continue to look at it. But you're right, it would be lower interest than the 6.75%.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Nigel, last time we -","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","\u2013 looked at that was really not long ago, really weeks ago. We were upside down some $10 million in that equation, a couple, $0.03 a share. And the only argument you could make would be do you do it early and protect the deductibility of interest, on a scenario that you're guessing at around taxes. So really guessing at that scenario for $10 million didn't make any sense, but I want to give you some color, because you need to know we're looking at that all the time, and we wouldn't leave an opportunity on the table like that.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right. And I would say it's a big \u2013 it's a big number. And then I guess, going even deeper, train, you \u2013 obviously you called out in the slides the impact of D&A on margins, and the train amortization starts to roll, I believe, in mid-2018. So I'm just wondering, is that about $100 million of intangibles that go away in mid-2018?","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","So, actually what is sitting there in 2017 in terms of the train amortization is about $105 million, which is about what you said. That actually does not start to roll off, Nigel, until like 2023. So it isn't going to start rolling off in 2018, it's going to be roughly the same $100 million.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. So it's 15 years, not 10 years, I've got it. And then just quickly on the restructuring, makes sense to do the consolidation. I assume this is in the Industrial segment, I'm just wondering what sort of payback are you assuming?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Well, actually Nigel, it's across \u2013 it was three different sorts of ideas. One was taking a residential light unitary North American factory, and then putting that into four factories with open capacity. And so one of the things I think is a product of good productivity for a lot of years is opening pre-capacity in another location. So one piece of that would have gone to the HVAC side of the business. The second one was to the Industrial business and consolidating two plants in-country in Europe. And then the third was a plant in Europe which is going to be a multi-segment plant in Europe, and so we really hit all three.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And the payback, it's like two-, three-year paybacks on this?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","You've got \u2013 sort of GAAP under four years and cash under 2.5.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Hi, Steve.","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Good morning.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for all the detail on the \u2013 in the presentation. Very helpful. Just a question around, I know you guys aren't giving quarterly guidance anymore, but you had said previously that 45%-ish of the year was going to be in the first half. Is that kind of still the right number?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Steve, I just won lunch, okay? So \u2013 and I'm not going to do any calculus or algebra on this one for you at all. I want to really stick to the guidance, we gave managing within that, and let you guys -","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So then I'll do the \u2013 so then I'll do the calculus. If you do 45% of the high end of the range, and you take the $0.57 you did in the first quarter, that's getting you somewhere in the range of a $1.45, which is about a 4% increase over the second quarter of last year. I guess I'll ask it this way, is there \u2013 I know there's the tax benefit this quarter, which is helpful, there's some other stuff. Is there anything else that you want to call out, year-over-year, that would unusually kind of depress that rate of growth? I mean, I would think that that $1.45, maybe that's a good number, it's still above the consensus. So just curious if there is anything on \u2013 from a comp perspective, because you obviously here this quarter absorbed a pretty decent hit from price-cost and some investments, but again the tax rate was favorable. So just curious as to, if there's anything you want to call out to make sure you kind of calibrate people on the moving parts, without doing algebra?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah. To sort of maybe re-characterize the question in the way that I want to answer it, I would tell you that the way \u2013 the reason in which we took up the low end of the range was just confidence we had in the bookings, and really eliminating the risk on the low end of the range, and feeling like we had a stronger backlog going in. When you look at that mid-20s applied bookings that we had in Q1, look at the large plant there in process and Industrial bookings, which would have been mid-teens growth year-over-year, the Climate is probably six to nine months. It's interesting because that's based on the availability of the customer to have the project ready for it. We build chillers now in a day. We used to have chiller lead times of 10 weeks; we now could do that in 10 days. Give customers 10-day lead time from order to delivery.","But if you go to a large plant there on process side, same thing, 12 months to 18 months. So those are largely pushing out to 18 months, but with that being said, some of the bookings will fall into the back half of the year and give us an opportunity to raise to the low end of the range. You had also asked a little bit about price and material cost, and I'll let Sue kind of give you some color on that.","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah. So I think, Steve, that would be one of the other areas that I would watch in the second quarter. So our material inflation in 2017 is coming primarily from steel and from Tier 2 commodities. As we go throughout the year, we've talked about the first half is going to be a tough compare to last year, where we had a very positive spread between price and material inflation. On the material side itself, there's been some volatility, really post-election, in both steel, which will start to show up in the second quarter, as well as aluminum.","And aluminum has a bigger impact on our residential business than what some people might think, we actually use \u2013 I'll give you a first quarter kind of antidote, where we used about 15 times as much aluminum as we did copper in the residential business in the first quarter. So we're more impacted by that. Having said all of that, we intend to be price positive throughout the year. We're watching the commodities, and we're also really, really focused on productivity and really offsetting any costs that we have. So monitoring all of the different pieces, but I'd really watch on materials.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah. And maybe, Sue, just a bit more color on that even. You look at the fact that we are getting positive price across the board. That's a good sign. Again, it's the steel, the Tier 2 components, the aluminum of which Sue said we buy 15:1 pounds of aluminum to copper in our res business, for example. You get to quarter two, the spread's 120 basis points. We would still expect positive price and the same sorts of material inflation that we're seeing. Then you get out to the back end of the year, and it literally might take to the back end of the year to kind of flip that into that 10-basis-point positive there. But I do believe we've got the strategies to do that.","We've also got some excellent value engineering ideas going on right now, testing out \u2013 we finalized this summer where we would both be able to change some of the alloys and be able to change some of the gauge thickness of the materials we're using. If those test out positively, then that's going to allow us to abate some of that material inflation toward the back end of the year. So we're working it and feel pretty good about getting there at the end of the year.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Wait, what's the 120 basis points? Sorry, just a quick follow-up on that. You did 50 bps headwind this quarter. What is the 120 basis points again?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","I think Q2 last year, we were 120 basis points positive -","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Positive. Tough comp. Got it, go it. Positive. Okay. All right. Great. Thanks a lot guys, I appreciate the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays. Your line is open.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Hi, Scott.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So Steve's question is a good one. I \u2013 if you're 120 basis points positive last year, and now it's 50 basis points off of that 120 basis points, so it's still 70 basis points positive, is that how I should read it? Or are we actually 50 basis points negative? Or am I just dumb, which might be the other option?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Scott, I appreciate the question. It's a headwind. I mean, we had to overcome a significant headwind in comps, and that's the point we're making.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. So, it's headwind in comps, okay, I get it. So you're not actually negative price cost and \u2013 explicitly, it's just a comp, okay. I did see you were out there with a fair number of price increases on January 1, at least in the resi businesses. Were you able to realize those on January 1, or was it just not enough, or not fast enough to offset materials as they continue to move?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah. Remember, Scott, the vast majority of our company doesn't operate on a price list, or a pricing. It's really the res business, some parts of light commercial, tools business to some extent; it starts to fall down pretty quick after that. Everything else is really putting a system together, a project together. And so you're really pricing more or less in real time with a customer on an order, and that's how we look at it.","So, yes, we had price increases where we compete in markets where that's the norm. Where it's not the norm, that's where we've been working this whole top line margin expansion, pricing work over time to make sure we understand how to price out into the future, when we expect deliveries, and try to get on top of that.","Of course, as you get to these large long-lead items, you're dealing with the fact that you're trying to price out and guess 9 months to 18 months out into the future. And in some cases, what's happened hasn't been so much demand related from a commodity perspective, but in the case of aluminum for example, it's very speculative in nature as to what's going on; it's more difficult to predict.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Okay. That's -","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","But now that \u2013 we get there at the end of the year I believe, and are marginally positive on price versus material cost, with price been actually quite positive.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Again, I totally get it. Your comps are tough, so. Can you guys just -","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Scott, if I can just inject for just a second. On the \u2013 on the second quarter, I still expect for us to be upside down on the price-cost equation. So, there is a very tough comparison to the price-cost spread from the second quarter of last year. But I do expect second quarter to look somewhat like the first quarter of this year, price positive, but still seeing a negative spread between price and material inflation.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. I totally get it. It just took me a while. Can you guys remind us what Thermocold is, I just don't \u2013 I'm not familiar with that asset?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah, Thermocold is a \u2013 it's a ductless variable water flow product that we worked with this company over time to kind of help develop it, get it into market. Got to a point where it was getting very interesting for us, so we acquired the business this quarter. Actually, bookings have doubled in the quarter since we've owned it. So, it's an early success around that. But what happens with some of the variable refrigerant flow systems is you're pushing refrigerant around buildings, and many building codes don't allow either a flammable or a high concentration refrigerant circulate in the building. Just for context, a VRF system might have twice the refrigerant charge than conventional system, and then you're pushing that at higher pressures, and you're pushing it through buildings where it's not pushed today.","So in some places, the preference for when people want to go ductless is to have variable water flow versus refrigerant. So we're looking to really make sure that we've got a product for every application, and what we do is we apply products and systems to situations, and we do that through our channel, and that's why it's important for us to have all products for all applications.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That makes a lot of sense. Thanks, guys.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Hi, Joe.","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Good morning, Joe.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So, I guess my first question is really on \u2013 sticking with industrial. It seems like your aftermarket business probably drove a lot of the kind of improvement. So maybe just help us understand a little bit the progress that you've made to drive aftermarket, and then what growth looks like, aftermarket versus equipment, going forward?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah. Compression technology specifically, and Club Car, would be the two parts of Industrial I'd call out to be the strongest. And when you look at what we can control in the compression technology business, if we can't control CapEx of large equipment, which was evident to us a year-plus ago, the move that we could make was to spend more time in the channel around the mix, pushing to service. And Todd and that team have done just an outstanding job of putting what I would consider to be the operational excellence discipline into the sales management and sales functions.","And so the amount of connectivity that we have between customers and service, the share of wallet we have with those customers, has increased. And just sort of the whole pace and rigor around the sale management process has increased. So I couldn't be any happier with how they're kind of bringing that to the market. And then in Industrial, what you've seen here is Club Car with mid-teens bookings, and that's led by everything outside of golf, frankly. Golf is a business where globally we've got roughly 50% market share, so all the growth opportunities that sit in that small electric vehicle market spit out in utility and in personal transportation vehicles, low-speed vehicles, at the consumer level. And we're seeing good growth there.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And, Mike, maybe, if you can just touch on ex Club Car, regionally, your developed markets, both North America and Europe down. A lot of the reads we've seen just across the industrial landscape have been really good this quarter. And so maybe talk a little bit about the kind of regional disconnect that you're seeing in North America\/Europe versus what you're seeing across other areas of the world. Because clearly, you've got better growth outside of the developed market landscape today.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah. I mean, again, I think when you see larger compressors come back into the mature economies, you're going to see great growth in leverage, and even without a high degree of revenue you saw good leverage in this quarter. But you got the China, which I consider to be a mature market, and here you saw really excellent kind of high single-digit, almost double-digit growth there in our compression technologies business. So China is an example where we really did see some strength and recovery. And it's supported not just by the reported GDP, but around energy use in the economy, and by some of the usage of commodities like steel in the market would tell us that. You're seeing something that appears to be a turning point in China, and hopefully it'll last.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Your line is open.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Hey, Andy.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So through April you spent $417 million in repurchases. Obviously you've ramped up repurchases, especially in April. You do seem committed to your $1.5 billion target. But can you talk about the probability of doing M&A versus repurchases? Are valuations higher to the point where the chance of doing bigger M&A are lower, or do you still see significant opportunity in your pipeline? And at what point in the year do you actually step up repurchases if M&A is little harder to come by, and is that happening now?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah, I have to start with \u2013 from the beginning, which says that the strategic plans that we put together in the company, would have isolated some ideas around targets that we want to go after, and that list of targets would have yielded some specific targets that we would have put on our list, whether they're actionable or not. And you could say, well, everything's actionable at any given price, but the reality is it's not actionable within the financial guidelines that we've put in place about what we think a good acquisition looks like.","So when you start with that, you say to yourself from there, at any one given point in time in the pipeline, what do we feel is both actionable and actionable at a level financially that we think would be attractive to us? If I snapped the line today \u2013 and I want to be very careful about this, because it could change next week and it would have been different last week \u2013 but if I snapped a line today, I would say that there's between $300 million and $500 million of actionable M&A that meets our financial constraints and hurdles across the company. So that doesn't mean that it won't change next week. It wouldn't preclude doing much larger deals, if they fit the strategic plans that we put in place and the target lists that were in place at the time. So that's what we are today. And if you ask me next quarter, I'll snap a line for you and tell you where we are, I suppose.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Mike, that's very helpful. And then just shifting gears, can you talk about your commercial HVAC markets in EMEA and Asia? You mentioned last quarter your 2017 outlook was relatively flattish, but you did see strong 4Q Asian orders. You said they were lumpy last quarter, but you've continued to see good order growth in both markets really, and you did raise your forecasted debt for Asian HVAC. EMEA orders did (55:24) look like they accelerated a bit in the quarter. So can you see some upside on the Asian HVAC as we go through the year?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Well, the Middle East really accelerated for us, and was kind of a mid-teens bookings growth in the Middle East for us, so very different than what we're seeing in Europe. And in Europe, we're not bearish on Europe. We just think it's going to be sort of a flattish market, but the Middle East, we would think to be up for the year for us. And I think that's not the market, I think that we're doing some good things in the market, particularly around some of the district cooling plants and the newer refrigerants that we've launched into the market.","China was also just a good story for us. And again, it's really a quarter at this point, and I'm not going to say that we expect that to continue through the balance of the year, but clearly the market in China specifically, I don't think was above 20% in the quarter, but we had strong bookings growth in the quarter. Again, a lot of new product introduction, more depth in the channel, and I think just solid execution across the board there.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","You said the Middle East market, it was more you than the market. Did it stabilize, though, and that allowed you to outperform well in the quarter?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","I would say \u2013 I was there just a month ago. At least where I was, okay, but specifically Dubai would be a point I would raise. I would tell you that it was booming, and really no signs of slowing down there. Obviously as you get outside of Dubai, you're going to reach different dynamics, but we would have seen our team there sort of feeling good about what they're able to bring into the market with new products and services, controls, performance contracting, and the capability of the team becoming I think stronger there, to the point where we can do more work outside of equipment. That's helping us to grow the market.","We've got a joint venture we're starting there as well, soon. I think that will help us develop in the market further, so again I didn't see a terribly depressed situation in the marketplace, but I felt good leaving that trip, understanding what our growth plans were and feeling good about our ability to get growth where it's maybe flattish today, or down.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC.

Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Hey, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, Mike, I'd love to hear your comments about the build ahead of the cooling season, how does the inventory in the channel stand today, and maybe your sense about customer bias towards replacing versus fixing their units, just given sentiment today?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah, Deane, really detail about sort of the inventories, there is nothing unusual about inventories in the channel, I know some of the folks that are sort of more res-based and maybe singly focused on HVAC are looking at where they are in days' sales and so on and so forth, but honestly, we're not seeing anything unusual. Here we're seeing good strong markets, we're seeing the replacement market strong, we're seeing the new construction markets strong.","In the couple of areas that we're really looking to penetrate, which should be areas like new construction or areas like owner-non-occupied, are markets that are really growing for us, and we focused the channel, we focused our work in those markets. So I think it's shaping up to be another strong, solid year for the res markets, and clearly we're doing well in those markets. And it's also you're seeing the nice market-share growth and margin expansion, it's not as if we're in there buying share at all. It's really a well strong \u2013 well-functioning business, strong management team executing well on its plan.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's real helpful. Can you just provide some color on where you think you're gaining share in the resi market, in particular product lines, or just where you think that that growth is coming?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Deane, we're in the last three years of about a 100% revitalizing. So there's nothing in the market that we've had in the market for very long. So, we're \u2013 who we're taking share from, we speculate internally, but I certainly wouldn't want to put a public proclamation around that hypothesis.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Of course.

Your line is open.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hey, thank you, good morning. Just a couple loose ends I guess here. Mike, what are you seeing, if anything, on the competitive response to your share gains? I think a lot of it goes to your \u2013 to the point you just made about you're winning on product. But is anyone else coming back on you on price, do you see anyone kind of acting out of line?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","We work in an industry with a handful of large players. It's probably going to consolidate over time. And we certainly don't discount any of our competitors' capabilities in these areas. It's a strategy, Jeff, that we've had for a long time about how we wanted to win, where to play; the product growth teams are very additive to what we are doing, and try to isolate opportunities or weaknesses and exploit them.","So, yeah, I said the word culture, I don't know, five times on the opening script, and I could tell you that there's something about really embedding that pretty deeply in the organization, that we wake up every day thinking about market share and margin expansion, and we're supporting that with the field, with great service capability, with tremendous amount of investment in innovation and products control, services across the board. So we're just going to run faster, and we've got big strong competitors that are running fast too.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And just kind of a separate thought, we've heard a couple of times this earning season, just maybe some companies of over-restructured some pinch points in the supply chain, with things looking like it's broadly picking up. Is there anything in your supply chain that looks problematic, anything you might have to vertically integrate to kind of contend with such issues, or anything you're monitoring, would just be interesting?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah. Knock on wood, Jeff, we've had an excellent season. I think every season just gets better and better. And the first thing we do at the end of a season is we debrief every learning we had in the season at a very deep level, on a plant and product basis, and understand sort of what we would have done if we could have hit the replay button, and every year we get better at that. Which is why the profitability of the res business turned the corner in the first quarter, which historically I think forever had been in a loss-making position, is now in a good position in the first quarter with less inventory, high returns, better cycle times, lead times to customers, more product availability.","So, we're not seeing anything here that we haven't planned for or thought about at this point, but again, this is not even May, and we've got to go through a few more months here to be confident about that.","Jeffrey T.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now turn the floor over to Zac Nagle, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Zac Nagle - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thanks operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Ingersoll-Rand's third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. We released earnings this morning, and you can find our news release, our earnings presentation under webcast of this event on our website at ingersollrand.com. We're also archiving this call on our website.","Please go to slide two. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from our anticipated results.","This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release.","The participants on this morning's call are Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO; and Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO.","With that, please go to slide three, and I will turn the call over to Mike.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thanks, Zac, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. I'm going to begin by discussing our strategy and how as a foundation our business operating system drives top-tier financial performance for shareholders.","Sue will provide more details about the quarter financials and guidance, then I'll close with a few comments before we answer your questions. As a matter of strategy more than 90% of our product portfolio directly addresses demands for greater productivity and energy efficiency with lower greenhouse gas emissions in buildings, homes, industrial and transport markets around the world. The strength and resiliency of our portfolio comes from our leadership in growing markets that are durable, because these markets are essential to addressing the global, strategic imperative to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to conserve resources.","Our business operating system is a systematic way our people work within the company to deliver against our strategy globally. It is a holistic approach that establishes strong baseline execution expectations, then builds on those expectations through continuous development of people and improvement of processes and standards. Respecting and engaging our people in the development and maturation of a business operating system, makes it sustainable and is a core element of what it takes to win over the long-term.","Rigorous execution of the business operating system has enabled us to deliver consistent top tier financial performance across key metrics, including organic growth, incremental margins, EPS growth and cash flow conversion over many years.","The third quarter demonstrated our consistent progress against these key metrics. We delivered strong organic growth of 3% across a diversified portfolio. We had record operating margins of 14.1% and drove leverage through the P&L, resulting in adjusted EPS growth of 17%","Year-to-date, free cash flow is more than 100% of adjusted net income, demonstrating our ability to convert earnings into real cash, a fundamental driver of valuation. Record margins in the quarter were primarily driven by continued strength in our Climate business, where adjusted operating margins expanded 90 basis points to 16.7% with particular strength in our commercial and residential HVAC businesses.","We are also pleased to report that our Industrial business turned in a positive direction in quarter three, moving adjusted operating margins higher by 180 basis points sequentially to 11.6%. Adjusting for the capitalized cost that we discussed last quarter of 1.1 percentage points, the business improved 70 basis points sequentially from 10.9% to 11.6%. The actions we've been taking to improve the business are taking hold and we believe we saw margins bottom in the second quarter.","Improved profitability was driven by operational excellence and our continued focus on delivering innovation centered on energy efficiency, sustainability, system reliability, as well as disruptive game changing technological advancements in areas like controls and digital connectivity.","In quarter three, our overall growth was led by our commercial and residential HVAC businesses in North America where we continue to see strong double-digit growth and market share gains. Our performance in 2016 is a direct result of a continuous long-term investment program prioritized around a clear set of opportunities and managed from inception to launch by focused and committed product growth teams.","The net result is that our product growth teams' average to growth rate about four times higher than our overall average growth rate in quarter three. Continuously delivering innovation through our product growth teams is one way we produce strong financial results and stay ahead competitively.","Another key driver is our commitment to being the leader in energy efficient and sustainable products. About 10 days ago, the 28th meeting of the parties to the Montreal Protocol was held. At that meeting about 200 countries agreed to an amendment that phases out hydrofluorocarbons beginning in 2019 and aims for an 80% reduction in their use by 2045. For several years now, we have been planning for the phase-out of hydrofluorocarbons and over that time we have been a leader in developing several commercialized next-generation lower global warming potential products that meet and exceed the transition requirements to help customers achieve their sustainability goals.","Two years ago, we made a public climate commitment to a 50% reduction of refrigerant greenhouse gases in the footprint of our products by 2020 and a transition out of current refrigerants before 2030. We did this to help customers plan for the transition period based upon their business needs and system requirements.","We are on track to complete our commitment goals and to-date have avoided approximately 2 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent globally. Another example is our EcoWise product portfolio, typically when an eco-friendly refrigerant is used in a system, it reduces efficiency and can sometimes compromise safety. For example the gas might be flammable or more toxic.","With the introduction of our EcoWise product portfolio, we've not only developed a low global warming potential refrigerant product. We've also designed it so the product or system is more energy efficient. A prime example of this is our new line of Centrifugal chillers that have near zero global warming potential, do not concede safety and deliver 13.5% better efficiency than chillers using hydrofluorocarbons. So, now our customer is not choosing between being green or being efficient. Through EcoWise, they are able to do both.","Growth with these products has been excellent. In Europe, for example the EcoWise portfolio growth has nearly doubled over the last year and we see a healthy pipeline, with high profile jobs coming in like the Chunnel Tunnel between France and the UK. After considering retrofit of their equipment, our expert technical team worked with Chunnel operators to install units from our EcoWise portfolio this year. With near zero global warming potential, the units will allow a savings of around 40% of the electrical energy used in the Chunnel's cooling system. And to give you some perspective, the energy savings for this project is about as much energy as the island of Aruba generates annually. It is a savings of 53% compared to the customers' former units that we replaced from one of our competitors.","Vertical integration is another way that we drive growth and leverage technical know-how across our Climate and Industrial segments. Our vertical integration in compressor technology is one area of real competitive advantage because we engineer and manufacture our screw, centrifugal and the majority of our scroll compressors. We own the intellectual property and accelerated our time to market with these products.","Through our energy efficiency strategy, the next-generation R-series air compressor that we introduced in quarter three incorporates the latest advancements in variable speed drive technology to increase airflow output up to 15%, reduce energy cost up to 35%, with an increase in system reliability. Customers are finding the product offering compelling, and we are outpacing the market growth rate as a result.","These are just a few examples of how we're making investments in long-term innovation, energy efficiency and productivity to stay ahead of the competition and in front of an increasing regulatory environment. We are also tying in services, controls and wireless to our products, so they are leading-edge as technology continues to move quickly. We continue to see double-digit increases in our commercial HVAC controls business and high-single-digit growth in services. In Compression Technologies, we also realized mid single-digit growth in our aftermarket business. Our multiyear trend in aftermarket growth is consistent with our strategy to drive service penetration across our segments and create a more resilient portfolio.","Turning to cash and capital allocation, Q3 was another quarter of steady and strong cash flow. Year-to-date free cash flow was nearly $1 billion. Over the past five years, our cash flow ROIC has averaged 18% per annum. A top priority is to increase shareholder returns through high ROIC investments in our business that build a platform for consistent cash generation and investment in growth and innovation.","Our long-standing commitment to organic long-term strategic investments is what has enabled us to perform well in both up and down climate or industrial cycles over the years. As an example, in 2016, we've invested heavily in channel investments that will improve growth by penetrating key markets over the next several years.","In addition to fully investing in the business, we spent $250 million in 2016 on share buybacks. We've raised our dividend twice, 10% in February, an additional 25% in October, and we continue to have an increasing pipeline of interesting M&A opportunities. Our consistency in performance and a resultant strong cash flow and healthy balance sheet puts us in an excellent position to maintain significant optionality to move quickly across any or all capital allocation fronts as opportunities arise in this is uncertain and often volatile global economy.","Before I hand things over to Sue, I want to hit on three key areas that we know are important for you to understand based on our conversations with many investors. Turning to slide four, I'm pleased with the progress of our Industrial segment in the third quarter, and we believe we remain on track to achieve our guidance for 2016 margins of 10% to 11%. The continuing actions we have taken and are taking to deliver improvement are taking hold. We continue to focus on operational excellence initiatives, restructuring and reducing cost, increase focus on parts and service, and here we are already seeing growth in the service business, but we believe we can step on the gas even further in this area.","Segmentation and focus on growing markets like food and beverage, pharma and electronics, and continuing multi-year product, channel and machining investments to achieve strong leverage when the markets recover. It's important to note based on the actions we have taken and what we are seeing in the business that we believe Q2 marked a trough in operating margins for the business and we're expecting improved performance going forward in 2017, although the results may not be a straight line up quarter-to-quarter.","If you turn to slide 5, the main takeaway here is that the Thermo King business is resilient. We saw this in the third quarter, when revenues were down but margins moved higher. For 2016, we continue to see the business being consistent with the expectations we set out in July. The team deserves a lot of execution credit there for improving margins on declining revenue, and for building a more resilient and valuable franchise over time. (13:22) is a great example, the transport business grew margins on a 12% lower revenue base. We do expect about a 20% decline in trailers next year but we believe we should be able to mitigate some of the downside by growing the business in other regions and in other TK products.","Moving to slide 6. Another topic on the minds of investors is how the Dodge data for nonresidential put in place translates to Ingersoll-Rand. Here I think it's important to lay out where our business comes from, and what drives the market. I think the market overestimates our exposure.","As the chart shows, the North American Commercial HVAC segment is about $4 billion and is split about 50-50 between services and equipment. Of the equipment, about 65% is replacement business, so not new put in place.","The result is that our Dodge put-in-place data just covers about 18% of our business. Additionally, when you drill down further into the 18%, about 50% is commercial and 50% is institutional. Institutional is expected to show good growth in 2016, and even better growth in 2017.","Our data says North American Commercial HVAC will be mid-single digits in 2016, and a similar number in 2017. So, we continue to see a healthy market going into next year.","And with that, I'll turn the things over to Sue.","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thank you, Mike. Let's go to slide 7. I'd like to begin with a summary of main points for you to take away from today's call. As Mike discussed, we continued to execute the core tenants for our business operating system in Q3, building upon our strong 2016 performance, across the three pillars of growth, profitability and cash flow.","Adjusted earnings per share was up 17% on 3% organic revenue growth. Cash flow was 180% of net income for the quarter. Our performance was highlighted by record results in our North America Commercial and Residential HVAC businesses, where we captured additional market share, while at the same time expanding margins year-over-year.","In our Industrial business, we drove 180 basis points of improved operating margin performance sequentially. We continued to take further actions on operational excellence initiatives, increased our commercial focus on aftermarket parts and service and added cost reduction activities to improve operating results going forward.","The margin improvement was 70 basis points after adjusting Q2 margins for capitalized new product engineering and development cost that we highlighted in last quarter's earnings materials. We believe we are largely maintaining our growing market share across the portfolio, despite continued soft industrial end markets.","During the quarter, we also extended our strong free cash flow performance by $644 million, bringing our year-to-date total to $992 million, up $527 million from the prior year. Given our long-term expectations for strong earnings and cash conversion, we also increased our dividend by 25% in October to $0.40 per share or $1.60 annualized, making our dividend highly competitive not only in our peer group, but across the broader market.","Additionally, we now believe our free cash flow for 2016 will approximate $1.3 billion, up more than $200 million from our previous guidance of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. We've also increased our earnings per share guidance for the year given our year-to-date performance and outlook. Our revised guidance of between $4.17 and $4.22 is higher by $0.14 at the midpoint, reflecting the flow-through of our Q3 over performance versus our Q3 guidance midpoint, and an $0.88 to $0.93 fourth quarter. The fourth quarter of $0.90 to $0.91 at the midpoint is consistent with our prior guidance.","On the next several slides, I will highlight the key messages for this earnings call. Please go to slide eight. Our strong enterprise performance on organic growth, earnings per share growth and cash flow conversion was highlighted by our North America HVAC businesses and by sequential operating margin improvement in our Industrial segment versus the prior quarter.","Organic revenue was up 3% as adjusted margins improved 30 basis points year-on-year with 30% operating leverage. Our business operating system again guided us through good execution in our factories and in our cost centers. Our focus was on good operating results in a low growth environment and we delivered against that objective.","Please go to slide nine. Organic orders continue to be solid through the third quarter of 2016 led by our Climate business and partially offset by soft industrial markets. Climate orders were up 4% organically, Organic Global Commercial HVAC bookings were up mid single-digits led by low-teens growth in North America unitary. We also continue to drive excellent growth in service, controls and contracting with low-teens growth in the quarter.","Residential bookings were solid, up mid single-digit. Organic transport orders were down low single-digits with order growth in Europe and Asia, offset by declines in North America trailer and auxiliary power units. Consistent with our guidance, we continue to expect bookings to decline in North America trailer. On balance the Industrial businesses were flat to down modestly and we are calling a broad-based recovery in the near-term.","Please go to slide 10. This slide provides a directional view of our segment revenue performance by regions. In our Climate segment, we saw solid performance in both North America and Latin America and low single-digit growth in the Middle East. In our Industrial segment overall performance was essentially flat with high single-digit growth in Europe, Middle East and Africa due to the shipment of large orders in the Middle East and mid single-digit growth in Asia, offset by declines in North America and Latin America.","Please go to slide 11. Climate performance was strong in the quarter, with organic revenues up 3% and adjusted operating margins up 90 basis points. Commercial HVAC organic revenues were up mid single-digits, highlighted by exceptional growth in North America contracting up 17%. And unitary equipment in North America up low-teens.","In Europe, business was unusually light, impacted by the slowdown in activity during the summer holiday season, driving mid single-digit equipment declines. Europe services contracting in parts were flat. Residential continued their outstanding year with revenues up low-teens.","Transport organic revenues were down low-teens in the quarter, driven by weakening North America trailer and soft APU and marine markets. Despite lower revenues, margins expanded 110 basis points, with increases in both North America and Europe, Middle East and Africa.","This demonstrates the more resilient franchise we discussed. Growth in aftermarket parts and services, trucks and in Europe trailers drove higher margins and helped mitigate the impact of the downturn.","Please go to slide 12. Climate reported operating margins expanded 110 basis points year-over-year. Volume and mix were favorable across commercial and residential HVAC, partially offset by volume in transport. Price and direct material deflation and productivity also contributed to margin improvement. Additionally, we continue to invest in the business to drive innovation and growth.","Please go to slide 13. Third quarter Industrial margins improved 180 basis points from second quarter trough margins on 1% organic revenue growth. Margin improvement was still solid at 70 basis points when accounting for Q2 2016 capitalized costs related to new product engineering and development of $8 million that we discussed last quarter. Excluding those costs, Q2 margin was 10.9%.","Industrial end markets remained soft in Q3 and are expected to be soft through 2016. Revenues were up mid single-digits in compressors with growth in aftermarket, oil-free and large machines with easier comparisons to the prior year. Other industrial products were down low teens with material handling showing the largest decline due to oil and gas exposure. Small electric vehicles were down slightly in the quarter.","Please go to slide 14, industrials reported operating margin of 10.9% was down 300 basis points versus prior year. Volume and mix were the largest drivers of this decline. Pricing offset materials, but given the continued low volumes running through our factories productivity did not offset inflation in the quarter. We continued planned investments in our products and channel and restructuring to improve our cost base.","Looking forward, we expect margins to improve in 2017 given ongoing margin improvement actions, although we do expect some variability due to cyclicality. Please go to slide 15. September year-to-date free cash flow of $992 million was favorable to prior year by $527 million. Strong operating income improvement and working capital performance were the primary drivers of the favorability. For the quarter working capital as a percentage of revenue was 4.9%. Our 2016 goal is approximately 4%. Based on strong performance year-to-date and our confidence in future cash conversion, we have raised our 2016 free cash flow forecast to approximately $1.3 billion. This is up more than $200 million from our prior range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion.","We have a proud history of returning cash to shareholders. Since 2011 our free cash flow as a percentage of net income has averaged 100%. Over that same timeframe we've retuned more than $6.5 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends of $1.5 billion and share buyback of $5.1 billion.","You may have noted that we've referenced cash flow ROIC a few times today. Our definition is free cash flow divided by gross fixed assets plus working capital. Our goal is period over period improvement in this metric and we're doing well in 2016 with improved free cash flow and balance capital expenditures and working capital.","Please go to slide 16. Our strong cash performance in the third quarter and our expectations moving forward enable us to; one, continue to invest in strategic growth programs as Mike outlined earlier. In addition to the core strategic investments we're also investing in long-term growth through innovative and differentiated products in areas such as controls for buildings as a resource, intelligent monitoring and self-healing systems just to name a few.","Two, we've paid an annual dividend for 106 years and have consistently raised the dividend over time. Over the past five years, we've raised our annual dividend at a 20% compound annual growth rate. In October, we announced a dividend increase of 25% to $0.40 per quarter or to $1.60 per share annually.","Three, we will continue to purchase sweeping shares sufficient to offset dilution, roughly $250 million per year. Four, we continue to see an increasing number of positive potential acquisition targets. And five, we strive to maintain a strong balance sheet with BBB metrics to provide optionality as our markets continue to evolve. We will continue to create long-term value for our shareholders through capital allocation, as we have consistently done for years.","Please go to slide 17. Our intention is to give you our best view of what we're seeing in our end markets sitting here today and how that translates to our revenue guidance for the remainder of 2016. We've broken it down by major end markets and geographies. As you can see by the variation of colors and symbols, our end markets are seeing a wide variation in trends. Markets for North America commercial and residential HVAC as well as European transport and commercial HVAC are generally positive, while global industrial markets remain soft.","We are forecasting global transport markets to be down low single-digits. Our forecast for North America trailer volumes has not changed and we expect the market to be down slightly for the year, this implies a decline in the second half after single-digit growth in the first half of the year. Asian HVAC markets are expected to be flat to down and industrial markets in Asia remain under pressure.","Golf cart markets are slightly down, offset by increases in the utility vehicle markets. All of our revenue growth forecasts are shown on an organic basis. We are forecasting mid-single-digit growth in Commercial HVAC in total; high single-digit growth in Residential HVAC, which is essentially an all-North America business for us; and a small decline in Transport globally.","Please go to slide 18. Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect organic revenues for the full year 2016 to be up approximately 2% versus 2015, with foreign exchange presenting a headwind of about one percentage point. We expect organic revenues to be up approximately 4% for Climate and down 3% for Industrial.","Adjusted operating margins, which exclude restructuring costs are expected to be at the high end of our previous ranges for the enterprise at 12% and for Climate at 14.5%. Adjusted Industrial margins are expected to be at the midpoint of our previous range of 10% to 11%.","Please go to slide 19. Transitioning to earnings, the reported earnings per share range is estimated to be $5.62 to $5.67 and the adjusted range is $4.17 to $4.22, up $0.14 to $0.15. At the midpoint, this represents a 12% increase in earnings per share over 2015. Adjusted numbers exclude restructuring and the Hussmann gain.","We have raised our full year guidance for free cash flow more than $200 million to approximately $1.3 billion from $1 billion to $1.1 billion, reflecting continued strong cash flows through 2016. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect Climate revenues to be up 2% to 4% organically, while Industrial revenues are expected to be down 6% to 8%.","Adjusted fourth quarter earnings per share is forecast to be between $0.88 and $0.93, excluding restructuring charges of about $0.02. The midpoint is consistent with or slightly higher than our previous guidance midpoint of $0.90 per share.","With that, I will turn it back to Mike for a few closing comments.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thanks, Sue. As we conclude, I want to emphasize a few points that I think are important for you to have as takeaways as we head into the final quarter and into 2017. First, we're performing well with a solid strategy punctuated with excellent execution over time. As a result, we have delivered consistent, reliable top tier financial performance on organic growth, EPS growth and cash flow over industrial and climate cycles.","Second, our management team is effective in anticipating and seeing around the corners. Our commercial HVAC business is strong and focused on the right growth areas with equipment, controls and service. We believe we have turned the corner with our Industrial segment, and starting to realize margin improvement versus the quarter 2 trough. And our Transport Refrigeration business is resilient. Our team is capturing margin expansion, despite downward sales.","Finally, we're building a stronger, more valuable, more sustainable and less cyclical Ingersoll-Rand. The results we reported today are a direct result of the strategic work, persistence and tenacity of the talented people that represent the unique culture we've built.","I'm proud of our people, who continue to deliver for our customers and our shareholders. Our momentum is strong as we conclude the year and head into 2017.","And with that, Sue and I will now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question for today comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, good morning.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Good morning, Nigel.","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Good morning.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, obviously, very good execution in a really challenging macro. Were any signs of softening as you went through the quarter. And I'm just thinking here about North American Commercial, up 9% orders, obviously a very good number, but you'd pointed to double-digit for this quarter. And so, I'm just wondering if there was any tailing off towards the end of the quarter that maybe just caused you to slightly miss that 10% bogie?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Well, maybe like a tenth of a point, Nigel was the difference. So, the good people here would not allow me to round that up, as they should not have allowed me to round that up. But that's the difference.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And the kind of the frontload activity, you mentioned some larger projects in the hopper, maybe just give some color on that, Mike?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","They were largely institutional, but we're seeing them around the world, there are some large lumpier projects. So, it's difficult to always know the exact timing but the pipeline looks pretty strong going into 2017. So, the backlog 2016 ending will be greater than it was of course 2015 ending and then we've got a good pipeline coming into 2017. So, we feel like the earlier comment about 2017 looking a little bit more like 2016 with perhaps more institutional tailwind and if anything a little less of the commercial headwind will net out to a pretty good year.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then a quick follow-up. TK for next year, you talked about North American trailer down 20%, but you think there is offsets, can you maybe just talk about maybe just round out where you see the offsets to that? And what do you think is the break point where perhaps it turns into a bigger headwind for higher. Thanks.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah, Nigel. First, when you think about the TK unit itself, you've got North America down maybe as much as 20%, you've got APUs down, you've got global marine down, pretty much everything else is going to go up. That's North American truck, truck and trailer and Europe and Asia, air, aftermarket, bus and rail should all go up. So, there's a chance that TK pulls off something close to mitigating that. But when you back away and look across the company, institutional is going to be strong. We think industrial margins will recover. So, there's a lot of levers to pull inside the company and a lot of confidence in the teams that we've got across the company to make it work. We see EPS growth next year. So, that's how I would look at it initially.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks Mike.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Okay, Nigel.","Operator","Thank you. And, our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa, from JPMorgan.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Hey, Steve.","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Good morning.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So, just on the fourth quarter, Industrial, I think \u2013 just correct me if I'm wrong. Industrial profits are going to be essentially flat quarter-to-quarter? I know there is some moving parts around Cameron that changed the seasonality a bit. It's usually up. Anything to read into there. And then secondly, your free cash flow guidance of $300 million, I believe, for the fourth quarter is down pretty substantially from the third quarter. It's bounced around a bit, but last couple years, it's been actually definitely stronger than that. So, just curious as to why those two dynamics. And I have a quick follow-up.","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","So, Steve, let me start out with the industrial comment and the fourth quarter. So, you're correct that the operating income is about flat, but what you have is a dynamic in the fourth quarter where you really have more of the large compressors on a year-over-year basis. It's going to be a tough comparison. (34:58) going to be one of those areas, you have tools and material handling, which are high margin businesses that are going to be down on a year-over-year basis.","So, in essence, you're going to have a volume challenge. You're also going to have some investments that are occurring in some of the business. For instance we're doing some investments in the Club Car business as well as in new products for the CTS business. So, it's really a story about volume and investment and a little bit less on the Industrial side with commodities, but also some impact there.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then, on free cash flow?","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yes. Free cash flow, that's a great question. So what we've done in 2016 is we've really changed the way that free cash flow has come in. So every quarter as we've started out 2016, we've had positive cash flow as opposed to having everything really backend loaded. So again, I think where we're at at $992 million at the end of the third quarter, is fabulous. We brought it forward and we brought it forward by paying attention to things like terms on accounts receivable, making sure that accounts receivable is balanced with accounts payable terms across the globe, with working through inventories and making sure inventories were there to serve the customer, but not too much to have additional product on hand.","So we've really managed this very, very carefully. And so what you see in the fourth quarter is really that instead of doing heroics to end the quarter, we've normalized it, which is really how we want to operate the business and how we want our cash flow to come in.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then Michael, as just a quick one. You mentioned EPS growth next year. I think in prior presentations this fall, you talked about top tier EPS growth, I know you had a bit of a low tax rate, that helped that growth a little bit this quarter still top tier even without that low tax rate. Is there something outside of the fundamentals next (37:17) the tax rate going back up or pension or anything else that kind of will keep you from getting to top tier and I guess with the fundamentals as they are with all that in, I mean, are you still talking that way or is this just hey the bogie is really just growing earnings given the headwinds that we have in TK et cetera?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah. I think Steve, it's a balanced and diversified portfolio, lots of service. We're investing heavily in the service channel as we've done all year long, and that's paying dividends. So, I think our eyes wide open on some of the challenges, but net-net, I'm talking about top tier growth from operations. Sue you might want to comment?","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","So, let me comment on the general business first. So, Steve, as we're going through and we're looking at the business, we still see strength in the commercial business for next year. We see strength in the residential business going into next year. We'll see improving margins coming out of the industrial business. So, we're going to get some good play on that. We're going to remain focused in terms of the price cost spread. We know we'll have a few headwinds on the steel side, but we'll still have a bit of deflation that occurs on the basis of copper that we already have locked-in and some of the aluminum that we have locked-in for 2017. We're also going to hit productivity really, really hard in the business, that's part of our hallmark of our operational excellence, and we're going to offset inflation. We're going to continue to press on corporate. So earnings per share growth next year on \u2013 I think is going to come from all of the different parts of the business, as well as tax.","Now, tax is something that we're really proud of, and we're really proud of because it's \u2013 we started to talk about a low 20%s tax rate earlier in the year, we got there faster than we expected, but we got there by really doing what we call operationalizing tax. Which is basically we assign tax partners to each of our SBUs, they're working projects within the SBUs to actually work down the effective tax rate. Things like trading hubs, things like energy credits, things like really legal entity simplification.","So, we've really operationalized that, I think it's kind of cutting edge. I still don't think our tax rate is going to go below the low 20%s, I think that's where it should be. So, yes, we'll get some tailwind out of that going into 2017 because I think the low 20%s is where we project the rate. But I think, it's operational also and something I think that's really good for Ingersoll-Rand.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. So, the low tax rate sustainable that \u2013 that's kind of the bottom line of that conversation, tax rate is feasible.","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yes that is absolutely the low 20%s tax rate is sustainable.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Awesome. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks a lot. So, I guess my first question would be on Thermo King. You sized that 25% of the business is North American trailer. I just wondered if you could give any further splits out of that business in revenue terms and also just focusing on Europe for a second, you sounded confident about Europe next year. A lot of the truck OEMs there have actually been talking about Europe slowing and maybe volumes falling next year on truck. So, maybe just give a little bit more detail on your Europe perspective for TK.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Hi, Julian. So, let me start with the quarter, that we've got in North America. You can add about 20% or so to Europe and the rest of the world in terms of trailer. Truck is a little less than 20%, aftermarket is a little bit less than 20%, APU in container are high single-digits, bus, air and rail are low double-digits. So, we've got North American trailer down, we feel pretty good about our plans, pipeline and the other businesses with the exception of marine container, which we don't think will recover much next year.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. And then my second question just around the balance sheet. Your net debt has come down very rapidly, there was no buyback in the last few months and you talked a little bit about a fairly attractive M&A pipeline, it's been a while since the last couple of deals. So, maybe just give us an update on how you're thinking about sort of size of preferred acquisitions and any sort of financial criteria for them?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah. I think one of the things we wanted to highlight for you was that in the last five years and we could go probably a little bit longer than that, but 18% per annum cash flow return on invested capital, we're doing well. So, even with the timing on Cameron not being great, we didn't lose a beat last year and we're not losing a beat this year in maintaining a strong cash flow ROIC.","The kinds of things that seem to populate the list for us would be channel investments and product extensions where we're selling products through existing channels that we have today with the sales force that we have today. There's a healthy pipeline of that, probably 50-50, I think across channel versus product and it's important to be patient there. They would be more accretive if they can be closed, don't say share buyback at this level. So, the optionality is important to wait it out to make sure that we do the right thing.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Hi, Jeff.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Two topics, first one, just back to Industrial, the comment broad based recovery. I truly want to understand what you mean by that, it would appear that you clearly mean controlling what you can control and improving operations internally. But are you also notwithstanding the pressures you still see in Q4, actually calling a turn in those end markets and see visibility of that happening?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Jeff, we're seeing flattening really, not improving markets, flattening markets and easier comps coming into 2017, but a lot of what we'll do in 2017 is improve margins to the op excellence restructuring and cost activity. And then, very good product launches coming in this quarter, fourth quarter and next year as well and that's really our game plan for Industrial for 2017. We are not counting on a broad based Industrial recovery though.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. That's what I thought. Thanks. And just back to kind of the institutional markets and what you're seeing in the project book. Are those skewed towards new projects or is there a lot of retrofit going on in the institutional outlook and maybe just in general, if you could speak to kind of the retrofit pipeline that you're seeing?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah. I'd say, it's largely energy efficiency retrofits replacing old antiquated systems with newer systems and those projects can get very large. So we'll see it from universities to healthcare to municipalities, state governments, federal installations. This is pretty much the market that we anticipate continuing into 2017.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great. There's actually just one really quick one, maybe for Sue, just pension next year. Sue, any initial thoughts?","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","It's Sue. Our pension I believe as we look at it at this point is going to be flat for year-on-year in terms of pension expense, so I know a lots of people are calling headwind on pension because of discount rates falling and of course obviously ours are down 75 basis points from year end also. But I think with the way that we have the portfolio setup with the asset returns that we've got, my expectation is that we are going to be flat.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Good morning, Joe.","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Good morning.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So, my first question, Sue, going back to your comments earlier on cash flow, good job on the working capital. I'm just curious as we think through the bridge to 2017, are there any items that reverse in 2017 or is the right way to think about your free cash flow growth really EBIT growth should equal free cash flow growth in 2017.","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","What we're focused on is really exactly what you said that the EBIT growth should be the free cash flow growth, and that's exactly what's happening in 2016 is, the operating income growth is falling through, our percentage on working capital is remaining true. We are not having to invest heavily in terms of capital, but we're also doing all of the projects and all of the items that our businesses bring forward that make financial sense. And so, if we can keep that rigor going, that is exactly the model we want which is see the EBIT flowing through.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. That makes sense. And then, Mike, I just wanted to square some comments you made earlier on Thermo King. So, with North America trailer down next year, and your comments around hoping to offset with other parts of the Thermo King portfolio. Can you square that with what your expectation is for op income for Thermo King. Would you expect it to be up next year given that you think there is going to be some natural offsets on the growth side.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","So, I'm going to punt that down the road here a little bit for us to be honest. We want to dial in what North American trailer volumes will be. We're going to probably set around a 20% down number, and make sure we don't do anything. In the event that it's only down 10% or if it's down 30% we want to optimize the cost structure to match it. So, I know that if it's down 15%, we're working a plan to be relatively flat. We'll see as we get closer and dial this in, but we need a few more months on this before we can really come back to you on that.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks guys.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Winoker from Bernstein.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks and good morning all.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Hey Steve.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey Sue just want to clarify the commentary around price cost heading into the fourth quarter. You've been talking about 20 basis point to 30 basis points spread for the second half, so given the 60 basis point this quarter should we be looking at flat next quarter, and then into 2017?","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah. So, let's talk about the fourth quarter first. So you are right if you do the math and you have an 80 basis point spread for the year it would get you to flat to maybe 20 basis point spread in the fourth quarter. But what we see happening and again the third quarter came out better than we had hoped at 60 basis points which was really about 50-50 materials equation and the other price. As we start to look at 2017, I think what 2017 does is it reverts to what we've said all along which is that we would have a 20 basis point to 30 basis point spread between price and cost and as you start to look at commodities for 2017, so steel has moved around a little bit. We saw an increase earlier in the summer to over $800 a ton. We currently see spot prices back in the $700 range. So, we have about a six-month time lag between when those prices move around and when we see it.","Translated, that means I am going to see some steel inflation in the fourth quarter as well as probably the first quarter of 2017. However, I still continue to see tailwinds coming out of copper and aluminum going into 2017, helping us to offset that balance. So, we have line of sight to what we think the commodities are going to do and therefore we have line of sight to what our costs are, so that we can price per our operating model with top line margin expansion and get back to the 20 to 30 basis points for the year.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And Mike, lean obviously has been so important to your story for IR, but I am just looking at Climate in it and Industrial this quarter. Excluding volume and mix and 20 basis points on productivity versus other inflation for Climate and down 100 for Industrial. What's going on on a lean path here?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah. Really, it's the volume running through Industrial's so low on the large equipment, which is where the big heavy fixed costs tend to sit. So it's more volume dependent. If you look at what's actually flowing through there's good productivity on that lower volume. So, Steve, the long story short is volume helps productivity, cost reductions we've taken need volume to apply them to and that's \u2013 it needs to happen in the Industrial business.","But look, fundamentally, you'll see us turning up the gas again in 2017, and we'll make sure the pipeline \u2013 we try to keep the pipeline 125% of what we think it needs to be. We try to calendarize that by quarter. So what we're doing now and we do every month is to make sure that we've got that pipeline lined up to be 125% of where we want it to be for our plan, allowing for things to break or timing to be different.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Mathematically, though, on 14, where you show volume separately in the waterfall chart versus productivity, you're actually saying, look, there's a volume effect running through the productivity as well as in the volume part of that chart.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Absolutely. Because we're trying to separate productivity on volume from volume at standards.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Right. Okay. And just, sorry, one last thing. You talk about the replacement market being so significant for IR. Are you seeing as a result of the new investments, breakeven paybacks coming in shortening for customers that's sort of driving a shortening of the replacement timeframe for specific end markets in any kind of big way?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah. I think the combination of the regulatory effect and the thought about getting in front of that when customers have the opportunity. Plus, from our point of view, there's a passion at the company around energy efficiency and sustainability. I think you hear that every time you talk to us. That combination I think is helping our people in the field make the story more compelling. And I do think it's led to why we're seeing share gain globally across the board.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning, guys.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Good morning, Andy.","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Good morning.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Mike or Sue, last quarter you gave us a breakdown of what your Industrial business looked like in its major sub-segments. You talked about Club Car aftermarket, large machines, small rotary, small air. You said larger machines, I think, were trending down 50% and smaller equipment was down a little. How would you characterize those segments, the sub-segments, in 3Q and do you see any improvement in your large factory exposed air business and do you have any initial thoughts as we head into 2017 on those sub-segments?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah you're seeing some of the smaller equipment growing, which is a good sign. You're still seeing really severe contractions in large machines. But we're ready to lap that, I think, next quarter and so that's why I think it's going to stabilize where it is.","And you're seeing a still good growth in oil-free machines and contact cooled machines that would be supplied into pharma, food and bev in particular, markets which \u2013 again, the earlier comments I made, were really trying to direct more of that proactive activity into the markets that are actually growing. We don't see a lot of relief coming in iron, steel, air separation, those sorts of markets.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, Mike. That's helpful. And then on Climate, can you give us a little more color, I mean you said a marginal change in your guidance this year to 4% versus 4% to 5%. When I look at the sort of the pieces, it looks like the only change here is in transport, down low single digits versus flat to down last quarter was your guide. Is that North American trailers, just APUs and marine still being weaker than you thought or is it something else?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","I'd say it's exactly that, Andy. It's exactly what you just said, it's North America trailer, APU and marine as being weak and not really a surprise. We've been thinking about this really all year. We thought it would actually be earlier in the year, it's actually the back half of the year. But certainly, that's the change really as you come through now the final quarter.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. As you look into 2017 through, marine is very, very low, right? So, we really shouldn't have an impact from marine any more at this point?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","I would hope not. We're trying to look at crop yields and other fundamental factors that determine if you're going to see produce and food and perishables move. So, structurally, you're getting to a pretty low level here.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan from UBS.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Hi, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, on the institutional improvement, not only in 2016 but you talked about 2017. When it first started for you, it seemed like it was mainly in K through 12 education, now it sounds a bit broader than that. Can you talk a little bit more about how that's developed and what kind of visibility you have into it?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah. It's the typical way is it does evolve. It really is always kind of a K through 12 led institutional recovery, and then it moves up through higher ed, through healthcare and then eventually with state, city and federal projects. And a lot of that is based on just property values, the ability to tax against those values and have bonds pass local city vote. And so, you're into that cycle here now. It's still about 25% below where it was last time on a volume basis. So, there's quite a bit of room I think on the institutional side to continue to grow.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And then, Mike, you were talking about some of the M&A in terms of channel investments, product extensions, which all sound like good places to go, but they also don't sound very big. The buyback you talked about over the last bunch of years was several years ago. Can you just maybe update us on your current philosophy around buyback? I mean, given where the stock has traded, obviously we talked about it for a while, but doesn't seem like there is big M&A in the pipe. So, maybe just update us on your philosophy on buyback?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah. Maybe to step back even one step further, I mean, the first thing we want to do is make sure that we are absolutely investing in the business fully and I can check the box and say we're absolutely doing that. I can check the box and say, we've now put the dividend in a good place relative to the peer group and we're proud of that. So, it really does come down to what do you do with the other pieces of this thing and if you think about it over the long run, roughly half of the cash going to either acquisition or share buyback. We'd certainly like to grow the company, but we're not going to do that at the expense of making a poor capital allocation decision.","So, what you see right now is a large number of channel and potential product expansion investments that might fit the portfolio. If we could close, they would be worth the \u2013 the juice is worth the squeeze on those, so that's really why you're seeing us hold back here.","Now, with all that being said, we've continued for at least seven years I guess now that I have been saying this, always controlling dilution of the share count, so Sue alluded to the fact that's roughly 2.5 million to 4 million shares and we'll continue to make sure it's part of the program going forward.","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","And I think what you're seeing, Shannon this is another point on that is, we're going to be patient with this and with the cash that we have, because we really want to create long-term value. We'd really like to invest in some of these opportunities, to your point some of them in the smaller size with channel investments, but also in new products.","And so, it doesn't mean that we are going to just make an either or decision, we're being patient with the cash that's on the balance sheet and we're finding the best opportunities, but we want to let some of those M&A opportunities flavor a little bit and see if we can close them, because we think that's important too.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joshua Pokrzywinski from Buckingham Research.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hi, good morning, guys.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Hi, Josh.","Susan K. Carter - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Good morning.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","So a couple of questions. First on Industrial margins. Mike, you talked about some of the initiatives there to get margins back up, obviously, some progress this quarter. But to see the kind of jump back to even 2015 levels for margin, 2015 levels. Does that require a particular mix to get there beyond just some productivity improvements and running the business more efficiently?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Well, mix matters, Josh. I mean, definitely, if you look at the high margin material handling and tools businesses, they matter a lot. But if you look at a normal mix that we would've seen sort of pre-downturn, about 70% of the downturn that we've seen has been volume related, the balance being some currency and then some mix. So fundamentally, we do need volume to return, but with that being said, if volume doesn't return next year, and we have the same mix of business that we have today. We have a healthy expectation to expand margins in 2017 in the Industrial business based on the actions we know we can take at these low levels of volumes. And we'll be bold about that and you'll see us commit to that probably in February.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Got you. And then, just following up on some of your comments on institutional and some of the bigger projects that are in the pipeline. I guess that triggers off a little bit of an alert on performance contracting. So I'm trying to understand maybe some of the mix of orders that are coming in that are more project related and have some pull through revenue versus pure equipment type, and I guess it wouldn't be bookings shipped, but more of your own content type orders. And can you maybe help dimension some of that out for us?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Yeah. Josh, I don't have an exact split for you, but I'm amazed at the size of equipment and controls orders that we are getting that are not performance contract based like the Chunnel tunnel and I can name a handful of sort of marquee projects like that. So we are winning a lot of that sort of work and we are loading up on that work as well. With that being said, performance contracting is an interesting place for us to play and there is a healthy amount of pull through that comes both not just in equipment but in service. Performance contracts always have a healthy service component that comes along with the guarantee.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","And when we think about a more institutional mix in 2017, that would have that type of flavor to it?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","It's going to be large applied and performance contracting, and so it will be equipment and controls and service with and without an energy guarantee is the way to think about that.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Got you. Appreciate it. Thanks.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And we have time for one more question. Our final question for today comes from the line of Robert McCarthy from Stifel.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi good morning everyone. Obviously we've covered a lot here, but I guess the \u2013 I'll try on 2017 one more time. I mean Michael in the context of the last couple of years on the third quarter call, you definitely one year I think you provided a constructive range for EPS growth and then last year, you just talked about kind of the rhetoric around what you liked in terms of your overall HVAC portfolio. But do you think you have a good line of sight to 2017 on a forward basis versus previous periods in other words from 2014 to 2015 or are you \u2013 do you think there is more uncertainty in terms of the outlook this time versus the last couple of years when you were reporting 3Q?","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Robert, I'll tell you, I don't have a public point of view that's primetime at this point. So, good try, I appreciate the last question is one more shot at it. But we're putting our plans together now and there is a pivotal process at all companies to put that together, so I don't want to sort of put an end here too soon on that, but we understand what top quartile will be, we understand what our goals are, what our operating system is set out to do. And so, there is not a lot of acrimony inside the company to understand what good performance looks like. That's what you'd expect for us next year, and I'll dial that in as we get closer into next year.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for your time.","Michael W. Lamach - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Zac Nagle for any closing comment.","Zac Nagle - Ingersoll-Rand Plc","Excuse me. I'd like to thank everyone for joining today's call. As always, we'll be available for questions today and over the next several days. And we look forward to speaking with you soon.

[Operator Instructions].","I would now like to hand the call over to Janet Pfeffer. Ma'am, you may begin.","Janet Pfeffer","Thank you, Tricia. Good morning and welcome to Ingersoll-Rand's third quarter 2015 conference call. We released earnings at 6:30 this morning, and the release is posted on our web site. We'll be broadcasting, in addition to this call through our web site at ingersollrand.com, where you'll also find the slide presentation that we'll be using.","If you would, please go to slide 2, our Safe Harbor statement.

Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from anticipated. This release also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables which were attached to our news release this morning.","With that, let me turn it over to Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO; and Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO. Mike?","Mike Lamach","Great. Thanks Janet. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. In the third quarter, we exceeded our EPS forecast, improved operating performance and delivered profitable growth through solid execution, that more than offset headwinds from the global economic environment.","Our operating income and operating margin percent were both all time records. Particularly good performance in the face of a slowdown in the industrial segment, and in the Asian and Latin American regions. Our team responded well to the challenges. We were able to over deliver on our commitments, despite lower than forecasted revenues.","Adjusted earnings per share were $1.21, that's up 10% versus the third quarter of 2014. That compares to our guidance range of $1.15 to $1.19, so adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.04 better [ph] than our guidance midpoint.","Revenues were approximately $50 million lower than the midpoint of our guidance forecast. About half of that from more unfavorable FX and about half from lower volume. That translates to a couple of cents headwinds versus our earnings guidance. The tax rate was also a little higher, and that was another $0.02 of headwind. These headwinds were more than compensated for by higher productivity and lower spending, as well as a slightly lower share count driving the $0.04 earnings outperformance.","Organic revenue growth was 6%, led by strength in the U.S. and European transport and commercial HVAC businesses, as well as residential HVAC. Europe and the Middle East, excluding currency remain strong. Ex-currency, Latin America was down low single digits, with strong results in Mexico, partially offset weakness in Brazil. Excluding currency in Asia, revenues were down 3%, reflecting continued weakness in China and emerging markets.","Climate organic growth was 8%. Industrial markets were weaker in the quarter, organic revenue and industrial was down 2%. As you will see when I get to the forecast, we adjust our fourth quarter down slightly to reflect slower industrial markets and currency.","Organic orders in the third quarter were up 1%, impacted by tough comparisons in transport against record orders in 2014, as well as a slowdown in industrial. Commercial HVAC bookings, excluding foreign exchange were up low single digits and were up mid-single digits in North America.","Adjusted operating margins increased one full percentage point, a stronger productivity and pricing combined with deflation, more than offset negative currency, investments and other inflation. We repurchased about 4 million shares in the quarter, and have completed our announced 250 million of share repurchase in early October.","And I will turn it over to Sue, and then I will come back to take you through the fourth quarter outlook.","Sue Carter","Thanks Mike. Let's go to slide 4 please; orders for the third quarter of 2015 were down 2% on a reported basis, and up 3% excluding currencies, on an organic basis which excludes both currency and acquisitions, orders were up 1%. Climate orders were up 3% excluding currency.","Commercial HVAC bookings were up low single digits, and residential HVAC bookings were up mid-teens. Transport orders were down, primarily due to difficult comparisons with record 2014 bookings in North American transport and in marine. Organic orders for industrial were down 4%. Organic orders decreased by mid-single digits in air and industrial products, and improved by low single digits in Club Car.","Please go to slide 5; just a look at the revenue trends by segment and region. The top half of the chart shows revenue change for each segment. For the total company, third quarter revenues were up 3% versus last year on a reported basis, and up 6% on an organic basis, which excludes both foreign exchange and acquisitions. Climate revenues increased 8% on an organic basis. Industrial revenues were down 2% organically. I will give more color on each segment in just a few slides.","The bottom chart shows revenue change on a geographic basis, as reported and organic. Organic revenues were up 7% in the Americas, up 10% in Europe, Middle East and Africa, both led by strong HVAC and transport performance, and Asia was down 3%.","Let's go to slide 6 please; this chart shows the change in operating margin from third quarter 2014, of 13% to third quarter of 2015, which was 13.6% on a reported basis and 14% on an adjusted basis. Volume, mix and foreign exchange collectively were a 20 basis point headwind to operating margin versus prior year. Within that, about 40 points negative was from currency and 20 points positive from volume mix.","Price and direct material inflation contributed 60 basis points to margin with positive price and direct material deflation. This is consistent with the expectations we gave you in July, as the positive gap widens in the second half of the year, from material deflation. Productivity versus other inflation was positive 90 basis points, driven by strong productivity and cost containments. Year-over-year investments and other items were 70 basis points.","That breaks into three pieces. This is the first year in which Cameron is included in results, and impacted margins by 20 basis points due to intangible amortization. In the box, you can see 20 basis points of headwind from investments and 30 basis points from higher restructuring costs. In the grey box at the top of the page, overall leverage on an adjusted basis was 45%. Backing out currency and acquisition, organic leverage was 41%. That is better leverage than our July guidance, as lower revenues were more than offset by productivity and spend control.","Let's go to slide 7 please; the climate segment includes Trane commercial and residential HVAC, and Thermo King transport refrigeration. Total revenues for the third quarter were $2.8 billion. That is up 4% versus last year on a reported basis and up 8%, ex-currency.","Third quarter organic commercial HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits. Excluding currency, commercial HVAC revenues in North America increased by mid-single digits compared with last year, and increased by high teens percentage in Europe and Middle East, and HVAC revenues in Asia were flat.","The North American residential HVAC market continued in orderly transition to the new regional SEER standards. Residential HVAC revenues were up low-teens. Thermo King revenues were up low teens, ex-currency, with strong gains in North America. In Europe, organic revenues were up low teens.","Climate's margin performance was strong. Adjusted operating margin for climate was 15.8% in the quarter, 150 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2014, due to productivity and volume\/mix, partially offset by other inflation, currency and higher investment spending.","Please go to slide 8; third quarter revenues for the industrial segments were $729 million, down 2% on a reported basis and also 2% organically, as revenues from the Cameron acquisition offset the negative impact of currency. Air systems and services, power tools, fluid management and material management organic revenues were down mid-single digits versus last year. Organic revenues were down low single digits in the Americas, up low single digits in Europe, Middle East and Africa, and down in Asia. Third quarter organic revenues from parts and service increased mid-single digits. Club Car revenues, excluding currency, were up high single digits.","Industrial's adjusted operating margin performance was strong in the face of volume challenges. Adjusted operating margin was 14.4%, down 40 basis points when compared with 14.8% last year. However, the Cameron acquisition, including known purchase accounting impact and negative currency, account for 190 basis points of downward pressure on industrial margin. On lower volume, the team delivered pricing and strong productivity and cost savings initiatives to more than offset inflation and investment.","Please go to slide 9; for the third quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 5.4%. The increase versus prior year is primarily inventory. This includes some incremental inventory to support Q4 air compressor shipments and some pre-build of inventories prior to ERP system go lives, which went live in October, without event.","Also the lower growth forecast puts pressure on inventory, which will probably end the year higher than our prior forecast. We had good collections in the quarter, and our DSO improved year-over-year.","Our balance sheet remained very strong. We have no debt maturities this year. We expect adjusted free cash flow in 2015 to be in the range of $950 million, which excludes the IRS payments and restructuring. That would be within a couple of points of our 100% of net income targets for cash generation.","And with that, I will turn it back to Mike.","Mike Lamach","Great. Thanks Sue and please go to slide 10; North American institutional markets continued the recovery in the third quarter. There is no change to our revenue forecast there. We also continue to see growth in commercial and industrial buildings and retrofit. We still expect mid to high single digit growth for 2015 in North America and commercial HVAC markets.","The regional standards change in residential HVAC is going as planned. We expect motor bearing unit shipments for the year to be flat, up low single digits in 2015, reflecting the [indiscernible] that occurred in the back part of 2014.","To [Indiscernible] North American climate segment markets, we expect North American transport market to be up double digits in 2015, reflecting good trends in trailer, truck and APUs for most of the year. North American industrial markets have remained fairly weak. Gulf markets are expected to be up low-single digits.","We expect Latin American, Asian, European and Middle East HVAC equipment markets in the aggregate to be up low to mid single digits at constant currency, from flat to down, after considering currency. Within those regions, Europe and the Middle East have been relatively strong for us, excluding currency. Asia has slowed since July, and we now expect Asian markets to be down for the year.","We expect European transport markets to be down, including FX, but up at constant currency. Industrial markets in Europe and the Middle East, Latin America and Asia are more challenging, and we expect these markets to be down for the full year.","Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect our reported revenues for full year 2015 to be up about 3% versus 2014. Our prior range was 4% to 5%. So in total, we are reducing the back half revenue forecast by about $140 million. As I said, really $50 million of that happened in the third quarter.","Overall, foreign exchange will be a headwind of about four percentage points, which reflects the deterioration of several currencies since July, when the expected impact was 3% to 4% negative. We expect acquisitions to add about three points for the year. Organic growth, ex-currency and acquisitions remains at the same 4% to 5% range we gave in July.","We expect climate revenues to be up about 3% on a reported basis and approximately 6% organically. There was very little change to climate revenue outlook, only about $25 million or $30 million, and its mainly a reflection of softer FX rates than in July, and reflects continued weakness in China.","For the industrial segment, revenues are now forecast in the range of up approximately 3% on a reported basis; which compares to an anticipated growth of 6% to 7% in July. In dollar terms, the full year industrial forecast was lower by about $120 million. Its almost all from lower volumes, that short cycle markets have not recovered, as well as allowing for some shipment pushouts on larger machines. You might recall, that our July forecast needed about 2% organic growth in industrial in the second half, the new forecast reflects about 2% contraction in organic growth in the second half and industrial.","Within the industrial segment, organic revenues are now forecast to be down 1% for the full year compared to our July view of up 1% to 2%, reflecting the softness we saw in the third quarter, and a continued weakness in overseas markets. For operating margins, we still expect climate margins to be in the range of 13%, identical to our prior guidance. We expect industrial adjusted margin to be approximately 14%, also identical to our prior guidance. This higher productivity and the continued spending controls are offsetting the impact of lower volume.","Please go to slide 11; our adjusted earnings per share guidance range has been tightened to $3.69 to $3.74, an increase of 11% to 12% versus 2014. That excludes acquisition step-up, restructuring, the Venezuelan currency devaluation and the IRS agreement. It slightly moves the midpoint for the year, down by $0.02, which reflects lower revenue backdrop that we are entering the fourth quarter with and partially offset by the cost actions that are taken and that will continue. The range for reported or GAAP [indiscernible] EPS is $2.57 to $2.62. Fourth quarter revenues are forecast to be up 2% to 3% on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Currency impact offsets the impact of acquisition.","Adjusted fourth quarter earnings per share is forecast to be $0.90 to $0.95. We expect about $0.02 restructuring costs and $0.01 related to taxes for Venezuela, including these, the reported EPS range is $0.87 to $0.92.","We have provided an EPS bridge for the fourth quarter and the appendix to give you the walk from year-to-year. The fourth quarter forecast will put leverage, excluding currency and acquisition, so organic leverage, at about 75%, at about 2.5 percentage points of growth. That higher normal leverage is driven by strong productivity, material deflation in the quarter, and includes $15 million lower corporate expense than last year.","Before we go to questions, you might have seen the announcement we made this morning, naming Todd Wyman as the President of our Compressed Air Systems and Services business. Many of you have had the opportunity to meet Todd since he joined us six years ago. He has been instrumental in our value stream transformation and in the development of the company's first operating system, which is the foundation for the company's birth in operational excellence strategies. Todd's global business experience and demonstrated success and strategy implementation makes them highly qualified and serve as the compressed air system and services business President.","Keith Sultana was named to succeed Todd as Senior Vice President of Operations and Integrated Supply Chain for the company, including leading our operational excellence strategy. Keith joined Ingersoll-Rand seven years ago, and most recently served as Vice President of Global Procurement. Before that, Keith led the global integrated supply chain for the company's commercial heating, ventilating and air conditioning business in North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa. Before that, he led the climate solutions and industrial technology sectors. So our commitment to our business operating system remains as strong as ever. At one point or another, Keith has had direct manufacturing and supply chain responsibility for every IR business, which makes him an ideal successor to Todd.","These changes reflect our commitment to premier performance, aligning capabilities with business opportunities and market conditions, and they are consistent with our organizational leadership development plans.","So in conclusion, our strategies for growth and operational excellence have delivered a five year trend of excellent operating leverage, margin and earnings improvement. They remain the right strategies for the future. This quarter's performance, will be a demonstration of our focus on meeting or exceeding our commitments to you. Our focus remains to grow earnings and cash flow, with a further implementation of our strategies. We have already taken and will continue to take actions to generate growth and earnings, as needed to respond to market conditions.","And so with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Nigel Coe","Good morning.","Mike Lamach","Good morning Nigel.","Sue Carter","Good morning.","Nigel Coe","So let me start off with the change amendments for the industrial segment. Congratulations to Todd and Keith in their new roles. I am just wondering, what if anything changes in terms of the [indiscernible] for industrial tech, and to [indiscernible] the question Mike, is that -- the margins, the trickle of investor retention [ph] and I am just wondering, is that a recognition, given all the background that perhaps there should be a sharp focus on productivity and cost containment there?","Mike Lamach","Well looking at the opportunities, Nigel, and we are dead committed to the 70% and 90% operating margins that we have communicated in the past. We want to accelerate that as quickly as possible, and for the segment to achieve that, we have got to achieve that [indiscernible] that business, first and foremost. So the effort here would be certainly on all of the growth and operational excellence activities in the company. We see great opportunity in the value stream work, and reaccelerating that. So its really -- I think, a tribute to Todd's leadership, but also to a commitment to being on-track and getting ourselves on track for that business.","Nigel Coe","Okay. Fair enough. And just a quick follow-on there, Mike. The 50 bips of price cost benefit this quarter, consistent with commentary, but I think probably a little bit better than certainly what we expected. As that continues to get better, as the hedges start to roll off on the copper and aluminum, or is this a pretty good run rate from here?","Sue Carter","Nigel, let's think about the cost or the price and material from a longer term perspective. So what we would have is a -- we'd have a total average spread between direct material inflation and price of about 20 to 30 basis points for the year. What we said when we talked in July, was that in the second half of 2015, we would see wider spreads, because the material deflation was really kicking in, which is exactly what we saw in that 60 bips spread.","But in general, we are still targeting about 30 percentage points of spread for the year, then as we look at, going forward, we'd hang on to that goal of having a positive spread of 20 to 30 basis points. So I don't think that edge moves up forward, at least in the near term, that 2016 commodities are going to increase. We have got about 50% of our copper for 2016 locked in. However, I think its more realistic to think about the overall spread being 20 to 30 basis points, rather than a 60 basis point spread being a normal. I don't think that works [ph].","Nigel Coe","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Mike Lamach","I think Nigel, more than we though really, but we kind of thought 50, it was 60. So its pretty close to the number that we had thought.","Nigel Coe","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you. Good morning guys and ladies. Just quickly on Cameron and just the M&A impact. Just wanted to check my math, it sounds like you've actually held your Cameron forecast? If I am assuming a 3% acquisition contribution, that would imply about $380 million in revenues and back out [indiscernible], it was like 340-ish for Cameron. It sounds like no change there, but then Mike, you also made a comment about de-risking Cameron a little bit. So can you just reconcile that or am I missing something in that math?","Mike Lamach","Jeff, great question. Let me walk through. So I talked about the fact that we reduced the back half for you in total for the company by $140 million. $50 million of that would have happened in Q3, so $90 million relating to Q4. Also [indiscernible], there was regular change to the climate, really the top $30 million, leaving $60 million in the industrial businesses. We think about the Cameron piece of large machines, and we took a $20 million to $25 million view of risk on that, saying that, we know of some instances and perhaps will know some more delays for oftentimes customer acceptance or readiness on those sides. So think about $20 million, $25 million being associated with big machines.","The balance of that could be split 50-50 between all of what the short cycle replenishment is in industrial and FX again. So if you look at sort of the Cameron piece of this, on the large machine exposure, 20-25, and then if you look at just short cycle of recovery, some of that would be plant there, for both Ingersoll-Rand legacy and Cameron, it would be the normal smaller plant there. We are not seeing the order rates returning there, we are seeing some slowdown of capital spending from industrial customers in Q3 and Q4, and so there is a bit of that in there as well.","Jeffrey Sprague","Okay. And then, just shifting gears on TK, orders down on tough comps, but the comps are going to stay tough, right, in North America, in particular in trailer. How do you see things playing out? Should we still be thinking about double digit type decline or more in trailer in North America in 2016?","Sue Carter","So Jeff, let me give that a shot. So you're right, as we look at the order rates for North America for trailer in the third quarter, they declined. Again, we expected that, we talked about some of those orders being roughly at peak in the second quarter, and it really is a tough compare to 2014. So when we look at the fourth quarter, so first I will take fourth quarter, we expect the trailer orders again to show negative year-over-year comparisons, again, based on really strong 2014, actually record order levels last year.","So what we are looking at is, the tough comparisons on TK in total, orders for the third quarter and overseas markets were actually down, and ex-currency were roughly flat. But you also asked a question about 2016. So if we look at what's out there in terms of ACT data. So we are not telling you about your forecast. So we are looking at ACT data. We still are seeing forecast for that to come down in the ranges of probably some of those double digits. But we are closely assessing the markets, especially in trailer and in looking at the record volume. So not really a precise answer, but the tough comps are really the big part of the story, and in 2016, ACT doesn't see much change from the prior outlooks.","Mike Lamach","Jeff, if you took that kind of 15% kind of the -- sort of the market for North American trailer. I recognize, it\u2019s a little bit less than 25% of our business. We are probably going to see pretty good markets in Europe and Middle East. We are seeing probably good markets for marines, rail, bus and for our air, refrigeration businesses that we talked about a scenario last time that, a 10% to 15% decline in North American trailer, is something that we think we could still grow margins, in the TK business, and potentially, actually grow the top line. But that's not to be concluded until we finalize the plan.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Steven Winoker","Thanks and good morning all. Just to clarify that answer for Jeff. On the Cameron deal, you had originally promised $0.8 to $0.10 of gross accretion for 2015. So bottom line like, where is that -- what number it looks like you are going to achieve this year on that?","Mike Lamach","So cash accretion so at about $0.08 -- maybe a little bit better, but about $0.08.","Steven Winoker","Okay, great. And then on the restocking impact in resi and destocking across industrial. What are you seeing -- what kind of impact do you think that's having on the business?","Mike Lamach","Well residential is lumpy. You know Steve, it's hard for a quarter-to-quarter compare with all that's happened with the change in [indiscernible] regulations. Our global residential business was up mid-teens, but our North American residential bookings were up high teens. I wouldn't put a lot of stock into the booking numbers, and some of the anomalies from quarter-to-quarter.","The industrial restocking, is just more of an indication of slowing industrial markets, and as a fact that companies like ours are probably pulling in a bit on CapEx and we see our service businesses growing. So one thing you see in a typically mild pull back in your commercial-industrial phase, is that service business should grow. And our service business grew mid-single digits and mid single digits in industrial, which is a pretty good performance.","Steven Winoker","Okay. And then just following up your point about 30 basis points ongoing prices versus raws, and if I think about same growth rate maybe next year as this year for the overall business, if that were to be the case. Do you think you can hold these kinds of mid-40s organic incrementals?","Sue Carter","I think if we look at really more along the lines of what we have said longer term, which is -- we are comfortable with looking at incrementals that are -- and our gross margin levels, as opposed to trying to project what happens to all of those. And I understand the comment on deflation and the productivity that we have had, but I think there is going to be some other areas that are going to have even tougher comps in 2016 going forward. So I think, the price spread of 20 to 30 bips and our incremental leverage being at gross margin levels, have probably got a longer term weight of just thinking about the business.","Steven Winoker","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning everyone. I was hoping Sue could clarify the comment on expectations for -- did you say inventory increasing in the fourth quarter, and its impact on your free cash flow conversion?","Sue Carter","Right. So I am hoping that our inventory does not increase in the fourth quarter. What I meant, and hopefully what I said is, right now, our inventory levels are higher than what we would have seen a year ago. Part of that is, because of the build-up of the air compressor inventory for Q4 shipment. Part of that is the pre-build for the ERP go-live and some other impacts from -- actually the revenue decreasing.","But what I expect to see in the fourth quarter, is I expect to see the inventory come down, but the comment is that I don't really expect it to get back to the previous levels, or year ago levels at the end of 2015. So we will continue to work all of that off, it doesn't mean it's an issue, it just means its going to be slightly heavier. And what we have done, to answer your question, on a free cash flow basis, is that we did -- our original range was $950 million to $1 billion, we said roughly $950 million at this point in time, and what we are doing from a free cash flow perspective, is that everything that you might expect us to do, which is, we are overdriving performance on receivables. We are looking at all the things that make sense, in terms of being tight on all the other elements of free cash flow to make up for the fact that we have got a little more inventory than what we had a year ago.","So I don't think any of this is an issue. I think our free cash flow, being at 98% and sort of projected net income is running in line with where we'd like it to be. So I don't think it\u2019s a problem, I think its just going to be a little higher than it was a year ago.","Deane Dray","Sue, I appreciate the clarity. And Mike, I was hoping you could comment on the European strength in climate. Did that surprise you at all? How much is fix a factor there, and it looks like you could be getting some share gains?","Mike Lamach","Well it is surprising us for a couple of years in terms of just the success I think we have had. But as I said in the past, we have got an excellent team, bringing new business and a lot of new products and services being launched into the marketplace. So continued good performance there.","Deane Dray","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell, with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Julian Mitchell","Thank you. Just a question on industrial. I think you're guiding for Q4 organically to be down about the same degree in revenues as Q3, so maybe down about 2% year-on-year. But the orders progression has got worse, Q3 versus Q2 and the organic sales hurdle is higher in Q4. So maybe just confirm is that's really the case, and maybe talk a little bit about how you are seeing industrial demand trending kind of within the quarter and in the last couple of months, specifically?","Mike Lamach","The [indiscernible] Julian that we have really is in China, which really runs a pretty wide range of worst case, best case. And so, we are taking something out of a more conservative range in China at this point, and that's really the wildcard. The balance of it really is just sort of the book in turn that we know of and conservative views now on restocking into some of the stock businesses.","Sue Carter","And I would say Julian, you are right. When we talked in July, we have seen some short cycle markets recover in June. Some, but its not all certainly, and that reacceleration didn't continue in the third quarter, as we had anticipated, and we did lower our industrial growth outlook for the second half from plus 2% to minus 2%. So you are absolutely right.","Julian Mitchell","Got it. I guess, you are not expecting the decline to get worse in Q4, even though you have a tougher comp in industrial?","Mike Lamach","We had a little bit of a surprise favorability in bookings in Latin America in the compressor business, a bit of a surprise. And again, we think, we have taken a conservative view and China team has a roadmap on some larger orders that could close. But I think we have got this tackled with the 90 million in the back half, 60 million of it really being attributed to -- I am sorry, the fourth quarter, $90 million for the company, $60 million in industrial. We think we have got it covered here with what we know today.","Julian Mitchell","Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up on Trane in Asia. I think obviously, the trends, even back in July, were pretty unsteady in China. Maybe just talk a little bit about how you have seen the order intake in the backlog moving there?","Sue Carter","So let's just kind of talk about china in general. So obviously, economic growth rate, significantly below the historic rates, with the government attempting to rebalance the economy and all of those different pieces. Some of that is not smooth, some of it is lumpy and so some of the comparisons get a little bit volatile, if you just go from quarter-to-quarter. But if we look at HVAC bookings in China for the quarter, they were actually up low single digits versus last year. And for the quarter, HVAC revenues in China -- for the fourth quarter, the HVAC revenues in China are expected to be down low single digits, and part of that is applied systems and the growth there being more than offset by lower unitary revenues and currency. And so, there is a lot of different pieces that are moving around. If we just look at non-residential construction markets start in the fourth quarter last year, some of that continued into the second half of 2015. Some of the areas of strength or verticals, where we do see some growth would be data centers, healthcare, and mix development opportunity.","Mike Lamach","Good news there Julian, was the fourth quarter positive bookings and HVAC in China.","Julian Mitchell","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Your line is now open.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Good morning.","Mike Lamach","Hey Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Mike, so just on the -- to clarify the leverage point in the fourth quarter. I think you said corporate going down $15 million to $60 million. Is there some other maybe offset below the line and other income or anything that we should be aware of? It just seems like, I end up a little high, if corporate goes down $15 million?","Sue Carter","Well so when you think about the fourth quarter leverage and the different pieces, in the spot where you are going to look at and what's happening, if organic growth is going to be in the range of 2% to 3%, so you have got $75 million to $80 million of revenue. If you have got productivity and direct material inflation, we are still continuing to get price, and if those are the primary drivers of productivity in the fourth quarter, and you have lower corporate. To your point, the math does work out to be in the 75% to 80% range for the fourth quarter.","Mike Lamach","Shannon, another way to look at it, $75 million of revenue at the midpoint, $40 million NOI on that, take $15 million off that for corporate, now you are talking about nearly $25 million on $75 million. You have got 33% leverage and look at the price deflation spread, look at the productivity of our other inflation spread, and its really a doable number.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Okay. And there is nothing -- I know your other line moves around, there is nothing different going on there. It has been bouncing all over the place, something I had to model, [indiscernible] currency, but do you have anything moving significantly down the other line?","Sue Carter","No. So the fourth quarter should be relatively flat. So not really a lot of movement there that we are looking at.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Just on the commercial HVAC bookings, up mid-single digits in the Americas, do you have sort of the North America split of that? I think you used to give, and is there any parts of North America you see getting better or worse?","Mike Lamach","Applied is trending, as we said, applied, mid single, its sort of the institutional piece of that large unitary that applied to institutional is -- in fact, the larger unitary is doing really well. The open backlog [ph] sort of matches what the booking trends looks like, which gives us some sense that -- to think about open quote [ph] got predating bookings by three to six months. The rates stay fairly consistent going into 2016. So I think that its shaping up like the though, which is this mid-single digit institutional recovery that should last a few years. That state is still quite a bit more aggressive, and that you are showing institutional put in place 2016 versus 2015, 14%, starts at 10%. But I think as you all know, historically been fairly high, it comes down throughout the year.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Steve Tusa","Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just following up on Shannon's question. Can you just kind of give us the approximate margins? There are some rounding dynamics here, and you guys got some squiggly lines next to the numbers annually, and so I am just having a little bit of trouble again getting kind of low enough for the fourth quarter. Can you just give us more rough approximation of what the 4Q is for the segments? Margin-wise?","Sue Carter","So if we are looking at the total year for industrial being in the range of 13% or roughly 14%. So you are right, we have got a little bit of a squiggle in there. What that would imply for the fourth quarter on industrial, is margins in sort of the 15.5-ish type of range. And part of that gets driven by the compressor shipments in the fourth quarter, as well as continued productivity and lower inflationary type environment.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And then for climate, I think we are backing it into something around 13.5%? Is that about right?","Sue Carter","So climate, with the sort of 13 that we are looking at for the full year, would be -- if you backed into a -- that climate midpoint would be just a smidge under the 13 range for the fourth quarter?","Steve Tusa","Okay. Then that makes more sense. And last question, just on the resi dynamics, what will mix contribute this year? I don't think you guys had great mix in the second quarter, like maybe some others did? There maybe different timing dynamics around how much 14-SEER you are now selling? How much of that 14-SEER transition is booked this year, and then how much is kind of still yet to come for next year?","Mike Lamach","We have some negative mix, Steve, in the year with 14-SEER, which works itself out this year. But we think that generally 14 is accretive [ph] to 13 and we are seeing really good margin expansion in the res business. So in spite of the mix down of 14 for us, good absorption, good expansion, and work itself through in 2015.","Steve Tusa","And then for 2016, is there still some benefit to come in [ph]?","Mike Lamach","I think there is better -- I don't think have got the issue of mixing down in 2016. I mean, there could be a quarter, four or five months that -- you have to take with -- these dynamics of the change this year, in terms of stocking 13-SEER. For the most part, I think we should be having a pretty clean year, next year, in terms of mix.","Steve Tusa","Okay, great. Thanks.","Mike Lamach","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Robert McCarthy","Good morning everyone. I guess the first question I would have, is just, taking into account some of the comments around state of the U.S. non-resi and the limited visibility on the industrial side. I mean, how do you think about directionally about 2016 in terms of EPS growth, and what can you provide in addition, maybe for CapEx or -- you have provided some incremental margins. So what can you provide about 2016, how we should be thinking about it?","Mike Lamach","I mean, first of all, remember, we will do it from February, so I will give just some general sense of where things are going. But before I do that, step back for a minute and we look at 75% of the companies being in the climate segment. Of that, really 60% of the company is HVAC and more than 60% of that is in North America. So you have got, really 40% of the company, with pretty strong growth dynamics going into 2016.","I think HVAC in Europe, Eastern Europe, even potentially the Middle East will be growth organically for us, probably not the same rate of course as North America. But you have got that growing. So in essence, a large part of the business is growing for us.","When you think about industrial; I think that Asia, Latin America, continue to be a bit of a struggle and maybe some currency headwind coming at us. But net-net, we see that even with low growth next year, we will expand margins nicely. I am not going to give you an EPS number today, but we certainly feel like there is an opportunity with the pockets we are seeing at growth in 2015 [indiscernible].","Robert McCarthy","Okay. And then just one follow-up; in terms of just capital allocation and then just reinvestment in the business, given the prevailing environment. Certain change or nuance of the margin in terms of M&A or other forms of capital redeployment or internal reinvestment?","Sue Carter","No. When we look at it, we expect to continue the balance capital allocation that we have got. We have investment in our businesses. We can expect continue having a strong dividend payout. So in the 30% to 35% range, we will continue to, at a minimum, offset dilution with share repurchase activities. And then, the remainder of it, we will basically continue to toggle between value accretive M&A and additional share repurchase and just evaluate what makes the most sense at any given point in time.","Now, you had also asked about CapEx, and so generally speaking, our CapEx is usually in the range of about $250 million, which is roughly equal to depreciation, and we don't expect that to change going forward either.","Mike Lamach","The CapEx and investments are a number, that Robert, we can work with during the -- depending on what we see in terms of the environment. There is some flexibility for us to spend less, if we need to -- to help us on the EPS commitments that we will make.","Robert McCarthy","Thanks for your time.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Hi good morning.","Mike Lamach","Hey Josh.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Just a couple of questions, first on Cameron; obviously backlog is typically weighted to the fourth quarter, but can you give us maybe an indication on how order trends and visibility or coverage into next year looks, maybe versus what normal seasonality should look like? They are obviously [indiscernible] to the year yet, but just kind of any color on orders would be helpful?","Sue Carter","Sure Josh. One of the interesting things about the history and what happened in that engineered compressor business, is that not only are shipments back half loaded, but generally, orders in the launch engineered compressors are also back half loaded. So we are seeing real time, what's happening in the different places in the market. So let me give you a little color on what I think we are seeing, and how that translates into what we see for 2016.","So in general, you are going to look at this space being negatively impacted by all of the oil and gas majors are going to put [ph] in capital, 20% to 30%. There is industry consolidation. EPC activity is slowed, and so when you think about projects, there is probably, in general, fewer projects. Same number of competitors, which means that you need to be really sharp, you need to be really focused, and really work at the orders.","Now, having said that, if I break down the different pieces of the business. So on processed gas, which is roughly a quarter of the business; there is still some growth from the natural gas side of things, and LNG. There are some Middle East project delays. However, you have got petrochemical doing okay. Power-gen, particularly in Europe being an area where, there are some projects and things that we can look at, and so, when we think about the processed gas, one of the things that you can start to think about, is on the chemical side or petrochemicals, is the lower gas price, give you a lower feedstock price and that could change some of those dynamics. I don't know.","But its still a tough environment, as I said fewer projects and some things happening. Engineer, air, so another quarter of the business, you have still got air separation, particularly in the China market, that to be honest, I don't see changing any time soon. There is going to be some activity, but there is going to be a lot lower activity, and if you looked in just, what's happening from, industrial gas businesses and activity, you'd see lower activity in the first half versus 2014 and 2015, and I am not sure that that changes. And again, that industry, looking at projects where we might take place with some of that engineered air product, with air separation, you have got over capacity, lower steel demand and all of that.","In plant there, which is -- we can turn pieces of business. Its roughly flat versus 2014. There are still some good markets out there, with auto, food and beverage. Europe is a little slower on that side and Asia is down, and then the aftermarket for the business is where opportunity still exists. And so in general, you have got softer markets, still some projects moving forward. But we are in the period, when a lot of the orders take place. So we have got our eye on what happens in 2016 with all the different pieces.","Mike Lamach","Synergy-wise too Josh, we are really on track with -- as an example, just sort of the plant there, the rent synergies and the cost synergies, and if anything over the last few months, we have gotten a sort of even more conviction around the opportunity for the engineering, supply chain and manufacturing synergies that could exist in the business.","So I think that we will continue to make the business accretive and in 2016, we will make sure that if we got the weakness. [Indiscernible] who is talking about, that we have got a response to keep the margins at or better than when they were this year. And we got a roadmap to do that.","Sue Carter","And I think the bottom line of all of that is, its still a great business and its still a great product for us. And like I said, in spite of all of the things that I said about the market, its accretive in 2015, and we are getting the synergies. So more to come on this one.","Josh Pokrzywinski","That's great detail. And if I could just ask a follow-up on TK, I have heard that some of the trailer guys have opened up the order books, maybe a month or so early than they normally would for the following year. Is that something you guys have seen, and is any of the strength in North America this quarter, and maybe a month or so [indiscernible] had from what you might normally have seasonally?","Mike Lamach","Well, clearly [indiscernible] which customers opened up their order books and whose customers they are. So you could take the top 10 customers, they are going to order at different points in time. But I would say that, in the third quarter, you had some customers that open up their order books, and we have seen the same thing happen in the past, where there is a little bit of an anomaly between who is ordering. So we are -- whose order and who is left to order, and I don't think you're seeing a lot of dynamic shift in that. But you will see differences in book rates and revenue rates depending on when that occurs. Some of these guys will buy 1,000 to 2,000 to 3,000 units, and so it makes a difference when you are looking at 6,000 to 8,000 unit month, which we is what we have been saying the last few months.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got you. All right. Appreciate. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Andrew Obin","Yeah, good morning guys.","Mike Lamach","Good morning Andrew.","Andrew Obin","Nice quarter in this doom and gloom environment. Just a question; there was some debate inside the company about how to look at the value stream process, and at the Analyst Day, you have indicated that you are reassessing your approach, because you have sort of touched a lot of low hanging fruit. And then, we seemed to have had a pause in execution last quarter and this quarter operating leverage just seemed to have come through very nicely. Can you describe to us what internal operating changes you have been implementing over the past six months to address this next level of operating improvement.","Mike Lamach","Yeah, a lot Andrew. I am not sure I will cover it here, it would be a great discussion that we could have when we get together for our review this spring, in general. But we have used this product growth team as a basis to expand the effort across the company. We have continued to now touch really all of the business with the value streams. Sourcing has become, I think, mature across the company. We have got really good productivity last three quarters, really in general. If you look past Q2 and kind of look at the last three quarters, we are seeing productivity accelerate.","Its never really that linear. I know we'd all like for it to be, but its not. We have projects and ideas that, at a certain point in time, kick in a quarter, and those make a difference. Higher volumes would make even a more positive difference of course. So we are doing this all with actually quite sort of low volumes than some of our businesses. So we are excited, as volumes do return, we'd see even better productivity and the change that we have made.","And so, look, I think that we haven't really changed the operating system in five years, we have just really looked across as product growth teams, and now have touched most or all the companies in one way shape or form.","Andrew Obin","And just a follow-up question, I apologize if you have answered it already. But can you comment on cadence of industrial orders throughout the quarter?","Mike Lamach","Cadence throughout the quarter, there really weren't any sort of high spots in the quarter to say. They were choppy, they were just sort of low in the entire quarter. We had pretty good growth in our fleet management business, obviously which was a highlight for us. It was kind of a double digit grower there, it's a good sign. But material handling, which is really our only oil exposed business, significant declines of 50% in bookings in that business from prior year. So inside industrial, when you move the compressor business out of the way and you look at some of the smaller businesses, there are some high and low points, that generally speaking, pretty explainable if you look at material handling as a good example of that.","Andrew Obin","Terrific. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks and good morning.","Mike Lamach","Hi Joe.","Joe Ritchie","So a quick clarification. Mike, you mentioned earlier the dodge [ph] data on the institutional side, and your expectations for next year. But there is not a lot of noise in the data, especially on the commercial side. I am just curious, what if anything you're seeing and what you're making of that noise on the unitary side of your business?","Mike Lamach","Well, I think that the large unitary business continues to do well, because, there is also a lot of large unitary that's split into more of the institutional environment. So that continues.","Actually the commercial activity has been fairly strong. If you split up commercial-industrial, industrial has probably been just a little bit weaker in North America. But not a bad environment frankly at all for us. So we continue to think it\u2019s a pretty good North American market, for both institutional and industrial. But in terms of strength going forward, its really institutional than commercial, and then industrial HVAC kind of trending in that direction.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. That's helpful. And maybe following up on that, how do you think about mix then, as you head into next year? Clearly, we talked a little bit about some North America headwinds on TK. But some of the mix headwinds on resi sits aside. How are you guys thinking about mix? Particularly, in light of the climate margin target of 13% to 14% for 2016?","Mike Lamach","Well I mean, on track in a nutshell, Joe. I mean, TK still gives us really good volumes from a profitability perspective, working with pretty high volumes across the board. Even though the year-over-year decrease in the market will be there, we have got plenty of gas left there and grow parts of the business that we didn't have last time around. So we feel pretty good about being able to hold their head up on the TK business. As you look at a climate, great expansion in margins, in the res business. I have said before, I will say again, mid-teens, mid-teens plus EBITDA. The commercial business, particularly in Europe is doing well, and we are hitting some critical mass there, and I think we will begin to contribute more to that margins across the business.","And then in general, North America just does a really good job in terms of share and consistent margin expansion there. So feel pretty good about that. The wildcards are really Latin America and Asia for us, as it relates to HVAC businesses.","And here, we talk about pricing in China, but its not sort of an environment that's impossible, its just more difficult for us. So we are persevering in China, and again, we feel good at least about the quarter, bookings going in the right direction. We'd love to see next couple of quarters, look the same way before we feel more constructive about China -- about Asia in general.","Joe Ritchie","Okay, thanks. I will get back in queue.","Operator","Thank you. And I would now like to turn the call back to Janet Pfeffer, for any closing remarks.","Janet Pfeffer","Thank you, everyone. Joe and I will be around if you have any follow-up questions, and have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. That does conclude the call. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day."],"11294":["Ingersoll-Rand Plc (NYSE:IR) Q3 2013 Earnings Call October 18, 2013 10:30 AM ET","Executives","Janet Pfeffer - Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations","Michael W.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now turn the call over to your host, Janet Pfeffer, Vice President, Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Janet Pfeffer","Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Ingersoll Rand's Third Quarter 2013 Conference Call. We released earnings at 7:00 this morning, and the release is posted on our website. We'll be broadcasting, in addition to this phone call, through our website at ingersollrand.com, where you will find the slide presentation that we will be using this morning.","This call will be recorded and archived on our website.","If you would please go to Slide 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of securities laws. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from anticipated. The release also contains non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release.","A couple of things of note before I turn the call over to Mike. Similar to last quarter, we will be talking to adjusted margins during our commentary this morning, which excludes refinancing costs, impairment, restructuring and spin-related costs. Our news release and tables give you the reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted margins. This is consistent with how we've given guidance all year.","As a reminder, earlier this year, we transferred a business line from Security Technologies to Residential. This was just about $20 million of revenue in the third quarter. There was no impact at the consolidated levels. And in the charts and comments, we'll focus on the year-over-year change in revenues and orders for those businesses on a comparable basis so that we're best representing the underlying performance.","Now to introduce the participants on this morning's call: Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO; Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO, who joined us in September; Steve Shawley, Senior Vice President; and Joe Fimbianti, Director of Investor Relations.","With that, please go to Slide 3, and I'll turn it to Mike.","Michael W. Lamach","Thanks, Janet. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on today's call. We delivered growth and profitability above our earnings guidance in the third quarter, with solid operational execution across the company. Our revenues for the third quarter were up 4% versus last year, both on a reported basis and excluding foreign exchange, reflecting top line performance and top-of-our-guidance range. Revenues were up in each of the 4 sectors.","Orders increased 7%, and we're up in all 4 sectors. Orders were up double digits in commercial unitary HVAC, most of which shipped in the third quarter, and residential HVAC.","Recall that year-over-year comparisons for residential HVAC bookings are not that indicative given improvements in the order of ship cycle time as a result of the value stream work we've been conducting.","Adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter were $1.16, that's $0.06 above the midpoint of our guidance range of $1.07 to $1.12. Better performance from operations and higher revenues delivered upside of $0.05.","A positive $0.03 came from a gain on the sale of a security technology manufacturing site, which was closed as part of a footprint consolidation earlier this year. This is the same product line that Janet mentioned as being transferred from Security to Residential for reporting purposes. And the impact on operating income was $21 million, which was recorded in the security technology sector but after deducting the joint venture partner share and taxes, it was $0.03 of EPS.","This is a result of the factory consolidation project we've talked about the past few quarters, and it's a great example of operational excellence in the company. We have known all year that we were going to have the gain within the year, but due to government approval timing, we were just not positive in which quarter it would fall. It was not included in the third quarter's guidance.","Finally, tax was a headwind in the quarter, amounting to $0.02 drag on earnings versus guidance due to a discrete tax charge. Adjusted margin increased 140 basis points. Excluding the impact of a gain I just mentioned, margin increased 80 basis points. Versus 2012's third quarter, Residential delivered a 270-basis-point improvement, Climate margin was up 110 basis points and Industrial margins were up 90 basis points.","Security adjusted margins was up 520 basis points including the gain and down 30 basis points excluding the gain. Corporate costs were higher in the quarter as expected, due to the higher benefit costs and increased investments related to our IT transformation.","This marks our 10th consecutivequarter of a positive gap between pricing and direct material inflation. Our lean focus again showed significant results in the implemented value streams, and we continue to invest in the future of the business, funding significant new product development, investing in a new IT platform and building our services footprint.","Spin-off, restructure and refinancing costs were $0.23 from the quarter. We also recorded an impairment charge of $0.36 related to the security business in Europe, Middle East and Africa. We had filed an 8-K on September 20, advising that there would be this charge.","We continued our share repurchase program, repurchasing 5 million shares in the quarter. We repurchased 14 million shares year-to-date in September. We still expect to spend the current $2 billion authorization by the end of the first quarter of next year.","We continue to be on track with our milestone to complete the spin of Allegion in our planned time frame at the beginning of December. We completed a successful debt offering for Allegion a few weeks ago and have named the full senior leadership team, as well as the board. There are 2 key milestones approaching that could be impacted by the government shutdown: the shutdown could delay the timing of the spin beyond early December if we do not receive both the private letter ruling from the IRS, and the SEC declaration of the Form 10 is effective within the next 2 to 3 weeks. We have every belief and indication that we will receive both, it's just a matter of timing. And now that the government is back to work, we're optimistic that we'll be able to maintain our current timeline.","Now I'd like to formally introduce and welcome Sue Carter, who is our new CFO. She and Steve have been transitioning over the last few weeks since she joined, and that will continue until Steve retires. You will all get a chance to meet Sue in person at our investor meeting on November 12. Sue will take you through the third quarter results in more detail, and I'll be back with our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year.","Susan K. Carter","Thanks, Mike, and let me add that I look forward to meeting many of you in a few weeks in New York. Let me give you a high-level summary and then dive into the details.","Our bookings for the quarter were up 7%; revenues were up 4%; our operating margins without restructuring, one-time items and the gain on the property sale, improved 80 basis points; and we generated $474 million of available cash. Ingersoll Rand had good operating results in the third quarter. Now let's go to Slide 4.","Orders for the third quarter of 2013 were up 7% on a reported basis and excluding currency. Climate orders were up 7%, global commercial HVAC bookings were up high single digits, transport orders were up mid-single digits, industrial orders were up 2%, with order growth in Europe, Asia and Club Car and flat bookings in Americas.","Residential bookings were up 18% on a comparable basis. Commercial Security orders in the quarter were up 6% on a comparable basis.","Now go to Slide 5, please. Here's a look at the revenue trends by segment and region. The top half of the chart shows revenue change for each sector. For the total company, third quarter revenues were up 4% versus last year on both a reported basis and excluding currency.","Climate revenues increased 4%, with HVAC revenues up low single digits and transport revenues up high single digits. Industrial revenues were up 3%. Residential was up 6% on a comparable basis. Commercial Security revenues were up 5% on a comparable basis. I'll give more color on each sector in the next few slides.","On the bottom chart, which shows revenue change on a geographic basis, revenues were up 4% in the Americas, while Europe, Middle East and Africa and Asia were up 5% and 2%, respectively, excluding foreign exchange.","Now let's go to Slide 6. This chart walks through the change in adjusted operating margin from third quarter 2012 of 12.6% to third quarter of 2013, which was 14%. Volume, mix and foreign exchange collectively were 40 basis points positive versus prior year. Our pricing programs continue to outpace material inflation, adding 60 basis points to margin. Productivity offset by other inflation was 30 basis points accretive to our margins. Year-over-year investments and other items were higher by 10 basis points, which includes a 60-point impact from the facility sale that Mike mentioned.","In the gray box at the top of the page, the impact of the gain is excluded to better represent underlying performance. On this basis, overall leverage was 33%. Leverage in the sectors was 40%, partially offset by higher corporate investment spend.","The box in the middle of the page shows the revenue and adjusted operating margin by sector and in total, also excluding the impact of the gain. Operations, excluding corporate, increased adjusted margins by 110 basis points. Corporate costs were higher in the quarter due primarily to higher benefit costs and increased investments related to our IT transformation.","Please go to Slide 7. The Climate Solutions segment includes Trane Commercial HVAC and Thermo King transport refrigeration. Total revenues for the third quarter were $2 billion. That is up 4% versus last year on a reported basis and also up 4%, excluding currency.","Global Commercial HVAC orders were up high single digits. Orders were up in all major regions. Trane's commercial HVAC third quarter revenues were up low single digits and were up in all major regions, with Americas up slightly; Europe, Middle East and Africa up mid-teens; and Asia up mid-single digits.","Commercial HVAC equipment revenues were up mid-single digits, while HVAC parts, services and solutions revenue were up low single digits versus prior year. Thermo King orders were up mid-single digits versus 2012 third quarter. Thermo King revenues were up high single digits.","The adjusted operating margin for Climate Solutions was 13.9% in the quarter, 110 basis points higher than the third quarter 2012 due to volume, productivity and pricing, partially offset by inflation and higher investment spending. Please go to Slide 8.","Industrial technology third quarter revenues were $722 million, up 3% on a reported basis and 2%, excluding currency. Air, tools, fluid and material revenues were up low single digits versus last year. Revenues in the Americas were down low single digits, while revenues in Europe, Middle East and Africa were up high single digits and fairly flat in Asia.","Air, tools, fluid and material orders were up low single digits. Orders were higher in EMEA and Asia and were flat in the Americas.","Club Car revenues in the quarter were up mid-teens, and orders were up mid-single digits versus prior year.","Industrial's adjusted operating margin of 16.2% was up 90 basis points compared with last year as pricing, productivity and higher volumes more than offset inflation and investments. Now let's go to Slide 9.","In the Residential business, third quarter revenues of $609 million were up 9% compared with last year and up 10% when excluding foreign exchange. Adjusted for the product line move, comparable revenues were up 6%.","Residential HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits versus last year. Revenues for the residential security portion of the sector were up mid-teens on a comparable basis, with increases in all major channels. Sector operating margin of 10.8% was up 270 basis points compared with 2012, as pricing, volume and productivity more than offset inflation and adverse mix.","Please go to Slide 10. Revenues for Security Technologies were $392 million, flat on a reported basis and up 5% when adjusted for the product line move. Americas revenues were up mid-single digits. Revenues were up low single digits in both Europe and Asia.","Bookings on a comparable basis were up 6%. Results for the Security segment included the gain of $21.5 million as discussed earlier. Excluding gains, adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 21.2%, down 30 basis points from last year as productivity, price realization and favorable mix were offset by inflation and higher investment spending.","Now let's go to Slide 11. Available cash flow for the third quarter of 2013 was $474 million or 27% above the third quarter of 2012. The increase was due to operating's earning improvement and a 50-basis-point improvement in working capital as a percent of sales, as you see on the slide.","Cash conversion, defined as available cash flow, excluding onetime and restructuring costs divided by net earnings, was 164% for the quarter and 109% year-to-date. Year-to-date available cash flow is almost $300 million higher than last year.","Our cash flow performance was strong in the quarter, and we feel good about the $1.1 billion guidance for the full year.","And with that, I will turn it back to Mike to take you through the guidance.","Michael W. Lamach","Okay. Thanks, Sue, and please go to Slide 12. Some of the prior quarter's guidance for 2013 is on an as-is basis. It assumes the current Ingersoll Rand 4 current operating sectors was in place for the full 12 months of 2013.","Subject to receipt of the approvals in the SEC and IRS, we expect the security spend to take place in the fourth quarter. However, consistent with our convention all year long, this guidance does not reflect the spend.","Likewise, consistent with our prior guidance, we have broken out spend and restructuring costs from the core EPS guidance in order to give the best representation of the company without the impact of the impending spend.","To give you an update on our market views, let's start with U.S. non-residential.","Dodge construction starts and Put in Place trends have deteriorated somewhat since our prior guidance. The Put in Place outlook was lowered in Commercial and Industrial and institutional market segments. The Commercial and Industrial Put in Place forecast for 2013 went from up 9% to up 6%. Institutional markets are expected to be down for the year by 7% versus down 5% in the prior Dodge market forecast.","The construction starts forecast for 2013 was lowered from up 8% to up 5%, mainly due to a lower outlook in institutional, which is now expected to have 7% lower starts than 2012. The prior forecast was for 2% lower starts.","Starts is a longer lead indicator for us, so we would -- I think the impact would be greater in 2014 than in 2013.","We continue to expect low single digit growth in North American commercial HVAC overall and flat to a low single digit decline in North American Commercial Security. We expect North American truck trailer markets to be fairly flat on a unit basis in 2013.","Asian HVAC markets are expected to be fairly flat in 2013. The China HVAC market is expected to be up mid-single digits for the full year, while Asian markets outside of China will be down low single digits.","U.S. residential and new construction markets continue to show good growth. We expect industry motor-bearing unit shipment for the year to be up high single to low double digits in 2013, driven largely by new construction. We expect R-22 to be a lower percentage of the market, down about 10% versus 2012.","Industrial Technologies saw somewhat stronger markets in the quarter in EMEA, with a positive revenue trend in the quarter for the first time this year. Industrial markets in the Americas remain sluggish.","In China, we saw positive industrial bookings and revenue in the quarter at a fairly low rate and have therefore slightly lowered our outlook for industrial Asia for the full year. When taken in total, the industrial revenue forecast growth for the year is unchanged.","EMEA Security outlook remains at a slight contraction for the full year. Our Asian Security business, which is much more influenced by the timing of large infrastructure projects, should be up high single digits for the year.","Overall Europe, Middle East and Africa taken together were a bit of a positive in the quarter, across the businesses, with higher revenues in every sector. We have revised our full year outlook for the region for the total company, from up slightly to up low single digits.","Based on our results in the third quarter and our visibility for the remainder of the year, we are raising our revenue and earnings guidance for the year from the prior midpoint. Our revenue outlook for 2013 is now $14.3 billion to $14.4 billion, which is a $50 million increase for the midpoint and which equates to 2% to 3% growth versus 2012.","This was basically a reflection of the higher-than-midpoint revenues we saw in the third quarter.","Translating that to our full year outlook by sector, we expect Climate Solutions revenue to be up 2% to 3%, slightly higher than prior guidance. For Industrial Technology, revenues are forecasted to be in the range of down 1% to flat. Residential is expected to be up 9% to 10% on a reported basis and up 5% to 6% on a comparable basis. And for Security Technologies, our outlook is unchanged at down 3% to 4% on a reported basis, and up 1% to 2% on a comparable basis. Please go to Slide 13.","We are raising the midpoint of our full year adjusted EPS guidance range. The updated range is $3.55 to $3.60 per share. The full year tax rate forecast for 2013 is still expected to be 23%. This excludes a full year estimate for one-time spin costs and restructuring of $0.70, early bond redemption cost occurred of $0.15 and a third quarter impairment charge of $0.36 related to the Security Technologies EMEA region. The $0.70 estimate higher than our prior guidance is the additional cost expected to complete the spin.","The restructuring estimate reflects $50 million for a full year restructuring spend in which we have spent $44 million year-to-date in September. We are going through an extensive process to determine the right organization structure for post-spin Ingersoll Rand to deliver growth while having an efficient cost structure, including elimination of stranded costs from the spin.","We're finalizing the plans over the next few weeks, and we'll be in a position to provide you with more detail at our Investor Day on November 12.","To focus on fourth quarter guidance, refer to the right-hand column on this chart. Fourth quarter 2013 revenues are forecast to be $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion. That translates to up 1% to 4% versus the fourth quarter of 2012.","Adjusted fourth quarter earnings per share are forecast to be $0.85 to $0.90. We are assuming a share count of 294 million shares and a tax rate of 23%.","One-time spin and restructuring costs are expected to be about $0.40 in the quarter. But as I said earlier, we will likely revise that estimate as we finalize our restructuring plans.","For the full year 2013, we still expect to generate available cash flow of $1.1 billion, excluding onetime and restructuring costs.","So in closing, we're pleased to have delivered another solid quarter. We continue to feel good about our company. Our focus is on positioning our company to continue to grow earnings and cash flow with or without help from markets. As you can see from the results this quarter, we capitalized on some pockets of growth and leveraged nicely. We've implemented a consistent shareholder-focused capital allocation program. We have proactively worked to reduce costs and improve productivity while still making prudent investments for the future. We continue to invest in new products and service offerings, our IT infrastructure and further developing our people and our operating capabilities.","The spin of Allegion is on track, pending some final approvals. Proud of the progress we've made and the results we have delivered and certainly, optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead for us.","I'd like to take this opportunity to publicly thank Steve Shawley for his years of dedicated service and leadership to our company. Steve has been a leader not only in Finance as Controller and most recently as CFO, but also as the Business Unit and Sector President at Thermo King and Climate. Steve's steady hand led us through the 2009 financial crisis and he leaves in great position with both a strong balance sheet and a strong finance team.","Steve, we wish you a wonderful and well-deserved retirement.","Steven R. Shawley","Thank you, Mike.","Michael W. Lamach","So Steve, Sue and I will be happy now to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just in terms of the productivity trends, you had about 30 bps of net productivity tailwind to your margin in Q3. That was after 50 bps in Q2 and 90 bps in Q1. So I just wondered if that reflected simply a shrinkage of the tailwind around materials or anything going on in terms of gross productivity, if there was just some slowdown in that as you approached the spin-off of Allegion?","Michael W. Lamach","Yes, Julien, this is Mike. And the short answer is no. The movement in the gap that we've been seeing has been really higher other inflation this year, driven by the benefit costs and wage increases, but the productivity itself has been fairly steady. The value streams, which would be the labor, productivity component, have continued to show excellent results, and sourcing is right on track, delivering the expected levels of productivity there. You can actually see that on the gross margins. We're up about 100 basis points. One thing that is shifting and it's shifting by design and evolution, is the amount of value analysis and value engineering productivity. And that has been last because, as you can imagine now, after 4 years of developing new products and more new products sort of being imminent, there's less need and less old product to go do VA\/VE work. But the replacement for that is new product that hopefully higher market -- sorry, higher margins and higher market shares. So I don't think there's an issue here with the sort of runway in front of us, but the only maybe mix change is around that VA\/VE component. As far as G&A areas, I still think we're in the early innings there on that. Clearly, we're investing more right now in IT system conversion than we're seeing in productivity, but that's a long process of getting kind of systems installed and obviously, productivity that results on the back end of that. But that's not a surprise to anything that we've been talking about now for the last couple of years.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then on the top line, this is always the time of year when people try and get excited about U.S. Commercial construction recovering in the year ahead. It doesn't sound in your commentary as if you're seeing much change. I mean, you did push up the bottom end of your Climate market growth assumption for this year. But when you look across the equipment and the services and parts business in the U.S. Commercial, are you seeing much change? Or it's pretty much steady as it was at the beginning of the year?","Michael W. Lamach","Well, actually, service and parts bookings have been good. I mean, the surprise was this year, in the third quarter, was twofold, really in the Trane business, where we had much higher Unitary sales than we had anticipated, and that is going into a strong commercial and industrial market in North America. The other thing that was a bit of a surprise in the third quarter was our Applied business bookings, particularly in North America, were up. And they're up kind of high single digits in North America, and that really helps us relative to what we had expected in quarter 1, quarter 2, even potentially quarter 3 of next year. So it's a long lead delivery on those, but that was a nice sign. But with all that being said, though, we use a number of data points. I know you're familiar with most of these, and the one that we've seen a slip since the last time we talked has been that Dodge data, both the Put in Place and the starts coming down again. So we're somewhat muted in our 2014 view at this point in time as to calling a commercial recovery. We do love what we've seen in the certainly commercial and industrial space. And we do believe, both in Unitary and a small bit of Applied that goes into that market, that we've done very well in those markets.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And Steve, congratulations on the retirement. Very, very jealous. I'm about 20 years from that event, so very, very jealous.","Steven R. Shawley","Fair enough, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So just going to pick up on that point. I mean, obviously, the bulk of your commercial exposure is retrofit and replacements. We've seen significant deferral of replacements, particularly within the applied markets. I'm just wondering, are you seeing the sort of the start of the elements of a replacement cycle? Are you seeing a pick up in cooling activity? Any color on that would be good.","Michael W. Lamach","Well, I mean, there has been the launch of quite a bit of new applied product, but frankly, unitary as well that is more efficient, is more reliable. And in that regard, it's always better in conversations with customers when you're able to apply shorter paybacks on what we're doing. So about half the market, I think, is visible through what we see in Dodge, and half the market is the market we create through, I would say, owner direct activity, really pitching energy efficiency and retrofits in buildings. And so frankly, although the Dodge market is unimpressive, I think we continue to do well around energy efficiency, your replacements and to owners.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then switching to Europe, I mean, I guess Europe is a bit of a surprise with -- you've had commercial HVAC up mid-teens and upper single digit growth within Industrial. So can you just provide some color around what you've seen in Europe? I mean, is this just sort of a flush through in your comps? How sustainable is this kind of growth rate in Europe in your opinion?","Michael W. Lamach","Well, for the full year 2013 across the company, we see Western Europe is still down only slightly. The big pickup for us has been Eastern Europe. And then actually, from the way we consolidate that, the Middle East is in that number, and the Middle East has been up quite nicely, particularly in the HVAC business. So Western Europe, not fully recovered; Eastern Europe, doing very, very well; and the Middle East, of course, doing well, too.","Operator","Our next question comes from Deane Dray with Citi Research.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I was hoping you'd give some color in sizing the investment spending that you've done in Climate? And what type of investment you're thinking about in the next year or so?","Michael W. Lamach","Yes, Deane. It's not been a program. I think everyone knows that we've been measuring vitality across the businesses for at least 4, maybe little bit longer years now, and we've had sort of a steady influx across all of our businesses. Climate specifically has been a big benefactor of that, both in Commercial and in Residential. So we would continue apace. I mean, you might see the pace to be, incrementally, a little bit higher for 2014, although we really haven't put together yet the concrete plans for 2014 yet across those businesses. But some fantastic ideas around what we're doing there. And quite a bit of investment going on in the applied products, whereas the last 2, 3 years, we've seen that in the Unitary product. We're looking now at -- for many of the broader lines, historically high shares across the business. And that's indicative of really having put together, I think, the right product plans and have made the right deliveries. So there's actually quite a bit going on in terms of new product launches this fourth quarter and on through the middle of next year, particularly in the Trane and Commercial business. Actually, Trane -- Commercial, Trane res together. So yes, I can't give you a definitive number. I don't see a slowing down. The investments we made have been long term and programmatic. There've been really geared against a long term, multi-generation product plan. I'd add the same thing translates over to Thermo King, where we've continued to invest in next-generation trailer product, and we'll continue to do that in 2014 as well. So steady as she goes, maybe a little bit more incrementally. But so far, I think it's added to the top line margin expansion that we've seen.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And on the residential HVAC side, can you comment on the mix at the lower end, Ameristar? How -- what kind of traction have they seen? And do you have a sense of any share gains in the quarter?","Michael W. Lamach","We are having good success with Ameristar. Ameristar is right on plan for us, no changes there. And relative to what we see, sort of in -- across sort of the board there, R-22 is certainly down, as I mentioned, about 10%. A little bit actually of a bit of a resurgence in the second quarter versus the trend line that we're on, I don't think enough to be a concern. But as some replacements were done really in the second, third quarter, just a bit more mixed toward R-22 than what we had projected. Not a big deal, but we were in position with a product and at the right price point to look at that. So it's really difficult to comment on residential HVAC shares on a quarter-to-quarter basis. I think what we probably do is similar to last year. We might give you sort of a more definitive answer to that question early next year, looking back on a full year. But we like what we're doing. We like the growth. The product, I think, is right. The margin expansion is what we thought it would be. So we feel pretty good about the execution of the team. And as I said in the earlier question, some very interesting product coming out for us in the fourth quarter and through the season next year that, I think, will be pretty exciting.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Mike, I just wanted to make sure I kind of understand your thinking about the fourth quarter, because it feels like we had a pretty good sequential increase in orders this quarter and yet, we don't have a ton of growth next quarter. Is there anything we should be aware about, vis-a-vis, tough comps or onetime or long-term sort of orders or anything like that, that would help true that up?","Michael W. Lamach","No. It's the nature of what's booked. And maybe to give you just a little bit of color on that, if you take North America as an example, where we were up in HVAC 7%, half of that really is in the aftermarket parts and services. And so there's really no order that shipped there as -- as quickly as we get people on the street, parts shipped to the customer. 72% of the balance was Unitary and that's about 70% shipped in Q3. So we've got 30% of that portion left to ship. All the nice Applied bookings, though, really got extended out into quarter 1, quarter 2, and it's when the customer is fundamentally ready or the building is ready for shipment. So that's indicative of sort of our business here as between service and parts, and then you get into Unitary, which is very quick ship, turning ship for us. It really just takes that applied and moves it out a bit for us. Same is true, we had a nice growth in China air; we were up 8% bookings there, but all of that is 2014. In fact, even toward the back half of 2014 in the China air business. And actually, a product that we've launched and are developing in China for the Unitary HVAC business, a new product, was up 66%. But again, all that product is due for us in 2014. And I could go through each of these businesses, but as we go through that and we did our operating reviews on Tuesday of this week, we just didn't get any sense that there was something missing here between the translation of the 7% bookings and the fourth quarter midpoint estimate we have of about 2.5% growth. So, Steve, it does line up 2014, where we've got a little bit of backlog, we'll be able to take into 2014. That's probably the good news.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Yes. That sounds positive. And then I guess I'm also curious about 2014 directionally. When you think about the productivity potential improvements, do those continue kind of through 2014 at the current level? Or is there a reason for it to sort of move one way or another?","Michael W. Lamach","Well, we're not going to give guidance on 2014 productivity, but I'd just take you back. Lean for us, still early innings. Our global sourcing organization a little over 1 year old now. So that's still kind of early innings. We really have in front of us all of the functional excellence work that we want to undertake inside the company. Part of that enabled through the IT work and part of it enabled really just through organizational change that we might make there. So fundamentally, I don't see why we would slow down productivity in 2014. I assure you, our plans are to maintain that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Mike, I just want to make sure I understood your message on restructuring. So the comment is that the plan, as it stands today is, for $50 million of restructuring. But as you go into Q4, you're looking for additional actions to kind of prepare Remain-co for separation. Is that the way to think about it?","Michael W. Lamach","Yes, Jeff, that's exactly right.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And as we get into next year, is there a tail of restructuring activity associated with kind of new co, or you get that done in Q4? And is there any anticipated change to the way you restructure or the pace of restructuring or how you even incorporate restructuring in your guidance once we get into 2014?","Michael W. Lamach","Jeff, for now, think about that restructuring really about being sort of longer payback, sort of 1-year-type savings on that. So I don't think it's going to be sort of a headwind or a tailwind for us next year in the way you should think about 2014. It would certainly help the company sort of on a go-forward basis on that.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","But you'll get most of what you want to get done for '14 kind of booked in the fourth quarter, it sounds like?","Michael W. Lamach","Well, hard to know if we're able to do that. But certainly, we would like to be able to get on it as quickly as we can. And there's no doubt that some things that we do might take a little bit longer. But that's our focus at this point in time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mig Dobre with Robert W Baird.","Joseph M. Grabowski - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","This is Joe Grabowski sitting in for Mig. I wanted to ask about the Thermo King bookings. Last quarter, they were up pretty solidly mid-teens. Seems like this quarter, they've sort of normalized back to the mid-single digit range. Is that sort of the run rate we should expect going forward?","Michael W. Lamach","We've had -- North America I think, is probably more what you're referring to. We've had a forecast for trailer of about 34,000 units and [indiscernible] had a forecast of about 37,000 units. And we don't see the 37,000, and if we stretch it, we might see it some between 34,000 and 35,000 units. And so I think it'll normalize back to our projections, which is really based on a deep understanding of actual truck customers that we're talking to and what their buying expectations and habits and patterns actually are for our business. So we think we've got the forecast right here. And there was a lot of sort of early-season booking this year. Certainly, we're delivering against those, the shipments as we speak. But I don't -- we don't see it as a 37,000-unit market.","Steven R. Shawley","And remember, the first quarter was pretty flat for TK, certainly the TK North American trailers. So we're kind of catching up with that such as when we average out for the year, it's going to be about in the single digits. So...","Joseph M. Grabowski - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That makes sense. That's very helpful. So then, sort of the high single digit revenue gains you've been seeing there the last couple of quarters, though should also sort of normalize to more than mid-single digit range going forward?","Michael W. Lamach","The only anomaly might be, as you think about the new precedent product, which is sort of the car plant now to a bore reg product, it's a more expensive product. So even on a same-unit volume, we mix up a little higher on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Mike, can you talk about how you're thinking about price actions next year? I mean, it seems like we're in a pretty muted commodity environment and still demand environment. But what's your thought about kind of going out with price across the businesses?","Michael W. Lamach","Yes, Jeff. In a company that has as many products and channels as we have, that's a question that you can't answer in aggregate for the company; it really comes down to how we're thinking about different businesses, different competitive situations. And what I would tell you fundamentally here is that I agree with you, it'll be a muted environment. We do think that we'll see a positive GAAP again next year priced to inflation. And all the work that's going on relative to pricing for us now in 2014, has really been understanding relative competitive position and how to price the economic value between ourselves and competitors, as well as to a more surgical approach to stratifying channels to provide the right pricing to the right channel partners and business. So you'll probably see us have price next year again, even in a market where there might be muted inflation and not a lot of announced price agreements. We would still expect to have price -- some positive price gaps.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then looking at the orders maybe a little bit differently, in the inflector from plus 1 to plus 7, can you talk about if there's any -- just break out how you saw it differently from an inflection point between the regions?","Michael W. Lamach","Well, yes. I mean, certainly, Europe was stronger than what we expected really across-the-board. So that was probably a surprise, #1. And then I would say, just as the Unitary piece of this -- particularly, I would say bookings for Unitary in the last week or 2 of the quarter were a little stronger than we had thought. That would -- that's what leaves us with 30% you have to shift, because the cycle times there are very short in that business. So that was a bit of a surprise. And frankly, we were really not thinking about the applied market being that strong. So we had really nice strength in Asia, specifically China, and we had great strength in the Americas, in the Trane, Applied business. So when you part to the part, Europe is a geography, but I'd say Climate, HVAC, Asia and TK really is sort of the business drivers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So, Mike, what percentage of the cost base is now covered on value streams? Where are you on that? And is SIOP, as part of that, in your view pretty much fixed, in","good shape, given you're starting to see some of these more rapid orders changes?","Michael W. Lamach","Yes, Steve. Todd would say that, look, by the end of the year, we'll be at 40% next year. I think our plans right now will be closer to 60% at that point in time. SIOP is -- you're saying fixed. I mean, you're always trying to improve that. As you well know, Steve, in particular, just a bit of a background you had on lane [ph]. And so SIOP is a process, it's implemented. We've seen much better materials management. We've seen much better inventory control. We've seen much greater fill rates. We would expect continuous improvement in SIOP as it relates to what we're doing, and it's been part of the fundamental improvement in the company, along with all the other work going on. So SIOP has improved, working capital remains at really, I would say, top quartile levels around the diversified industrial peer group, and we have no reason to expect that, that won't continue to improve. Our expectations are to improve that. So there's this much more sophisticated work coming in, in 2014 and beyond, plan for every part, further work on stratifying our ABC materials analysis and different tools we're bringing into the organization as part of the standard operating system for the company. But we're executing a lot of that today. So...","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And on Asia, you mentioned improving orders, but I know revenues were up just 2% x FX for the quarter. I mean, can you give us a little better sense of what the Asia mix is? Or where you're having kind of headwinds or just tailwinds in your business?","Michael W. Lamach","Oh, HVAC was really the very positive surprise on sort of what we've seen there, specifically in China relative to kind of where we were. So that's been a good story for us. And Air, it picked up in Q3. We think it'll pick up again in Q4, albeit those are typically very large, complex systems that are being pushed out 9 months, even a year for customer delivery in some of the locations. So we saw it across the board. I would say the Climate businesses have just generally been a bit stronger for us than industrial, which is still, we think, capacity-constrained and policy-constrained in China to a certain extent. So we see a recovery there, but it's somewhat muted relative to our HVAC performance, where we're having great success in things like health care and 4- and 5-star hotels. So the mix has moved away in HVAC from maybe industrial HVAC applications or from pharma or tech companies into hospitals and leisure. And in the Air side, it's still constrained a bit through some of the second-tier providers that we sell to, that would sell off to shipping and steel as an example.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones. First of all to say -- the details on Slide 9, you said HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits, but you said shipments increased by high single digits? So what was the difference between the units and revenues? Why would that be lower?","Michael W. Lamach","Looking at Slide 9, Steve, to see what's -- your talking residential?","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, because you basically said revenues were up mid-singles, but units are up high singles. So I'm just curious as to -- it doesn't seem like mix would be that massive or price. Or just curious as to what the difference is there.","Michael W. Lamach","Mix and price, Steve, I guess I'd have to bridge what's left over exactly how much, but mix and price would be substantial in terms of the amount of '13 or '14 year business we're doing now versus what we used to do. So price has been a contributor for us as well. Price has been still very positive. So between the 2, I think that...","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Well, I mean, units are higher than revenues. So if the mix was positive, wouldn't that be the opposite?","Michael W. Lamach","Well, the mix was lower SEER.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Oh, I got you. I got you.","Michael W. Lamach","[indiscernible] Right.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Why was it lower SEER?","Michael W. Lamach","Well, that's, again, the market moving there. And as you know, from the last couple of years, we've been trying to put product in that range. And whether it's Ameristar or Trane at new price points, it's been a focus for us to compete across the whole product -- over the whole 13 through 17-plus market. And we're selling more '13, '14 series mix, and that's -- mix is down for us in terms of price. And, of course, units are up.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And on the commercial front, clearly, a pretty strong number, and it looks like you're at least outperforming your peers like Carrier, who have called out things that are a little more negative. Is that just kind of regional differences? Or are you seeing traction on the new stuff that you introduced, the big booth at AHR last year? Is it kind of regional differences? Or maybe, do you really think you are kind of on the cusp of going on a nice run of taking share here?","Michael W. Lamach","Well, it's across the board. I mean, it's every single region of the world. Unitary is up nicely for us, and I could think about AP, EMEA and Unitary Americas, all had significant new product launches in the year that you saw at the HR show. So part of it certainly, I think, would be attributable to that. We've had really good success with the Unitary product within the marketplace.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Mike, just on this -- so on this kind of suprising pickup in Applied, now that you've seen it -- I mean, have you been able to kind of decipher a little bit more what drove it and how sustainable you feel it is? Sometimes things can be a little bumpy at this part of the cycle. I mean, does it feel like there's potential follow-on to that?","Michael W. Lamach","Shannon, I'd say I consider to think about it as being bumpy. The data we're looking at still is moving dramatically. And the Dodge data, 2Q to 3Q, particularly institutional, has moved down. So I mean, to me, it feels a bit lumpy. Again, it's been really great for us to see, particularly in applied, the large chiller business into the [indiscernible] business to look at our shares there, really again kind of approaching historic highs for the company. That's all well and good, but it's not really driven by Put in Place or starts getting us excited.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And in terms of those share improvements, I mean, you guys are pretty active in new products. Have you seen any counter from some -- any of your competitors in terms of trying to launch against you with some new products of their own?","Michael W. Lamach","Absolutely. I mean, it's a competitive business. We've got great, strong competitors. Nobody is sitting back on their heels. We're just working a long-term multi-generation product plan, thinking 3 to 5 years out. There's new technology that we're incorporating in new product development, so it's -- often times, if you think about new technology, it needs to be proven before you put it in new product development. So we're having, I think, some great success, where NTI work is now proving out to the point where it's being introduced into new product development. And that's created, I think, an advantage in reliability and in efficiency, which, I think, a great place is to compete. So that's really what's been happening. I could extend that to Thermo King, and I can certainly extend that to -- really, all of our businesses, I think, are following the same formula.","Operator","And I'm showing no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to Janet Pfeffer for closing remarks.","Janet Pfeffer","Thank you, and thank you, everyone. We look forward to seeing many of you on November 12 in New York City.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference call is being recorded.","I would like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference Janet Pfeffer, Vice President, Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Janet Pfeffer","Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2014 conference call. We released earnings at 7 this morning and the release is posted on our website. We\u2019ll be broadcasting, in addition to this phone call through our website of ingersollrand.com, where you will find the slide presentation that we will be using. This call will be recorded and archived on our website.","If you\u2019d please go to slide 2.

This morning I\u2019ll spend a few minutes for capping our full year 2014 and our progress on the transformation that we\u2019ve been working on with the company for the past few years. Then Sue will take you through the fourth quarter results and I\u2019ll then provide outlook for 2015 before we open it up to your questions.","So starting with full year 2014. The past year demonstrated continued progress in the implementation of our multiyear strategy for growth, operational excellence and shareholder value. We invested in our core businesses, matured in key strategic capabilities and delivered excellent financial results. All in all navigating shifts and changes in global markets.","For the year our revenues were up 4%, markets were uneven around the globe. Our growth in Europe, Middle East and Africa was double digits where I believe we outpaced the market in most or all of our businesses. Growth in North America was mid single digits, while revenues in Latin America and Asia were lower for the full year due to market and currency headwinds.","Adjusted earnings per share were $3.33 a year-over-year increase of 25%. Sue will take you through the bridge in a few minutes, so I\u2019ll leave that for Sue on the quarter. There will be some puts and takes but the short answer is that volume and operational leverage with guidance particularly in the Climate segment.","We grew adjusted operating margins 140 basis points in 2014. Our Lean focus again showed significant results in the implemented value streams and we continue to invest in the future of the business by funding significant new product development, investing in IT platform and building our channel services footprint and product management capabilities. We generated $810 million of cash flow, our capital allocation strategy remains focused on maximizing shareholder value and it\u2019s consistent with our overall financial strategy.","We continue to increase our dividend with a 19% increase in 2014. We repurchased 22 million shares for $1.4 billion in 2014 funded by the remaining Allegion dividends and from free cash flow. We announced two value enhancing acquisitions during 2014, the purchase of the Cameron Centrifugal Compression division which closed at the beginning of this month and is now part of our compressor business unit and FRIGOBLOCK which we expect to close in the first half of 2015 which will become part of our Thermo King Transport refrigeration business unit.","Our performance in 2014 where we outperformed the three year path laid out in late 2013 confirms our conviction to our strategy and positions us well going into a challenging global economic backdrop for 2015.","Let\u2019s go to Slide 4. We\u2019ve delivered steady improvements in operating margins over the past three years. Climate margins are up 340 basis points over that period. Overall, our operating margins were up 230 basis points over the last three years despite a tough year in industrial for 2014. As I\u2019ll review when I go through 2105 guidance we expect industrial to recover and a 40% organic operating leverage in 2015.","Please go to Slide 5. This chart locks to the change in operating margin from 2013 at 8.9% to the 2014 which was 10.9% shown on a reported basis, but we strike out restructuring Uni-box. Overall margins expanded 200 basis points on a reported basis and a 140 basis points on an adjusted basis. The margin expansion was delivered from a combination of organic growth driven by our strategies to invest in new product and service offerings, maintaining a positive gap between pricing and interim inflation to pipes analytics and value pricing and productivity from strategic sourcing, implementing our Lean operating system and overhead cost just of Lean altogether outpacing other inflation.","We continue to invest in new products, IT infrastructure and systems and service and sales footprint underpin the future growth of the business. 2014\u2019s margins performance exceeded our annual goal delivering 85 to 100 basis points of margin improvements. I\u2019ve always said that most improvements are not typically linear, but being ahead of goal going into 2015 is a great place to be, given the short movements that the world is seeing in exchange rates and oils and metals markets and the economic ripples that that will create.","So, now Sue will walk you through the fourth quarter and I\u2019ll come back and take you through 2015\u2019s outlook.","Sue Carter","Thank you, Mike. Let\u2019s slide go into Slide 6 please. At the high level our bookings for the quarter were up 5%, revenues were also up 5%. Foreign exchange was 2 percentage points of headwind to both to excluding foreign exchange both orders and revenues were up 7%. Our operating margins without restructuring were up 230 basis points and operating leverage in the quarter was excellent at 61%.","Adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $0.82 up 34% versus last year and consistent with Mike\u2019s commentary for the full year, the fourth quarter was a very strong quarter particularly in terms of margin expansion and earnings performance.","Let me start by taking you through a bridge to our guidance for the quarter. Let\u2019s go to Slide 7. As you recall we updated our guidance on October 24 to reflect the incremental interest expense from the bond issuance and early retirement of our 2015 notes. So, our starting point on a reported basis is a range of $0.63 to $0.67 or midpoint of $0.65. Okay, get all the way to an adjusted basis since that seems to be where most of you are tracking.","Volume and operational performance particularly in Climate delivered a $0.11 incremental to guidance. Our financial statements continued to reflect the official rate in Venezuela and therefore we did not book the recent charge which was included in our guidance. Movements in currencies including the euro, Asian and Latin American currencies resulted in a $0.04 negative versus guidance and $0.04 of other positive items mainly in other income that brings us to $0.79 of reported earnings per share. There were $0.03 of add back in the quarter to bring you to the $0.82 on an adjusted basis.","So, with that let\u2019s go to Slide 8 please. Orders for the fourth quarter of 2014 were up 5% on a reported basis and up 7% excluding currency. Climate orders were up 6% and up 8% excluding currency. Global commercial HVAC bookings were up mid single digits, transport orders were up high single digits led by North American trailer.","Orders in the industrial segment were up 3% on a reported basis and up 6% excluding currency. Given that more of industrials revenues come from outside of the U.S. its foreign currency impact is larger than in Climate. We saw order growth in all regions and industrial products and a small decline Club Car.","Please go to Slide 9. Just look at the revenue trends by segment and regions. The top half of the chart shows revenue change for each segment. For the total company fourth quarter revenues were up 5% versus last year on a reported basis and up 7% excluding currency. Climate revenues increased 5% on a reported basis and 7% excluding foreign exchange. Commercial HVAC and transport revenues were each up mid single digits. Residential HVAC revenues were up high single digits. Industrial revenues were up 3% on a reported basis and up 6% excluding currency and I\u2019ll give more color on each segment in the next few slides.","The bottom chart shows revenue change on a geographic basis with and without currency. Excluding currency revenues were up 6% in America. Up 22% in Europe, Middle East and Africa led by strong HVAC performance and Asia was down 3%.","Please go to Slide 10. This chart shows the change in operating margin from fourth quarter 2013 of 7% to fourth quarter 2014 which was 10.7% consistent with prior quarter, this is shown on a reported basis where we spiked out the restructure to give you adjusted margins as well.","Volume mix and foreign exchange collectively were 70 basis points positive versus prior year, pricing was slightly less than direct material inflation impacted by negative price in Asia mainly China. Productivity versus other inflation was positive 210 basis points driven by strong productivity in the quarter. Year-over-year investments and other items were lowered by 100 basis points and in the box you can see that this was comprised of 40 basis points from investments and 140 basis points from lower restructuring cost. In the gray box at the top of the page, overall leverage on an adjusted basis was excellent at 61%.","Please go to Slide 11. The Climate segment includes Train, commercial and residential HVAC and Thermo King Transport refrigeration. Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $2.4 billion that is up 5% versus last year on a reported basis and also up 7% excluding currency. Global commercial HVAC orders were up mid single digit. Orders were up in all geographic regions. Trains, commercial HVAC fourth quarter revenues were up mid single digits. Commercial HVAC equipment revenues were up low single digits while HVAC cards, services and solutions revenue were up high single digit versus prior year.","Thermo King orders were up high single digits versus 2013's fourth quarter with a significant increase in North American trailer orders. Thermo King revenues were up mid single digit with truck trailer revenue down as increases in North America were more than offset by lower revenues in foreign exchange overseas.","Residential HVAC revenues were up high single digit versus last year. The adjusted operating margins for Climate was 12.2% in the quarter, 210 basis points higher than fourth quarter 2013 due to volume and productivity partially offset by inflation. Climates operating leverage was over 50% in the quarter.","Please go to Slide 12. Fourth quarter's revenues for the industrial segment were $795 million up 3% on a reported basis and up 6% excluding currency. Air systems and services, power tools, fluid management and materials management revenues and orders were up low single digits versus last year. Revenues in the Americas were up mid single digit while revenues in Europe and Asia were down low-single digits including impacts of currency.","Club Car revenues in the quarter were up mid single digits and orders were down low single digits versus prior year.","Industrial's adjusted operating margin of 15.8% was slightly down compared with last year, as volume and productivity was offset by the impact inflation, investments and currency.","Please go to Slide 13. For the full year, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 3.1%, the increase versus prior year was primarily inventory. This includes some incremental inventory related to the regional standard change in residential HVAC, additionally we have been intentionally increasing stocked inventory levels of key assemblies in order to ensure availability of supply. We had good collections in the quarter with our day sales outstanding and days payable outstanding both improving over the prior year. Going forward, we expect our working capital to be in the 3% to 4% range.","Please go to Slide 14, cash flow was $810 million in 2014. Cash conversion was 87% for the year below our long term target of 100% mainly by our strategy for working capital as I addressed on the last slide.","As you will see when we look at 2015, we expect to be back at that 100% target this year. Our balance sheet remains very strong. We have no debt maturities this year given the financing we did in October and the early retirement of 2015 note. Our cash balance was unusually high at the end of December as we have the cash on hand to fund the Cameron acquisition on January 2nd of 2015. We expect free cash flow in 2015 to be in the range of $950 million to $1 billion.","And with that I am going to turn it back to Mike to take you through 2015 guidance.","Mike Lamach","Great, thanks Sue. And please go to Slide 15. It\u2019s certainly an interesting time to try to predict exactly what will happen over the next 11 months in order to give you guidance. In the past few months the world has experienced discount in oil markets and foreign exchange rates. So I will give you the best view of what we see in the market sitting here today and some more color on how it could be impacted from further improvements in foreign exchange.","Starting with North American non-residential, we anticipate the first positive year in institutional market since 2008. Albeit in a more moderate pace than the current batch forecast. We have started to see some positive signs in our recorded pipeline particularly in K-12 education. We continue to see growth in commercial and industrial based on this mid single digit growth for 2015 in North American commercial HVAC markets.","We expect Latin American, Asian, European, and Middle East HVAC equipment markets in the aggregate to the up lower mid single digits at constant currency but flat down after considering currency. We expect North American transport market to be up mid single digit in 2015 and European markets to be down including FX. We expect residential HVAC industry motor-bearing unit shipments for the year to be up low single digits in 2015, the revenue should be up mid single digits due to favorable mix.","We expect industrial markets to be up low to mid single digits and Gulf markets are expected to be up low single digits. Aggregating those market backdrops we expect our revenues for full year to be up 4% to 5% versus 2014.","Overall, foreign exchange will be a headwind for about 3 percentage points. We report the Cameron Centrifugal business for the entire year and that's going to add 3 points so for organic growth excluding FX front and back at 4% to 5% range. Translating that to our full year outlook by segment we expect climate revenues to be up 2% to 3% on a reported basis and 4% to 5% excluding currency.","The industrial segment revenues are forecasted between a range of up 13% to 14% on reported basis and 4% to 5% excluding Cameron and foreign exchange. As Sue noted industrial has a higher proportion of revenues outside of the U.S. as compared to Climate. So, industrial expense is more impacted from FX relative to Climate.","Operating margins, we expect Climate margins to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.5%. We expect industrial margins including Cameron operations and amortization, but excluding the impact of the inventory step up to be 14.5% to 15.5%. The inventory step up will be recorded in the first and second quarters and is about $12 million per quarter. Since its non cash, and isolated to those two quarters we felt it was more representative of ongoing earnings to spike out the step up and should note that we are in the final validation stages for the purchase accounting for Cameron, for the amortization and step up numbers might move around a little but this is our best estimate as of right now. If you peel out the Cameron impact the legacy industrial business is leveraging at about 40%.","Please go to Slide 16. Transitioning to earnings, the reported earnings for share range is estimated to be 360 to 375 per share. Excluding the Cameron inventory step up which is in the range of 366 to 381, an increase of 10% to 14% versus 2014. When you exclude the impact to bring in Cameron revenue and earnings and for the first time this year, the legacy company is leveraging at about 48%. Given the outperformance in 2014 with full year EPS growth of 25%, we are on path for articulated three year cagier growth target range of 15% to 20% even if they had wins from currency and uneven markets.","As a note for 2015, FX is a headwind of about 3% to revenue and $0.17 to earnings. This reflects full year tax rate forecast of 25% in an average diluted share count of 270 million shares.","To give you some more insight into the sensitivity to additional movement in currency, in 2014, about 63% of our revenues were denominated in dollars. Only 7% is in China and another remaining 30%. The Euro is about 10%, Asia outside of China and Latin America were 6% to 7% each and other currencies such as the Canadian dollar, the British pound make up the remainder. So our much of the focus has been on the movement and outlook for the euro currency movements in Asia and Americas have been significant for example between August and December, the Yen, dollar and Malaysian ringgit all moved down 10% to 15%. And since half of the revenues in Asia are outside of China this has an impact.","We built our guidance around the Euro at 116. to give you some simple math to gauge sensitivity of $0.01 move in the euro means about a penny in earnings. And if all currencies move 1% versus the dollar, although it's very unlikely they will all move the same magnitude that would be about $0.02 of earnings.","Now to focus on the first quarter guidance to the right hand column on this chart, first quarter 2015 revenues are forecast to up 4% to 5% on a reported basis and you can see the currency and acquisition impact on the slide. Reported first quarter earnings for share forecast to be $0.26 to $0.30, the inventory step up all hit in the first and second quarters and impact first quarter by $0.03. Adding this back to get to adjusted basis, the EPS range is $0.29 to $0.33. And it seemed this morning there are some questions about first quarter guidance so let me give you some more color now in order to address that.","At the midpoint first quarter is about 8% of the total year adjusted earnings and historically it would be closer to 9% or 10% but slightly less than normal. There are few things impacting the first quarter. First it's the portion of the full year Cameron\u2019s earnings are less in the first quarter due to the calendarization of their revenues. Second, the cost are higher in the first quarter than historical due to the timing of the cost incurred relative to our healthcare program and equity compensation trends. Specifically, this year in the U.S. for the first time our employees are all participating in health savings accounts with their health care program. So, employees are in credits their health care saving accounts they are doing certain activities related to wellness. Those fund at the beginning of the year but we will see the benefit to us in the year to lower healthcare cost as we go along. ","Third, to get more benefit later in the year from lower copper because of our layering strategy we added the year with copper lock at about 70% for the first half. So, copper movements won't have much impact in the first part of the year. And then finally foreign exchange of course is more negative versus prior year in the first quarter given the variance of rates from the year ago. So, we provided EPS bridges for both first quarter and full year in the appendix and that will help give you the walk from year to year.","For the full year 2015 we expect to generate free cash flow of $950 million to $1 billion which is at a long term target of 100% net income. We intend to increase the dividend as appropriate to be consistent with the pat ratio in the peer range. We expect FRIGOBLOCK to close in the first half of this year and we will utilize 100 million of Euros of cash to do that. We anticipate a minimum of 250 million of spending for share repurchase which will offset delusion from equity issuance and that will leave us about 350 million of cash that we see as a toggle between value, accretive acquisitions and share repurchase.","We have a pipeline of acquisition opportunities related to our core business and we weigh those risk adjusted opportunities against buyback in terms of returns and shareholder value.","So, in closing we are pleased to have delivered another solid year with 2014 margin improvement and earnings growth ahead of our targets, our strategies for growth and operational excellence have delivered a multiyear trend of excellent operating leverage, margin and earnings improvements.","Our focus is to continue to grow earning of cash flow through further implementation of those strategies. We have proactively worked to deliver productivity and make good investments for the future. Our new product line is the strongest as it has been in decades. If any of you read the AHR show this week, you saw clear evidence of that. We continue to invest in new product and service offerings, our IT infrastructure and systems and by further developing our people and our operating capabilities. We continue to execute a consistent value maximizing capital allocation program. So from the progress that we have made and the results we have delivered and believe that we are well positioned as we enter 2015 and for the future.","And with that Sue and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Hi good morning guys. Mike you talked a little bit about the differences between institutional and commercial and some of the momentum you are seeing in K-12, can you put that in terms of apply versus unitary for the year. I guess maybe starting off with what bookings were for each in the quarter and then how you are thinking about the difference between the two businesses?","Mike Lamach","Well, the unitary markets globally worldwide and in North America were very strong low double digit team type growth there. So we are seeing that in commercial industrial and obviously some of that happening in small institutional projects where unitary would be applied. You might see more unitary in sort of the lower schools, K-6 maybe some smaller middle schools, you\u2019ll kind of see in the bigger high schools perhaps more applied. So that was kind of the mix K-12 that happened. But, we have worked hard over the last five plus years that we got relative parity in margins between applied unitary and we got good utilization and capacity left for whatever that mix would swing. So, I think that from a company point of view we feel good about the contribution margin as applied more unitary and we feel good about the capacity upside that we have got in our facilities to build out, if we were potentially surprised by better markets we would have the ability to work against that, execute against that.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Do you think that unitary pace is applied in 2015?","Mike Lamach","Yes, I do. I actually do. I think that applied, you probably look at something more like a mid single digit growth rate. I do think that that will sustain itself over a multiyear period if you look at what's required from an institutional infrastructure perspective that would make sense that that would be the case. So, as you get through that route into multiyear view you may see an exchange where unitary comes back into more normalized low to mid single digit type growth pattern that it could sustain that way for a while.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Andrew Casey","Thanks. Good morning everyone. In the quarter it looks like productivity benefit really accelerated versus last quarter and it was against a little bit easier comp, but that doesn't buy itself explaining. Could you give a little bit more detail on what drove that and kind of what you expect going forward?","Sue Carter","So, Andy when you think about what happened in the fourth quarter overall, first of all we talked about that the revenues guide was up and the revenues that came through were good revenues that provided some additional leverage and when you look at the pieces of the business we gone from good productivity out of our cost base, we got some good productivity out of the direct material inflation and from some of our other components of cost whether it would be something like warranty or other item, so really when you take in you look at the quarter and all of the pieces everything was just better than the way that we had looked at it because people in our businesses did a great job of not only executing on the revenue side, but they also did a great job of executing on the cost side which like I said cross board and all of the different categories gave us additional productivity. So, there is no really one big thing that you can look at but -","Mike Lamach","Yes, Andy one thing that maybe to emphasize to this point is we would look normally at every quarter on a really detailed risk and opportunity assessment in the quarter and looked at that through the last minute of the quarter end. And it was a case and I wanted to hats off to the team, the whole team sort of business team and functional team because it was a function of executing all the opportunities and managing all the risks in a way where you get the best net out of that that's possible and it's just like that.","Andrew Casey","Okay. Thank you. And just quick follow up on that. So based on your description of a lot of things going right it seems like that should be sustainable at least for the short term as that accurate?","Mike Lamach","Andy I always say that you have only room for breakage? Okay, I mean that was a perfect quarter for us but compares with the you don\u2019t tell things aren\u2019t perfect so that you are allowing for breakage so we will continue to look at things on a risk adjusted basis and I would suggest that that\u2019s a pretty good leverage that we have in quarter and I dial you back on something looks a lot more like the gross margins of the business for us, okay because that over a very long period of time which is what we have done over five years and going multi years into the future if you are able to leverage that at your gross margins it\u2019s phenomenal, it means there\u2019s no fixed cost investments, very hard to sustain, means keep hard doing that but that would be a fantastic 10 year sort of view and that from the operating system that we are building as we have five good years of that we would like to have at least five more before we call that something sustainable.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley, your line is open.","Nigel Coe","Thanks. Good morning everyone. Maybe just obviously conversations on closing Cameron and maybe just if you can talk Mike about sensitivity of Cameron\u2019s to the oil price and how the operating fund for Cameron has changed if at all since you announced deal?","Mike Lamach","Sue will give first crack at that she has been really close, very, very close to that team effectively with sensitivity, oil and gas.","Sue Carter","Alright, so Nigel the way that I would start looking at that piece of the business as you divided really into sort of four almost equal categories or pieces of the business, so you got the engineered aero piece of the business which is largely the air separation and pieces you can't replant aero piece there was two pieces though again let\u2019s call each of the pieces 25% of the business for the sake of argument, there was two pieces of business that were really going flux with just the IGR industrial indices.","So, those are not going to be as exposed you got the process gas pieces of the business again another 25% of the business and that has some exposure that comes to the oil and gas side but then pieces of the business is going to look at a lot of things that are hydrocarbon. So, well you have an impact from the oil and gas pricing, you also have the piece that says that there was some power generation. So, conversion from vehicle to a lower natural gas price which is a good thing and something that around the globe that business has so products into which it\u2019s not necessarily seeing as much impact as well as petrochemicals which have been strong and so that\u2019s another 25% of the business and that of course the other side of the aftermarket.","So again, when you think about the business, the exposure directly to oil and gas is really in that one piece but it is not the entire piece of the business and it\u2019s not just a negative. And one of the things that you asked Nigel was impacts, since we actually signed up the transaction and so what we\u2019ll see is if you recall the commentary when we bought the business was that this is, the long lease bookings for the business so the things that you book in one year going to sell the next year.","We saw some lighter bookings in the back half of 2014 before we actually started operating the business. So, we will expect some of the lightness that we talk about is more in the back half. Mike talked about in his commentary that their first quarter revenues were like that\u2019s part of the normal cycle that isn\u2019t anything to do with the market or how we are seeing the business. So, not a lot of oil and gas exposure and truthfully let me expand that out just a little bit and talk about the total company because that maybe another question that you might have is for the total company. I would say you could ask to me the oil and gas piece maybe 2% of revenues something in that range.","So, I think we are on solid footing with the Cameron business, we\u2019re looking at the synergies we think we\u2019re going to continue to do a really good job of executing notes and the fourth piece of the business that I didn\u2019t mention was the aftermarket piece and the service piece which is our intention to grow.","Nigel Coe","Yes, thanks Sue that was really helpful knowing we definitely thinking -- from the lower price and then just the follow on, on the investment spending with the heard to the industrial margins in 2014 and I am wondering what is the investment outlook for 2015 overall things around, what sort of rate is that growing at and to what extent did investment spent get pulled forward into 2014?","Sue Carter","So again, Nigel when I think about the investments spending and I think about 2015 so our incremental spending is going to be up on a year-over-year basis. It goes from something like $64 million up to sort of $82 million number with the investments for 2015 and so here is how I would look at those actual investment is when we start to look at them and we look at where we are investing money. So about 50% of the investment dollars in 2015 are going to be in product and product related type of area. So, I mean that one include any go to market type of pieces out of the investment spend and then you are going to have the other pieces which are going to be the business operating system so call at another 25% and then the IT system and so when you think about sort of that break down and think about it in terms of overall strategy we want to continue to grow the investments in our product and how we go to market with the product. We certainly want to continue to invest in the business operating system per the strategy and those things are really paying off for us. So, we think that those numbers in 2015 are good investments and something that is really going to be helpful for us.","Mike Lamach","Nigel, let me add, the remaining piece was with the IT systems and infrastructure piece and we did some of the infrastructure pieces typically that relates to security and some \u2013 and making sure that we were doing that and largely from headquarter basis, it's the best way to spend that as opposed to every business unit making a different decision about that. So that's the source of the other piece of investment. We probably flattened out here from an IT perspective through about 2018 and then we begin to sort of roll up lot of the depreciation in 2019. So that piece of it as you mentioned I think flattens out here in 2015. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Joe Ritchie","Great, thank you and good morning everyone. My first question is on price cost. Like we did get the HR show earlier this week and it seems like you are getting really good pricing on your commercial HVAC products with all the new products that you actually \u2013 that you can clearly there is a cost tailwind as well this year. And I am just trying to understand what\u2019s embedded in your guidance in terms of the price cost tailwind that you should see in 2015?","Sue Carter","Joe, let me try that one on and the Mike can add some color if he chooses at the end. So the way that I would think about our pricing versus the direct material inflation which is how we talk about it is, we look to have a positive spread in sort of 20 to 30 basis point revenue. So, it looks a lot like 2014. So, we built that capability and in the pricing with our ability to anticipate and react. So, we are focused on maintaining that spread regardless of sort of what's happening on the commodity side. Now having said that, we are fully aware that copper has come down and in price. Now the impact to an Ingersoll Rand based on the way that we buy copper is really going to be more in the back half of the year. So, we go into the front half of the year being we bought 70% of the copper that we are going to buy. So, you are not going to have a direct impact in the earlier part of the year based on that commodity spend and then we also have exposure on the aluminum and the steel side which are more than the flattish. So overall, in 2015, again you have got the piece that you know with the benefit coming out of copper but we still think that in total direct material is going to have a slight headwind for us and we think we are going to have pricing that's 20 to 30 basis points above that direct material inflation overall.","Mike Lamach","Joe, it\u2019s important concept there because we look at scenarios that are kind of 40 basis points of deflation, 40 inflation I would lean more towards the deflationary story than inflationary story but again it was just really testing ourselves around the ability to wrap the spread. The only place where it's been difficult in the quarter for us was really China where you have got just the lot of many local competitors, pricing lower on anticipated cost so that was the one place where we didn\u2019t catch up with ourselves, but it actually was quite close. It wasn\u2019t like we really missed it out there. So, I think that 20, 30 basis points positive spread pick your number on inflation and that's what we hope to do during the year.","Joe Ritchie","That\u2019s really helpful color guys and I guess maybe my one follow up question here is really on the applied market Mike mentioned earlier that your expectation is below what dodges for 2015 and when I take a look at your order trends for this quarter it looks like you declined. So, I am just curious like what are you seeing in that market today, what gives you the confident that we will get some growth as we head into 2015, it does look like municipal standing has gotten better, I am just curious what you are thinking?","Mike Lamach","Yes, actually total [indiscernible] actually up in bookings little bit in the quarter looks embedded but they were up and then as we are talking to our people around the globe and we have the ability of course to see little bit further out with pipeline that we will look at in our sales pipeline and that's more positive reflecting some of the K-12 activities that I mentioned, which I think will translate into bookings in the year. Being that K-12 schools generally are a little bit smaller and typically had a lot of activities between April and September possibility there that we will see some of that come through toward the middle or early fall in the year and that would be a good indication for us that we are seeing momentum there.","Our view about being a little bit lighter than dodge has better view now for the long time but particularly in the last year around how institutional cover would really take shape and it has a lot to do with industry capacity of trades people about how funding flows through municipalities and states and just the ability to construct as much infrastructure frankly it's not going to snap back at that double digit rate. I believe that you will see more sustained mid single digit curve going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Julian Mitchell","Hi thank you. Just the question on the industrial guidance because your sales and margins have been flat there for about four years, but your guidance today for 2015 you have got a decent organic growth rate of 4 to 5 dialed in and I also think you are looking at what close to 40% incremental margins on the underlying business ex Cameron so maybe talk a bit about the conference on the organic growth step up. I saw you had a one good quarter of orders and also why the incremental underlying suddenly take off?","Sue Carter","So Julian, when we think about industrial and what's happening in those markets, you are right, as we look at 2015 we have got the revenue growth on the legacy business we are looking at that 40% leverage in 2015. We think that the business has got good line of sight to the market, to the orders that they are expecting. They all been owning their strategies and again if you think about what we were doing with reorganization of the business and going to a business unit structure and focusing on growth that gives us a lot of confidence that we have got people that are looking at right things in terms of the products and the revenue growth they have also been looking in prioritizing some really good payback investments that support the growth those include product development, service infrastructure investments for the business and other channel investments and so when you look at 2015 there are larger percentage of the investment spends and they are of our revenue profile but we think that those are, we think that those are the right things for those businesses to be doing. And so what we think is as you put all of those pieces together with the team is focused on the businesses and growth focused on their different markets and the focus on investments to really grow those businesses that\u2019s what gives us confidence that the business will have that 2015 that we are projecting.","Mike Lamach","Julian, mechanically to Club Car last year, last 10 days on a storm about 10 days, first on these issues that we are not going fax really write after that so you don\u2019t have that repeating. So just by having a more normal low single digit Club Car business leveraging at really good margins which it normally would do plus not having to repeat last year ice storm again happened in February. So let\u2019s hope that we don\u2019t get one down there again that out of snap back even mechanically much better just to do that alone.","Julian Mitchell","Thanks and then my follow up would just be on the Climate adjusted operating margin, it looks like you are hitting the margin target that one year early, you hit the guidance. So looking beyond that given your running at such a good rate where are you targeting sort of medium term, the margins and Climate can get to assuming no major gyration in organic sales growth outlook?","Mike Lamach","Yes, Julian if you recall, our structural view was something in the 14% to 16% range for the Climate so I think clearly, we think there is structural opportunity up in that area so let\u2019s work on that probably next. We are always away from that at this point in time and I think that they are going to continue to see that but again it takes investments, we\u2019re investing heavily into product, channel, service footprint all around a long term view that that\u2019s structural in the business.","We can update that in May talk about it that point in time but we are really pleased to be where we\u2019re at this point, it\u2019s great execution by the entire global team both residential and commercial and the service business. So, all [indiscernible] there really.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Stephen Volkmann","Thank you very much. Good morning.","Mike Lamach","Good morning.","Stephen Volkmann","I\u2019m wondering about your comments about building a little bit of inventory in 2015 and I guess I\u2019m just curious your thinking behind that what areas were that be and what gives you confidence of that\u2019s sort of helpful strategy?","Mike Lamach","We saw some of the higher margin businesses last year was order volatility that you can literally be 200% sort of a historical rates and so market volatility that we are seeing in the world is translating the order volatility on stock and semi assembled products and we want to make sure is that with that stuff is very quick turn. Somewhat discretionary in terms if you got the product you are going to sell it, we don\u2019t want to be stingy on that we want to make sure we protected against the possibility that sort of volatility and so widening out the corn barns, widening of the stock rates and we think about the certain product in the company that we say if the zero stock of product literally 100.0x you want product you get the product if want it and we really like that when those products, the contribution is accretive of the overall margins of the company.","So, margins accreted to the company\u2019s overall margin profile, stock, semi stock, we want to have product when you want to buy it and there is no point with cost to capital being what it is, you feel stingy about that. So it\u2019s just straight economics.","Stephen Volkmann","Okay, thanks. And then maybe a quick follow up are there any share changes in any of your product lines that you like to color for us and I guess Thermo King continues to look pretty good and sort of in that vein, are you worried at all about competition in the compressor business with your competitor having kind of euro cost base?","Mike Lamach","Yes, if you listen to me for a long enough I don't talk about sort of market share one way or the other much because I think that over the long run if you are growing margins and your growth rate is higher than your peer set, you must be doing good job. Our approach is to be top quartile every single year around incremental margins and organic growth. That\u2019s what we have done over the last five years on margin and last couple of three years on our organic growth profile company. So that's our formula and I can tell you that we feel like the investment and the product and service it's working and I feel like even more that toward the compressed air side of our business, the tool side of our business and fluid side of our business our pro rata as Sue mentioned that is good, good for us as well.","We see good growth opportunities. We see some pockets of growth and some niche opportunities for the product that we have assessed. We have done a lot of strategic analytic behind the scenes to support that. So we feel good about that. We are going to poke in those areas. So compressed air, tools, fluids, all big ideas that we have got to kind of throw that disproportional. The product growth team around the company, you heard me talk about that, we have doubled those in 2015, we have got outsized growth and share and margin performance in those last year for the six that we had and feel like we have got the capacity to take on and do six more for 12 in total. I am excited about that going into 2015 eventually really having that match the value stream of the company. In fact all of those product growth teams are actually value streams in the company anyway. So that was pre requisition to selecting those so this is over the next five years looking out I think really good model to draw the company and focus our strategy.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Steve Tusa","Good morning. I have one question in two parts. On the commodities side, first of all what you are assuming on price, was price realization kind of the majority of that 20 basis points this year. Is that the same thing you are assuming on price and then assuming all other commodities like steel and aluminum are wash and you just marked copper to where it is today, you said plus, minus 40 basis points I am not sure what you were saying but we know it's not going to be a drag so what would copper be?","Mike Lamach","My comment on the 40 basis points was rather than trying to be self precise in our ability to predict flux rates to commodities we run cases toward how quickly can we respond or react business in different inflation or deflation environments and could we sustain 20, 30 basis points of improvement. A big part of that though is not just relationship between the cost of commodity and pricing of the current product. Its making sure that there is a an economic value estimation of new product that better value prices what's it's replacing and where there is an opportunity to grow margins on the top line relative to that economic value created, that's the big idea obviously that we are doing fairly well at this well. So the introduction of new products for us is enormous opportunity to raise the margin profile of the company even if we were to hold commodity and pricing flat on the legacy product which is not our goal of course, it's price there too. But, not all that out that's how we come back to 20, 30 basis points positive but on multiple scenario.","Steve Tusa","So basically, you are saying is that you are going to use some of that commodity tailwind to drive to kind of get these new products out there?","Mike Lamach","No, different thing. The commodity tailwind largely it's going to be reflective on competitive pricing at some point in time. And so that\u2019s going to take its own I think competitive dynamics into consideration. New products that we are launching and when you look at the as an example the energy efficiency or the reliability of the product or the total cost of ownership or other service ability factors that can translate into a value into the customer that's not something that you see a cost for, you see a margin pricing opportunity. That's the kind of thing that we actually want to make sure that we are doing good job understanding that as we launch the product. So there are two different thoughts that both show up in the pricing column.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Raso with Evercore ISI, your line is open.","Mike Lamach","I just want to make sure that I want to give Steven a crack to make sure that we got is questions so if you could just make sure Steve if you could tell us we got it, I will give you one more crack out if we didn\u2019t if not we will go on.","Operator","Steve if you can press star then one on your touch tone telephone. Alright. And our next question comes from the line of David Raso with Evercore ISI, your line is open.","David Raso","Hi good morning. My question is on Thermo King for 2015. You mentioned mid single digit growth in North America is a target. Is there a notable slow down that you are looking for in the out quarters I am just trying to understand the initiative seems to be far stronger than that so I am just trying to understand how to read that guidance?","Mike Lamach","We are coming off a peak Dave, and I think that as we look at even some of the changes that have made in terms of driver stops and the ability to create additional driver capacity through decent number of inventory stops helps create and unlock a little bit of capacity to our customers. With that being said you are coming really off the peak and so again lapping the new product lapping the old product is not that big sort of revenue price differential that we are going to get lapping out this year to last year we will get something but not much. But early in the year and again this is an early read on the full year, you tend to lock in orders really early lock in customer intend and there is a lot of sensitivity to market and capacity for these customers so throughout the years those intangible rates may change. So that in particular David is a good reason for us to update the guidance in April and July because that number can move around. But right now that really is our best guide. ","David Raso","But just unclear, is your current backlog or order trends up that modestly?","Mike Lamach","Backlog is up a little higher than that. The order trends are okay year at the slow. So it's a forecast that we have got.","David Raso","Okay, just the clarification when we spoke to 40% leverage on organic that was pre investment just on clear, is that correct, pre investments?","Mike Lamach","40% organic on industrial.","David Raso","I think that was the total company comments, making sure I understand their organic leverage comment.","Janet Pfeffer","David this is Janet, it's just basically taking Cameron out of, kind of legacy parts of Ingersoll Rand.","David Raso","But it includes the incremental investment for this year.","Janet Pfeffer","What?","David Raso","But it includes the incremental investment figure for this year.","Janet Pfeffer","Yes. Yes.","David Raso","It does. Okay. Thank you very much.","Mike Lamach","You know actually this morning you are correct I mean you are bringing all of Cameron in this year at the beginning of the year so the math is little bit different. The true incremental of the company is closer to 40 and then Cameron is a start to that okay in the one year.","David Raso","Well I guess I will have it then. The currency drag what are you assuming on detrimental to be fair if you are looking for the whole company to have about 145 million of EBIT growth, if you put 40% on organic I\u2019m already up at 230 million so how much is the currency drag? I mean I run the numbers on how you imply $0.17 and I looked it but the drag is only $60 million?","Janet Pfeffer","David, this is Janet. I think you are misunderstanding how we use, legacy is the right word, it's the legacy company. So that\u2019s -","David Raso","So it must be ex-investment then, is that what you are saying?","Janet Pfeffer","No, it's all in.","David Raso","Okay, we will do the math offline I\u2019m just saying, you have got 230 million of EBIT growth just from organic growth out of 40% incremental and the EPS comment and currency would suggest currency drag again the currency detrimental must be rather significant.","Janet Pfeffer","David why don't you give Joe a call and locate it.","David Raso","Exactly. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you. Good morning. Just two quick ones. Just back to Cameron, it looks like your guide would imply Cameron revenues something like 360 million for 2015 kind of 12% off to your industrial base so that's down 10% or so from what the 2013 revenues were described as. I don't know if that was just some kind of round numbers in the mix there but are you actually looking for the business to be down that much and maybe just I mean your industrial orders actually look pretty good right up three in Q3 and up six in Q4. What is that about their business that their orders would have been soft in the second half?","Mike Lamach","Jeff, when we looked about evaluating the business as we acquired it we had given at 10%, 15% year cut from where it was just based on what we knew that I am glad we did based on what we are seeing. So, your math isn\u2019t too far off. We are somewhere between 350 and 360 and probably how we see that.","Sue Carter","Yes, and I think Jeff, when again as Mike said your math is right and when you think about the business being down and we went through all of the different pieces one of the areas where my assessment is that they meet on the booking side in the back half of last year was on the normal booking bill that goes on in the business. Now what causes that I don't know because we weren\u2019t in control but that's something that our team and the Cameron team now part of Ingersoll Rand need to look at for 2015 and really focus on getting that book and bill back in to it.","I think the issue is it's not a fundamental issue with the business. It's getting into our operating system and our management team and focusing on the business and just operating.","Mike Lamach","Yes, I think the good news Jeff is that we have been really able to kind of go back and look at the EBITDA and EBIT numbers and confirm that we have got line of sight to how to do it based on business case we put together which to your point already was year cut 10%, 15%, as we did the valuation for it.","Jeff Sprague","I am just wondering on investment spending and coming around to that the comment that it levels out was that just the ITP, I think it was \u2013 can you just give us a view holistically on investment spent when it might kind of I don't know normalize the sales growth or something that is not a meaningful P&L headwind?","Mike Lamach","I will correct on the IT span Jeff, that\u2019s the only one that flattens out. And relative to the business investments it really depends on the pipeline of ideas and there is an innovation review that we are conducting all the time. There are multi generation road maps that we are looking at for the product and we think we have got a pretty good equation here. And again if we could continue to get the same incremental margin in growth in the business we would have no reason to tell you that we are going to ever change the investment profile what we are doing.","Now having said that we don't know beyond about 18 months because it really does depend on what that multi generation product plan might look like or what acquisition like in terms of footprint that we are bringing on board to serve channel footprint which is another big part of the investment. So, we are going to give it a year time but what you will see, kind of hear is that we are investing in growth of the company and in the FX performance of the company at about the same rate albeit larger absolute dollar year to year to year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with Bernstein, your line is open.","Steven Winoker ","Thanks. Good morning. You spent $200 million for shares, $3 million to $4 million in the fourth quarter but you are holing share count flat I guess at 270 million through 2015, maybe just and what generating about $1 billion you mentioned free cash flow. Just give us sense for why you\u2019re guiding in that way for the rest of the year and what are you thinking about capital deployment more broadly then?","Sue Carter","Steve, I think the way that that we thought about it and just modeled it for you was if you take that $950 million to a $1 billion maybe a third of it goes to our dividend. We said that we would follow our long term guidance which is to add a minimum key the delusion from occurring from option exercises and from programs that things are maturing and so we gave it to you in those two pieces and then send the remaining say third of the cash flow that we would toggle between M&A and share repurchases and it\u2019s we just broke it up that way so that you would say okay here is the minimum that they\u2019re going to do and then the piece if we have good M&A candidates that follow along with our strategy for that we would do it and if not we would look to return the cash for shareholders.","Mike Lamach","Steve, I think your question about share count, I will bring in the expert too if I get off track we will be issuing shares in the first part of the year at the programs and buying back shares in last part of the year so you are going to see delusion in the first couple of quarters and then you are going to see us coming back to neutral on the back half of the year just the way that it averages share count for the full year. So, average share count it just not beginning, I\u2019m sorry beginning and ending but it certainly yes, extremes of issuing in the first quarter and doing a lot of buybacks towards the fourth quarter.","Steven Winoker ","Okay and then Mike you talked about risks and opportunities R&Os before in the fourth quarter and how I think you used the words perfect that was for their performance, maybe just give us a bigger idea of how they Rs versus Os, look like they\u2019re balancing out and what you have to believe when you think when you most excited about that list and what you are maybe most concerned about as you think about 2015 results?","Mike Lamach","Steve, our philosophy in giving guidance has always sort of net R&O that we see for guidance and for quarter. One of the things that you don\u2019t see in our numbers now as we haven\u2019t put anything in for Venezuela, it\u2019s just noisy for us to forecast that didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going happen at some point probably will happen and we can just update you when something like that actually happens. You also noticed that we didn\u2019t spend much really in restructuring last year rather than putting noise around that if we see something that we need to be doing, we are going to do that and update you on that but probably can manage that within the base that we have got.","The rest of the items that show up in here are typically commercial puts and takes when something lose something, it\u2019s all based on pipelines that have typically four levels of commitment everything from we\u2019ve pretty much got at the back to pretty much of the competition got at the back, a case when you get a swinger, [indiscernible] lose one that we were we should have got, as we net those things out, the operational performance of the company is becoming much more predictable in terms of how executing against that and again this is big kudos for the bench strength around the company operationally forgetting the time, quarter-over-quarter, quarter for long time now and managing through that because they\u2019ve their own unique set of R&Os between suppliers that are having floods and fires and suppliers that we are switching out changing, line moves, plant moves and running the day to day so that\u2019s the kind of thing to look at on at least monthly basis.","Operator","And now I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.","A - Janet Pfeffer","Thank you. Thank you very much and everybody have a good day. Joe and I will be around for questions.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference Joe Fimbianti, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.","Joe Fimbianti","Thank you Danielle, good morning, welcome to Ingersoll Rand's first quarter 2015 conference call. We released earnings at 7:00 AM this morning, and the release was posted on our website. We'll be broadcasting in addition to this phone call through our website at ingersollrand.com, where you will find the slide presentation that we'll be using this morning for the call and this call will also be recorded and archived on our website.","If you would, please go to slide 2, which is our safe harbor statement. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities laws. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to vary materially from our anticipated results. This release also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables to our news release.","With me this morning on the call are Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO and Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO. So if you will please turn to slide number 3, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike. Mike?","Mike Lamach","Great, thank you, Joe, good morning and thanks for joining us. In the first quarter, our adjusted earnings per share was $0.38, an increase of 31% versus last year's quarter. We closed two acquisitions in the quarter, the acquisition of Cameron\u2019s Centrifugal Compression division closed on January 1, so results were included for the entire quarter. We also closed the acquisition of FRIGOBLOCK in early March, so that has a very minimal impact to quarter given that less than one month of results were reported. Both integrations are going very well, Cameron compressor achieved our forecast for bookings, revenue and operating income. We are seeing some early traction on cross-selling and synergies and we expect continued progress for the balance of 2015.","Currency had a significant impact throughout the results, so in our comments today, we will mainly focus on organic growth, which excludes currency and acquisitions, but you can get a better view of end market trends. In the first quarter, we saw solid organic revenue growth of 8%, let by strength in the US, and Europe, particularly in the Climate Segment. Order rates remain healthy in the first quarter at 5%, excluding currency and acquisitions. Adjusted operating margins increased 40 basis points and increased 100 basis points, excluding the impact of currency and bringing Cameron results into our financial statements for the first time.","Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.07 above our adjusted EPS guidance, mid-point of $0.31. The improvement primarily came from higher than expected volumes, mainly in North America and good cost control and execution to our plans. Foreign exchange translation negatively impacted the quarter by about $0.01 compared with guidance. However, this was more than offset by FX gains recorded in other income.","Now, Sue will walk you through the first quarter in more detail and then I'll come back to take you through our outlook.","Sue Carter","Thank you Mike, we are very pleased with our performance and our execution in Q1 and as Mike talked about, you're going to see a lot of moving pieces with currency and purchase accounting and we're trying to provide you with a lot of details to facilitate your understanding of the quarter in both the slides and in our comments.","So if you would go to slide 4. Orders for the first quarter of 2015 were up 3% on a reported basis and up 7%, excluding currency. Orders were up 5%, excluding both FX and acquisitions. Climate orders were up 2% and up 6%, excluding currency. Global commercial HVAC bookings were up mid-single digits on a reported basis and by high-single digits ex-currency. Transport orders were up low-single digits and up high-single digits ex-currency. Organically, Thermo King had strong order growth in North America and high teens growth in Europe. Orders in the Industrial Segment were up 3% on a reported basis and up 9%, excluding currency. Orders for Industrial were up 2%, excluding currency and acquisitions. We saw organic orders increase by low-single digits in air and industrial products, and improved by high-single digit in Club Car.","So if you would go to slide 5. Here's a look at the revenue trends by segments and regions. The top half of the chart shows revenue change for each segment. For the total Company, first quarter revenues were up 6% versus last year on a reported basis and up 8% on an organic basis, which excludes both foreign exchange and acquisitions. Climate revenues increased 6% on a reported basis and 9% ex-currency. ","Commercial HVAC was up high-single digits and transport revenues were up mid-teens, both ex-currency. Residential HVAC revenues were up high-single digits. Industrial revenues were up 7% on a reported basis, up 13% excluding currency and up 4% excluding currency and acquisitions, and I'll give more color on each segment in the next few slides. Bottom chart shows revenue change on a geographic basis with and without currency. Excluding currency, revenues were up 10% in the Americas, 22% in Europe, Middle East and Africa, led by strong HVAC performance and Asia was down 3%. If you back out acquisitions as well as foreign exchange, the primary changes in Americas, which would be up 8%.","Please go to slide 6. This chart shows the change in operating margin from first quarter 2014 of 5.7% to first quarter 2015 which was 5.9%. Consistent with prior quarters, this is shown on a reported basis, and we've spiked out the restructuring to get you to adjusted margins as well. Volumes, mix and foreign exchange collectively were 40 basis points positive versus prior year. ","Price was positive but was slightly less than direct material inflation. Pricing was most competitive outside of North America. Productivity versus other inflation was positive 80 basis points, driven by strong productivity in the quarter. Productivity favorability was in direct materials, G&A and solid executions including the third phase of our ERP implementation in the first week of April.","Year-over-year investments and other items were 80 basis points. This was the first quarter which included results from Cameron and as expected, impacted margins by 50 basis points due to inventory step-up and intangible amortization. In the box, you can see 60 basis points of headwind from investments and 30 basis points positive from lower restructuring costs. In the green box at the top of the page, overall leverage on an adjusted basis was 12%. Backing out currency and acquisition results, leverage was approximately 20%.","Please go to slide 7. The Climate Segment includes Trane commercial and residential HVAC, and Thermo King transport refrigeration. Total revenues for the first quarter were $2.2 billion. That is up 6% versus last year on a reported basis and up 9% ex-currency. Global commercial HVAC orders were up mid-single digits on a reported basis and up high-single digits ex-currency. Organic orders were up in all geographic regions, with notable strengths in North America and Europe. Trane's commercial HVAC first quarter reported revenues were up mid-single digits and up by high-single digits ex-currency. Commercial HVAC equipment revenues and HVAC cards, services and solutions revenue were both up high-single digit versus prior year ex-currency. We saw year-over-year gains in both applied and unitary ducted and ductless equipment.","Thermo King reported orders were up low-single digits and high-single digits versus 2014's first quarter ex-currency. Organic orders increased in all regions except Latin America. Thermo King reported revenues were up high-single digits and up by mid-teens ex-currency, with strong gains in North American truck and trailer and auxiliary power unit. In Europe, organic revenues were up high-single digits. ","Residential HVAC revenues were up high-single digits with volume gains in all major residential product categories as well as in light commercial products, which were up low-double digits for the quarter. The adjusted operating margin for Climate was 7% in the quarter, 40 basis points higher than first quarter 2014 due to volume and productivity, partially offset by inflation, currency, and higher investment spending.","Please go to slide 8. First quarter revenues for the Industrial Segment were $729 million, up 7% on a reported basis and up 4% organically, which excludes the Cameron acquisition and currency. Air systems and services, power tools, fluid management and material management organic revenues and orders were both up low-single digits versus last year. Organic revenues in North America were up low-single digits, while revenues in overseas markets were flat. Club Car organic revenues in the quarter were up high-teens from improved sales of golf car and utility vehicles. Organic orders were up high-single digits versus prior year.","Industrial's adjusted operating margin of 11.9% was slightly down compared with last year, as we're in the early days of the Cameron acquisition, including heavy purchase accounting impacts and negative currency. For the segment, price offset direct material inflation and productivity offset other inflation in the quarter. We achieved our Q1 plan for the Cameron acquisition and the business will continue to add benefits as we continue the integration process. Industrial's organic operating margin at constant currency was 13.9% for Q1, an increase of 180 basis points over prior year.","Please go to slide 9. For the first quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 6.3%. The increase versus prior year is primarily inventory, this includes some incremental inventory related to the regional standard\u2019s change in residential HVAC and additionally, we have intentionally increased stock inventory levels of key component assemblies in order to ensure availabilities of supply as we enter the prime selling season for commercial and residential HVAC products. We have good collections in the quarter with days sales outstanding and days payable outstanding both improving over the prior year.","Our balance sheet remained very strong. We have no debt maturities this year given the financing we did last October and the early retirement of the 2015 notes. Our cash balance is at normal levels. We expect free cash flow in 2015 to be in the range of $950 to $1 billion. Before I conclude, you saw that we devalued our assets in Venezuela in the first quarter due to the ongoing decline of the Venezuelan currency, this charge was reported in other income and expense and we've adjusted it out of earnings per share given its unusual nature.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Mike to take you through our guidance.","Mike Lamach","Great, Sue thank you, and please go to slide 10. So overall, our forecast has not changed materially since the last call in January. North American institutional markets were up in the first quarter and we expect to have a positive year albeit at a more moderate pace than the current Dodge forecast. We also continue to see growth in commercial and industrial buildings and retrofits. Based on this, we expect mid-single digit growth in 2015 in North American commercial HVAC markets. We expect Latin American, Asian and European and Middle East HVAC markets in the aggregate to be up low-to-mid single digits at constant currency but flat to down, after considering currency.","We expect North American transport markets to be up mid-single digits in 2015 and European markets to be down including FX. We expect residential HVAC industry motor-bearing unit shipments for the year to up low-to-mid single digits and revenue should be up mid-to-high single digits due to favorable mix. We expect industrial markets to be up low-to-mid single digits. Gulf markets are expected to be up low-single digits.","Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect our reported revenues for full year 2015 to be up 4% to 5% versus 2014. Overall, foreign exchange will be a headwind of about 3 percentage points. We expect Cameron centrifugal business to add three points for the year. So, for organic growth, excluding foreign exchange, we end up back at 4% to 5% range.","Translating that to our full year outlook by a segment. We expect climate revenues to be up 2% to 3% on a reported basis and 4% to 5% excluding currency. For the industrial segment, revenues are forecasted to be in the range of up 13% to 14% on a reported basis and 4% to 5% excluding Cameron and foreign exchange.","Industrial has a higher proportion of revenues outside of the US than climate. So, industrial experience has more impact from FX as compared to climate. For operating margins, we expect climate margins to be in a range of 12.5% to 13.5%. We expect industrial margins, including Cameron operations and amortization, but excluding the impact of the inventory step-up to be 14.5% to 15.5%.","The inventory step-up will be reported in the first and second quarters is about $12 million per quarter. Since it\u2019s non-cash and isolated to those two quarters, we felt it was more representative of ongoing earnings to spike out the step-up. If you remove the Cameron impact, the legacy industrial segment has operating leverage over 50%.","Let\u2019s go to slide 11. Transitioning to earnings, our reported earnings per share guidance range is $3.42 to $3.60. Excluding the Cameron inventory step-up, restructuring, and the Venezuela currency devaluation, the range is $3.66 to $3.81, an increase of 10% to 14% versus 2014. When you exclude the impact of bringing Cameron revenue and earnings in for the year and currency, the legacy company leverages at approximately 30% and including acquisitions and currency, we should be in the 25% range.","The $0.07 per share outperformance for the first quarter largely offsets the additional currency headwind for the strengthening of the dollar against overseas currencies in the quarter. For example, we built our original guidance at a euro rate of $1.16 and our current forecast is at $1.08.","Just as a reminder, the information we gave you last quarter, to give you some simple math to gauge our sensitivity to currency movements, $0.01 movement in euro means about a $0.01 in earnings. If all currencies moved 1% versus a dollar, that would be about $0.02 of earnings.","To focus on second quarter guidance, see the right hand column on the chart. Second quarter 2015 revenues are forecast to be up 4% to 5% on a reported basis. You can see the currency and acquisition impact on the slide. Reported second quarter earnings per share is forecast to be $1.14 to $1.18. The inventory step-up, all hits in the first and second quarters and impact second quarter by $0.03. We also expect about $0.01 of restructuring costs, adding these back to get to adjusted basis, the EPS range is in $1.18 to $1.22. We have provided the EPS ranges for the second quarter in the appendix to give you the walk from year-to-year.","For the full-year 2015, we expect to generate free cash flow of $950 million to $1 billion, which is at long-term target of 100% of net income. We increased the dividend by 16% to be consistent with payout ratio in the peer range. We also utilized the EUR100 million of cash to pay for FRIGOBLOCK.","We anticipate a minimum of $250 million of spending for share repurchase, which will offset dilution from equity issuances. That leaves about $350 million of cash that will be put to either value accretive acquisitions or share repurchase. We have a pipeline of acquisition opportunities related to our core businesses and we weigh those risk-adjusted opportunities against buyback in terms of returns and shareholder value.","Our strategies for growth and operational excellence have delivered a multi-year trend of excellent operating leverage, margin and earnings improvement. Our focus is to continue to grow earnings and cash flow through further implementation of those strategies. We have practically worked to deliver productivity and make prudent investments for the future. We continue to execute a consistent value maximizing capital allocation program.","In closing, we\u2019ve given you a lot of data and analysis on our operations this morning. There are lot of moving parts for this year\u2019s numbers and it\u2019s likely to continue as we go through the year. Filtering out all the noise, I hope it\u2019s obvious that our overall business fundamentals are strong. Our investments are fueling our revenue growth and our productivity improvements are on plan. Our two new acquisitions are on forecast and we believe we have purchased two very sound businesses.","There is still a lot of work to do, but I\u2019m very pleased with our steady operations, improvements and a growing maturity in our operations. Part of the progress we\u2019ve made, results we\u2019ve delivered and believe we\u2019re well positioned for 2015 as well as for the future.","With that Sue and I\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. Danielle I\u2019ll turn it over to you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open, please go ahead.","Nigel Coe ","Thanks. Good morning, Mike and Sue. Just wanted to -- just kick off first of all with the margin bridge from the slides and little bit surprised to see 20 bps impact from price rolls [ph] this quarter, especially given the [indiscernible] we\u2019ve seen in the raw materials. So, I\u2019m just wondering, can you make some commentary on price and why those negative?","Mike Lamach","Yeah, we had positive price in the quarter. We had a little bit of carryover, material inflation, just due to some of the assemblies that we\u2019re working on, but essentially the price would come into the Asian market, particularly China, a bit into Latin America, which really in the last quarter or two, those markets have struggled and we\u2019ve got some local competitors I think with some capacity to utilize and so, that\u2019s been a bit more pressure there.","We also had bit of a rebate timing from Q4 to Q1 and if you sort of add that back to Q1 and normalize it, we were pretty close to being flat, which -- it is 20 basis points less than what we had hoped for, but it was fairly flat.","Nigel Coe","Are we still looking for about 23 bps benefit for the full year?","Mike Lamach","Yeah, we\u2019re challenging ourselves to do that. That\u2019s probably one of the challenge points in the forecast, but our plans, the road maps we\u2019re building, the countermeasures that we got to realize price would have us doing about 20 bps, 30 bps in material inflation gap.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Mark Douglass from Longbow Research. Your line is now open, please go ahead.","Mark Douglass","Hi, good morning.","Mike Lamach","Good morning.","Mark Douglass","There is still little bit of conservative in guidance on the organic growth expectations. I suppose some of that\u2019s because 1Q is really seasonally weak, don\u2019t want to read too much into the year, but your trend seem pretty good and certainly outpacing the 4% to 5% organic growth expectations.","Mike Lamach","Yeah, I mean, the optimism in the quarter was the strong growth, but as you pointed out, it\u2019s seasonally such an insignificant quarter to the full year for us that we typically go back and fine-tune in July and we\u2019ll do that again this year, but your question and Nigel\u2019s earlier question where we might see potentially some upside to volume, mix was not particularly favorable in the quarter for us.","Currency is still quite a bit of headwind if you look at the euro at $1.08 and currencies where we are today, it\u2019s about $0.11 of headwind, we offset about $0.07 in the first quarter, but we\u2019ve got more room to work for the balance of the year and then again the pricing question, we\u2019ve got more aggressive view on pricing for the balance of the year. So, you net it all out, I think it nets out to a balanced view on guidance, but specifically on your question, if we were to see stronger markets and by July, we would probably make a little higher call there at that point in time.","Mark Douglass","Okay. And then you mentioned industrial had better than 50% incremental margin in the legacy business. Can you describe what\u2019s really driving such strong incremental leverage?","Sue Carter","Well, I think it goes back to Mark when I talked about -- when I talked about the segment is that, if you save a higher impact from currency, right, so, if you take that out, that\u2019s a piece of it and then if you take out the Cameron acquisition that it\u2019s in its early days and it\u2019s got all that purchase accounting, the business for the segment itself actually had positive price versus direct material inflation. They actually had productivity that offset inflation and so, they actually had a very nice quarter in terms of operational performance that underlie the basics of that. So -- and also investments were in line with the revenue percentage in the first quarter of 2015. So, you take out some of that noise that we talked about, they actually leveraged very, very well for the quarter.","Mike Lamach","Club Car did a great job too, doing what we expected against a very easy comp from last year, but Club Car did a nice job in the quarter.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Market. Your line is now open, please go ahead.","Deane Dray","Thank you, good morning. Couple of questions. I was hoping you could give some clarity on that whole inventory situation with residential HVAC and the new SEER requirements and has that inventory been sorted out and then secondly, some commentary on the strength you saw in EMEA, that up 22% FX?","Mike Lamach","Deane, on where we sit with 13 SEER just for competitive reasons, we\u2019re not going to talk much about that. We really don\u2019t want to discuss our position at this point in time. The main thing we\u2019re trying to do is, we saw across the business a lot of order volatility starting last summer and I commented on that in the third and fourth quarter and frankly, that volatility was broader than even the min\/max requirements we would have for stocking key components and so, rather than trying to guess the volatility of the markets, we will expand it those min\/max\u2019s for key material for components and assemblies, particularly in high margin businesses, where cycle times were very short and there was some discretionary opportunities with customers that wanted to buy what was on hand.","And so, we took that up and I think that\u2019s an important point because we\u2019re looking at fulfillment rate and cycle times to be balanced with inventory levels and the net of that really is strong growth in the quarter and improved customer delivery rate.","So, I\u2019m not sure where working capital will really end for us exactly, but frankly, if we can continue to get strong growth rate fulfillment, it\u2019s an inexpensive investment in terms of the EPS growth for the company.","Europe just continues in the HVAC business, but I would also say, across all the businesses to perform very well. The standout was the HVAC business, as it has been for probably more than a year now. And it\u2019s the combination I think of -- just the winning combination is having right management team on the ground, a lot of new products hitting the markets at the right time and combination of that really coming together with some great results. I think they were probably north of 20% before currency in that business.","Deane Dray","Thank you.","Mike Lamach","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is now open, please go ahead.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you, good morning everyone. Mike, could you give us a little more color on what\u2019s going on in the institutional markets, institutional applied, in particular, and it does sound like commercial unitary was robust also? Is there any particular verticals there that are standing out?","Mike Lamach","Yeah, it is interesting, Dodge is calling for 11% increase in institutional, so that\u2019s still 25% off its peak and we\u2019ve contended that you are more likely to see an extended sort of mid-single digit institutional recovery perhaps over two or three years. ","Education is probably a little better than 5%. Healthcare is looking at probably a little less than 5%, those are two important markets for us. I commented that, we needed to see some education orders moving to the pipeline. We are seeing that, so that\u2019s a positive and we would expect healthcare, which typically are going to be a bit more complicated, a bit more applied work going in there, applied engineering and applied product going in there probably late this year, early next year. So that\u2019s shaping up.","We are seeing strong still commercial and manufacturing construction going on. That vertical as it relates to HVAC, I am talking about industrial buildings being built, the commercial buildings being built continues to be strong, but we\u2019ve had great success with light commercial. That is the product growth team for us, they\u2019ve done an excellent job. Sue commented that we\u2019ve seen double digit growth year-over-year there. So, we are very pleased with what\u2019s happening across that business.","Jeff Sprague","And just a quick one for Sue to follow-up. So you had FX gains I guess in other. Can you just describe what \u2013 where you are at on hedging for the year and kind of what the strategy is and how hedged you might be?","Sue Carter","Right. So, Jeff, when we think about what goes into the other income and expense and the favorability that you see in Q1, that whole line is going to be a couple of different items, one of which is the foreign exchange that I will get to. What\u2019s also in there is earnings from some of our equity affiliates, some interest income and as you might expect the other cats and dogs on the P&L, but don\u2019t fit into another line item.","In general, that line item is going to be somewhere between $2 million and $6 million favorable. And if you think about looking back to the fourth quarter, it was actually $6 million favorable. So you\u2019ve got the $10 million in the first quarter, not unheard of, but the big drivers for the first quarter, to answer your question, were better earnings out of our equity affiliates. And then also the foreign exchange gains and losses outside of the Venezuelan currency devaluation. ","Now what happens with the foreign exchange gains and losses is the only thing that we do cash flow hedging on is of balance sheet position and things that are known to us. So when we put those hedges on, if the dollar is strengthening when you close down those positions, you get a gain and that\u2019s part of what we saw in the first quarter. It doesn\u2019t mean then it\u2019s repeatable because as you role those hedges, you are resetting the rates. And if you look at Q1, this is the biggest change quarter-over-quarter in terms of foreign exchange rates, particularly on the euro that would have been on average for $1.33 last year and $1.09 this year.","So again, some nice gains that are in there from a transactional point of view and we try \u2013 there isn\u2019t a direct percentage that I would say is hedged, but we are looking at things with intercompany loans and things that are known that don\u2019t have a lot of volatility and risk for those. And that\u2019s just a routine for us that we are putting cash flow hedges out for that.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Robert McCarthy from Stifel. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Robert McCarthy","Hi, good morning, everyone. How are you?","Mike Lamach","Good morning.","Robert McCarthy","I just wanted to talk about the trajectory for the US non-residential construction in terms of how you are seeing and in terms of the exit rate, in terms of orders coming into March and April. How are you feeling about the year? And then, maybe we can talk about operating margins throughout the back half.","Mike Lamach ","I think that mid-single-digit view is a good view. Again, I think that you will see education maybe a bit north of 5%, healthcare a bit less than 5%. We will still have a good unitary business for office and manufacturing. So really sticking to that kind of mid-single-digit and to your early point that things continue to shape up, maybe it\u2019s to the high end of that range and we will come back and adjust in July.","Robert McCarthy","And just given the cadence of the year and all the noise you are seeing and obviously some of the incremental headwinds with FX, how should we think about the cadence for incremental margins at climate throughout the back half of the year?","Mike Lamach","In general, for the company I would start, you would look sort of all-in reported about 25 and if you take out acquisitions, you are probably closer to 30 to gross margins in the company. Climate, we do about the same. Interestingly, when you see translation in our company, obviously it\u2019s going to impact businesses like industrial that have higher exposure to foreign currencies, which is the higher margin business in our climate business, you also find in there that TK is one of the most global businesses we have and so obviously the operating leverage, the deleverage on currency there is higher coming back in.","So it\u2019s obviously more difficult to offset translation per se, so we have to drive harder with productivity to be able to do that. And that\u2019s the roadmap that we are building. And so a lot of companies I know have taken down guidance as a result of currency. I thought, A, it was too early in the year for us to do that, and B, we\u2019ve had good success with productivities and good volume in the quarter and feel like the leverage should support staying with the range that we\u2019ve got at this point.","Sue Carter","And the other part of that, Robert, is going to be that the direct material inflation. So we talked about we\u2019ve got some inflation in the first quarter and a bit in the second quarter some of that tier 2 carry over in the back half of the year. We see that that levels out and we are not getting material inflation, so that also helps the leverage in the back half of the year for actually both of the segments.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, thank you. Just a question on the industrial margins. You\u2019ve got the target for the year of 14.5% to 15.5%. I just wonder if you think you will be able to get into that in Q2 or it\u2019s really about a big sort of second half move.","Sue Carter","No, I think that as we look at it, Julian, our projections would say that we are going to continue to grow and the second quarter will be stronger than the first. So I don\u2019t want to \u2013 not allow for any breakage, but I think we will start to see things get close to that range in the second quarter for industrial. And when we think about what\u2019s happening there, they are still going to have the big FX impacts, they are still going to have the Cameron step up, but there is productivity in the additional volume that is going to help them. So the short answer to your question is, yes, we should get close to that in the second quarter.","Julian Mitchell","Thanks. Then my second question, your Asia revenues organically were down sort of four quarters now. Just maybe give a bit of an update on that. I understand there has been a price [indiscernible] HVAC for sort of six months or more and do you think that your Asia business can get back to organic growth in the next six months?","Mike Lamach","Well, the overall market is down, so it\u2019s not actually any sort of a share issue and it\u2019s somewhat choppy and we\u2019ve seen this before in China in terms of the choppiness and the shortness of the cycles that we\u2019ve had years of two quarters down, two quarters up, net up. And I think that you are looking at that here. The pipeline there would support back half of the year which is stronger than the front half of the year. So even for the second quarter, we are likely to see sort of flat for the overall company down in terms of bookings, but for climate I would expect to see an uptick in Q2, potentially high single digits or maybe even better if bookings \u2013 timing \u2013 bookings comes in as we would expect. Then for the full year we should have I think pretty strong growth there in HVAC.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from David Raso from Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","David Raso","Good morning. My question is on Thermo King. The strength is obviously the North America for a while, but seeing some improvement in Europe, can you flush that out for us? What\u2019s the order growth rates you are seeing in Europe? Just trying to maybe find a little offset if Thermo King is down in \u201815 domestically, do we have some international offsets?","Mike Lamach","Yeah, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen the order growth rates were coming back in Europe, although I think there is more optimism in general in Europe and if you take currency out, obviously just look at the market for itself, is more sort of optimism around Europe, but we didn\u2019t really see that in the first quarter. The growth we had in TK there was largely North American truck and trailer, but across the world, we would have seen great container growth. Again, we saw APUs with really strong growth, something near 50% in that regard.","Also air, rail and bus combined were up as well, David. So those businesses are becoming more significant. It\u2019s a total part of the mix at PK. North America is performing about where we thought it would be. Europe hasn\u2019t quite recovered, but we think we will a bit towards the end of year on a constant currency basis, and we expect the ancillary products around rail, bus and APUs and containers to continue to have good run. Overall, kind of a mid-single-digit view.","David Raso","And for this year, at least Thermo King domestically has a pretty healthy backlog. How far does it extend into? Does it cover now pretty much the majority of the rest of \u201815?","Mike Lamach","We\u2019ve got a pretty good view of \u201815, we are slightly less than act of [ph] looking at 43,000 units I think in the last forecast and we would be something a bit less than that at this point in time. So where X calling for, say, 10%, we are calling for kind of more of a muted mid-single-digit growth rate there. Again if there was some optimism, if we chose to view that, hopefully act is right. Again, this is where we\u2019ve got inventory in place in case it is right. That typically could be some longer lead items on diesel engines and that\u2019s one of the positions we said could be a stronger backlog of components and inventory there.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Joe Ritchie","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. My first question is on Cam. Now you have had Cam in the full for a quarter, just wanted to see if you can give us an update on your outlook for that business and specially whether you\u2019ve seen any pricing pressure particularly on the oil and gas side of that business.","Sue Carter","So let me try to walk you through the business and the different markets that they are participating. As we told you, they met our revenue and operating income expectation for the first quarter and we are on track with generating the synergies and doing the things that we are planning to integrate the business. So everything is going along as we would expect with the business at this point in time.","If I divide and go into the individual markets for them, process gas, again a piece that does have some exposure on the oil and gas side, we are actually seeing some strength in the business with natural gas and with LNG. There is some project delays that are happening in perhaps the Middle East side, Petrochem is holding up as well as power generation in some of the pieces. So all in all, process gas is holding up well.","Plant air, we are seeing good activity there with business and the book and turn activity was good in the first quarter. Engineered air which is a piece that is exposed to air separation and some of those markets, it\u2019s showing a little bit of a pull back. And that\u2019s really more of an across the industry type of pull back, particularly in Asia where there was a lot of building and lot of overcapacity in air separation.","And on the aftermarket side, the aftermarket is stable for us, but we, of course, have plans to grow that as we talked about when we did the acquisition. So all in all, we are seeing what we expected to see out of the businesses, the markets haven\u2019t really let us down in any big way, and again our exposures being more on the gas side than the oil side of this are keeping us on track with what plan was for the business.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks, Sue, it\u2019s really helpful. And a follow-up I guess just on the incremental margins just being slightly lower this quarter for a variety of different reasons, lots of moving parts. It seems given that you have got an expectation that you\u2019re going to get a little bit more price cost leverage as the year progresses, I mean is it fair to say that as we get into the second half of the year, you should \u2013 could you see incremental margins that are closer to the type of incremental that you experienced last year?","Mike Lamach","Well, If you go back to the first quarter guidance, we are probably just maybe a point or two better in terms of operating leverage than we had guided, so we are pretty close on that, it\u2019s got there a little bit differently that \u2013 it\u2019s factored little bit weaker price, little inflation, little stronger productivity, little better volume, little worse mix, but bottom line, it was a solid execution to get to the leverage that we have planned. ","When you look at getting that 25% reported op leverage or 30% ex-acquisition op leverage, it would imply a better back half than front half and I think we are at this point all of the productivity pipeline, all the plans we have, price realization are in place, so it\u2019s a matter of executing on that, but again our forecast would be 25% reported, 30% ex-acquisitions on leverage for the full year.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan from UBS. Your line is now open, please go ahead.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Good morning.","Mike Lamach","Good morning, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Hey, just quick question on the acceleration in the Americas HVAC bookings up to the high-single digits, I think it\u2019s been a while since we have been there. You know, does that feel like sort of achieving lift-off for you guys, or is there something sort of keeps you in check, whether it\u2019s \u2013 because it\u2019s 1Q or something else you\u2019re seeing out there that doesn\u2019t want to extrapolate that.","Mike Lamach","I think we are getting great lift-off on the product growth teams we have put in place and again, I couldn\u2019t be more happy with the efforts of that entire team, which is a very broad team of product management engineers, operational people and selling organization doing a fantastic job with that. So I am more pleased with the execution of product growth team than I would be to call anything more than what I have, which is a decent institutional market, which believe me, we are delighted to see after years of negative, it will be a positive. ","And I think that the commercial and industrial building and retrofit markets have some lives left as well too, but again, we are all in all \u2013 even dodge would say, we are 25% off the peak, so we have got a long way to go.","Shannon O'Callaghan","All right. And then just on the M&A versus buyback with the discretionary cash, maybe just a little more color on what you\u2019re seeing out there in terms of the M&A environment and what kind of things you\u2019re looking at sort of which segment sort of size we might view as possible?","Mike Lamach","We have taken the philosophy to \u2013 across all of our businesses to look for the best opportunities. And so, I think the filtering that we do and the balancing that we do would be at the corporate level, but as it stands right now, we have really got all of our businesses looking for the right tuck-in opportunities at markets we know well, either channels that we can use to exploit the new products and services or the other way around, we have got products that we need to channel for. And so those are the typical acquisitions we are looking for. ","Obviously, we are trying to balance toward 15% overall operating margin target for the company, so that pushes us to looking for good businesses where the synergies are clear and that\u2019s a tough threshold obviously to look out there for us. But look, it\u2019s competitive out there in terms of acquisitions still today, a lot of these pipelines take a long time to develop, a lot of these are based on historical relationships, relationships we are building with companies that we would have an interest in. In some cases, they maybe partners suffice to us in other areas. So it\u2019s across the board, Shannon, and I wouldn\u2019t highlight or isolate one particular interesting business for you.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Steven Winoker","Thanks, Mike, Sue, Joe, thanks for getting to me. Couple of questions, I\u2019d like to you to put a finer point on. The first one is on your material inflation assumptions for the rest of the year, copper, steel, particularly seems to me like there is a lot more opportunity than what I am hearing in your commentary. Can you just help me understand how you are thinking about your raws?","Mike Lamach","Yeah, cooper and steel are moving in the right direction, Steve, we buy a lot more component and assemblies. That is two-fold. One is, in some cases you are paying more for overall general wage inflation or freight inflation and some of those commodity, that\u2019s not always just a material commodity decrease as a part of the assembly. ","But we are working with suppliers to make sure we are getting our fair share of that back, and where that\u2019s not happening, we will clearly resource that to a supplier with the better price points and that will take some time as well. So I think we are on top it. We do see a sort of a flattish to down overall inflationary environment in certainly steel and copper and zinc. Our factors that are positive in that as well as freight for that matter.","Steven Winoker","I think you would be in a pretty good negotiating position right now on those. And the other question, the final point on volume mix, so 8% core growth and volume mix 100 basis points of expansion. Mix must have been really bad or just help me understand the trade-off between those a little bit given the very, very strong core growth you had?","Mike Lamach","Well, climate grew specifically in HVAC much -- sort of it was the largest contributor to the overall absolute in the company and it was largely equipment. It has a long service tail on that and that takes a while to materialize over time. So look, when you are mixing higher climate versus industrial and higher HVAC versus TK, it\u2019s a bit of a challenge into the mix, that\u2019s really the sum of it.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. ","Steve Tusa","Yeah, good morning.","Mike Lamach","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Tusa","I think you guys are \u2013 the majority of inventories are what -- 50% is LIFO, is that right?","Sue Carter","Yes, something like that.","Mike Lamach","We can let you know, Steve.","Steve Tusa","Is there a dynamic there on how the raw material benefits are going to kind of run through given the more pronounced seasonality in your business, that\u2019s the first question, and what kind of impact that may have. ","And then just on the buyback, just remind us where you guys stand on your authorization for the buyback, and do you need a new one to kind of -- if you are going to do more in the back half, do you need a new one?","Sue Carter","So, let me take the share buyback, because that\u2019s probably easier than LIFO, but I will come back to LIFO. We had the $1.5 billion authorization in 2014 and as of the end of the year, we had utilized about half of that. So given the minimum of $250 million that we had set for 2015, that still will carry us through the year, so no problems on the share buyback authorization. ","On the LIFO side with prices going down, and volumes, there was no impact as I looked at the financials really in the first quarter from LIFO and I woudn\u2019t expect that to change as we go through the latter part of the year, Steve.","Steve Tusa","Okay, great. And then one last question just on the non-resi stuff, you know, JCI also out there saying things are pretty positive. On the institutional front, I believe the dodge forecast have gotten a lot better, maybe if you could just \u2013 just with the sales guidance, I mean, it just seems like things are getting better, not worse out there. How much kind of visibility do you have into the back half of the year now for commercial HVACs?","Mike Lamach","I mean, we had great performance in the quarter revenue, great performance in terms of orders, applied, the books are filling out through the fall, education, little less applied, health care a little bit more applied, so it\u2019s more of a move up there. ","Unitary continued strong, Steve that I don\u2019t think is going to slow down much for the year. So yeah, we are optimistic in kind of a mid-single digits growth rate. Dodge has been optimistic for a long time and so we have generally used our own pipeline and triangulation of all the data that we have and have had a fairly accurate estimate over the last say four, five years around that I don\u2019t see any reason to change from that.","With that being said, look if there is some sort of a boom we\u2019re missing here, once again, it\u2019s this sort of component inventory, particularly on the applied side that we are going to make sure that we are not cutting ourselves too thin in terms of inventory. We have plenty of capacity, that\u2019s not an issue for us at all on the capacity front.","Joe Fimbianti","Operator, we will take two more please.","Operator","Thank you. And you next question comes from Robert Berry from Susquehanna. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Robert Berry","Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to start by just clarifying what the message was on the commodities, I don\u2019t want to mince words too much, but I think on the 4Q call you talked about commodities still being a modest net headwind for this is year, and I know Mike you just mentioned it being flat to down. So I just wanted to clarify what the bottom line message is there. ","Mike Lamach","It\u2019s so close to flat, that I couldn\u2019t call it either way frankly, but it\u2019s certainly not going to be to my mind, much of a headwind, if any headwind at this point time the things continue as they are continuing, it would be a slight tailwind for us. ","Robert Berry","Okay. So that sounds a little better than what the message was last quarter, which\u2026","Mike Lamach","That\u2019s also part of why pricing probably isn\u2019t as strong too, again, it\u2019s about this gap between price and some of the commodities, which drive some of the pricing in the market place. ","Robert Berry","Fair enough. And then also just wanted to follow-up on the answer to a prior question about TK in Europe and clarify the outlook. I think you had guided to low-single digit decline in Europe, in the first quarter you\u2019re seeing high-single growth, I don\u2019t know if one of them is with currency and one is without, but maybe you can clarify that. And if you\u2019re seeing high-single now and expect low-single for the year, does that imply a meaningful deceleration through the year? Any color there would be helpful?","Mike Lamach","Yeah, European revenues were actually up high-single digits organically and if you take FX against that, obviously you get a story, which \u2013","Sue Carter","Yeah, the low-single digit with currency.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc. Your line is now open, please go ahead.","Jeff Hammond","Hey, good morning, guys.","Mike Lamach","Hi, Joe.","Jeff Hammond","Mike, you mentioned kind of be a more confident in your product groups in the way you\u2019re going to market in commercial versus say, optimism about demand side. Can you just give us a little more color on what they are doing right, what you are excited about from a new product or how is it going to market differently that\u2019s driving that?","Mike Lamach","The market analytics and the segmentation we\u2019re doing around some of the customer segments has been really critical, both in understanding about what we will grow and why, what competitors are doing or likely to do, scenario of planning around that, economic value estimation of the products we\u2019re launching and make sure valuing sort of products versus looking at it on a cost plus basis, all that really consummating and having an operations team and engineering team and a product management team having the same goals and objectives.","This is an example. If a plant manager is looking to maximize the inventory turns and a product manager is looking to maximize product availability, they are obviously in conflict when these people all agree on what it is as being the number one and number two things to grow market share and margins, great things happen. ","We have got those teams totally aligned on how to grow margin and how to grow market share and if you talk to anybody on that team, sort what stripe they wear from ops, engineering, sales or product management, they are going to give you the same exact answer. And that\u2019s where the investments are going and they are not going anywhere else, and this is why we got three, four times growth in the overall portfolio last year, this is why I am excited about doubling that this year, and ultimately that\u2019s why I am excited about next say, five years, because we will build this thing out all the way. People are having a great time doing this, they feel like they are winning and we are going to keep going as fast as we can.","Jeff Hammond","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back to Joe Fimbianti for any further remarks.","Joe Fimbianti","Hey, thank you all very much for this morning. Hope to see you at our Investor Day in May. I will be around for the rest of the day, so please call me if you have any additional questions.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

This call is being webcast on our website at ingersollrand.com, where you\u2019ll find the accompanying presentation. We are also recording and archiving this call on our website.","Please go to slide two.

Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results.

Mike?","Mike Lamach","Thanks, Zac, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today.","Please go to slide three. Before discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results, I'd like to begin the brief review of the fundamental elements of our business strategy that underpin our financial performance and create value for our shareholders.","First, our global business strategy is at the nexus of environmental sustainability and impact. The world is continuing to urbanize while becoming warmer and more resource constrained as time passes. We excel at reducing the energy intensity in buildings and industrial processes, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing waste of food and other perishable goods, and we excel in our ability to generate productivity for our customers, all enabled by technology. Our business portfolio creates a platform for the company to consistently grow above-average global economic conditions, aided by the strong secular tailwinds I\u2019ve outlined.","Second, our business operating system is designed to excel at consistently delivering strong top line growth, incremental margins, and free cash flow.","And lastly, over the years we built an experienced management team and a high-performance winning culture that makes our performance sustainable. When combined with our dynamic capital allocation strategy, we have a differentiated business model that drives strong shareholder returns over the long term.","Turning to slide four, focused and consistent execution of our business strategy enabled us to deliver top tier financial performance in 2018. We deliver top quartile organic bookings and revenue growth in each quarter and closed out full year 2018 with 13% organic bookings growth and 9% organic revenue growth for the enterprise. Adjusted earnings per share growth was also top quartile, up 24% for the year and up 29% in quarter four. Despite persistent material and other inflation and tariff related headwinds, our team successfully developed and delivered pricing and productivity actions that enabled us to effectively manage these costs and drive improved leverage and solid margin expansion throughout the year.","Importantly at the end of quarter two, we set out to achieve significantly improved leverage of 25% in the second half of 2018 and the team delivered against that objective while at the same time delivering record organic bookings and record revenues. Additionally, we achieved 10 basis points positive price cost per full year 2018 with 60 basis points of enterprise adjusted operating margin expansion, while at the same time continuing our healthy pace of incremental business investment which is core to our ongoing differentiated operational and financial performance.","Free cash flow for the year was 82% of net income which lagged our 100% conversion target. The largest component of the shortfall is related to funding working capital above normal levels through the end of the year in order to meet growing customer demand for our products and services. We also funded additional CapEx for high ROI projects beyond what we expected when we entered the fourth quarter. We've delivered an average of 110% free cash to net income conversion over the past four years and we expect to return greater than 100% in 2019.","Lastly, in 2018, we also continue to execute our balanced capital deployment strategy. After investing in the business including $366 million in capital expenditures, largely related to footprint optimization and plant consolidation, we deployed approximately $1.7 billion between dividends, share repurchases, and mergers and acquisitions.","Turning to slide five, our performance against our initial guidance expectations was strong with the exception of free cash flow which I discussed earlier. We significantly beat on both the top and bottom lines and delivered strong margin expansion, while managing inflation and tariff related headwinds and making healthy investments in the business.","Turning to slide six, focused execution of our business strategy is delivering differentiated results in the marketplace and for shareholders and we will maintain this focus going forward.","Looking at 2019, we see the fundamental ingredients for another strong year. First, our end markets generally remain healthy and I'll address that in more detail on the next couple slides.","Second, we're entering 2019 with record backlog in multiple business units after achieving exceptional bookings throughout 2018. This provides us with improved visibility into what to expect for 2019 revenues relative to where we'd have traditionally been at this stage in the year.","Third, in 2018, we demonstrated our ability to effectively manage inflationary and tariff-related headwinds through pricing and productivity. Combined with higher expected volumes, we expect this to enable us to continue to deliver solid leverage, improving margins and strong EPS growth in 2019 as we did in 2018. For 2019, we're expecting free cash flow to exceed adjusted net income. We will continue to execute a dynamic capital allocation strategy that deploys capital where it earns the best returns. This includes organic investments, dividends, mergers and acquisitions, and share repurchases.","On the M&A side, we have an active pipeline of attractive opportunities. It will be a strong fit with our core business strategy. If and when these become actionable and affordable, we're in a strong position to execute any transactions. We also continue to see value in our own shares which are trading well below calculated intrinsic value.","Lastly, based on our performance in 2018 and our guidance for 2019, we're firmly outpacing the glide path to achieving our 2020 Investor Day revenue growth, EPS, and free cash flow guidance that we laid out during our mid-year 2017 Investor Day. Given the tremendous amount of inflation and tariffs the industry has endured over the last two years, moving along that glide path a bit differently than what we expected in 2017, we're well ahead of the curve nonetheless.","Turning to slide seven, our end markets continue to show strength throughout the fourth quarter and 2019 appears to be shaping up as another solid year. In Commercial HVAC, the markets remain strong in virtually all geographies and we delivered strong bookings growth and revenue growth across the product portfolio. Europe has shown mixed economic signals over the past few months, but HVAC activity remains healthy there as well.","China had a solid quarter in HVAC with good growth in both equipment and services. Our direct sales strategy in China continues to progress well against our expectations and we're making good inroads in a number of verticals including infrastructure, which has been a key focus for us, and continues to be one of the strongest verticals. The situation remains fluid with trade war uncertainty. But at this point in the year, we're still expecting to see modest market growth and market share expansion opportunities in China, outside of China, the Asian markets are mixed. In total our global outlook for the Commercial HVAC market continues to be positive with low-single-digit to mid-single-digit market growth expected.","Turning to Residential. Quarter four was a very strong quarter for us with continued share gains, primarily driven by replacement demand and we expect the majority of the market growth to come from the replacement market in 2019 as well. This plays well into our business mix which is about 85% replacement. Economic indicators have softened modestly, but is still healthy and supportive of growth for the year.","Turning to slide 8. Our Transport business continues to be a globally diversified and resilient business with good growth opportunities across multiple areas. In 2018, we saw exceptional order growth for North American trailers and auxiliary power units and we built a healthy backlog as a result. In 2019, our strong backlog position for these businesses gives us solid visibility into revenue growth for the year, as we work to convert this backlog to revenue over time. The European Transport markets are mixed with trailer a bit weaker and truck a bit stronger as Brexit uncertainty is impacting these markets. We think additional clarity around this topic would be a positive catalyst.","Overall, we're expecting low single-digit to mid-single-digit market growth for transport refrigeration in 2019. Our Compression Technologies business had good growth globally in the fourth quarter with North America and Europe healthy. We continue to see trade war uncertainty impacting projects in China.","Global services growth continued to outpace equipment growth in the fourth quarter which is a positive and is well supported by multiple service initiatives focused on increasing attachment rates of services to equipment and increasing our share of wallet of total services provided within accounts. All things considered, we expect to see low single-digit \u2013 mid-single-digit growth in the Compression Technologies market in 2019 with China being the main area to watch closely.","Small electric vehicle growth continues to be powered primarily by our consumer and utility businesses. We expect to see healthy growth in 2019. Our Industrial Products businesses including Fluid Management, Tools and Material Handling markets remain healthy and we expect to see continued solid growth in these businesses in 2019.","And now, I'd like to turn it over to Sue to provide more details on the quarter and discuss our 2019 guidance. Sue?","Sue Carter","Thank you, Mike. Please go to slide number 9. I'll begin with a summary of a few main points to take away from today's call. As Mike discussed, we drove solid operating and financial results in the fourth quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.32, an increase of 29% versus the year-ago period. Our earnings growth in Q4 closed out a strong year in which we delivered adjusted earnings per share growth in excess of 20% in each quarter. ","Organic bookings and revenue growth was strong in both our Climate and Industrial segments. In our Industrial segment, we delivered 6% organic bookings and revenue growth. Organic bookings growth was healthy in the fourth quarter despite a difficult comparison of 12% organic growth in the fourth quarter of 2017. On the Climate side, organic bookings were exceptional, up 20% including a large Commercial HVAC order that will provide revenue over the next three to four years. Excluding this order, organic bookings growth was still outstanding, up 13%.","These exceptional organic growth rates accelerated despite difficult comparisons with very strong growth rate up 7% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 10% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Organic revenue growth was also exceptional up 9% and was broad-based across all of our Climate businesses and across building equipment and services.","As Mike discussed, free cash flow was 82% of adjusted net income, primarily due to finding higher working capital to support our exceptional bookings and revenue growth and funding additional CapEx for strong projects in the fourth quarter. We continue to drive high-quality earnings and expect to deliver free cash flow in excess of 100% of adjusted net income in 2019. Leveraging our business operating system for operational excellence across the enterprise, we continued to manage direct material, tariff-related and other inflationary headwinds in the quarter. During Q4, we delivered our targeted 25% operating leverage and expanded adjusted operating margins 90 basis points. For the year, our 60 basis point adjusted operating margin improvement was towards the higher end initial guidance.","Importantly, we also delivered on our dynamic capital allocation strategy in 2018. We deployed $480 million in dividends and increased the dividend 18% during the year consistent with our commitment to maintaining a strong and growing dividend over the long-term. We deployed $900 million on share buybacks as the shares continued to trade below our calculated intrinsic value. We also deployed $285 million on strategic mergers and acquisitions in 2018, the majority of which was committed to spend in 2017. Looking forward, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time.","Please go to slide number 10. As we discussed on the previous slide, the fourth quarter was highlighted by continued strong organic bookings and revenue growth in both of our segments as indicated by the positive signs on the chart. These results reflect continued strong execution of our strategy, capitalizing on healthy end markets. One minus sign on the chart was a revenue decline in Commercial HVAC in the Middle East where orders and accompanying revenues can be lumpy. Last quarter we highlighted that there were a couple of large orders in the third quarter of 2017. These orders shift in the fourth quarter of 2017, creating a difficult comparison for us in the fourth quarter of 2018. European HVAC orders and revenues showed continued strength in the quarter.","Please go to slide number 11. We delivered organic revenue growth of 8%, adjusted operating improvement of 90 basis points and adjusted earnings per share growth of 29%. Strong gains in volume from ongoing investments in new products, channel and system controls are delivering results in virtually every business and geography where we compete. Consistent disciplined focus on productivity and pricing actions enabled us to effectively manage inflation and tariff-related headwinds and drive margin expansion across the enterprise.","Please go to Slide number 12. The focused execution of our business strategy, underpin by our business operating system, enabled us to drive solid year-over-year earnings per share growth in the quarter. Our Climate segment delivered another strong quarter of operating income growth. Our Industrial segment delivered solid results with our Compression Technologies business in particular, levering over 40% in the quarter. Corporate productivity initiatives drove $0.05 of earnings per share growth year-over-year. Below the operating income line, other expenses related to legacy legal matters negatively impacted results by approximately $0.04. All-in, we delivered 29% earnings per share growth with strong results across the enterprise.","Please go to Slide number 13. Strong execution drove 90 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement in the quarter. Price versus material inflation was positive by 40 basis points in the quarter and positive by 10 basis points for the full year, reflecting strong pricing efficiency and a return to more normal price cost, despite the extraordinary inflation we were up against in 2018. Productivity versus other inflation was notably stronger in Q4 improving margins by 30 basis points. For the full year productivity fully offset other inflation. We also continue to reinvest heavily in our business with incremental Q4 investment of approximately 60 basis points, pretty evenly weighted between operating expense reduction projects to drive further productivity, footprint optimization, plant consolidation projects for Commercial HVAC and Compression Technologies and new product development and information technology investments. All these investments work in concert to make Ingersoll-Rand a stronger and more resilient business.","Please go to Slide 14. Our Climate segment delivered another strong quarter with 9% organic revenue growth and adjusted operating margin expansion of 40 basis points. Consistent with our expectations results were strong across the segment.","Please go to Slide 15. Our Industrial business also delivered strong results with 6% organic revenue growth and 40 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion with Compression Technologies leverage up more than 40%. Outside of Compression Technologies, the overall Industrial segment leverage was negatively impacted by discrete accrual adjustment and a legal settlement totaling approximately $5 million. We expect Industrial segment leverage will be strong moving into 2019 as it has been over the past several quarters.","Please go to Slide 16. In 2018 we executed a dynamic and balanced capital allocation plan deploying capital where it earns the highest returns for our shareholders. We maintain a healthy level of business investment in high-ROI projects to help customers solve their most complex challenges. These investment help drive our strong growth in both segments during 2018. Beyond that we invested $366 million in CapEx largely on footprint optimization and cost-out programs which build a stronger more resilient Ingersoll-Rand. We maintained a strong balance sheet that provides us with good optionality as our markets evolve.","We executed against our long-standing commitment to a reliable, strong and growing dividend. During 2018, we've raised the dividend, 18%. Additionally we deployed approximately $900 million on share repurchases as the shares continue to trade below intrinsic value. As we look forward to 2019, we remain committed to a dynamic capital allocation strategy that consistently deploys excess cash to the best return on investment opportunities. We're enthusiastic about the future and the opportunities ahead to deploy excess capital to the best ROI investments, whether that be investment in the business raising the dividend, repurchasing shares, or making value accretive strategic acquisitions.","Please go to slide 18. I'll spend a few minutes walking you through the details of our 2019 guidance. Given the market backdrop Mike outlined earlier, we expect total reported revenues to be up 4% to 5% in 2019 with the Climate segment growing slightly faster than Industrial. The difference between our reported and organic revenue contemplates about one percentage point of negative foreign exchange impact year-over-year. With the enterprise, we delivered solid leverage and margin expansion in the back half of 2018. In 2019, we expect further margin expansion in each segment and enterprise adjusted operating margin expansion of between 30 and 80 basis points.","Please go to slide number 19. We expect continuing adjusted earnings per share for 2019 to be in the range of $6.15 to $6.35 excluding about $0.25 of restructuring. We've modeled approximately $500 million in share repurchases into our guidance, which translates into approximately 244 million diluted shares for 2019. As I outlined earlier, we're committed to a dynamic and balanced capital allocation strategy that consistently deploys excess cash over time. Net the actual allocation of excess cash will depend on where we see the highest ROI opportunities over the coming quarters. We're targeting free cash flow to be greater than 100% of net income.","The adjusted effective tax rate is estimated to be between 21% and 22%. And for your modeling purposes, we also offer the following guidance. Corporate expenses are expected to be approximately $250 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $300 million, primarily driven by footprint optimization, factory consolidation, and new product development initiatives. Below operating income, we estimate interest expense to be approximately $200 million reflecting the debt refinancing we did in early 2018.","Additionally, we estimate that pension-related expenses that are classified within the other income and expense line will be approximately $40 million for 2019. We did not plan other income or expense line items outside of pension. These items are truly other and not estimable in advance.","Now I'd like to cover two topics of interest with you. Please go to slide 21. It's hard to keep track of what's happening with tariffs relative to what's in and what's out of guidance, so we thought it might be useful, if we laid out the assumptions that we're using. The guidance I just laid out includes, the known direct and indirect impacts we expect from the Section 232 tariffs, the Section 301 tariffs including Lists 1, 2 and 3 which is the full $200 billion and the expected China retaliatory tariffs. Relative to the Section 301 tariffs, we've included a planned step-up from 10% to 25% on March 1, 2019 at the conclusion of the 90-day negotiation period.","As we've said a number of times during this call, we expect to be able to effectively manage the inflationary and tariff- related impacts in 2019 as we manage these types of costs in 2018. To be clear, however, if the step-up from 10% and 25% does not occur, you should not anticipate we'll see a windfall gain. We will implement the pricing actions necessary to cover the actual inflation we see.","The next topic which is on the same slide is on 2019 restructuring costs. We thought it would be helpful to provide a little extra content beyond what we included in the main presentation. The restructuring we're doing in 2019 is largely aimed at proactively taking steps to build stronger, more resilient businesses in both our Climate and Industrial segments. Of the estimated $0.25 of restructuring in 2019, more than 80% relates to our ongoing footprint optimization and plant consolidation efforts. Each optimization project is expected to reduce our fixed cost base and improve operational efficiencies which benefits us no matter the economic conditions we encounter going forward.","And with that, I'll turn the call back to Mike.","Mike Lamach","Thanks Sue. Please go to slide 22. We believe the company is extremely well-positioned to deliver strong shareholder returns over the next several years and our 2018 financial results bolstered our confidence. We'll be the first to recognize that 2018 was by no means a perfect year. There'll be a room for further improvement. However, our ability to solve complex problems and overcome escalating headwinds to drive continuous improvement results for 2018 is encouraging and gives us confidence our business operating system and high-performing teams are prepared to successfully navigate the evolving landscape ahead.","I want to extend my full appreciation to our talented people throughout the world that are committed to delivering excellent results for our customers and shareholders. Our strategy is firmly tied to attractive end markets that are healthy and growing profitably. Our products and services portfolio is at the nexus of global energy efficiency and sustainability mega trends, which provides a tailwind for growth above-average economic conditions over the long-term.","Unless you believe the world is getting less populated, cooler, and less resource-constrained, these secular mega trends will continue to create growth opportunities for Ingersoll-Rand. Successful execution of this strategy enabled us to deliver exceptional bookings and profitable revenue growth in every quarter of 2018. We have an experienced management team and a high-performing team culture that incorporates operational excellence into everything we do. Our business operating system and our culture are differentiated and sustainable competitive advantage.","And lastly, our business model generates powerful cash flow and we are committed to deployment of capital. We have a strong track record of generating free cash flow and deploying excess cash to shareholders over the years.","And with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is open.","Scott Davis","Hi, good morning guys.","Mike Lamach","Good morning Scott.","Sue Carter","Good morning.","Scott Davis","Boy there's not much to pick on in this quarter at all. But you made a couple of comments I just wanted to dig into a little bit. In particular, really about the push to the right on some of the Commercial projects in China. Is it the opinion of your local guys that this is just more of a delay or maybe something a little bit more tied to the tariff outcome or what's really the color behind some of those comments?","Mike Lamach","Yes, you have to separate the business a bit Scott. So, take HVAC where we saw again really strong bookings growth and continued momentum there in services as well. And in those markets, I think, it's less susceptible particularly on the government commercial side involving infrastructure institutional work that there's more of a bias toward producing greenhouse gas emissions and as I've said hopefully a thousand times, if you're going to go attack the greenhouse gas emissions problem anywhere, you're going to hit HVAC whether it's stationary or transport first because 15% to 25% of most economies' global greenhouse gas emissions.","So, I don't think that China will let its foot off the gas around codes, compliance and regulations that would improve air and water quality. That being said, you look at the Industrial business and here I think the trends are largely the same. Interestingly, we saw good growth in some of the smaller compressors, some of our contract-cooled rotary and certainly in our rotary compressor line-up in general, but certainly all three would have been part of that. So that continues.","What I get mostly from our suppliers and from our customers that are, in China exporting outside of China particular to the U.S. is, they are waiting to see, however some of them are moving more rapidly to put incremental capacity in Asia, outside of China. So Vietnam is a favorite spot for that right now.","So I think that you're already seeing sort of actions taken by Chinese companies that export. I think you'll continue to see that going forward. And by the way, it's a positive Scott for us because you know it doesn't matter sort of where they set up shop, we're going to be able to support them. ","Scott Davis","Yes, that's going to be my natural follow-on is that are you a net winner or a net loser? I mean you have critical mass in China and some those other regions maybe you don't or do you? I guess is kind of... ","Mike Lamach","Yes. We have a strong footprint throughout Asia, so you really can't get to a part of Asia where we don't have a team on the ground, sufficient capacity of supply. So it will be good so long as that capacity is unlocked somewhere we would have opportunity. ","Scott Davis","Okay. I am going to pass it on. Thank you guys.","Mike Lamach","Thank you Scott.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open. ","Steve Tusa","Hey guys good morning.","Mike Lamach","Hey Steve.","Steve Tusa","Can we just dig into the bridge, the margin bridge a little bit? What was exactly in investment in other? And then could you maybe just give some color on how you see kind of that price material number kind of trending? And I think you said, no windfall if the tariff doesn't go through, but like you're already 40 bps ahead of the game here, definitely better than we expected in 4Q.","I would think that, you know can get better on its own ex-tariffs next year, maybe just give a little bit more color on how you see both of those parts of the bridge probably trending in the 2019 guidance. ","Mike Lamach","Yes. Steve so when you say sort of walk through bridge, are you thinking about the 2019 bridge or the 2018 fourth quarter bridge? ","Steve Tusa","Yes. I am just in the context of what happened in the fourth quarter I guess 2019. So maybe just explain the 60 bps what was in there in the 4Q and then moving beyond the 2019 how you'd see that play out? ","Mike Lamach","Yes, I would start and let Sue finish. The price over material inflation was something that we had hoped to get back to say 0 for the full year. We got to 10 basis points, so roughly at our expectations there. That worked out, materialized as we hoped it would.","One of the questions going into 2019 than is why is there not more positive price versus cost given some of the carryover and what I would say there as you've got to remember the 232 tariffs were implemented in April and May and the 301 were implemented in October, so the first half still sees headwinds from tariffs that didn't exist last year at the same time.","We also would see commodity inflation in quarter 1 and quarter 2, still see steel is being the largest, copper is being next and of course the Tier II knock-on effect that --these metals would be inflationary in the first half of 2018. But by quarter 2 you start to lap the majority of price from 2018. Materials begin to get perhaps deflationary, but tariffs remain in our model, so you might see a wider spread in Q3 or Q4. But it's a pretty early to call all that looks, but our plan is laid out as I've just expressed in that regard. Sue, any of the bridge items?","Susan Carter","Yeah. So if you think about, Steve your question on investments in the fourth quarter and going into 2019. So the investments in the fourth quarter were as we had planned them throughout 2018 and they're primarily investments in Operational Excellence and new product development and some of the footprint optimization that we were doing. And those actually do carry over and we continue to invest in the business as part of our capital allocation strategy in 2019.","So nothing terribly unusual or unexpected, as you think about either the fourth quarter of 2018, or where we're going in 2019. It's that overall strategy of really providing for projects that make us operationally better, increase productivity and allow us to manage the business.","Mike Lamach","Yeah. Sue, I probably add one point which is when you think about the productivity over a long period of time creating higher utilization and really opening up new capacities we've taken the decision over the years to slowly as projects emerge and you can consolidate reduce footprint we've done that. But you've seen in 2018 and 2019, a more aggressive view toward that. There was a step-up in 2018 not quite as high a step-up in 2019. That's at this point sort of the last of what we've see is the larger projects would entail for us.","And we want to be clear that we're not thinking about a recession in 2019, but we wanted to get really in front of that final large restructuring now. And just really in the event that something would happen into the future around recession, we just can be that much more resilient around that. So that's another part of what the investments involved through 2018 and certainly in the fourth quarter of 2018.","Steve Tusa","Historically that investment number is kind of a modest negative. Is that what we should think about for 2019 a more modest negative?","Mike Lamach","Well, the total investment number on the bridge itself is always right around 40, 50 basis points and that's exactly what we're going to be modeling in 2019.","Steve Tusa","Got it. And then one last one. Normal seasonality first half to second half next year, how should we think about seasonality for 1Q and the rest \u2013 and next year?","Mike Lamach","Steve I love you're adapting your question, because I was expecting the one about quarter one. And so let me answer that one actually first, because I appreciate that you're taking a longer view on that. Quarter one is usually the part that I think creates the most confusion around investors. But historically, if you look at the three-year average we've been around 12.4%. If you go to a long-term average, it's been around 11.1%. So I think that when you think about the seasonality for us, it largely comes into the first quarter. And for models that are between 11% and 12.5% you're kind of in a safe range. If you're north of that, you're probably figuring out something that we don't know about. So that's how I would kind of give you some thoughts around quarter one. The rest of the year sort of works itself out. I don't think there's been that many situations where there's been confusion around the back half of the year or even quarter two. ","Steve Tusa","Well, you gave me more than I thought I was going to get. I appreciate that. Thanks guys.","Mike Lamach","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open.","Julian Mitchell","Hi. Good morning. Maybe a first question around the free cash flow within that step-up of conversion in 2019. I think you're guiding for CapEx to drop almost 20%. But you're still guiding for operating cash flow to grow about 25%, so double the EBIT growth guide. Maybe just spell out, is that mostly coming from receivables, for example? And how quickly through the year do you think we see that improvement, given your cash flow tends to be pretty seasonal?","Sue Carter","Yeah. Julian, it should be a good story for us in 2019. We really do expect to have greater than 100% of net income and free cash flow. And so as you take apart those pieces, let's talk about CapEx for a second with the approximately $300 million guide for 2019.","That is lower than 2018. That was $366 million and there's a couple of components to that. We made a couple of decisions on projects in 2018. We had some carryover we had a warehouse facility where we were doing a warehouse consolidation absolutely a good project. We made a decision to lease versus buy. So long...","Mike Lamach","Other way around, owned versus leased.","Sue Carter","All right. Owned versus leased. Sorry, Mike. So as you think about the CapEx, it sort of normalizes back into our more 1% to 2% of revenues range in 2019. So that's helpful. As you think about working capital, working capital isn't going to change from an overall strategy viewpoint, which is that you're always going to be looking to balance out your customer terms and your supplier terms. So DSO and DPO always looking to balance those out. And on inventory, you're looking to make sure that you have enough products to meet the demand that we have, which is, of course, been quite strong. And at the same time, meet your on-time customer delivery.","What I would expect to see in the free cash flow guide in 2019 is that, as we move through 2019 that the working capital as a percentage of revenue is also going to normalize back more into our 3% to 4% range of the long-term guide. So we're moving back into more of the longer-term metrics in the 2019 statistics and that's what gives us the additional bump in free cash flow for next year.","Julian Mitchell"," Great. Thank you. And then my second question, maybe a bit more color on what you're seeing in Europe overall. I think you'd mentioned that in Thermo King you have some specific watch items which are understandable. But anything interesting changing in Trane or on the Industrial side in terms of customer spending appetite and so forth, and maybe split anything on Western Europe versus the Middle East.","Mike Lamach","Well, we've had a very strong HVAC year in quarter four in Europe and so that continues. And again, here this is \u2013 this bifurcation between economies, very focused on energy efficiencies, greenhouse gas emissions and making the regulatory changes to make that happen. So the growth rates there are outstanding. And then, you're looking at sort of the Industrial side of Europe is slower than that of course, as you're really I think factoring in sort of sloppier Brexit and I think the economy is a little bit in a slower mode there. But all in all, it's not \u2013 it's certainly not bad in Industrial in Europe for us and it's been great in HVAC. The Middle East just been choppier with the way orders come in there. Generally, you're talking about district cooling plants that are extremely large and whether we build them or not or modify them or not can make a difference quarter-to-quarter.","So, I think the environment there is good for us. It's just a matter of lumpiness in the orders. So, we're relatively optimistic on Europe and certainly the Middle East as well. In terms of transport refrigeration in Europe, it's a little bit mixed. You've got a slowdown in Western Europe. You've got continued growth in Eastern Europe. You see a little slower European trailer market and you see a little stronger European truck market.","And, again, I think this is just really working through some of the general economic concerns, largely Brexit. And clarity on Brexit, frankly, sort of a good outcome there. Clarity would be sort of a baseline outcome. I think it's a positive for the market and for our businesses.","Julian Mitchell"," Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Nigel Coe","Thanks. Good morning guys.","Mike Lamach","Hi Nigel.","Sue Carter","Good morning.","Nigel Coe","Mike it sounds like you had that Q1 answer prepared.","Mike Lamach","I didn't want to disappoint Steve on that one, so I got it.","Nigel Coe","12.4% that was pretty specific. So, the large commercials order, I don't think I've ever seen you call out an order of that size and especially in long-cycle. So, maybe just a bit more color in terms of that and how that progresses in. What's the market like for that kind of size of order? I mean are you seeing opportunities of scale out there?","Mike Lamach","Yes, we actually had one in 2016 and I wished we would have called it out in 2016 because that created a little bit of confusion in 2017 when it lapped. I think it was in the $128 million range, this one's closer to $200 million. So, I think that we're going to see more of these where it's a holistic approach toward reducing energy use in facilities, campuses, buildings, reducing the energy intensity, maybe even getting some grid flexibility moving toward alternative power. We're seeing more of that. And so for us, we're seeing that it involves design, equipments, lots of controls, service moderating over time, and that's a subcontract that will go along with that. So, they're lumpy. I've been probably talking about this for three or four quarters. So, that's one of the larger projects that we thought we will close and I think these things will get spotted in over time.","This particular project will last about 40 months and it will earn revenue in a pretty linear fashion. And we like that. We like the -- again, the resiliency over four years and having a nice base business to build on. The margins are pretty good and so it shouldn't really affect what we expect to be good leverage for the business going forward.","Nigel Coe","Okay, that's really helpful. And then I think you mentioned your shares below intrinsic value for, I think, three or four times during the call. You also mentioned M&A opportunity. So, I'm actually wondering given that you consider your share price too cheap right now, is the needle for incremental dollars still towards buybacks? Or do you see opportunities out there to deploy M&A more accretively than share buybacks? Any comment there would be helpful.","Mike Lamach","Yes, it's both Nigel. I mean you can expect that it would be both for us. And it's really looking at the affordability the ROICs of the M&A that's out there based on what we think we could do that for and then comparing that toward intrinsic value. Of course, the benefit on the acquisition is building a compounding base of cash over time, particularly if they're good businesses strategically fit the core of the company. So that's the focus. But as we're not going to let cash sit around for long and we're going to deploy it somewhere. And that's what certainly happened in the fourth quarter, where you saw actually stepped up the buyback in the fourth quarter. Balance sheet is in great shape, so plenty of capacity there and flexibility to work with the balance sheet going forward.","Nigel Coe","Okay. Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Mike Lamach","Good morning, Joe.","Susan Carter","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Ritchie","So just to clarify a couple of points on the cash flow Sue. So obviously nice step-up expected in 2019. You guys are expecting roughly 40% growth. Get the CapEx point, it seems like the delta is \u2013 half of it seems to be coming from working capital improvement half of it coming from earnings growth or EBIT growth, core EBIT growth. And so on the working capital side, are you assuming the turns get a turn better? Or how should we be thinking about that working capital piece?","Susan Carter","Yeah. If I think about Joe and I go back a little bit with the working capital as a percentage of revenue, where we would have called that at year end would have been probably 3.4%, 3.5% somewhere right in the middle of our 3% to 4% range. And it ended up at 4.3%, so you actually do get to your point on about a full point of that coming out of there. And again, it is a process where it is not just making a decision of whether you're going to have inventory there or not. I mean, there's a series of levers that happen.","As you see the demand forecast, as you plan what's going to happen in the factories and you plan how you're going to actually efficiently manage those factories going through time, in order to meet that on-time customer delivery. So your point to the right one, the inventory will probably come down over time and everything else remains balanced. But it does go back into that 3% to 4% of revenue range which is what gives you the uplift.","Mike Lamach","And of course Joe, we delivered really outsized cash flow in a slowdown. So it's kind of a good problem to have as we're funding growth here. And it's not a worry in terms of what we think about everyday. The cash would be not a worry in terms of our ability to deliver that. We've done it historically. We'll do it in 2019 and it was good reason in 2018. The plan we always have is to increase turns. We usually plan at about half a turn, but we always throttle it back.","The Trump card there is always on-time shipment, on-time delivery and when you've got sort of volatile order rates particularly biasing upwards, we want to make sure we've got plenty of safety stock or increased Kanban sizes to be able to handle particularly hard-to-get components and parts. And so we're just going to make sure that we're making hay while the sun is shining. So, Sue's point's exactly right, but we want to make sure to fulfill the growth and do it on time.","Joe Ritchie","All right. So maybe said another way, if the quarter book looks good as the year progresses and you may have to build inventory again next year and that's just a good problem to have.","Mike Lamach","Well, our growth rates the forecast probably half of what it was last year. So I think to Sue's point, you're going to see where the capital come down anyway there a little bit. I think we comfortably get above 100% just based on that. But it's a 12-round fight, so you need to think about how this is going to evolve over the year. And if we've got a good outcome on some of the stuff that's out there, whether it's the debt ceiling negotiations, or Brexit, or China-U.S. tariff discussions, if it's a blue sky scenario there, we're going to adjust as necessary to go fulfill that.","Joe Ritchie","Yeah. No, that makes sense. And Mike, just to follow on your question, your comment earlier around talking about these large projects for several quarters. I recognize the lumpiness, but it'd be helpful if you can maybe talk about the pipeline, whether you see like the pipeline as being pretty robust today or you are starting to see some of these projects come through and maybe a little less full than maybe what you saw over 12 months ago?","Mike Lamach","Yeah. Look, I think that these projects kind of go in sort of two to five at a time that are out there on the horizon. They take often two, three years to develop. We'll often put $10-or-more million into the development of the project, as you can imagine. And so, as we get closer and closer toward thinking we've got something, we can certainly do that this year. We knew that we had one or two turned out to be the one really large one, there's a couple of smaller but in the magnitude of $50 million to $125 million that are out there.","Joe Ritchie"," Okay, great. Thanks guys.","Mike Lamach","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Good morning, guys.","Mike Lamach","Hi, Andy.","Susan Carter"," Good morning, Andy.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Mike, obviously, there continues to be some concern that resi HVAC for you will slow down at some point, given weakened new housing. But we know you're projecting a little bit -- single digit growth for the resi market in 2019 based on replacement demand. Was your resi growth in Q4 natural real climate growth in the high single digits? And do you think 2019 could be another year of share gains for Ingersoll? Or should we think Ingersoll growth more in line with the market in 2019?","Mike Lamach","Are you talking about resi, Andy?","Andrew Kaplowitz","Yes, yes.","Mike Lamach","Yeah. So resi, really from 2013 to the present, and I would say 18, for sure, consecutive quarters in a row we've had share gain. We really changed the strategy in 2013 product distribution, the model, investments in digital. And so for 18 straight quarters without a hiccup we've had share gain there. It was the same in the fourth quarter of this year. And the markets there remain strong.","You have to realize that, 85% of what we do is going to be in the replacement market, not the new construction market. So think about the context of Ingersoll-Rand, you think about Residential HVAC as being less than 10% of our revenue. So you could think about \u2013 obviously, you're talking about a really small number, 1% to 2% being new construction and if that fell off even 20%, it would be a negligible dip for us. We're really built towards the replacement market and I think that's going to continue to be strong.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay. And maybe, Mike, if I can ask you about the U.S. Commercial HVAC market. Obviously, a lot of questions on the large projects, but even the 13% organic bookings growth in the quarter was very strong. Looking to 2019, I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks to get better visibility here than you've had. Some people still question, how we're late to cycle. But if you look at the strength that you've seen, is it still broad-based between institutional supply markets? And the same markets, is institutional going to lead the way in 2019? And does this backlog that you have really start picking in 2020 at this point?","Mike Lamach","Well a couple of things, Andy. One is certainly the applied business remains strong, but I have to tell you the strength of the unitary \u2013 commercial unitary market was really strong as well. And so this just gives us a general sense about underlying economic conditions in the U.S. are still pretty positive. It's got long legs to have had that kind of growth for this long, particularly the results we had in the fourth quarter in commercial unitary. The applied institutional work continues to move along nicely, education and healthcare about 50% of that mix, and we think that education continues to be strong. We think that the healthcare continues to be strong. No outliers there that we're seeing on that front.","So we think we've got a solid backlog built for 2019. And as I mentioned earlier on the question regarding the larger contract that we booked that Nigel asked that thing has a four-year span. So I think this thing has got legs through 2019 for sure. Now recognize too, Andy, for people let me -- just to keep it in context. When you think about our Commercial HVAC business, you get to think about 50% equipment, 50% service. You get to the equipment piece of this thing, it really breakdown pretty quickly between Institutional and Commercial. But the large component of what we do there is still replacement buildings in the U.S. And so I think there's always an opportunity for us to have more energy efficient, more environmentally friendly ideas going into our customers, and so there\u2019s demand creation opportunity here as well.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Appreciate it, Mike.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","John Walsh","Hi, good morning.","Mike Lamach","Hi, John.","John Walsh","Maybe just to circle back to the margin bridge into 2019 for Climate. Was just wondering if there is anything to call out in terms of mix. You, obviously, gave us the market growth rates for some of the sub-businesses, but is there anything Ingersoll-specific there? And then anything as it relates to the different growth rates between equipment and service as you think about the margin impact?","Mike Lamach","So nothing remarkable jumps out to me at all on the year. It's pretty straight stick. I think that right in the ballpark there too of 25% of leverage that will continue to improve throughout the year.","The mix if anything, I mean perhaps a little bit on the Res side or the TK side because we continually expand more of the opening price point for the product line. With TK there could be some mix with Europe being a little bit weaker and a bit more profitable than North America, a bit more maybe toward truck versus trailer in Europe. So little things on the edges, but I think it's a pretty straightforward year.","The visibility around the backlog for TK particularly North American trailer units and around, obviously, power units is the most visibility we ever had in that business. I think we feel that way about the backlog in HVAC entering the year as well too. So a relatively straightforward plan here I think.","John Walsh","Got you. And then as we think about these restructuring benefits rolling through from the $94 million in 2018 you, obviously, call out the $0.25 and them having a four-year here payback. I mean, how should we think about what's actually carrying over from earlier actions into 2019 and then even starting to think about '20? And what kind of tailwind some of these restructuring actions could have or is it going to be later than that? ","Sue Carter","So John, the way I would think about it is the bigger pieces of the restructuring that we've been talking about in the footprint optimization arena between 2017, 2018 and what we're projecting into 2019 is sort in the range of you know 5 to 7 factories and those less than 5 year paybacks over time. So you're going to continue to build.","We started that process in 2017 and so you're going to build savings as you go through each of the years going out into -- there will be savings obviously in 2019, but there will be increasing savings in 2020, 2021 from these projects. And again, it is really about optimizing the footprint, building capacity and building a better Ingersoll-Rand in the catching locations that's there, but it does provide a good return and it does have a great payback. ","Mike Lamach","I'd say John, once we make these announcements into 2019 and as we think about extending the next round of long-term planning guidance that we do, you know this is something that will factor into improved margins and costs, of course lower fixed costs in the company going forward.","And I think we can probably help recast that sometime later in the year for all investors to understand the benefit of what's happened. So we'll make a note to do that once we have announced our intentions. ","Sue Carter","And I think Mike you made the point earlier in part of the discussions is that, we're not looking at these opportunities as a way to get ahead of an economic environment. We're actually looking at these opportunities to actually operate really well regardless of the economic environment. And so the fact that you can get a great return off of that, in addition to making the company stronger is terrific. ","John Walsh","Great. Appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Hi, good morning guys.","Mike Lamach","Josh Pok, good morning.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Yes, close enough, right. I am used to it. Just on the Industrial business. Not that anyone should necessarily operate with a hard landing scenario, but thinking back to 2015 and 2016, I think some of the shorter-cycle elements of that and Tools and other Industrial Products caught you by surprise and some of the decrementals there were a bit abrupt. How are you thinking about inventory levels, customer tone and kind of distance from prior trough in the context of 2019? It seems like everything's fine and I'm not being overly alarmist here. Just trying to gauge what maybe the sensitivity looks like? ","Mike Lamach","Well, first I mean back to John's question, when you think about sort of where all this restructuring spend has gone, the bulk of it at this point has gone into the Industrial business, particularly into the compressor business. And so I think building a higher-margin more resilient business is certainly what they've been doing. The other piece of that, is that service orders continue to outpace equipment growth, certainly again in Q4 too and that has both service penetration and its share of wallet strategies for our CTS business. We believe that from what we're seeing here there is certainly a balanced view toward what could happen. I mean clearly if there is some certainty around China-U.S. tariffs, we think certainty no matter what the outcome of that could be, is probably going to lock a little bit of growth there.","So, I think it's a balanced view at this point in time, but I think we planned for a lower fixed-cost base, the restructuring through higher service mix. And that business has been prolific around investing back into the business. I want to say gives a full 50 basis points going back into Industrial and I think that that is always a sign of healthy business investing. In a downturn, you can take share and we want to make sure if that happens, we're taking share in a downturn too.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got it, that's helpful. And then just thinking about some of these larger projects in Climate, I would imagine as the cycle wears on, you see more and more large projects show up. How should we think about that in terms of operating leverage when those ship? I'd imagine some of that especially in performance contracting is some pass-through revenue not just all your equipment. Is there a margin hit that comes in with that or a lower incremental or does it kind of feel like normal equipment?","Mike Lamach","Yes. It can be Josh not particularly in this case, right? I don't think this one's going to be something that spikes out materially anything with leverage or incrementals. So, the margins on those projects are not bad. As we've talked in the past, you've got to look at the contribution margin to the entire business.","Usually those projects have everything from an SG&A perspective loaded into the contract as well very little between contribution margin and operating income there are left to look at. So, I feel positive on that.","Again, they're hard to do hard to forecast. We don't put them into base plans. And when we think we've got something that's got a high probability of closing, we might start to talk about it. And certainly when there's the magnitude of what we booked, we'll have to spike those out, so we get everything straight from a comp perspective. So, I hope that answers your question.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Sure does. Thanks Mike.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Andrew Obin","Yes, good morning. Can you guys hear me?","Mike Lamach","Good morning, how are you?","Andrew Obin","Hey, I'm good. Just a question a lot of questions have been answered, thanks for including me. But just can you give us visibility on the institutional side because I know you guys look at state and local funding as foundations? How much visibility do you have for funding on the institutional side in HVAC in North America because it is a key market for you guys?","Mike Lamach","There's a lot of metrics to look at there, Andrew. I mean certainly you all can look at ADI, GDP growth, non-resi, fixed construction, all those look good. We've got the benefit of looking at--","Andrew Obin","I was more interested in -- yes, you guys track bond issuance and sort of longer term metrics from local government and state government. Those tend to be useful, sorry.","Mike Lamach","Yes, we do as well and you guys certainly can look at that. The most important thing we can track though is we put a lot of investment into the systems we use in the front end of the Commercial process. So, the ability for us to understand pipelines better really supports strong institutional growth going forward.","And I could just tell you that the number of -- and size of the projects from the institutional perspective are very healthy. And this goes back to the question around 2019 in Climate, what confidence do you have? Or maybe even to the larger Ingersoll-Rand question, what kind of confidence do you have in the guidance you put out? And I've got a high degree of confidence in what we put out today on all of that. But I would say the heart of that is because I feel very strongly about what's happening globally around HVAC, compliance, and certainly greenhouse gas emissions visibility, around institutional growth in North America, and around the visibility we have in the TK business. Those are all very strong indicators that I look back over 10 years of doing this and I probably haven't had at least the visibility I've got now into the backlog.","Andrew Obin","That's a great answer. Thank you. And just to follow-up on the industrial compressors. How much of a headwind is automotive for you? And if it is a headwind which industries are offsetting this in North America because the orders are quite good as well? Thank you.","Mike Lamach","Yes sure. Andrew when you go back and look at sort of the pie charts that the business produces one we did at Investor Day and it shows the end markets that we serve, you ran out of colors and slivers on the pie chart. So, Automotive is a piece, but it's probably not more than 2% or 3% of what we do, electronics is a piece, it's not 2% or 3% of what we do, and pharma and food and beverage, and so on and so forth.","So, automotive per se is not critical but it is indicative of a broader slowdown at times. It's indicative of the spending in the economy. So, we watch automotive and when we see automotive slow down, it can be a leading indicator for us for sure.","Andrew Obin","But what's strong in North America? Are there any end markets that turned out as strong to you guys on the Industrial side?","Mike Lamach","Industrial markets that remain strong would be food and beverage, pharma would be -- anything oil-free would certainly be strong for us. And then some of the weak-to-moderate markets are still going to be larger compressors where customers might be waiting at capacity to understand what's happening with trade.","Operator","I will now turn the conference back over to Zac Nagle for closing comments.","Zac Nagle","I'd like to thank everyone for joining today's call. As always Shane and I will be available over the coming days and weeks to take any questions you may have. So, certainly reach out to us if you'd like to chat. And we look forward to seeing you all at the upcoming conferences in February and we'll be on the road in March as well. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we\u2019ll have a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions). ","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Janet Pfeffer, Vice President, Business Development and Investor Relations. Ma\u2019am, you may begin. ","Janet Pfeffer","","Thank you Mary. Good morning everyone. We released earnings at 7:00 a.m. this morning and the release is posted on our website.

","With that, please go to slide three, and I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike. ","Mike Lamach","","Thanks Janet. Good morning and thanks for joining us on today\u2019s call. Today we\u2019ll cover three broad areas. First, we\u2019ll take a look back on the full year 2012. Second, we\u2019ll look at of course fourth quarter 2012 results; and finally we\u2019ll conclude by looking at 2013\u2019s outlook and guidance. ","Given the impending security spend, we\u2019ll be delaying the analyst meeting that we traditionally have hosted in March until later in the year, closer to the effective date of the spend. The analyst meeting is usually where we would step back a little from quarterly results and look at our progress over time and plans for the future, and since that won\u2019t occur for several months, I\u2019ll spend a few extra minutes this morning recapping our full-year 2012 and our progress on the transformation that we began in the company a few years ago. ","Steve will then take you through fourth-quarter results and I\u2019ll end with our outlook we have for 2013. So again, we\u2019ll spend just a few more minutes this morning than we normally do. I don\u2019t want anybody to get nervous. We\u2019ll obviously have a lot of time for questions towards the end. ","Let me start with full year 2012. In a macro environment of low revenue growth, our revenues for the year were up 1%. We increased adjusted earnings per share 23%, and grew operating margins 30 basis points in the face of some very challenging mix. ","Our pricing excellence program delivered price realization, significantly over direct material inflation. Our lien focus continued to show significant results in the implemented value streams, and we continue to invest in the future of the business, funding significant new product developments and building our services footprint further. ","Revenues from products launched in the last three years were about a quarter of our total revenue. We also invested in common systems, and we will have the first go-lives this year. As you recall, the program will continue through 2016. ","Our capital allocation strategy has been consistent and shareholder focused. We continue to increase our dividends with the announcement of additional 31% of an increase in December. The 2013 dividend will exceed now the 2008 peak by 17%. ","In 2011 and \u201812 we repurchased 55 million shares for $2 billion. In 2012 we repurchased 840 million in shares, and in December announced a new $2 billion repurchase authorization that will be used by the first quarter of 2014. Finally, we concluded a significant strategic review with our board, and in December announced the plan to spin off of our security business, which will occur late this year. ","Please go to slide four. As I\u2019ve talked about before, we started on a journey in 2010 to increase the operating capability of the company. We focused these efforts in two broad areas, innovation and operational excellence. In the area of innovation we\u2019ve almost doubled the proportion of our revenues from new products, which we measure as a percentage of total revenues delivered by new products introduced in the last three years. ","The new offerings have been in every sector of the business, from air compressors to unitary HVAC, to electronic locks, to new service offerings. Through new processes, talents and investments, we have increased our capability and results in areas like intellectual property development and protection, speed to market, margin improvement, and market share growth. ","In 2012, intellectual property disclosures were up 270% and patent filings were up 75% over the prior year. We are by no means done. We\u2019ll continue to invest in innovation and are focusing on multiple growth platforms identified during our planning process. ","To highlight a couple of examples of recent market introductions, in the lower left of the chart you\u2019ll see the Trane IntelliPak I. IntelliPak I systems are part of the Trane line of unitary rooftop systems, designed to be the most efficient and cost effective air conditioning units on the market. ","Available from 20 tons to 130 tons of cooling, IntelliPak systems deliver the highest energy efficiency rating in the industry for a standard product, and are up to 20% more efficient than traditional forward curved fans. Utilizing variable speed compressor technology, IntelliPak I systems provide a simple turnkey solution for system set-up and configuration, with lower lifecycle costs, and through efficient operation and reduced maintenance demand, the new systems provide superior reliability. ","They\u2019re ideal for large office buildings, restaurants, retail centers, industrial facilities and institutional buildings used for healthcare and education. In addition to reduced energy consumption and lower lifecycle costs, it provides very quiet operation in critical environments. ","The lower right corner, you see the ThermoKing Precedent. The Precedent features a completely new platform for the trailer market, designed to be fully compliant with the new EPA tier 4 final regulations. The Precedent platform features a new diesel direct electric architecture to deliver optimum efficiencies. Testing demonstrates that the electronic throttling valve saves 30% in fuel, reaches cooling set point up to 50% faster, translating to significant operational and environmental savings for fleets throughout the life of the unit. ","Please go to slide five. Another area of intense focus for us, and for me personally has been improving our level of operational execution, which we call operational excellence. We categorize it into four main elements; strategic sourcing, implementing lien through our value streams and in our functional processes and finally the pricing. ","We centralized sourcing during 2012 and organized around common commodities in order to increase our strategic sourcing capability through targeted training, standard work and the addition of external talent when needed. We also strengthened capability in emerging markets to better support supplier qualifications, supplier development and strategic sourcing in those regions. ","In one example, our maintenance and repair operations or MRO commodity team, implemented the new standard sourcing process for North America, which represents an annual spend in this case of about $70 million. They achieved 7% productivity, and also developed a roadmap to maintain productivity at 5% for the next two years. They improved days payable by five days. They reduced North American suppliers from over 3,000 to a select few, and increased their internal customer satisfaction score to four on a five-point scale. ","We have 24 value streams under transformation, which happens to also represent 24% of our cost base. The value streams continue to deliver superior results and show separation in performance versus the remainder of the company. ","In 2012 the value streams reduced past due days by 66%, reduced cycle time by over 40%, increased cost leverage, which is the plant\u2019s version of operating leverage and it\u2019s based on cost throughput by over six points, and had a 5 point increase in employee engagement scores while they were doing all of this. We will continue to roll out more value streams with a plan to add eight additional streams in 2013, which would then bring the cost base coverage to 40%. ","On functional costs, we have a target to reduce our costs by two points of revenue over the next three years. Implementation of common systems is a key enabler to that reduction. We\u2019ll have our first go-lives in the first half of 2013, and the implementations continue in six phases through 2016. ","As you can see on the bottom of the chart, these initiatives along with innovation have increased our margins almost 400 basis points over the last three years on very little revenue growth, while still making significant incremental investments in the business. Operating leverage has been 38%, 31%, and 73% respectively for the last three years. ","We started on pricing in early 2010 and have reaped benefit from better price realization and price management for the past two years. We looked back several years in history and couldn\u2019t find a year when we had done this. So it was a testament to the results we can produce when we focus on building a long-term, sustainable capability. ","This isn\u2019t just managing price lists; it\u2019s actually a fairly small component of what we\u2019ve built. It\u2019s centered on capabilities like pricing elasticity analysis, value pricing of offerings and discount management. ","As I\u2019ll discuss more when I come back to review guidance, we see a continuation of challenging markets in 2013. We plan to proactively address that backdrop, as well as prepare ourselves for our new cost structure, post spend, by taking restructuring actions during 2013, beginning in the first quarter. So I\u2019m proud of the progress we\u2019ve made, and I\u2019m certainly encouraged by the opportunities that lie ahead. ","And with that, Steve will now take you through the fourth quarter results. ","Steve Shawley","Thanks Mike. Please go to slide number six. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter, which exclude impairment were $0.76. That is $0.09 better than the midpoint of our guidance range. $0.03 came from better performance in operations. There was about $0.001 of cost incurred related to the spend that was not in the guidance, and the remainder was from a lower tax rate. ","We were pleased with our ability to navigate challenging market environments and to deliver above our earnings commitment. With solid operational execution in all of our businesses, margin increased 100 basis points despite flat revenues. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, operating margins were up in each of the sectors, with residential delivering an 800 basis point improvement, despite slightly lower revenues. ","Revenues were flat, both on a reported basis and excluding foreign exchange. Excluding FX, we saw a slight decline in the climate, and lower single digit growth in revenues and industrial. Residential revenues were down 5% year-over-year. Security Technologies revenues was up 7%, with Americas up high single digits. Excluding Hussmann, orders were up 1% and up 2% and excluding currency. ","Operating margin for the quarter was 10.6%, up 100 basis points versus prior year. Margins improved from pricing and productivity, partially offset by unfavorable mix and investment spending year-over-year. ","All of the businesses continued to realize positive pricing. In the fourth quarter, our price realization outpaced direct material inflation for the seventh consecutive quarter. We repurchased 10 million shares in the fourth quarter, bringing the total repurchased in the year to 18.4 million shares. To sum, our focus on operational excellence and innovation delivered excellent results in the quarter. ","Please go to slide number seven. Orders for the fourth quarter of 2012 were up 1% overall and up 2% excluding currency. Global commercial HVAC bookings were up mid-single digits. Transport orders were down low teens, with a double-digit decrease in truck trailer orders and significantly lower marine demand. ","Industrial orders, excluding currency were up 3%, with order growth in all regions and at Club Car. Residential bookings were down 5%. Commercial security orders in the quarter were up 16%, mainly impacted by the timing of large project orders in Asia. ","Please go to slide number eight. Here is a look at the revenue trends by segment and region. Note that the information on this slide excludes Hussmann from the comparisons. The top half of the chart shows the revenue change for each sector. For the total company, fourth quarter revenues excluding Hussmann were flat versus last year on a reported basis and excluding currency. ","Focusing on organic revenues, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange, climate revenues decreased 1%, with HVAC revenues flat and transport revenues down mid single digits. Industrial had moderating growth at 4%. Residential was down 5%. Commercial security revenues were up 7%. I\u2019ll give more color on each sector in a few slides. ","As you can see in the bottom chart, on a geographic basis organic revenues were up 1% in the Americas, while Europe was down mid-single digits, excluding currency. Asia was up 7%, led by double-digit increases in Industrial and Security. ","Please go to slide number nine. This chart walks through the change in operating margin from fourth quarter 2011 of 9.6% to fourth quarter 2012, which was 10.6%. This data excludes Hussmann for comparison purposes. ","Volume, negative mix and foreign exchange collectively created an 80 basis point headwind to margins. Our pricing programs continued to outpace material inflation, adding 110 basis points to margins. Productivity offset by other inflation was 140 basis points accretive to margins. Year-over-year investments and other items were higher by 70 basis points. ","In the gray box at the top of the page, you can see that revenue leverage was excellent in the quarter, with operating income increasing despite flat revenues. As the box in the middle of the page, the details, we delivered margin improvement at every sector, even with revenue declines in Climate and Residential. ","Please go to slide number 10. The Climate Solutions segment includes Trane commercial HVAC and ThermoKing transport refrigeration. Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.8 billion. Excluding Hussmann that is down 2% as reported, and down 1% excluding foreign exchange. ","Global commercial HVAC orders were up mid-single digits. Orders were up low single digits in the Americas. Orders were down slightly in Europe on a reported basis, and up slightly excluding foreign exchange. HVAC orders in Asia were up in mid teens, with China up over 20%. ","Trane\u2019s commercial HVAC fourth quarter revenues were flat. HVAC revenues in the Americas were up low single digits on a reported basis and excluding foreign exchange. Revenues in Europe and the Middle East were down mid single digits on both a reported basis and on excluding currency. Revenues in Asia were down low single digits. China HVAC revenues were down mid single digits in the quarter. ","Commercial HVAC equipment revenues were down low single digits. HVAC parts, services and solutions revenue was up low single digits versus prior year. ThermoKing orders were down in the low teens versus 2011\u2019s fourth quarter. ThermoKing revenues were down mid single digits, both on a reported basis and when excluding currency. ","Worldwide-refrigerated truck and trailer revenues were up low single digits. The operating margin for Climate Solutions was 10.3% in the quarter, a 10 basis point improvement versus fourth quarter of 2011, excluding Hussmann. ","Pricing and productivity more than offset inflation and higher spending on investment initiatives. We saw particularly strong operating leverage in North America HVAC, where new products and cost reduction efforts fueled margin expansion on very little volume growth. ","Please go to slide number 11. Industrial Technologies\u2019 fourth quarter revenues were $765 million, up 3% on a reported basis and up 4% excluding FX. Air and productivity revenues were up low single digits versus last year on a reported basis and excluding currency. ","Air compressor revenues were up mid single digits. Revenues in the Americas were up mid single digits. Growth in Asia was offset by declines in Europe. Air and productivity orders were up mid single digits on a reported basis and excluding FX. Orders were up in all regions. Club Car revenues in the quarter were up high single digits and orders were up low single digits versus the prior year. ","Industrial operating margin of 16.1% was up 80 basis points compared with last year, as higher revenues, pricing and productivity were partially offset by inflation and higher investment spending. Air and productivity margins exceeded 17%. ","Please go to slide number 12. In the residential business, fourth quarter revenues of $422 million were down 5% compared with last year on a reported basis and excluding foreign exchange. Residential HVAC revenues were down low single digits versus last year. ","Our HVAC unit shipments in the fourth quarter were flat versus the prior year. Last year in the fourth quarter, recall that we had significantly reduced our inventory levels. Adjusting last year\u2019s shipments for the impact of that inventory reduction, unit shipments were up high single digits. ","We were also the only major competitor that did not have a significant pricing increase effective in the fourth quarter of 2012, which tends to pull in shipments as distributors are trying to stock in advance of the increase. ","Since we had implemented a mid year increase in 2012, our latest increase was more targeted and went into effect during the first quarter of 2013 rather than the fourth quarter of 2012. Consistent with the trend of the first three quarters of the year for 2012, the \u201813 to \u201814 share of the market was higher than the prior year, as mix shifted to the low end of the efficiency range. ","Revenues for the Residential Security portion of the sector were down low teens, with increases in the new builder channel. South American volumes increases were more than offset by lower big box revenues. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we had a significant increase in big box from the load in of new security products. ","Sector operating margin of 6.9% was up 810 basis points compared with 2011, as pricing and productivity more than offset inflation and adverse mix. ","Please go to slide number 13. Revenues for Security Technologies were $445 million, up 7% on a reported basis and excluding currency. Americas revenues were up high single digits. Overseas revenues were up mid single digits, as higher revenues from projects in Asia more than offset volume declines in Europe. ","Global bookings were up 16% on a reported basis and excluding currency, buoyed by share gains in the U.S. and the timing of large projects in Asia. Bookings excluding currency in Europe were down slightly. Operating margin for the quarter was 20.6%, up 150 basis points from last year, as productivity and price realization offset inflation and higher investment spending. ","Please go to slide number 14. We continue to maintain our focus on working capital. We finished the fourth quarter with working capital at 2.8% of revenues, which is a one-point improvement from the end of the third quarter. We ended the year with a little more inventory than last year as we intentionally increased stocking levels in targeted areas. For example, we were stocking more engines for TK as they transition through the new tier 4 engine standards. ","With that, I will turn it back to Mike to take you through the guidance for 2013. ","Mike Lamach","Okay, thanks Steve, and let\u2019s go to slide 15. For purposes of setting guidance for 2013, it\u2019s on an as-is basis. It assumes that the current Ingersoll-Rand with the four current operating sectors is in place for the full 12 months of 2013. As we announced in December, we expect the Security spin to take place in the fourth quarter, but to be clear, the guidance does not reflect the spin, given we do not yet have carve-out financials and the specific date of the spin won\u2019t be known for several more months. ","Also, when we announced the spin in December we indicated one time deal costs and restructuring of $150 million to $250 million. We\u2019ve broken out that amount from the EPS guidance in order to give the best representation of the company, without the impact of the impending spin, and hopefully that\u2019s all clear. ","And to save you all a question, there is no change or update to the information we gave you in December on the spin. It\u2019s proceeding according to our timeline. We won\u2019t have pro forma financials for a few more months when we file the Form 10\u2019s. ","Finally, contrasting to 2012, when we had significant currency headwind for most of the year, based on current exchange rates, there\u2019s not much impact expected in 2013. The numbers I\u2019ll reference as revenue growth are the same with or without currency. ","With all that out of the way, our revenue outlook for 2013 is $14.2 billion to $14.6 billion, which equates to 1% to 4% growth versus 2012. I\u2019m going to talk through what we\u2019re seeing by geography, and then we\u2019ll sum it up again by sector.","Our outlook reflects activity in North American commercial HVAC, continuing at moderate growth rates. Industrial markets are growing, but at a slower place than what we\u2019ve seen over the past couple of years. We see continuing moderate growth in residential markets, albeit with choppy month-to-month trends continuing. ","We have seen some positive movement in replacement systems and in new home construction. For our Commercial Security, we expect to see a continuation of the challenging conditions in the U.S. non-residential new construction market for the next year, particularly in our key institutional markets. ","Given that the non-residential construction market impacts both our commercial HVAC and security businesses, I thought I\u2019d spend some time giving some more color on the outlook there and how it impacts our businesses. We typically look at a group of indicators, the main one being put in place in starts data, which we get quarterly from Dodge. Put-in-place, it\u2019s measured in dollars and starts data is measured in square footage. ","To understand the impact of our business, you need to look at the trends by key vertical markets. Although total put-in-place is forecasted to be flat for 2013, institutional, which is over half of the put-in-place dollars is forecasted to be down 5%, while commercial industrial activity is forecasted to be up 8%. ","Within institutional, our key end markets of education and medical are forecasted to be down high single digits, and while commercial industrial overall is expected to be up, the largest growth sectors are warehouses and parking garages, neither of which will use much security or HVAC. ","Starts data is similar in trend to the put-in-place data. The Architectural Billing Index or the ABI, can be a general leading indicator for us, and that\u2019s continued to be choppy, although the trend over the last several months is generally somewhat positive. ","A couple of other points to set the context. Recall that HVAC has a higher element of replacement than the security business. Security also tends to lag the trends more, given the timing of when it goes into the building construction, which is near the end of building sit out. ","For example, HVAC generally lags ABI by about six months, while security lags it by about 12 months. The mix of all that leads us to a market outlook for a low single digit growth in North American commercial HVAC, and flat to a low single digit decline in North American commercial security. ","Transitioning to refrigerated transport, we expect North American truck trailer markets to be fairly flat in 2013. Asian HVAC equipment markets are expected to be flat in 2013. China though is expected to be up low single digits overall. Industrial Technologies also expects low single digit growth in Asia in 2013, and that security business there in Asia, which is more influenced by the timing of large infrastructure projects, should be up mid to high single digits for the year. ","Revenues in Europe are expected to show some recovery in the majority of our markets, albeit from very low levels in 2013. The exception for that is ThermoKing. We expect truck, trailer and marine to decline low single digits in 2013. Overall, we expect revenues from Europe, Middle East and Africa, when taken together to be up slightly. So in summary we see fairly slow growth from most of the end markets. ","So translating that to our outlook by sector, we expect Climate Solutions revenues to be up 1% to 3%; industrial forecast to show more moderate growth than in the past couple years, but growth there will be about 2% to 4%; and residential is expected to be up 4% to 6%. Climate security technologies should be up in the range of 2% to 4%. ","Let\u2019s go to slide 16. On the basis I discussed earlier, our guidance for full-year EPS from continuing operations is $3.45 to $3.65. This excludes one time deal costs and restructuring of $0.40 to $0.60, and this bridge reconciles that guidance to 2012. ","Operations drive the majority of the earnings growth of $0.35 to $0.55, and includes a headwinds in pension and benefit costs. We benefit from a lower share count in 2013, given our capital deployment and share repurchase. Our forecast for the average share count for the year is 300 million shares, which reflects a buyback in the range of 900 million in the back half of 2013. ","The full-year tax rate forecast for 2013 is expected to be 23%, versus an 18% rate in 2012, which causes a $0.22 drag on earnings. Incremental investments are $0.20 for the full year. The largest investments are for product development, the majority of which is in climate, and for the implementation of common systems. ","And finally to get it back to an apples-to-apples basis for treatment of restructuring and one time costs, need to add back $0.11 restructuring that we had in 2012, and that would bring you to the range of $3.45 to $3.65. ","Please go to slide 17. I\u2019ve already taken you through the full year, so to focus on first-quarter guidance, refer to the right hand column of this chart. First quarter 2013 revenues are forecast to be $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion, and that translates to a range of down 2% to up 2% versus the first quarter of last year. This reflects our view that based on backlog and order outlook, growth will start out sluggish and improve throughout the year. That\u2019s particularly the case in Europe and in ThermoKing, which both starts the year down year-over-year.","Adjusted first quarter earnings per share are forecasted to be $0.35 to $0.40. Security spin-off and restructure costs and potential non-U.S. discreet tax charges are expected to be about $0.20 in the quarter. We\u2019re assuming a share count of 302 million shares and an ongoing tax rate of 25%, which excludes the potential discreet that I just mentioned. ","There\u2019s the first quarter EPS bridge in the appendix to help you for reference. For the full year 2013 we expect to generate available cash flow of about $1.1 billion, excluding one time in restructuring costs. ","Please go to slide 18. We\u2019re pleased to have delivered a solid fourth quarter. We had tremendous, in fact infinite operational leverage in the quarter and margin gains in all sectors. We continue to feel good about our company, our focus on positioning the company to continue to grow earnings and cash flow, with very little help from markets. ","We have a multi-year record of delivering high operating leverage and margin improvement, and we\u2019ve implemented a consistent shareholder focus to capital allocation program. We proactively work to reduce costs and improve productivity, while still making prudent investments for the future. ","Our investments are yielding a strong pipeline of new product and service offerings, as was evident at this week\u2019s AHR Expo, which several of you attended. We are accelerating restructuring activity to prepare the cost structure for two, strong, stand alone companies. ","2013 will represent another step forward in the progression of the company\u2019s innovation and operating capabilities, as we improve margins, execute the security spin and continue to advance our core growth initiatives, and I want to assure you that we\u2019re up for all those challenges. ","I am proud of the progress we\u2019ve made, results we\u2019ve delivered and the opportunities that lie ahead for us. ","And with that, Steve and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Thank you. Good morning everyone. ","Steve Shawley","Hey Jeff.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Could you give a little more color on the cash side? You said available cash $1.1 billion. Do you have an early idea of what the cash requirements are on the restructuring and spin costs in 2013 and any other one-offs that may actually tap into available cash? ","Steve Shawley","Yes Jeff, we talked about this in December. We talked about a refinancing we\u2019re planning in the middle of the year. We\u2019re planning on refinancing the Z-tranche that\u2019s due, I think it\u2019s in August, and probably another $300 million on top of that to take care of the cash associated with the spin costs, restructuring, etcetera. So what that will do is that will free up most of the $1.1 billion to go towards the share repurchase throughout the year. ","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Right, and just totally shifting gears. On Europe the notion that it gets better over the course of 2013 if only modestly, is that predicated on some early indication on orders somewhere? Is it more just kind of the low operating level that you\u2019re seeing across Europe and some expectation that there\u2019s just some underlying bounce that ought to occur? ","Steve Shawley","Yes, for us Jeff, you\u2019ve got to look at Western Europe, Eastern Europe and the Middle East. So when we look at that collectively, we\u2019re really saying the Middle East will be up again mid-single digits, maybe a little bit better. Eastern Europe, Europe up maybe a little bit less than that and still a fairly weak Western Europe. ","So net-net we\u2019re not expecting great things out of Europe, but we do think coming off the lows that we saw, we should see just a little bit of latter year growth, and that\u2019s supported with what we\u2019re hearing from long term customers. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Shannon O\u2019Callaghan from Nomura. Your line is open.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan \u2013 Nomura","Good morning guys."," ","Steve Shawley","Hey Shannon.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura","Hey, can you just talk about corporate cost a little bit; one, in terms of just the \u201813 costs of the ongoing entity. And then in terms of this accelerated restructuring you\u2019re doing, are you going to be able to keep it at that level post spin? Is that some of the aim here, instead of absorbing kind of incremental public company costs for the two companies? ","Steve Shawley","Let me just address the numbers question first Shannon. In 2013 we expect the corporate unallocated costs to be somewhere in the $180 million range, about $45 million a quarter, and don\u2019t forget, we\u2019re making heavy investments in common systems throughout all of this. If we really ramp that up this year \u2013 in fact, some of the story about corporate costs in Q4 was common systems related, so that\u2019s a big piece of the increase in 2013. ","We also are seeing an up-tick in pension and benefit costs, and we have some technology costs falling out, associated with the technology centers that are managed by Paul Camuti here in the corporate center. That\u2019s what really seized up the increase in 2013, and like Mike said, we\u2019ve pulled all the deal costs out of 2013. So that increase is not really deal cost related. ","I think if you look at the glide path of corporate costs going into the future, some of the restructuring obviously is going to have the impact corporate overheads. Also, you look at the common system spend sort of tapering down through 2015 and \u201816, I would say we\u2019d hit likely the peak of the spend for systems in late \u201814, early \u201815. So you\u2019ll see that start to come down with the abatement of the systems projects unit. ","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura","Okay, so I guess with that kind of peaking out and some of the restructuring savings, I mean, do you think the combined corporate costs of the two future entities can equate to this $180 million you\u2019re talking about for \u201813 or you think it goes higher because of additional public company costs for two companies? ","Steve Shawley","Well, we\u2019re working on the stranded costs here. This is part of what we\u2019re doing with restructuring that we\u2019re talking about for quarter one and going forward. So we are dealing with that now, but clearly there\u2019s going to be additional public company costs for new securities out in the marketplace. ","So I mean just for right now the placeholder is $180 million for the year, and we\u2019ll update you going forward as to how much of the stranded costs will be addressed and with the standalone cost with security, once we filed the Form 10\u2019s. ","Mike Lamach","Longer-term Shannon, we would target $180 million to be the summation of the two standalone companies, but that\u2019s going to go through a little bit of a peaking here in \u201814 and \u201815, because of the systems projects, and probably ramp back down to that normalized level after we get through that. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Sullivan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets","Hi, good morning.","Mike Lamach","Hi Jamie.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets","Wondered if you could talk about, you mentioned the end markets within non-res construction that were important, that was helpful. I wonder if you could talk about kind of the exposure in climate and security by those key commercial industrial and institutional end markets, if you have those figures? ","Mike Lamach","I can. I mean I\u2019ve got the data here for the put-in-place, institutional versus industrial. You\u2019re asking specifically how do we factor into play into those things. ","This gets a little bit back into my comment about being selective around growth markets and platforms, and going where the business is growing, as opposed to sort of maybe what the historical mix has been. So the investments that we\u2019ve made in the unitary product have been really targeted toward the growth we\u2019ll see in the commercial and office space, as an example. ","So we got on that faster, looking at this data from a longer-term perspective, understanding there would be an opportunity in that market, as opposed to addressing markets that just weren\u2019t going to grow, and so these pockets of growth are a lot more important to us than where the exposure has been historically. We see still great growth in data centers, which is another market that we are looking to address with more and more content as we approach those markets specifically. ","So not to evade your question. We have historically been a bit more institutional tipped than commercially tipped, but we are working that really to where the markets are growing and security is a great example of that. They put in place a very, very effective program to get after a particular market niche where we weren\u2019t really penetrating, put a very specific set of programs together to address a channel need, and drove tremendous success in North America in the security business in the fourth quarter. ","So it is possible in over a two, three quarter period of time to move ourselves into these pockets and address them a little bit differently. ","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets","That\u2019s helpful color. And then just maybe on the margin front, if you could walk sort of us through by segment how you\u2019re viewing some of the trends in \u201813 versus \u201812 by segment. ","Mike Lamach","Yes. I think to do that, to have it be apples and apples, we would pull restructuring out of both sides, right? So we pulled restructuring out of 2013, we pulled it out of 2012. So I\u2019d kind of give you those numbers ex-restructuring, both just to help you apples to apples. ","But climate, in spite of the TK softness, we\u2019ll probably see 40 to 60 basis points of margin improvements there; industrial, I may see 50 to 70 there; res, we\u2019re looking for more like 125 to 175. We think there\u2019s still great opportunity there to do something more dramatic. ","In security, they\u2019re just going to do a great job executing where they are at. They\u2019re going to be fairly flattish, depending on the mix, which could go more towards Asian markets or a slight recovery in Europe. You might see it down as much as 40 basis points, but it will continue to be just an exceptional margin earner for the company. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Stephen Volkmann \u2013 Jefferies","Hey. Good morning. Mike, since you mentioned the HR show, it seemed like the tone down there was quite a bit more positive than the numbers you\u2019re giving us, and granted sales guys on an expense account are always positive, but I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019re being somewhat more conservative there? If you see maybe some other mix we should think about or pricing issues or anything that would add to that? ","Mike Lamach","No, I think you hit it on the head. You put the sales and salespeople together at an event and it\u2019s pretty exuberant. So it\u2019s not going to be a horrible market, no doubt about that, but we just go back to the data, look at the put-in-place numbers, look at it by segment of the institutional, by segment of commercial industrial and then compare that to where we\u2019ve got specification activity, where we\u2019ve got quotes outstanding; what the ABI are saying, and then lag that and you just end up where we\u2019re at. ","So I think we were pretty close this past year. I think we\u2019ve got a good methodology in that business for doing fairly accurate forecasts there. So I just see it overall as being sort of a low moderate growth market for us. ","Stephen Volkmann - Jefferies","Okay. ","Mike Lamach","Service will probably grow twice as fast, but that\u2019s been history, and we\u2019ll continue to grow service and invest in that footprint to help offset some of that cyclicality. ","Stephen Volkmann - Jefferies","Great, that\u2019s helpful. And any color you want to give on January in that or any of the other businesses? I mean, the thesis that it\u2019s safe now that the fiscal cliff is gone, are you seeing any of those types of trends? ","Mike Lamach","I have to say I want to give no guidance on January, okay? So to answer your question, no, I\u2019d want to just talk about the month. So glad we\u2019re through the fiscal cliff and we\u2019ll see what happens with round two in Congress, and I think our forecast reflects a bit more of the status quo. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from MKM Partners. Your line is open.","Josh Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners","Hi, good morning guys. ","Mike Lamach","Hi Josh.","Josh Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners","Just to dig in here on res D, I know you said you had the inventory liquidation last year, but it still seems like the comp was fairly easy. You under performed the market in 4Q \u201811 by, call it 600 basis points. Did you feel like going into next year? That you\u2019re on pace to meet or exceed where the market falls out, and that maybe some of those mix issues are well and truly behind you versus peers?","Mike Lamach","Yes, Josh. We had a very good 2012 collectively. So quarter-to-quarter you get these aberrations, but 2012 res, shares, volumes, margin improvements, just health of the product portfolio, talent in the business, it\u2019s been a very good year for us. ","Let me talk to you about the quarter specifically, because there\u2019s a lot of nuance here that went on in the quarter. So on the call, I mentioned we were down low-single digits versus last year. Now shipments would have been flat, obviously because the mix changed for us. ","When you add back sort of the change in inventory levels, and the fact that we were really pushing $90 million of inventory out through last year, and mostly 410-A, you end up with a high single digit market for us. ","I think Steve mentioned we were the only guys that didn\u2019t have a fourth quarter price increase in pulling shipments in, and we know of one large OEM that had that effect that you had to actually ship before November, over concerns of a factory closure are one of the larger factories closing. So there was a lot there, but between pricing, competitively pulling it into the year, and then our own reconciliation, you have to do between \u201811 and \u201812. ","What I will tell you, and that\u2019s probably the way to keep sanity in this, is that we\u2019re about 50-50 owned versus independent distribution. So our shipments in revenue reflects final sell through on the owned side versus a couple of other OEMs who are 100% independent going through wholesale. ","When you compare that to the Hardy Data, the sell-through for quarter four by month was up 11.6% in October. It moderated to 6% in November. It was actually down, it was negative 1.8% in December, and all that gave you a 5.7% sell-through for the quarter, right? So if I look at the 5.7% sell-through for the quarter, and look at us apples-to-apples being up single digits, and the fact that Hardy\u2019s indicator level for inventories was up, okay in the quarter, I feel pretty good about that and think we are really well-positioned coming into 2013. ","So Josh, I feel good about it and unfortunately I got to give you a little bit of bridge here to explain it, but I think it\u2019s something that clearly you can piece together on your own. ","Josh Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners","That\u2019s very helpful, thank you. And just one last one on price. You walked through it a little bit in the prepared comments, but clearly you guys have done a great job on the pricing side, you know in excess of inflation. ","How should we think about that into 2013, kind of versus any thoughts you have on the material inflation side and then obviously some of these commercial markets start to pick up. I would imagine your pricing power moves with that. What kind of tailwind are you thinking for 2013 in your leasing guidance? ","Mike Lamach","Yes, the material inflation environment has been fairly sedate, and we\u2019ve lapped most of our large price increases, so we think pricing this year will be under 1%. Probably a good number, something more like 75, 80 basis points for \u201813, and we\u2019ll still have a positive gap to material inflation, but I think it would be close to the probably 30 or 40 basis points for the year. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Hey, good morning guys. Just on the -- within your 1% to 4% growth, I think you said ThermoKing down low single digits. Can you parse out how you\u2019re thinking about growth in commercial quad versus commercial unitary versus parts and service? ","Mike Lamach","Yes, some of that\u2026 ","Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Or at least directionally. ","Mike Lamach","Yes. Applied in unitary, there is some shifts going on with applied in unitary in the marketplace. We\u2019re seeing in some cases more unitary being used in some of the data center applications, which is a good thing for us, because it\u2019s large unitary and that\u2019s very profitable for us. ","So we generally see applied being a little bit weaker in 2013. I would say slightly negative, because it would still lean more toward the institutional larger customers, and I would say unitary is still more following the commercial industrial Dodge data of being more positive. So with slight shifts going on within vertical markets, you\u2019re seeing more unitary than applied. ","And then specifically in the HVAC business in North America, we\u2019re dealing with low equipment growth. You probably see service growth 5% to 1% kind of pulling the mix up there, and that\u2019s something that has been a function of putting feet on the street, putting technicians out, doing training and really working the whole part service agreement and retrofit market, and we were able to do that last year even in spite of the flatter market. So I hope that\u2019s helpful. ","Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay, and then just on Security, I think we\u2019re seen 14, 15 quarters of flat to down. So it was a surprise to see it inflect up, and I\u2019m just wondering, I know you mentioned some of the large orders are in Asia, but any kind of aberrations in that growth number or any kind of inflections you\u2019re seeing that would suggest some growth there? ","Mike Lamach","Well, the one that we had talked to you about for probably a couple of quarters was the large infrastructure projects that we were waiting on in Asia, kind of getting through the political changing of the guard in China, and then finally the awards of those projects, and what we saw clearly in China in the quarter was very, very positive in that regard. I think revenue was up nearly 40% in China for the quarter, so that was helpful.","But you know the other positive story for us was just what happened with the security business in the Americas, and it got back to the earlier question of teams doing a good job finding pockets of growth, I mean growth platforms in flat markets. We needed to do more of that, but that\u2019s a great example and one I\u2019m proud to tell you about. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Thanks a lot. Just on the productivity, other inflation line in your EBIT margin bridge, that\u2019s been running now for three quarters in a row at sort of 100 bips plus in terms of the year-on-year margin effect. Is that a run rate you think that you can continue through \u201813 as you bring on these extra value streams? ","Mike Lamach","Yes Julian, look, clearly we set the targets out there. We think that we\u2019re going to see mild material inflation. We\u2019re going to see other inflation continue to rise at sort of an unhealthy rate. So you\u2019re looking at overall inflation running somewhere in the mid-3\u2019s and you\u2019re looking at our productivity plans somewhere in the mid-4\u2019s. ","I told you the four levers that we\u2019re pulling here are sourcing, functional, lien and lien the value streams and all of that really kind of coming together is our plan to address it. So we continue to sort of chip away at it, build a pipeline and work the pipelines here. ","So I would have no reason to believe we couldn\u2019t continue to see productivity at the same level. As long as we see inflation stay where it\u2019s at, I think we\u2019re going to be fine. If we see higher inflation, that\u2019s going to test our pricing capability and see how agile we are there. So net-net, there\u2019s no reason to believe we shouldn\u2019t be able to do that. ","Steve Shawley","And Julian, the \u201813 guidance includes a positive gap between productivity and other inflation. It\u2019s not quite as big as what we achieved in 2012, simply because the pricing is a little heavier, things like employee benefit costs, healthcare costs affecting that line, so a little bit of a contraction, but still a very positive gap. ","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Got it, thanks. And then on this resi HVAC issue, I mean are you effectively saying that in Q1 you\u2019ll be able to deliver positive growth year-on-year in resi HVAC? ","Steve Shawley","Yes. Yes. ","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Okay, thanks. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Deane Dray from Citi Research. Your line is opened.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","Thank you and good morning everyone. Hey, just a quick question and clarification on the guidance. On just the idea, where might there be some discretionary spending, where if you needed to you could pull back or if you added to it? So maybe on the investment side, and is there anything that you could throttle either way? ","Mike Lamach","Yes, Deane, in the quarter there was the locked and loaded with the exception of nailing down and communicating all the specifics around restructuring activity, but in terms of investments and plans for the quarter we\u2019re in good shape. ","For the year it\u2019s running at about the same rate of increase it was last year for us and those programs have been paired to the point where these are the critical and essential programs going forward. So I don\u2019t see that we would be pulling back on investments per se. I think if we were to run into additional headwinds, we would take a second or third look at the restructuring work we\u2019re doing and go further there, but no pullback, really that I see as being good long term on the investment lines. ","Deane Dray - Citi Research","Great. And then a follow-up question for Steve on tax rate in the quarter. It came in lighter than what we were looking for. Just kind of what are the dynamics there and are there any other dynamics on the 2013 tax guide? ","Steve Shawley","Fourth quarter tax accounting is always an adventure Deane. If you look at last year, a huge positive adjustments or favorable adjustments in our NOLs got valued in Q4. That goes on every year-end. ","So if I look at the fourth quarter tax rate, we were a little bit favorable on the ongoing rate. The distribution of income was kind of in our favor. So if I look at the $0.06 or $0.07 delta there, it\u2019s about half associated with a slightly favorable rate for the year, and the rest of it is the fact that we had the chance to value some NOLs around the world. Much less of a pickup than we got last year when we did that, but it\u2019s just something that happens every quarter, and it adds potentially a lot of volatility to the tax rate. ","All-in-all, I\u2019m very pleased with how that fell out. It was definitely within our parameters or expectation of the ongoing rate and we just picked up a few favorable pinnings from the NOL valuations. ","Mike Lamach","Yes, Deane, I mean the only thing that\u2019s a little bit of a wild card and we tried to spike that out for you, is U.S. non-discrete tax charge in quarter one. Whether or not, we\u2019ll owe that or not, its a bit of a legal debate and then two timing events, a bit of a timing debate. So we just spiked that out not to surprise anybody that the timing in the worst of all worlds could be in the first quarter, and that\u2019s how we planned it. ","Steve Shawley","So if you look at the rate going from \u201812 to \u201813 Deane, it\u2019s really based on the earnings, the increase of earnings in the U.S. primarily, it\u2019s going to cause a pickup in the rate. So that\u2019s kind of the ins and outs of that. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Winoker from Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Thanks and good morning. Just trying to understand the bridge on page 21 for 1Q and the sort of seasonality on them. You gave us margin expansion for the year by segment. What\u2019s the overall expectation for 1Q for margin expansion, and I guess the next follow-up on that is, does it differ materially from your annuals by segment? ","Mike Lamach","Well look, first of all Steve, what\u2019s underlying, all of this is going to be the weaker ThermoKing across the board picking up by the back of the year, but that\u2019s going to be one issue we have from a business standpoint in the first quarter. ","And then if you look at it sort of by geography, Europe happens to be very weak for us in the industrial segment, which creates a mix issue there. Because actually industrial is a profitable business for us in Europe, and so a combination of those two are putting some pressure on all that, so\u2026 ","But that being said, we still see margin expansion of probably 20 to, call it 50 basis points in the quarter. ","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, and then since we\u2019re not getting a March analyst meeting, just one sort of longer-term question. On the value stream points though, I guess you took it up by about 16%, recovering your cost base by 16% now from 2012 to 2013. So you\u2019re covering 40% of the cost base. And as you think about these value streams, I get a lot of investors asking, is it getting easier or getting harder as you pick up the new ones and as you look out into the ones to go from here. ","Mike Lamach","Well, I\u2019ll tell you, easy and hard is an interesting thing. If you talk about it getting more exciting, getting more momentum in the company, getting more people pulling on it, it\u2019s phenomenal, okay. ","So, I\u2019m not sure about hard or easy, none of this is easy, okay, and particularly if you want to stick around longer than just a flash in the pan, but the impact has been dramatic, and every time we run the data, we call it separation of results. We take the value stream work and then compare that to the average of the company and we just get further and further apart. Thankfully, we\u2019re also increasing the amount of costs under sort of management through the system. ","So, its very exciting Steve. It\u2019s something that looking back over three years, it\u2019s been a long haul and anybody that\u2019s in the lien world will tell you that that\u2019s still the early innings. So it\u2019s something that if I\u2019m doing this 10 years from now, it certainly would be something we\u2019re talking about. ","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is open. ","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","Hey, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. ","Mike Lamach","Hey Steve.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Just on the resi stuff, I\u2019m not sure I quite understand, what\u2019s the adjustment you\u2019re making for the inventory reduction? I mean because your comp was still pretty negative from a sales perspective, whether that was just going through your wholesale, your own distribution or not. So I\u2019m just down 5 on the down 20. I don\u2019t quite understand the kind of inventory adjustment you\u2019re making there. ","Mike Lamach","The $90 million inventory Steve that we had last year in the fourth quarter of \u201811, when you think about sort of what we had to do there, we had to pull that back from distribution. In some cases where there was a sale, we worked the product, and then try to push it back out in the marketplace through any channel we could, often through our wholly owned channel. ","So we fundamentally pushed the $90 million inventory out in the marketplace that wasn\u2019t necessarily inventory the market wanted if you will. So, we look at it and say, if you adjust for sort of $90 million in revenue, that probably was something we forced. Meaning 2011 was probably worse than the revenue we reported. That\u2019s where the adjustment comes in. ","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. So I mean, it just looked like that 2011 was. I thought 2011 was more dynamic around you just basically shut your plants down, because I mean it was still a pretty weak. Fundamentally that quarter was even, \u201811 was even weaker than that? ","Mike Lamach","Absolutely Steve, and if you look at just harkening back to that, I think we ran our plants 21 days the entire quarter, okay. So we took it really on the chin from absorption and all that, but it was fundamentally pushing this $90 million through. ","So absolutely, we were forcing product into the marketplace with record low pricing, getting into the market, which affected -- actually it lifted the revenue for 2011. However, it also had an average impact on absorption, because we weren\u2019t making anything. So the productivity was a pretty easy beat too, right, this year. ","Operator","Thank you.

As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Janet Pfeffer, Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relations. Ma\u2019am, you may begin.","Janet Pfeffer","Thank you, Mary. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Ingersoll-Rand third quarter 2012 conference call. We released earnings this morning at 7 a.m. and the release is posted on our website. We will be broadcasting, in addition to this call, through our website at ingersollrand.com, and that is where you will also find the slide presentation that we will be using this morning.","If you would please go to slide two. Statements made in today\u2019s call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Securities Law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of those factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated. This release also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release.","Now I\u2019d like to go ahead and introduce the participants on this morning\u2019s call. Michael Lamach, Chairman and CEO; Steve Shawley, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Joe Fimbianti, Director of Investor Relations.","With that, all please go to slide three and I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike.","Michael W. Lamach","Thanks, Janet. Good morning and thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call. Earnings per share from continuing operations for the third quarter were $1.07. That\u2019s $0.09 better than the midpoint of our guidance range from July. About half the beat came from operations and the remainder was from other income. Versus our prior guidance, revenues were slightly below the low end of our revenue guidance range.","We are pleased with our ability to navigate a challenging market environment and to deliver above our earnings commitment with solid operational execution in all the businesses. Margin increased to 110 basis points despite a slight year-over-year decline in revenues on a reported basis. Versus last years third quarter, operating margins were up in each of the sectors.","Markets were somewhat softer, somewhat lower our outlook, particularly in China, which continues to show slower than expected growth. We also saw a slowing in international industrial markets.","Foreign exchange negatively impacted revenues by 2%. Revenues including foreign exchange were up 1%; excluding FX we saw a moderate growth in revenues in industrial and single-digit declines in Climate and Security. Residential revenues were up 11% year-over-year. Excluding Hussmann, orders were down 1%, but up 2% excluding currency.","Operating margin for the quarter was 12.5%, up 110 basis points versus prior-year. Margins improved for pricing and productivity, partially offset by unfavorable mix, currency and investment spending year-over-year. Steve will give you more details in a few minutes, but to highlight a few areas residential delivered 430 basis points of margin improvement and gain share on the quarter.","Industrial improved margins are 140 basis points and 1% revenue growth. Climate increased margins a 100 basis points on a comparable basis in the face of a challenging mix between Trane and Thermo King. And finally Security delivered 20 basis points of margin improvement despite continuing soft markets.","All businesses continue to realize positive pricing, and in the third quarter our price realization outpaced direct material inflation for the sixth consecutive quarter. Our focus on operational excellence and innovation delivered excellent results in the quarter, and enabled us to effectively navigate global market conditions.","I\u2019m very encouraged by execution performance in the face of generally slowing market conditions, which we expect to continue to present challenges in the last quarter of the year.","Now Steve will take you through the quarterly results in more detail.","Steven R. Shawley","Thanks, Mike. Please go to slide number 4. Orders for the third quarter 2012 were down 1% overall and up 2% excluding currency. Global commercial HVAC bookings were up slightly. Transport orders were flat with double-digit increase in North America offset by soft European truck and trailer orders and lower marine demand. Industrial orders excluding currency were up 2% with order growth in the Americas and Club Car, partially offset by weakness in euro.","Residential bookings were down 1%. Commercial Security orders in the quarter were down 3% excluding currency, mainly impacted by the timing of large project orders in Asia as well as slower activity in Europe.","Please go to slide 5. Here is a look at the revenue trends by segment and region. Note that the Climate information on this slide excludes Hussmann from the comparisons. The top half of the chart shows the third quarter revenue change for each sector. For the total company third quarter revenues excluding Hussmann were down 1% on a reported basis versus last year and were up 1% excluding currency.","Focusing on organic revenues, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange, Climate revenues decreased 1% with an offset \u2013 with an increase in North American transport revenues, more than offset by declines in Europe and Asian transport revenues. Global HVAC revenues were flat excluding currency. Industrial had moderating growth at 4%. Residential was up 11% and Commercial Security revenues were down 4%.","I will give you more color on each sector in the few slides. As you can see on the bottom of the chart, on the geographic basis organic revenues were up 4% in the Americas while Europe and Asia were both down in the quarter, mid-single digits excluding currency.","Please go to slide number 6. This chart walks through the change in operating margin from third quarter 2011 of 11.4% to third quarter 2012, which was 12.5%. This data excludes Hussmann for comparison purposes. Volume, negative mix, and foreign exchange collectively created 120 basis point headwind to margins. Our pricing programs continued to outpace material inflation, adding 150 basis points to margin, productivity offset by other inflation was a 110 basis points accretive to margins.","Year-over-year investments and other items were higher by 30 basis points. And the grey box at the top of the page you will see that revenue leverage was excellent in the quarter with operating income increasing despite a decline in revenues. As the box in the middle of the page details, we saw margin improvement at every sector even with revenue declines in climate and security.","Please go to slide number 7. The Climate Solutions segment includes Trane commercial HVAC and Thermo King transport refrigeration. Total revenues for the third quarter were $1.9 billion excluding Hussmann that is down 3% as reported and down 1% excluding foreign exchange.","Global Commercial HVAC orders were up 1% as reported and 2% excluding FX. Orders were down slightly in the Americas and up low teens in Europe, but were down in Asia. Trane\u2019s commercial HVAC third quarter revenues were down 2% and flat when excluding currency. HVAC revenues in North America and Latin America were down slightly on a reported basis and up slightly excluding foreign exchange.","Revenues in Europe and the Middle East were down mid teens on a reported basis and down low teens when excluding currency. Revenues in Asia were up slightly. Commercial HVAC equipment revenues were down mid-single digits. HVAC parts, services and solutions revenues were up mid-single digits versus prior-year.","Thermo King orders were flat versus last years third quarter. Revenues were also down high-single digits, down low-single digits when excluding currency. Worldwide refrigerated truck and trailer revenues were down low-single digits with an increase in North America more than offset by declining volume and currency in Europe. The Marine Container business was down significantly versus last year.","The operating margin for Climate Solutions was 12.7% in the quarter, a 100 basis point improvement versus third quarter 2011, excluding Hussmann, pricing and productivity more than offset inflation and higher restructuring and spending on investment initiatives.","Please go to slide number 8. Industrial Technologies third quarter revenues were $702 million, up 1% on a reported basis and up 4% excluding FX. Air and productivity revenues were down slightly versus last year on a reported basis and were up mid-single digits excluding currency.","Revenue in the U.S. was up high-single digits, international revenues were down mid-single digits on a reported basis and flat excluding currency. Air and productivity orders were down mid-single digits on a reported basis and flat excluding currency.","Club Car revenues in the quarter were up mid-single digits and orders were up low teens versus prior-year. Industrial operating margin was 15.2%, was up 140 basis points compared with last year as higher revenues, pricing and productivity were offset by inflation and higher investment spending.","Please go to slide number 9. In the residential business third quarter revenues of $559 million, were up 11% compared with last year on both a reported basis and excluding foreign exchange.","Our residential HVAC revenues were up low teens versus last year. Our HVAC unit shipments in the third quarter were up mid teens, while market unit shipments were up mid-single digits. AHRI industry data show that market unit shipments in September were down nearly 10% versus last year. For the first nine months of 2012, the 13, 14 SEER segment of the market was higher than prior year as mix continues to shift to the low end of the efficiency range. This further validates our strategy to add products to address the lower SEER range more effectively.","With the new products introduced in the past year, our market share in the 13, 14 SEER range has now recovered back to our share from 2010. We continue to see the market mix move towards 410A systems. Although R-22 units remained a significant portion of the unitary market, we now believe the R-22 market unit shipments will be down about 20% for the year.","Revenues for the residential security portion of the sector were up low teens with increases in the new builder channel, Big Box and South American customer volumes. Sector operating margin of 8.1% was up 430 basis points compared with 2011 as pricing and productivity more than offset inflation and adverse mix.","Please go to slide number 10. Revenues for Security Technologies were $391 million, down 7% on a reported basis and down 4% excluding currency. Americas\u2019 revenues were down low single digits. Overseas revenues were down mid-single digits excluding currency. Global bookings were down 6%, 3% excluding FX impacted by slow activity in the U.S. and Europe and the timing of large projects in Asia.","Operating margin for the quarter was 21.5%, up 20 basis points from last year, as productivity and price realization offset unfavorable revenue mix, higher investment spending and inflation.","Please go to slide number 11. We continue to maintain our focus on working capital. We finished the third quarter with working capital of 3.9% of revenues, similar to our levels in the third quarter of 2011.","Slide number 12 please. We resumed our share repurchase in June. We repurchased about 7.6 million shares in the third quarter and had purchased 10.8 million shares year-to-date through yesterday. We still expect to spend approximately $840 million on share repurchases this year.","With that, I will turn it back to Mike to take you through the forecast.","Michael W. Lamach","Okay. Thanks, Steve. And please go to slide 13. Our revenue outlook for 2012 is $13.95 billion to $14.05 billion, about a $100 million lower at the midpoint versus our prior guidance due to softer markets in Asia and Europe, partially offset by somewhat stronger euro.","Asia, specifically China, has been softer than our prior forecast. Although we still expect Asia to be up for the year, we had trimmed our revenue growth expectations for the region by about 5 percentage points from the mid-single to low-single digits. We believe China bottomed in Q3, but given the current customer request dates for many of our products there namely large chillers and air compressors; we won\u2019t see a rebound in revenues until next year.","Revenues in Europe were somewhat below our expectations, including some favorability from currency. We continue to see good growth in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, which has been helping to offset the softness in Western Europe. Overall, we still expect revenues from Europe, the Middle East and Africa taken together to be down in the low teens for the year including currency impact.","Activity in the U.S. continues at moderate growth rates in commercial HVAC and industrial. Refrigerated transport markets are expected to have moderate year-over-year growth in North America and to decline in Western Europe. We see continuing moderate uneven growth in residential markets. We have seen some positive movement in replacement systems.","For commercial security, we expect to see a continuation of challenging conditions in the U.S. non-residential new construction market for next year, particularly in our key institutional markets. Although euro has strengthened since our July forecast, foreign exchange will continue to be a headwind in 2012 adversely impacting the revenue growth by about two points. In total, we expect the annual revenue to be flat to up 1%, compared with 2011 revenue of $14 billion, excluding Hussmann. Excluding foreign exchange, the expected organic growth rate is 2% to 3%.","Please go to slide 14. We are nearing our guidance for full-year EPS from continuing operations to a range of $3.17 to $3.23 per share. It\u2019s unchanged at the midpoint from our July guidance. Our forecast for the average share account for the year is also unchanged to 311 million shares and the full-year tax rate forecast remains at 19%. We expect to generate available cash flow of about $1 billion.","Fourth quarter revenues are forecast to be $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion. Revenues on a comparable basis excluding Hussmann are forecasted to be down 2%, up 1% versus the fourth quarter of last year. That includes FX, which will be a headwind of about one point, and that means including foreign exchange, revenues will be down 1% to up 2%.","Fourth quarter earnings per share are forecast to be $0.64 to $0.70. We are assuming a share count of 306 million shares and a tax rate of 29%, both of which are the same as we guided in July for the fourth quarter.","Please go to slide 15. We are pleased to have delivered a solid third quarter. We had strong overall operational leverage and margin gains in all sectors. For the balance of 2012, we see mixed demand patterns with slowing growth in North America, declining markets in Europe and slow growth in Asia. Currency translation, adverse revenue mix and incremental investments will continue to impact our fourth quarter results. However, this will be more than compensated for by the ongoing benefits from price realization, productivity and lower inflation.","We\u2019re focused on continued change and improvements to ensure that we\u2019re managing our business optimally across the spectrum of economic conditions. Our focus is on positioning our company to continue to grow earnings and cash flow with very little help or possibly no help from markets.","We continue to feel good about our Company and our progress. We have a portfolio of outstanding market-leading brands. The longer term attractiveness of the end markets in which we operate and our competitive positioning, will allow us to befit of those sectors if the economy improve. Our management team is committed and it\u2019s actively managing the company to generate sustainable, profitable growth.","We had continued to invest in innovation and to introduce new products across the enterprise. For example, in August Thermo King launched the Precedent platform to address new Tier IV regulations for engine emissions. Precedent which is available across a range of options to suit specific customer needs, set a new industry standard in both fuel efficiency and emissions control, by delivering double-digit fuel savings, best in class performance and lower life cycle cost.","Initial customer reactions have been very favorable. And overall we\u2019re on track this year to achieve our goal of delivering 25% of revenue with products introduced in the past three years. Our operating philosophy has been to not wait for a macroeconomic lift to improve our businesses. We\u2019ve proactively work to reduce cost and improve productivity, while still making prudent investments for the future.","With the start of the year, we expected flat and slow growth in our markets and we built our plans to that environment. That\u2019s proven to be the correct call for this year enabling us to deliver double-digit EPS growth with essentially flat revenue. I\u2019m proud of the focus our team has maintained and results we\u2019ve delivered, even in the midst of choppy markets and uncertain macroeconomic currents.","Now, Steve and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Thanks a lot. Good morning.","Michael W. Lamach","Hey Nigel.","Steven R. Shawley","Hi, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Just Mike you made an interesting comment that you\u2019re confident that China bottomed last quarter, in 3Q. What give you that confidence?","Michael W. Lamach","Yeah Nigel, we actually saw a progression from Q1, Q2, and Q3 in bookings, high negative kind of teen bookings in Q1, negative mid teens Q2, slight low digit almost flat in Q3 and that\u2019s just sort of orders in hand in Q4 would give us sort of a sense of fourth quarter bookings and total being up for the year. So we feel pretty good about that. Now if you go beyond China, Asia, it\u2019s actually been \u2013 it\u2019s really healthy as well. So we\u2019re about equally divided between China and Asia. So in general I think we\u2019re rounding the corner in China.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Now that\u2019s great color. And then if we could just switch to margins, obviously another great quarter year-over-year. Price inflation it was a \u2013 was a big factor, how does price inflation look as we go from 3Q into 4Q and perhaps into 2013. And could you maybe comment on pricing by segments?","Michael W. Lamach","Yeah, inflation moderates Q3 to Q4 sequentially. Price moderates from Q3 to Q4 sequentially. We think this will be the seventh quarter in a row that we will still see a positive spread between the two.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then just finally Thermo King the flat bookings surprised me a little bit. Obviously, revenues were down high single digits, but how does that business look as we go into 4Q?","Michael W. Lamach","Nigel, one of the reasons why bookings were pretty flat is with \u2013 I mentioned in my remarks that the Marine business is down significantly. So if you take marine, which is \u2013 shows up in our European pile, it\u2019s down quite a bit from prior-year. So the \u2013 and when I say quite a bit, its double-digits plus type of a number.","So if you look at truck and trailer bookings in Q3, the Americas were actually up double-digits. We\u2019re still seeing some pressure on bookings in truck trailer in Europe. But quite frankly the bookings in truck trailer Europe are not down as far as we kind of expected. So what you got here is, we\u2019re continuing to hold our own and what I\u2019ll call the core of our business within TK truck and trailer globally. But the Marine Container piece is having a big impact on it.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","But in your plan, do you have charge you have to thinking down mid to high single digits in 4Q?","Steven R. Shawley","Well our outlook for TK for the full-year is flat, slight down in total. So North America will be up mid-single digits, Europe excluding marine down in mid-teens and marine down over 20%. So I think the math works out Nigel for it.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Wherley from Janney Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Michael Wherley - Janney Capital Markets","Good morning and how are you guys doing?","Steven R. Shawley","Good morning and thank you.","Michael Wherley - Janney Capital Markets","Just looking at the climate, you said that the orders in Europe were up in the low-teens in the HVAC part of that business; so I was wondering if you could talk about that strength where it might be coming from geographically.","Steven R. Shawley","Yeah, it\u2019s in the applied business and we\u2019re seeing really strong bookings throughout the year and then fourth quarter in the Middle East that continues to board well. A combination of new product introductions I think helping to support that. And we\u2019re seeing actually a little bit better performance in Southern Europe than we would have thought coming end of the year. So, actually the weakest part relative to our own forecast would have been Northern Europe particularly Germany. But the Middle East and India are really a strength for us.","Michael Wherley - Janney Capital Markets","Okay. And then on the residential business; I was just wondering if you\u2019re getting a sense from the builder market or the big boxes; is this pretty controlled demand or do you think that there might be some inventories sort of stocking up going on?","Michael W. Lamach","Well I think from a retail perspective with big box you\u2019ll see the typical fourth quarter destocking that goes on. So I think just in terms of their patterns for the last seven, eight years that I\u2019ve been involved you\u2019ll see some destocking there across the Board. From a HVAC perspective, I think inventories are largely in check with where they should be. So, I don\u2019t think we\u2019d see any anomaly happening between inventory levels and the seasons there.","Michael Wherley - Janney Capital Markets","Okay, and then just following up on residential. When you\u2019re looking at those 13 SEER and 14 SEER products; do you have any sense as to whether or not, now that you have them back into the market, whether or not you can't continue to gain share in that part of the market in 2013?","Michael W. Lamach","I feel good about it. If you look in the course it\u2019s really just a season we\u2019ve been able to not just get 2011 back, but really kind of gain on 2010 and I think that as next year we come into the season and we continue to sharpen our cost position on those entry level products and our distribution system across those products. I feel pretty good about our odds what we\u2019re still \u2013 if you think about sort of the Trane brand, in terms of the brand recognition it\u2019s just roughly twice our share and I think that\u2019s really the entitlement going forward for us is to continually eat into that entitlement in the years ahead. So I feel good about what we\u2019ve done and I feel good about actually next year, and I wish it was summer at this point.","Michael Wherley - Janney Capital Markets","All right. Thanks a lot.","Michael W. Lamach","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Resources. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, it\u2019s Jeff Sprague.","Michael W. Lamach","Jeff, we know who you are.","Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Yeah, I also wasn\u2019t sure that was me and thank you, good morning. Could you just provide a little bit of color Mike on what you\u2019re seeing kind of in energy retrofit markets. We heard from someone today they\u2019re actually seeing some slippage going on there in the commercial side. Are you seeing that at all and just a general kind of retrofit versus new activity in commercial?","Michael W. Lamach","Well specially Jeff, in performance contracting we had some larger bookings in Q3 there, which always went lends itself toward larger applied sales and again if you look at even the shift between unitary and applied Q3 and Q4, you\u2019re seeing \u2013 that what we\u2019re seeing the unitary down sort of mid-single digits, applied is up mid-single digits. So all that is really getting more toward large retrofits that are driven by energy savings, energy efficiency so, we\u2019re actually I would say seeing more of a shift toward energy efficiency.","If you look at sort of the customer base whether it\u2019s institutional or its commercial or manufacturing customers that buy applied cooling products from us that are applied air compressor products from us. They\u2019re looking at the same sort of markets that we are which are largely flat markets and for a lot of these units that are coming out, particularly the newer units we\u2019re putting out in the market place, we\u2019re seeing two, three year paybacks and that\u2019s sort of a sweet spot.","So, I would probably differ from the view you heard, say that we\u2019re seeing probably more of a shift there. It\u2019s also true that we shifted resources, feet in the street really from looking at some of the \u2013 I would say sort of the planned and spec market over to the retrofit market, toward energy conservation so you\u2019ve also got more feet in the street for us pursuing owner direct negotiations that are energy efficiency motivated, so that could be part of it, it\u2019s just the focus that we\u2019ve had on trying to find some growth in pockets where we think growth can be had which isn\u2019t in the planned and spec institutional construction market.","Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","And then additionally a different topic, very early days, but do you see or expect to see any kind of behavior change in the channel kind of with the Goodman Daikin deal and just any high level thoughts on the competitive landscape?","Michael W. Lamach","We have been living with Daikin McQuay for a while now. So we\u2019ve seen that on the commercial side, and on the residential side it\u2019s just way too soon to have seen anything or to comment on it; so nothing to this point.","Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","All right. Thank you very much.","Michael W. Lamach","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.","Hey, good morning guys.","Michael W. Lamach","Hi, Jeff.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.","I was a little surprised by the industrial resilience given what we\u2019re hearing from some other just kind of industrial manufacturing companies. Can you just talk about the trend through the quarter what you saw into September and where there is may be more resiliency versus weakening?","Steven R. Shawley","Jeff, the starting point would be to say that, the new product launches that we\u2019ve had last couple of years they continue to bear fruit. We\u2019ve got an excellent oil free product out in the marketplace gaining share. We\u2019ve gone through systematically and had gone through all, but a couple of the larger frame centrifugal machines that are out there. Lead times have continued to be cut half through the lean work going on inside the Company.","I\u2019ve used as an example on a couple of previous quarterly calls where it\u2019s an example where the lean work starts with working capital improvement, it goes into margin improvement, it goes into share gain and I think all that really is coming to bear.","The other thing is the largest investment that we\u2019ve made this year in that business has been really a move towards the service side of the house and in putting in place incremental resources that to move towards similar to the HVAC story of service retrofit based on efficiency fare and so that\u2019s been successful to-date is just growing the service business at a higher rate than the equipment business actually in both HVAC and in the air side of the business.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.","Okay. So you think the resiliency is more a function of maybe share gains in what you\u2019re doing?","Steven R. Shawley","I\u2019d say share gain and shift to sort of the service businesses and shift to the markets that are growing frankly, shift to focusing on the pockets of growth for us.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.","Okay. And then on buyback you said you\u2019re going to wrap up your buyback program by the end of the year. Just how should we think about buyback going forward beyond that and just capital allocation focus going forward?","Steven R. Shawley","Yeah we intend to talk to the Board in December and really lay that out for you for 2013 Jeff, but as we said last time we\u2019re trying to go back and take a meaningful step in the dividend and to go back and reauthorize the share repurchase going forward; so we\u2019ll be able to size that up for you in December.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks.","Steven R. Shawley","Welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Deane Dray from Citi. Your line is open.","Deane Dray - Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Thank you. Good morning everyone. Just over on the residential HVAC side any updates on the rollout of the Ameristar brand?","Steven R. Shawley","It was a success. The season is largely over if you think about it from a cooling standpoint moving into the heating season here. I think we\u2019re in great shape really with regard to the furnace platform the work we\u2019ve been doing there to get all price points including highest efficiency, 95% efficiency, furnace is ready for the market. So it was a success and I think we\u2019ll build on it next year. We\u2019ll expand our capacity there and expand distribution and continue to make sure that we\u2019ve gotten a best product at that point in a product range.","Deane Dray - Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","And then with respect to the differences we\u2019re seeing in the applied versus unitary, my experience has been that on the unitary side that you tend to see a bit more price competition. On the applied these are bigger systems more engineering content and you often get a bit more pricing power. Is that playing out now?","Steven R. Shawley","Yeah generally Deane I\u2019d say it even splits a little finer than that. Applied yes and unitary, I was just talking about larger unitary so particularly on 25 tons and maybe even 50 tons and larger. It starts to really almost look like an engineered system itself with controls packages that go along with that. So I think with that regard it\u2019s much more of a applied sale than it would be for the smaller unitary up through 25 tons maybe up through 50 tons.","And what you saw on the first couple of quarters of the year was that like unitary and smaller unitary markets really growing, there was a bit of a commercial surge with commercial office buildings at that point in time and especially we participated in that with a very high share.","Deane Dray - Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Okay, that color is helpful. And then on, I might have missed this but I know you called out some help from the other income lines, sometimes you have hedging in there, is there anything that you would call out?","Steven R. Shawley","Nothing abnormal Deane, there was a onetime issue relative to an old legal suit \u2013 legal claim.","Deane Dray - Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Winoker from Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Great. Thanks and good morning. Mike maybe you could start off a little bit on the productivity side and cost reduction in terms of how that\u2019s playing along. I mean obviously we can see the good results, but how is it playing along against the implementation plan that you\u2019ve got particularly with timing and rollout across the portfolio and are you looking \u2013 and are you seeing additional cost reduction opportunities that are increasing rather than decelerating in the portfolio particularly as you look out against headwinds in 2013?","Michael W. Lamach","Especially with the answer that we have to look at all the leverage that we have to full there because we manage them really independently, and if you think about the lean work going on we\u2019re on track there with what we set out to do with the number of value streams.","More importantly since those value streams are widening we\u2019re looking at this more as a percentage of the cost under transformation, particularly the conversion cost of labor and overhead. So that continues as planned and we\u2019re still seeing the nice separation between results, but now over a little bit bigger base than we had last year.","We\u2019re also applying it to the SG&A side of the business, a project we internally refer to as AGILE where we\u2019re redefining the SG&A structure really the G&A structure of the Company and we\u2019ve been working through that as well. So that have productivity force in Q3 and I think we\u2019re still in the early innings there. I think that, that still as a 2013 major opportunity for us.","It really begins to be an opportunity in 2014 and 2015 as the systems implementation takes hold. We\u2019re generating net productivity on the G&A side in spite of the fact that we\u2019re investing heavily in the systems component there; so that\u2019s a good story going forward.","The sourcing team has been in place now for a few quarters. That\u2019s gaining traction, we have gotten material productivity which was greater than last year\u2019s total productivity and we\u2019ve invested in supplier quality and supplier development resources coming into the organization, just a whole new talent based around that. That\u2019s largely a 2013 \u2013 a 2014 opportunity around cost for quality for us which is an area that we haven\u2019t really attacked to the same degree as we have in other areas of the business. So that I think is a positive for us as well. Steve?","Steven R. Shawley","No I\u2019d just reiterate the comment about SG&A. I think the opportunity we have in \u201913 is to really focus there, pull up the targets we have for reducing the G&A piece or cost structure.","Michael W. Lamach","Yeah, Steve I would say the restructuring that we\u2019ve done is the last piece, we\u2019ve done a lot of that. We\u2019ve got a little bit more to do there, but that\u2019s played well. I\u2019ll give you an example for Trane commercial in North America, they were able this past year year-to-date in forecast to achieve 45% operating leverage in the business and we got a little bit of volume coming into the unitary and applied business there against really what's been a very effectively restructured cost base and an integrated cost base in several factories now that we have merged with industrial.","So this is very positive for us in terms of just what we\u2019re seeing with volume and leverage the Trane commercial business. So I would tell you that I\u2019m still very optimistic about it. It\u2019s been a long haul. We had to add a tremendous amount of resources and talent into the company. And when it all works like it has and quarter two and quarter three we get the numbers that we\u2019re entitled to get.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Great. And a quick question; could you call out compressor bookings specifically because I might have missed those, industrial?","Steven R. Shawley","When you say compressor, you\u2019re talking about air compressor bookings?","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Yeah, yeah.","Steven R. Shawley","Yeah. If you look at North America, we got to blend it with service here. My guess would be its relatively flat and you\u2019re seeing exactly what you think you\u2019d see in Asia Pacific which is more or less a down for us there. Europe about as expected a little bit less than expected.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And then just a different topic, but I know you mentioned obviously the Board is going through all the review now and we\u2019ll hear about that in December as you mentioned. But, as you look at the industry and I\u2019ve just been \u2013 as you look at the broader industry, do you believe that in general that there is still room for additional consolidation in HVAC and obviously the Daikin move with Goodman was sort of continuing to get people thinking about that, but just broadly speaking.","Steven R. Shawley","Well on the res side I think there, there probably is. On the commercial side you\u2019re really dealing now with two or three major players that have got large shares in the market place, so it\u2019s more difficult there. Our chiller shares are up with 40%, so as an example and if you go to number two it\u2019s probably 30%, number three is probably 20%. So there\u2019s not a lot there to be split and if you see consolidation there it\u2019s going to be fairly small players and frankly I would say the competitive base doesn\u2019t need distribution on the commercial side generally speaking, and so anything you\u2019d see there would be a small distribution network perhaps. But on the res, yes there\u2019s a lot of fragmentation of small suppliers out there where it has been really a cost play, it really wouldn\u2019t be a distribution play. It would be a cost play.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","And when you say res you include light commercial, like rooftops in there?","Steven R. Shawley","Well the danger there is because that goes through, in our case multiple channels and so it\u2019s really effective for us because we manufacture all the light commercial in our commercial factories and we actually have equal share between our res channel and our commercial channel which is \u2013 we double up on that and we get something north of 30% share in light commercial because of that. So there\u2019s some anomalies there when you think about the channels to market which, you\u2019re really are able to manage those two channels with not a high degree of tension and overlap in the marketplace I would say a fair amount of but appropriate channel tension. So you have to be careful that you consider that as well.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","I mean separating RLC versus applied, that\u2019s all.","Steven R. Shawley","Yeah. And I am saying, yeah you probably could see some more of that but it really runs through the same channel that you sell applied for half of the share.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","All right, got it. Okay, thank you guys.","Steven R. Shawley","Bye, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from MKM Partners. Your line is open.","Michael W. Lamach","Hi Josh, we know who you are.","Operator","Please check your mute button.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners","Hello.","Michael W. Lamach","Hey Josh.","Steven R. Shawley","Josh.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners","Hey, good morning guys.","Michael W. Lamach","Hey.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners","Just looking to dig in here a little bit more on residential. I understand that, I mean given the order cycle there I mean the orders that you called out in the slide deck might not be the best way to look at it. So if you could just give us a sense, how do we read on the furnace season, what are you guys seeing obviously -- I am sorry in easy comp last year with some of the warmer weather? And then maybe a sense around the profitability of residential into this year, so \u2013 I am sorry into the fourth quarter, so do you expect whether you can make money this year, just some detail on that into the fourth quarter.","Steven R. Shawley","Yeah Josh I mean we\u2019re still holding to, we\u2019ll see a couple of 100 points of margin expansion in the res business this year, so that kind of holds just the way it did before. And you\u2019re correct on the bookings, that\u2019s probably the one bookings number I don\u2019t pay a lot of attention to because it fundamentally comes down to, it\u2019s sort of like a week\u2019s worth of bookings versus a week\u2019s worth of bookings the prior quarter and so you don\u2019t really get a sense for anything there particularly with cycle times being much, much shorter than they were.","Generally when we think about the full-year in the res HVAC business for the industry, it\u2019s probably going to be relatively flat, that\u2019s what the industry data really shows and we\u2019re thinking we\u2019re going to be kind of mid-single digits of course based on share gains that we talked about. Now going into the fourth quarter we would have a similar view there. In fact you have seen almost every month of every quarter work in a pretty severe saw tooth.","A great example was third quarter you saw a great July, ho hum August and a pretty poor September for the industry and that\u2019s been the pattern we have seen all year long. I would think the pattern would persist going into the heating season. The difference we have, the thinking we have put into the sort of heating season here, is we have taken on more inventory, more component inventory than we normally would and what would be sort of be on their forecast that we\u2019re giving you.","So any event there was anomaly weather related or other, we\u2019ll have the capability of building to that demand forecast for sure. But we\u2019re really not just spanking on it based on what we\u2019ve seen here today.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners","Got you. And I guess just the way the math works out that implies, we spend a margin in the fourth quarter kind of something maybe just shy of mid-single digits as well as is that a fair way to think about it?","Steven R. Shawley","Yes.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners","Then just to understand the fourth quarter guidance, you guys guided down about $50 million versus the last few and taking out about $40 million of EBIT. It sounds like price cost is relative neutral. Is there anything going on at the corporate line or any other kind of one-timers or mix issues that we should be thinking about, you know, that maybe help to explain that sequential drop?","Steven R. Shawley","Actually Josh, it has really taken out $92 million at the mid-point of volume. Taking it out of the most profitable business we have which is actually Asia and China for both the Air and the Climate business, which are most profitable businesses. We are also taking it out of the TK business in Europe, again which is a very profitable business for us. So, it's really mask that we've got the FX going one way, you know kind of a $50 million plus pickup on FX, volume coming down $92 million at the mid-point, but at very high margin sort of with those businesses coming down.","Michael W. Lamach","Our margin is also the capacity cost associated with it.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners","Got you. And it sounds like those are the precise areas where at least on near term more basis you guys are feeling a little bit between but maybe more of a \u201913 term to see a new shipments?","Michael W. Lamach","Yes.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners","Okay. I appreciate the time you guys. Thank you.","Michael W. Lamach","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Yes, good morning guys.","Michael W. Lamach","Hi Andrew.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Just a short question on guidance just to make sure that I read it correctly. It seems that you have reduced outlook for the year by $50 million in terms of revenue, and if we apply sort of a reasonable decremental margin to that we would have gotten EPS hit maybe like $0.05 and that it looks like closer to $0.10. A; am I calculating it correctly, and B; what's driving the substantial earnings hit relative to the guidance top line hit. Thank you.","Michael W. Lamach","Kind of the answer was in the previous question. There\u2019s really two parts to the revenue change in Q4. One is, a little over $90 million associated with volume that we\u2019re taking out in China, Europe; it\u2019s pretty high margins and also the capacity cost associated with that. But coming back the other way is a favorable change associated with foreign exchange because the euro primarily is kind of recovered here recently. So that\u2019s adding $50 million of revenue back with very, very little OI. So the leverage on the reduction in guidance looks pretty high as a result of that.","Steven R. Shawley","Yeah, Andrew but if you just think about EPS basis you add $0.04 back for outbox and drop to nearly $0.13 on the volume that we\u2019re talking about and you get the $0.09 differential.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","That makes sense. And on free cash flow is it all related, you sort of $100 million hit there, is that just sort of net income reduction or what else is going on there?","Michael W. Lamach","Well there\u2019s two components there frankly, one is just FX and the second is there\u2019s been a several businesses where we\u2019ve just decided, we made the decision to take on the incremental inventory here in the fourth quarter, a example I used was the res business around the furnace season again just to make sure that we got what we need. Even around coil production coming into the early part of next year, we\u2019ll do some coil production even in the fourth quarter related to next year\u2019s season, just to smooth and linearize capacity that we have available to use we think is a better way to do that in the next year. And also in the TK business, you\u2019ve got the changeover happening and so it\u2019s a good time for us at least to have just in excess diesel engines on hand and you put that all together and $100 million was mostly designed and that\u2019s being the other part of it.","And to kind of clarify a little bit on the TK Andy the [agg] folks have reduced their estimate of the number of trailing units in the market again recently. And it was mainly because they took out the assumption that there was going to be a free buy of refrigerated units because of this changeover to the Tier 4 classification. So it\u2019s shifting a little bit of the demand into 2013 that we would expect it to see in the fourth quarter of \u201912 but that\u2019s why we picked up a little bit of inventory there.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","And now that Trane is, I don\u2019t know if you can share anything there but have you thought about changing the pace of restructuring, how you allocate R&D, marketing expense. How much strategic discussion have you had with Trane and the Board given the involvement about how you\u2019re going to run the business just very broadly over the next 12 to 24 months, if you can share anything?","Steven R. Shawley","Yeah Andy we have had I would say a very aggressive capability building program in place for two and a half years in terms of what we have done with bringing the talent into the company and development talent within the company to really do what we\u2019re doing. So transformation to become a top performing diversified industrial don\u2019t happen overnight clearly and we have been at it for 2.5 years.","Most that get into the business would argue that that there\u2019s a lot of change going on and frankly how do you guys manage all the change going on inside the business between systems implementation, organizational changes, implementation of lean across the company while maintaining a very high level of investment in innovation around the product portfolio. So I feel good about the pace of change.","I feel good about the fact that year-over-year, over year we\u2019ve had margin expansion with relatively, in this case flat market. So, and we have been able to really consume so the restructuring is embedded in what we\u2019re giving you. So this is not some sort of a zero restructuring story here, this is embedded in what we\u2019re doing and embedded in the margin. So we feel good about that. Now with regard to Nelson being on the Board, Nelson is on the Board now and Nelson is part of the discussions around the Company and so there is no update as to where we are other than to say that the release we had on August was heading toward sort of a December information with regard to what decisions we would make around the Company and those are progressing on plan and on track, no new news there.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much.","Steven R. Shawley","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Hi, thanks. My first question is just on the investment spend, I think you've said before that the investment sort of in other line in terms of year-on-year margin effect for the full-year this year would be about 100 bps, I guess, headwind for \u201912. I just wanted to check that\u2019s still the case and also when you are looking a bit further out, does that headwind start to shrink as you move into next year because it sounds like that new product introductions particularly in climate, industrial tech and resi, a lot of that work has been done. So you\u2019re kind of investing, but the big kind of catch up ramp up is largely finishing.","Steven R. Shawley","Yeah, I will take the first part, Julian. The expenditures on the initiatives that we\u2019ve been talking about, those are new product developments, those are common systems, those are things like centralizing our procurement organization are continuing and we hit that right on the head here in Q3. We said about $25 million of incremental spend a quarter. It was exactly $25 million in Q3, and I\u2019m [counting] on another exactly $25 million in Q4. So the $100 million of headwinds associated with investment initiatives is still there, so maybe Mike, you can take the second half?","Michael W. Lamach","Yeah Julian, on the 2013 view, we\u2019re in the process of putting our plans together. And similar to last year, we will do some scenario planning around different possibilities for the major lines of business and regions and so I don\u2019t know the answer of that question at this point in time. I can\u2019t tell you that we will continue to invest in the applied HVAC portfolio. So most of what we\u2019ve been doing has been in the unitary HVAC portfolio for commercial will go to the applied side.","And then on the industrial side, we will continue to invest there, but probably be able to hold that relatively flat going into next year. But we will have to come back and talk to you about that in another quarter and give you a full update on that at this point in time. I think what we\u2019re doing is working within that we can launch at higher margins, it\u2019s contributing through the margin growth inside the Company. We have gained share wherever we\u2019ve done that, so the formula seems to work for us.","And maybe a little bit to Andrew's question as well as what you\u2019re asking, just really steady margin expansion over time, doing it in a sustainable way with product development and implementation of Lean across the Company, right. If there are faster ways to do that, I wouldn\u2019t want to do that through cutting investments or to do something silly with regard to not really putting that permanent operational capability into the Company and that would just be a long-term mistake for us.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Sure. Then on the security business, you never seems to get many questions, but you\u2019ve obviously in this kind of transition of trying to move away from excessive reliance on mechanical more towards electronics access and so and I just wonder if you think that requires acquisitions to do that or you feel that internal R&D is sufficient, because I guess the rhetoric around M&A has been watered down a lot over the course of this year?","Michael W. Lamach","Well, I mean, I think you\u2019ve got to hold the acquisition story up to the mirror of share repurchase. And I think the acid test is share repurchase and right now we just haven\u2019t thought of better investment than our own Company. You still see fairly pricey, very pricey electronics security sort of targets out there and that\u2019s not on the cards for us.","Now organically again it gets back into the investment question, a large part \u2013 I\u2019d say all of the investment going on in security has been around electronic security platforms and they\u2019ve got a very good capability sitting in that organization around the ability to develop product in that area. So, I don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re compelled to do that and we certainly wouldn\u2019t be compelled to do that favoring that over repurchasing our own shares here at the multiples we\u2019re seeing for some of these opportunities.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Great. Thank you.","Michael W. Lamach","Yep.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from Jamie Sullivan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks. Good morning.","Michael W. Lamach","Good morning.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets","Just wondering on the restructuring spending side, if you have a figure for the quarter and what you expect going into the fourth?","Steven R. Shawley","We talked about restructuring on the last call. We have restructuring front-end loaded, so we will spend somewhere in the neighborhood of $40 million in the first half of the year and that ramps down to about $10 million in the second half of the year. So there is a \u2013 and that\u2019s helping also \u2013 remember the conversation in last couple of quarters, we\u2019re seeing the productivity show up in the second half associated with those spendings that went on in the first half. So, we\u2019re kind of right on cue there with that program.","Michael W. Lamach","We spent about $20 million more in restructuring in 2012 and 2011 Jamie. So it\u2019s been a pretty steady state restructuring program for the last 3, 3.5 years.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And probably kind of a similar focus on that as you go into next year, is that the way we should think about it?","Michael W. Lamach","For now, yes, we will come back and give you definitive guidance in the quarter. But for now I think it\u2019s a good assumption.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets","Great. And then just one last one, on the industrial side, you talked about focus on the aftermarket side of the business. What\u2019s the mix of equipment versus service today and also maybe if you can touch on how the order patterns kind of trended in the quarter and if there are any surprises on that front?","Michael W. Lamach","About 40% today, Jamie. I think we will move that over next few years something closer to 50%, that\u2019s our design in that business. And there we\u2019re looking at order rates for services that really kind of get into sort of the mid double-digit even at times high \u2013 I am sorry mid-single digits even high single digits order rates for service. So, we like the contribution margin service, we like the growth rates and obviously we\u2019re trying to move the mix up closer to 50% in the industrial business.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to Ms. Janet Pfeffer for closing remarks.","Janet Pfeffer","Thank you, Mary and thank you everyone. Joe and I will be around today if you have any follow-up questions. Have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference.

Welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2019 Q4 and full year earnings conference call. My name is Lindsey and I will be your operator for the call. The call will begin in a few moments with the speaker remarks and then a Q&A session. At this time, participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions].","I would now like to hand the call over to Zac Nagle, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Zac Nagle","Thanks operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Ingersoll Rand's fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. This call is being webcast on our website at ingersollrand.com where you will find the accompanying presentation. We are also recording and archiving this call on our website.","Please go to slide two. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release.","Joining me on today's call are Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO and Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO. Also joining today's call is Chris Kuehn, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer, who we recently announced will be succeeding Sue Carter as Chief Financial Officer after her planned retirement post-closing of the reverse Morris trust transaction with Gardner Denver in early 2020.","With that, please go to slide three and I will turn the call over to Mike.","Mike Lamach","Thanks Zac and thanks everyone for joining us on the call today. Before we begin today, I would like to take the opportunity to thank Sue for her many contributions to Ingersoll-Rand over the past six years as CFO. She has bee a terrific business partner and a leader of the finance organization and while we will miss her when she retires in the upcoming months, we certainly wish her well in her well-deserved retirement.","I would like to welcome Chris Kuehn to the call as the future CFO of Trane Technologies. Chris has been a strong business partner and leader at Ingersoll-Rand since he joined the company five years ago. Execution of this succession plan is well underway in order to ensure a smooth transition and he is well-positioned for the role. Sue will be with us through the close of the RMT transaction and we are happy to have both Sue and Chris participate on the call today.","Turning to slide three. I would like to start out today's call with a brief overview of our global business strategy that's enabling us to consistently deliver strong financial results for our shareholders. As we continue to progress toward the close of the RMT transaction and prepare a transition to a pure-play climate company, our strategy remains unchanged. At its core, our strategy is at the nexus of environmental sustainability and impact, which are strong secular tailwinds for our business. The world is continuing to urbanize while becoming warmer and more resource constrained as time passes.","At our core, we are focused on and excel at reducing the energy intensity in buildings, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing waste of food and other perishable goods and we excel in our ability to generate productivity for our customers, all enabled by technology. Unless you think the world is getting cooler, less populated and less resource constrained as time passes, these strong secular tailwinds will continue to provide opportunity for shareholders and purpose for our vision. As we look back over the past several years, these secular tailwinds are only growing stronger and have a greater sense of urgency.","Moving to slide four. Fiscal 2019 was a great year for Ingersoll-Rand with strong execution against all elements of our strategy. We delivered top quartile performance with organic revenue growth of 6%, 70 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and free cash flow generation of $1.8 billion or 118% of adjusted net earnings. We established a leadership role in tackling the world's environmental and sustainability challenges by putting forth our aggressive 2030 sustainability commitments and we issued this challenge to like-minded companies in order to amplify progress towards a more sustainable future. We invested heavily on our core business, acquired Precision Flow Systems, entered into a game changing RMT transaction with Gardner Denver, repurchase $750 million in shares and continued to pay a strong dividend to our shareholders executing against all elements of our capital allocation strategy.","The RMT transaction creates a leading industrial company. It also creates a world-class pure-play climate control business, which squarely focuses 100% of our portfolio on our sustainability strategy. Finally, we maintain very high employee engagement despite a rapidly changing environment with additional economic and geopolitical challenges ensuring Ingersoll-Rand remains a great place to work for our people. I am very proud of our teams for delivering these strong results for our customers and our shareholders.","In the fourth quarter, our global end markets largely continued to be healthy with solid revenue growth across North America, Europe and China. We have highlighted North America commercial HVAC's growth as a standout all-year long and the fourth quarter was no exception. Year-over-year revenue growth was up high teens in the fourth quarter alone despite very tough comps in 2018.","We have talked about the extraordinary transport business bookings growth in 2018 and the normalization process that's been occurring in 2019 with steep rates decline in transport bookings in every quarter. This has been a drag on topline enterprise bookings all year. So we have been providing bookings growth numbers excluding our TK business to help you understand the real underlying bookings of the enterprise or the climate business. I hope this information has been helpful to the investment community.","In the fourth quarter, enterprise bookings were extremely strong excluding TK, up high civil digits. Climate bookings, excluding TK, were even stronger up low teens. Net, our underlying business remains very healthy. Our fourth quarter enterprise and climate leverage was lower than our guidance at the end of Q3. The lower leverage in the quarter was a result of three factors.","First, revenue in our higher margin transport business declined high single digits in the quarter roughly $50 million deleveraging in line with gross margin rates. In addition, the combination of very strong commercial HVAC growth coupled with transport declines drove incremental negative portfolio mix. The second impact is a good news, bad news story. On the positive side, we had exceptional free cash flow in the fourth quarter that well exceeded our forecast. So on the flipside, we needed to accrue a substantial increase to our full year incentive compensation plans as a result, which impacted operating leverage. And lastly, we had some unplanned inventory adjustments in the fourth quarter.","We know from your pre-call questions that the transport markets are in many people's minds, so we devoted a fair amount of discussion of this topic throughout the presentation and have a slide near the end. Throughout the year, we have talked about the significant declines in order rates expected in 2019 balanced against a very strong backlog we carried into the year. We expected that the net of the two factors combined with increasing cancellations in summer and fall will lead to a mid single digit revenue growth for 2019 and year-end backlog that returned to more normal levels. We highlighted that Europe was soft throughout 2019 and that we were largely in agreement with the ACT data, which was showing a correction in 2020 in North America trailer and that November and December 2019 and early 2020 market conditions and order rates are going to be important to really understand how the end of 2019 and 2020 might play out.","We closed out 2019 with 3% revenue growth for transport. Overall market demand in November and December did not pick up as much of anticipated and fourth quarter revenue was weaker than expected as a result. This knocked a couple of points off our full year Thermo King growth. We believe the fourth quarter marked the first quarter of what ACT and others believe will be a relatively short-lived down cycle as the booking anomalies of 2018 and 2019 reset positioning the market for a flat or slightly positive growth profile for 2021.","Our industrial businesses continued to execute very well in the fourth quarter. Our leaders remain focused on running the business and employee engagement remained strong, a testament to our culture and the strength of the businesses that will combine with Gardner Denver. In the fourth quarter, our industrial business saw strong margin expansion and a low single digit revenue decline. Good growth in small electric vehicles was offset by soft short cycle demand in compression technologies and industrial product.","We are seeing excellent payback on the restructuring, operational and commercial investments we made in the business over the past few years as evidenced by our strong margin expansion in the quarter. We believe the business is well-positioned moving into 2020 and for combination with Gardner Denver. We continued our balanced capital allocation strategy throughout 2019 and in the fourth quarter. The strong free cash flow we are generating continues to provide us with good capital allocation optionality moving forward.","Please go to slide five. We exceeded or delivered towards the high-end of the range against all of our guidance commitments for 2019 and delivered top quartile performance. Again, I am extremely proud of the entire Ingersoll-Rand team for their hard work and perseverance navigating through a very dynamic economic and geopolitical landscape in 2019.","Please turn to slide six. As we continue to move closer to the close of the RMT transaction with Gardner Denver, we are excited and well-positioned to debut as Trane Technologies. 100% of our portfolio will be strategically focused on global megatrends and at the intersection of sustainability and advanced technology and innovation. All of our products and services are uniquely positioned to have a real and significant positive impact on reducing carbon emissions. We continue to compete in largely healthy end markets globally and our strategy provides tailwinds to grow faster than GDP.","While we expect the transport markets will move through a short-term correction period, we believe this is a great business to be in over the long term. We expect the new Trane Technologies to continue to drive top quartile performance and we expect to deliver approximately 25% leverage in 2020 despite headwinds from our transport business. We are excited about the new Trane Technologies business and expect to host an Investor Day in the fall to lay out our long-term strategy and targets.","Please turn to slide seven. This slide provides a visual depiction of organic bookings and revenue growth in the fourth quarter. The underlying climate business remains very strong with broad based bookings and revenue growth in virtually all businesses and regions. Our compression technologies and industrial products businesses continued to be impacted by soft industrial short cycle spending while our small electric vehicle business has continued to deliver excellent growth. The headline enterprise bookings decline of negative 6% does not accurately reflect the underlying strength of the business. Enterprise bookings were up high single digits and climate bookings were up low teens respectively when you exclude transport and the very large quarter four 2018 commercial HVAC order.","Please turn to slide eight. This slide combines our quarter four growth performance with our preliminary view of our major end markets for 2020. I have covered the main points regarding fourth quarter growth on the prior slide, so I will focus my comments on our preliminary 2020 market outlook. Our global commercial HVAC outlook continues to be positive. Leading economic indicators remain largely supportive of continued market growth in 2020, albeit slower growth than in 2019. We are expecting to see low single digit market growth for global HVAC with North American office, government, education and industrial markets, all healthy.","In the residential HVAC market, which is the North American market for us, we are expecting to see low single digit market growth led by continued growth in the replacement markets, which is approximately 80% of our business today. Economic indicators are also largely supporting continued growth. As I discussed earlier, ACT, other data sources globally and our internal estimates point transport markets moving through a relatively short term down cycle in 2020 and more stable market in 2021. I will cover this in more detail later in the presentation.","Relative to the industrial markets, we continue to see impacts of soft short cycle CapEx spending in the fourth quarter, partially offset by solid growth in small electric vehicles. We expect this to continue through the first quarter of 2020. Through focused execution of our business strategy, we expect our businesses to grow faster than each of the major market growth expectations just outlined.","I now turn it over to Sue to provide more details on the quarter. Sue?","Sue Carter","Thank you Mike. Please go to slide number nine. I will begin with a summary of a few main points to take away from today's call. As Mike discussed, fourth quarter organic revenues were particularly strong in our climate segment with consistent focus on sustainability and energy efficiency for our customers. Our climate segment delivered organic revenue growth of 7%, compounding on 9% growth in 2018. Climate orders were also strong, up low teens, when excluding our transport business that saw outsized order growth throughout 2018 and the approximately $200 million large commercial HVAC order that we specifically called out in the fourth quarter of 2018.","In our industrial segment, organic revenues were down 2% on a tough year-over-year comp of 6% in 2018. Small electric vehicles delivered continued revenue growth, which was offset by revenue declines in the soft industrial short cycle markets we mentioned previously. Our team delivered exceptional free cash flow in 2019, up 118% of adjusted net earnings. We have delivered free cash flow in excess of adjusted net earnings consistently over time with a five year average of 107%. Adjusted earnings per share was up 6% versus the year ago period building on 29% growth in 2018. EPS growth was driven by operational performance in both our climate and industrial segments.","Importantly, we remain focused on deploying excess capital on our best ROI investments for our shareholders. After reinvesting in our core business through expense in capital in 2019, we deployed $510 million in dividends, $750 million in share repurchases and entered into or completed four acquisitions totaling more than $1.5 billion including Precision Flow Systems and the pending RMT transaction with Gardner Denver. Moving into 2020 and beyond, we expect to continue to generate powerful free cash flow and execute on our balanced capital allocation strategy, deploying 100% of excess cash over time.","Please go to slide 10. Stepping back from the details for a moment, Q4 was another strong quarter capping of a year of top quartile performance. In the quarter, we delivered organic revenue growth of 5%, adjusted operating margin improvement of 10 basis points and adjusted earnings per share growth of 6%.","Please go to slide number 11. As mentioned previously, our industrial segment delivered strong margin expansion through productivity, operational improvements and restructuring savings. When coupled with the strong revenue growth in our climate segment, we delivered another quarter of strong operating income and EPS growth in the quarter. Fourth quarter corporate costs were higher than prior year, primarily due to two impacts.","First, the timing of functional spend was higher in Q4 2019 than in 2018. Second, we achieved stronger-than-expected free cash flow performance in Q4, which increased our 2019 free cash flow conversion beyond our already strong forecast of 105% of net earnings to our actual results of 118%. Free cash flow conversion is one of our most important long term financial metrics for a healthy company and it plays a central role in our incentive compensation design. Net, the strong performance is great to see and a testament to the hard work by our employees globally. On the flipside, it costs just a little more in incentive compensation and it was a full year true-up, taken as a lump sum in the fourth quarter. Lastly, our effective tax rate in the quarter of 20% was in line with third quarter guidance but up versus the low 16.5% in the fourth quarter of 2018.","Please go to slide number 12. Before discussing the elements of our margin bridge today, I would like to highlight that we made one modification to what you have seen previously. We have separated volume from mix and combined mix with price, material inflation and tariffs. We believe this is a clear way to visualize the margin bridge. As this is a bit different than you may be accustomed to, I would like to take a couple of minutes walking you through the modification and why combining mix, price and material inflation and tariffs is a positive adjustment.","Since late 2016, we have seen tremendous amount of material inflation and tariffs that have been fast-moving and volatile. To offset the massive material inflation and tariffs, we have realized price increases in the neighborhood of five times historical levels. At the same time, our business has been growing at very high rates and we have a large percentage of business that is not driven off of a price list. The line between mix and price and inflation is thin already and it has become more difficult to break mix and price apart at the level we have been providing on these bridges.","For example, when we create a configured system for high-rise in New York, that system is unique to that building. Since we have detailed tracking of input costs to calculate inflation, when gross margins on the project are better than the project on the street, the question we must answer is whether the margin improvement is because we priced the project better or if it's better mix because we utilized higher margin components in the system.","To be clear, we are confident we delivered strong price cost in the quarter completing our seventh consecutive quarter of positive price cost. We also delivered strong margin expansion from volume growth in the quarter. Negative product mix more than offset price cost as we continue to deliver outsized growth from our commercial HVAC equipment as compared to revenue declines in higher margin products like transport and short cycle compressors and industrial products.","Productivity versus other inflation was flat in the quarter. Our segments delivered solid productivity from operational excellence and restructuring savings. The savings were offset by the previously mentioned incentive compensation increases and climate segment year-end inventory adjustments following an ERP implementation and footprint optimization projects. We continue to invest heavily in growth and operating expense reduction projects with high returns on investment.","Please go to slide 13. Our climate segment delivered another quarter of solid organic revenue growth. Consistent with our expectations, we delivered strong volume growth, price realization and productivity. As previously mentioned, operating leverage was below expectations, primarily due to the deleverage on transport revenue declines and the year-end true-ups we mentioned on the previous slide.","Please go to slide 14. In our industrial segment, organic revenues were down 2% on a tough year-over-year comp of 6% in 2018. Strong revenue growth in small electric vehicles was offset by revenue declines in a soft industrial short cycle market we mentioned previously. Over the past several years, we have built a stronger, more resilient industrial business. Despite organic revenue declines in the quarter, our industrial segment expanded adjusted operating margins by 240 basis points through productivity programs, operational improvements and restructuring savings. The combination of our operating margin improvement efforts with our PFS acquisition expanded EBITDA margins 350 basis points in the quarter.","Please go to slide 15. We remain committed to a balanced capital allocation strategy that consistently deploys excess cash to the opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. We maintain a healthy level of business investments in high ROI technology, innovation and operational excellence projects, which are vital to our continued growth, product leadership and margin expansion. We continue to make strategic investments in acquisitions that further improve long term shareholder returns. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve. We have a long-standing commitment to a reliable, strong and growing dividend that increases at or above the rate of earnings growth over time.","With the proposed transaction with Gardner Denver growing closer, I remind you that we expect to maintain our annualized dividend of $2.12 per share post-closing and through 2020. This will deliver an attractive dividend yield for Trane Technologies. For 2021 and beyond, we will evaluate dividend increases in line with earnings growth and consistent with our long-standing capital deployment priorities. As we look forward to 2020, we remain committed to a balanced capital allocation strategy. We remain enthusiastic about the future opportunities to deploy excess capital to the best ROI investments, whether that be reinvestment in the business, a strong dividend, making value accretive strategic acquisitions or repurchasing shares.","Please go to slide 17. Anticipating the reverse Morris trust transaction will closed early this year, I will spend a few minutes walking you through a high level 2020 outlook for Trane Technologies. After the proposed transaction closes, we anticipate the newly combined industrial business to provide guidance, including our industrial segment. Given the market backdrop Mike outlined earlier, we expect total reported and organic revenues to be up 3% to 5% in 2020 and broadly healthy HVAC end markets. During 2019, our climate segment delivered 40 basis points of margin expansion.","In 2020, on an apples-to-apples basis, we expect to further expand segment margins between 30 and 70 basis points. In the first quarter, we anticipate solid revenue growth in our HVAC business offset by steep declines in our transport business creating continued mix headwinds. Mike will outline our transport outlook in more detail later in the presentation. Apples-to-apples unallocated corporate expenses are expected to be approximately $260 million including stranded costs previously allocated to our industrial segment. I will explain more about our stranded cost outlook later in the presentation.","For modeling purposes, we also offer the following items. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $300 million. We estimate interest expense to be approximately $240 million reflecting debt retirement of $600 million in the May timeframe. We are targeting free cash flow to be greater than 100% of net earnings with capital expenditures approximating 1% to 2% of revenues. And we have modeled $500 million in share repurchases.","And now I would like to cover two topics of interest with you. Please go to slide 19. We often get questions about the status of the proposed industrial segment reverse Morris trust transaction. We have covered most of this slide throughout the presentation so I will cover a few points here.","Entering 2020, we anticipate one time separation and transaction costs to be at the high-end of our previously communicated range of $150 million to $200 million. During 2019, we spent approximately $95 million and we expect to spend the rest in the next few months. We continue to execute our detailed project plans to carry out all of the separation and integration planning and transformation work. Given that we and Gardner Denver continue to operate as two separate companies and compete in the marketplace until the close of the transaction, much of the integration and transformation work ramps after the deal closes.","Last month, we announced that our pure-play sustainability focused climate company will be named Trane Technologies, pending shareholder approval. We expect Trane Technologies to trade on the New York Stock Exchange as TT and we plan to host our first Trane Technologies Investor Day in the fall of this year. In contemplating the timing of our Investor Day, we recognize that 2020 is the third year of the three-year financial targets we set at our Investor Day in mid-2017. Today we are giving guidance for the final year, which will complete that three-year plan. Additionally, between now and the time of the Investor Day, we will close the transaction, begin operating as two separate companies, file the appropriate historical financial statements and give you a chance to analyze a couple of quarters of reporting under our new segment structure. With those tasks complete and 2020 performance well underway, we will be in a position to give long term financial targets and further outline Trane Technologies' continued strategy at Investor Day.","Please go to slide 20. We also get questions about the stranded costs associated with the RMT transaction and how to model the savings for new Trane Technologies. With that in mind, I will walk you through the math illustrated in the chart at the bottom of the slide. Starting from the left, our 2020 unallocated corporate cost guide was $250 million at the time of the agreement. At the time we also estimated approximately $50 million of allocated corporate costs were being absorbed by our industrial segment that were not specific to industrial. In addition, we are targeting $50 million of cost reduction for a total of $100 million of stranded costs.","To make the math simple, we have shown a rebaseline totaling $300 million that includes both the unallocated costs and the cost currently allocated to the industrial segment. Our guidance for 2020 unallocated corporate cost of $260 million reflects a $40 million reduction in stranded costs, netted against the $300 million rebaseline corporate costs. To be clear, these cost reductions may come from corporate or from the climate businesses. We are presenting guidance in this way to give you easily comparable climate margin and corporate cost targets for modeling our 2020 outlook.","As we move to 2021, we plan to remove an additional $60 million from either corporate or the climate businesses to achieve our full $100 million stranded cost reduction target. To realize these stranded cost reductions, we expect to spend approximately $100 million to 150 million. We will provide quarterly updates on our stranded cost reduction progress.","And with that, I will turn the call back over to Mike.","Mike Lamach","Thanks Sue. Please go to slide 21. The last topic of interest is related to transport refrigeration. While this is a preliminary view based on available forecast and our internal estimates, I will cover both what we are currently anticipating for the major end markets for the transport business and what we expect to see for our Thermo King business specifically. Given the complexity of this topic, we have significantly expanded the level of disclosure on our TK business for the purpose of this discussion. We hope this will be useful in better understanding our outlook for the market and for our TK business. We expect the transport markets to move through a short-term correction period in 2020.","We are expecting to see steep declines in North American trailer and APU and mid single digit declines in truck. These businesses account for approximately 40% of our TK business. We currently expect the decline to be most significant in the first quarter where the market faces tougher comparisons to solid growth in the first quarter of 2019 which remains challenging throughout 2020.","We are also expecting to see a high single digit decline in our European, Middle East and Africa trailer business with a steep decline in the first half of the year and recovery in the second half. The truck business in EMEA is expected to be lumpy but flat for the overall year.","What's shown as the all other market for TK reflects aftermarket parts, marine, bus, rail, air in a few of the relatively smaller regional markets where market forecasts are not as robust as North America or Europe. However, for these markets, we are currently expecting modest growth of low single digit to mid single digit growth in 2020.","We believe we have the opportunity to outperform the overall markets in 2020, in part by leveraging the 40% of our business that is in markets where modest growth is expected. We believe we have opportunities to significantly outperform in areas such as aftermarket parts where consumption increases in a down cycle and in APU, where we continued our successful strategy to improve our bolt-on rate beyond current levels. We also anticipate outperforming the overall trailer and truck markets in both North America and EMEA through innovation and new product launches and where we see opportunities for share growth.","The situation is obviously fluid in transport refrigeration and we are closely tracking order rates and other market indicators to improve our line of sight into 2020 moving forward. At the present time, however, we are guiding for quarter one TK revenues to be down somewhere in the 20% range and for 2020 TK revenues be down in the 5% to 10% range.","Please go to slide 22. 2019 was another year of top quartile financial performance with strong revenue growth, EPS growth and free cash flow. Looking forward, we believe the company is extremely well-positioned to deliver strong shareholder returns over the next several years. Fundamentally, we excel where global megatrends and sustainability intersect with our innovation and capabilities. Today, 15% of the world's carbon emissions come from heating and cooling buildings and other 8% comes from global food loss. And these numbers are growing.","We are continually innovating to bend the curve on global warming. By 2030, we will reduce our customers' carbon emissions by one gigaton by changing the way the world heats and cools buildings and moves refrigerated food, medicines and other perishables. We have been heavily investing for years to build franchise brands and to advance our leadership market positions to enable consistent profitable growth. We have an experienced management team and a high-performing culture that instills operational excellence into everything we do.","We remain committed to dynamic and balanced deployment of capital and we have a strong track record of deploying excess cash to deliver top-tier shareholder returns over the years. And lastly, we are extremely excited about the pending RMT transaction and the strategic combination of our industrial segment with Gardner Denver. Combining two of the premier complementary industrial businesses offers the opportunity to drive significant innovation and growth with meaningful revenue and cost synergies supported by secular growth trends and diverse end market exposures.","And personally, I couldn't be more excited about creating a premier pure-play HVAC and transport refrigeration company as Trane Technologies. Our climate businesses have clearly differentiated performance and we see significant opportunity as a pure-play to build on this performance for our people, customers and shareholders.","And with that, we will be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Steve Tusa","Hi. Good morning guys.","Mike Lamach","Good morning Steve.","Sue Carter","Good morning.","Chris Kuehn","Good morning.","Steve Tusa","Just a question on the kind of timing of everything that's happening here. I think you might have touched on an update but when would you expect to kind of have a little bit of a deeper dive on the new TT business, from an Investor Day perspective?","Sue Carter","So Steve, it's Sue. And Chris can join in with that. The first thing we are going to do is, finish off the very detailed work that's going on right now on the separation of the industrial businesses and then start building off of the base that we have got. We will have to go through and issue some historical financial statements and then transition into that. But Chris, your phone?","Chris Kuehn","Sure. Hi Steve. Good to meet you here virtually over the phone. To Sue's point, I think there is a fair amount of effort still left to get done. We are on track for the RMT closure to be completed here in early 2020. But right after we do complete separation, we have got some requirements to restate some prior year financial statements and I would expect around that time, we would provide more information around the historical view of Trane Technologies at that point. I think from Investor Day perspective, we are targeting kind of that September timeframe with respect to giving us a chance of having a couple of quarters of closes under the new Trane Technologies structure and then be ready to walk with a little more details here in the fall.","Mike Lamach","Steve, this is Mike here. Just one second, Steve. I would say that just from an internal planning perspective, once we filed all that we need to file around the restated financials, targeting something like a five to 10 day period after that, after you have digested it, to come back and provide more guidance. And so, we will likely structure our call, put a presentation together and lay out the 2020 guidance. And then we will reserve until the Investor Day, report back on the last three years and then restate going forward likely another three-year view for Trane Technologies through 2023.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And thanks for the color on all the TK moving parts. When will you expect the orders comp to get easier? Is that kind of a -- just remind us when you would think these order should bottom out?","Mike Lamach","Yes. Steve, the way our revenue bottoms out, first I would say that you are probably just going to see the bottom in both Europe and North America in the first quarter and then it's going to still be negative obviously as you can see from the graphs we have on slide 21 of the deck for the balance of the year. But from a bookings perspective, you recover obviously a little bit quicker than that. Although there is a fair amount of book in turn, I think that will happen in the business and so the comps get easy third, typically fourth quarter. So second, third and fourth quarter, you get to see bookings. I think, improving. Revenue progressively improves throughout the year in both regions.","Steve Tusa","Okay. Great. Thanks for the color.","Mike Lamach","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Julian Mitchell","Hi. Good morning and thanks Sue for all the help. Maybe just a question around the climate revenue growth. Just wondered, within that low single digit commercial HVAC market assumption for 2020, what are you assuming for Asia given orders were down through most of 2019? And how much of a jump in the U.S. do you think you will have this year after such a good 2019?","Mike Lamach","Yes. Julian, I want to be very careful not to mix market expectations versus our internal businesses. So the market, I think that North America remains very healthy. We will see growth across the board equipment, parts and services. I think that we feel good about what will happen in institutional, particularly education and healthcare. We expect industrial and commercial also remain healthy. And then if I translate to our internal view in North America as an example, we end the year at 17% high teens kind of backlog over the prior year. So the setup for us and the setup for the market look pretty good.","In Europe, where you have got the sort of flattish expectation in 2020 and still some lingering Brexit execution uncertainties, we will continue to outgrow the market as we have been really based on the whole sort of sustainability focus and the go-to-market strategy that we have had there. So we expect to grow the market at least a multiple of two or three there, I would assume, off a very slow growth in the underlying market in Europe.","Middle East, Africa HVAC is going to be positive but the patterns are always lumpy because particularly in the Middle East, these orders tend to be large district cooling plants. And so they are very large orders when they come and so you get a little bit of an anomaly there.","And then actually healthy growth in China and for the AP region in general. And again here, the backlog that we have got in China, fourth quarter versus prior fourth quarter, is up low double digits. So a good set up for us coming into 2020. So we feel pretty good about what's happening in the commercial HVAC space.","And residential, similar view, 80% of the market for us is replacement. Underlying markets still look good. Consumer confidence still remains relatively high. U.S. economy remains relatively healthy. Unemployment is low. GDP is stable. So pricing remains healthy. I think the market there appears to be pretty solid going into 2020.","Julian Mitchell","Thanks, Mike, for all the color. And then just my second question around climate margins. Just looking at your margin guide for the segment for 2020, backing out what you are saying for Thermo King or transport, it implies the non-transport piece margins are up maybe 80 basis points or so in 2020. Just wanted to check that was roughly in line with what you were thinking and to what degree you think that number is backend loaded, again excluding transport?","Mike Lamach","Yes. I mean, at starting point I will let Sue and Chris chime in, but you really end up with a pretty low quarter four to comp that we just completed when you think about most of those impacts really were center hit on the commercial HVAC markets. And so the roadmap we have got here is still a strong pricing environment, probably a moderating materials environment.","Our productivity pipeline looks robust. It should cover all inflation. Volume should drop through to gross margins. We don't see anything there. And we don't see a repeat issues that would done in the fourth quarter. I mean obviously we talked about the silver lining perhaps and the cash conversion, but some of the inventory adjustments were partially result of just an immense amount of the factory consolidations that were done starting in 2018 and through 2019 and those don't repeat. That smoothes out as well.","So I feel like we are in great shape on commercial. I think residential continues to hum along. A good data conversion there. I don't see any changes there. And even in a market like Latin America, we had great success in 2019. It appears to be recovering, particularly Brazil I would highlight. Margins there are good for us and I think that can help contribute as well.","Julian Mitchell","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","John Walsh","Hi. Good morning.","Mike Lamach","Good morning John.","Chris Kuehn","Good morning.","John Walsh","And I will echo the sentiment. I thank you too, Sue, for all the help.","Sue Carter","Thank you John.","John Walsh","Sure. I wanted to maybe get a mark-to-market on where we stand with kind of the controls and the connected buildings platform. You know, I know last time I think we got update on that revenue base. It was north of $1 billion and you guys used to throw out some metrics around the number of connected buildings or the portfolios of buildings that you are monitoring. Can you kind of mark-to-market us on that?","Mike Lamach","Yes. John, I would start with the caveat that if a company can actually tell you the revenue generation from a digital business, they probably don't have a digital strategy because the whole strategy really hits every bit of the value stream from the way that you design and develop systems to not fail all the way through to the way you monetize offerings in the service business through to the way that you utilize fixed service contracts, fixed service agreements to deliver service in more creative and better ways for the customer. So you put that all together and it's in everything that we are doing. So it continues to be the norm.","I would say, 100% of what we are shipping out in the applied space today is absolutely communicating. If not inside the customers' firewall, it's coming across to us with important data. We are acting on it. At last count, I think we monetized in our commercial space alone about 20 different offerings that we put together in that space that use digital to monetize. Same thing will hold through to TK.","Interesting with TK, I am just going to kind of maybe skip to this as there is a little bit of a story here. When you look at ACT's 2020 forecast of 37,500 units, we look at the replacement of units on the road today in North America and we get to a number of about 35,000 units. I mean you can think about more than 90% of the market ACT is representing could be counted just through replacing units. Well, natural part of the reason that we know where these units are and whether or not they are a candidate for replacement would be through things like the telematics that would tell us how systems are operating. And so that's is a great example of how the game really changes when you have a got a complete digital strategy across these businesses.","John Walsh","Got you. Thanks for that color. And then, you know, just looking at the investment in other line, obviously you covered a little bit in the prepared remarks. But you know that's been a long time since we have seen that flat. You have the comment saying gross investment spending remains at high levels. As we think about 2020 and beyond, does that flip back to be a headwind? Or are you kind of plateauing right now on how you are thinking about your investment spending?","Mike Lamach","Well, we are coming through some really major platform investments and a multiyear investment for Thermo King, let's just say in particular. That's going to tend to kind of flatten out there but likely not in the Trane business, particularly with some of the regulatory changes that will happen between now and 2023. So it's at a very high rate. A good estimate for 2020 is probably you know as low as 20 bips of incremental and maybe as high as 50 bips of incremental that will go into the Trane Technologies portfolio for 2020.","Sue Carter","John, I will also add that as you think about those investments, that's such a huge part of the capital allocation strategy and what we do with the business that we are a great generator of cash. We have processes throughout the company with investment review boards looking at various and sundry things. We want our businesses to bring us great ROI projects that continue our growth and continue the great capital allocation strategy that we have got. So as you think about Trane Technologies going forward, I see that great cash generation as an opportunity and a way to really do great capital allocation with investing in the businesses. And I think that should continue and I think you would want that to continue.","Chris Kuehn","I will just affirm here, Sue, this is Chris, that it will continue that way knowing that we have a strong free cash from generator in Trane Technologies and we will be following those similar priorities for capital deployment.","John Walsh","Great. Thank you for the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you. Good morning everyone and thanks and good luck, Sue.","Sue Carter","Thank you.","Jeff Sprague","I appreciate all the help. Two questions on TK. First, just aftermarket in general. Has it been your experience historically that when you get into OE equipment downdrafts that aftermarket actually does grow? Certainly we have seen in machinery and equipment markets that aftermarket doesn't turn out to be quite as countercyclical as people would have hoped. So I would imagine, it would typically decline less, but as a question is, does it actually tend to grow in those down cycles?","Mike Lamach","Yes. Jeff, there is a number of things that I think that we can count on and in some ways try to control even with a trailer decline forecast for 2020 and that's one of them. So if the standard aftermarket growth rates would be something kind of in the normalized 3% to 5% range, as an example, if all 35,000 North American units that are probably up for replacement wouldn't be replaced which would be an extreme view, you would likely see something in the high single digits. Our experience has been something maybe 8% to 10% if that were to be the case. So that tends to always pan its way out.","The other thing that is interesting, when you look auxiliary power unit bolt-on rate, I think in 2016 we were talking about something in the 10% to 11% bolt-on rate there. And we said, look, we think we can move this thing and for every 2.4 units of APUs we sell, it equates to one trailer unit. That was a strategy to help us through 2016 and 2017. We actually have increased that bolt-on rate by 10 points. So we ended the year in the low 20s. The remarkable thing about that is that's with the denominator, right, increasing dramatically in terms of the what was built in terms of OEM tractors put out into the marketplace.","Other interesting thing there is the replacements factor that we see out there for APUs going into 2020 is roughly 102,000 units that are available. That's compared to a 99,000 unit market. So here you have got a replacement rate opportunity that's actually bigger than a new complete. So you know by taking the same experience we have around bolt-on rates moving three, four points a year, with even a more aged APU fleet out there, that's an opportunity for us.","The NPD launch as I have I talked to the new platforms should be good and we have worked three years to get these things ready for the market. And as I said in my remarks, truck, bus, rail, those will all grow too. Small truck in particular. Bus, rail, all will grow too. So those are sort of factors that we can count on I think in 2020.","Jeff Sprague","Great. And then just a follow-up on slide 21. I appreciate you trying to help us here and that you are noting the scale isn't exact. But the position of the plus 20 and the minus 40 looks pretty proportional to where the zero is, right. And so everything on that chart with the exception of APU looks like it's down less than 20% with all other actually positive. So just a little unclear how or why you would be guiding Q1 down 20% in aggregate?","Mike Lamach","I can't speak of the scale. Maybe Zac or Shane, who drew the scale can talk to that.","Zac Nagle","Yes. I mean, Jeff, the market will be down close to 30% for trailers in the first quarter, North America trailers. Europe trailers, a similar number. APUs would be down 35% to 40% range. So that's really how you get there. Balance of the market being the other 40%. So it's really the decline in the areas that really outgrew in the fourth quarter of 2018, which were trailer and APUs. And those are down right now. That's the reason","Jeff Sprague","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Your line is open.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Good morning guys. Sue, thanks for all your help.","Sue Carter","Thanks Andy.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Mike, you have been talking about your focus on sustainability and improving efficiency for a long time now. But given the continued strong bookings, especially North American commercial HVAC, are you just seeing more awareness and acceptance of your HVAC systems capability, especially in markets like office and education to help meet your customers' sustainability goals as they look to replace their equipment? And is that allowing the business to increasingly look better than the macro data that we see, like construction starts?","Mike Lamach","Yes. I mean first of all, it's a passion inside the company. What I am telling around company purpose is something that gets deeply ingrained and even how investments and projects get evaluated because that's how we think we are going to win the marketplace. And so it's very tied out in terms of how we deploy goals and how we look at products going forward. So that, for sure, I think is a critical factor in all of this.","When you look at some of the Dodge data as an example and the Put-in-place which people look to, it's interesting and I am just going to talk obviously about North America here which is where the Dodge data is more relevant. You take our commercial business and you split it right down the middle 50-50 between equipments and services, the 50% that's equipment you get 60% to 70% of that which is replacement which generally is not ever going to be reported on Dodge Put-in-place because we are negotiating service agreements, service contracts, retrofits. So that really only has the Dodge Put-in-place data addressing about 15% to 20% of the business. And so as folks try to read through that to our commercial business on Dodge data or ABI data, you are probably only predicting 15% to 20% of what that looks like.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Mike, thanks for that. And then just following up on some of the comments you made on China commercial HVAC. If I look at the bookings, they look like they turned down a little in Q4. But you mentioned backlogs up low double digits. So was it just kind of timing? Can you give more color on China? I assume you continue to grow service penetration. What particular end markets are helping you in China?","Mike Lamach","Well, first of all, when we talk about Asia in particular, we have to remember that China sort of half of the business and the rest is the rest of the region. China was actually relatively strong. Bookings looked okay. Backlog, as I mentioned, up double digit year-over-year. And so a lot of weakness was outside of China and I think in some ways you see those markets recovering. You can think about electronics in South Korea. You can think about those sorts of markets which were pretty tough. But we expect healthy growth in China and for the region in 2020. Strength in healthcare and we think a rebound in some of technology segments, where we have been a big player historically.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Thanks Mike.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks. Good morning, everyone and congratulations to both Sue and Chris. Sue, you will be missed for sure.","Sue Carter","Thank you Joe.","Chris Kuehn","Thank you.","Joe Ritchie","So maybe just my first question just following up on that China question. Mike, clearly you guys have done a great job growing into Tier 3, Tier 4 cities and the attachment rates. Obviously a lot of concern right now, given the virus outbreak. I am curious, as you look forward and you think about like previous times, whether it's SARS impacting your business. Have you seen any impact at all at this juncture from the virus? And how has this kind of played out for you guys historically?","Mike Lamach","Well, first of all, we have no impact yet to employees, which is fortunate. I think we have sent 650,000 masks, is what I saw, to China. So we are trying to do our part there on that. I would tell you that what we believe, we know today is that best case would be China essentially going back to work on February 10. This is sort of the market in general and sort of our business as well. So if that's the case, I mean you are talking about really a week of production and that's just going to get pushed. I mean that demand is there. It will get pushed out. Maybe it will get absorbed in the quarter if it's possible to do, if not it will get pushed to the second quarter. So it's fluid.","We are watching it closely. We are looking at the supply chain as well. We generally have strong supply chains. We generally tend to work in region for region. But to the extent we have got any Chinese components being imported, say, into the U.S. or Europe, we are generally keeping those cases eight to 10 weeks of inventory on hand. So again, a one week or two week issue is not going to be a problem for us with regard to that. But Joe, it's fluid and I am hoping that this thing contained and best case looks to be people are back to work February 10.","Joe Ritchie","Got it. Okay. That's helpful color, Mike. And then maybe just my follow-up here. Slide 21, super helpful. So nice job, Zac and Shane. Just curious, as you kind of think about the climate business ex-transport, is there anything we need to be aware of from either growth and margin standpoint as you think about cadence for 2020?","Mike Lamach","None that I can think of. Guys, anybody have any color on that?","Sue Carter","No. The way I was thinking about, Joe, is as think about the markets, when you think about HVAC with commercial and residential, it's going to follow the same cadence that it has historically followed with Q2 and Q3 being our stronger quarters. So I think that stays in line with what we are doing. We do think that Q1 is going to be a quarter where the volume is tough in buildings. So I think that one is an area where you can think about Q1 maybe not quite being at historical levels of contribution.","The other thing that I would say and I sound like I just think about cash, but I think as you think about climate in Trane Technologies, we talked about this at the time of the standup, we believe that we are still going to generate 100% or greater than net income over time in the climate business. It does tend to be a little more back half loaded than what we have seen. Although I am sort of laughing because we did have such a huge fourth quarter for cash flow this year. But I think that's one of the impacts that you might see. So revenue sort of following normal patterns other than the TK guide that we have already talked about and cash flow more backend loaded.","Mike Lamach","Yes. And I will say, Joe, is that, going back to commercial with North America which has been just incredibly strong and it's strong across the board meaning that even the unitary and services growth have been double. Units have been in the teens. But the applied growth has been extraordinary. The winter rates there, the pull-through of systems has been excellent. Now that does initially book and ship at generally lower margins than the unitary business, but of course you get the long service tail on the applied business. So in the long run, it's a great business. It's a win. But it does put a little bit of mix pressure within train and commercial and that again as one is those mix pressures we saw in quarter four as well. And so historically I usually get the question and I didn't it so far. But I will talk about it. We end up historically something in the 15% range of Q1 EPS for the total year and last three years has been that. Six years has been a little bit lower than that. I would tell you, sort of a safer guide here would be something between 14% and 15% just as a result of that strong mix differential between applied unitary and between the TK and Trane.","Joe Ritchie","Yes. Twosome must have been caught off guard. So thanks for all the color.","Zac Nagle","Yes. Just to add to that, since we are guiding OI at this point, I would say, the average for OI for climate as a percentage of the year has been in the 15% range. It will probably be in the 14% to 15% range this year. So a little lighter in the first quarter.","Mike Lamach","Thanks Zac. I am so used to EPS after all this time that we are going to get to talk about OI.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Andrew Obin","Yes. Good morning.","Mike Lamach","Hi.","Chris Kuehn","Good morning.","Andrew Obin","Sue, it was such a pleasure working with you, I think, actually with multiple companies. So congrats and good luck.","Sue Carter","Thank you Andrew.","Andrew Obin","Just a question, you know, residential construction, can you just walk us through your framework? How much visibility do you think on resi conception cycle over the next several years? And what gives you confidence that they will continue sort of to be positive?","Mike Lamach","Andy, it's such a small part of kind of what drives our business that we would far from be the experts on giving you a forecast there. And if you think about the res equipment business being probably 10% of the company going forward and you think about 80% of our business there being replacement, new construction doesn't move the needle one way or the other for us really in a residential market. So I would probably defer to some of better forecast that are out there on that one than tell you that we have got a good read on that.","Andrew Obin","Yes. I was just asking more as a leading indicator for non-res. Another question I have for you, how should we think about the Trane's market share over the next couple of years? You have done a fantastic job. So how sustainable it is? And what are the headwinds?","Mike Lamach","Well, I mean, when we guide, we are generally guiding on, we think the market is going to be pricing, some sense of volume, some sense of mix. We always target our teams with market share and margin expansion. So the goal there is always higher than what you see and I think that's a healthy thing for us do. I feel really good about what's coming out in the marketplace. I feel good about a lot of the training and development we have had around the company in terms systems, sales and some of the more sophisticated offerings that we do around services. So I feel like it's lot of ways to win. It's not always on the product technology, although we are a leader there and that's a heavy part of the investment but it's also in the way that you go to market in a way that the expertise gets played out in the channel. And as you think about, I have always said in the commercial space, these are always going to be people that are 100% dedicated on behalf of the company. This is not something where you see distributors doing for us. That's such an important thing when you are trying to drive an overall system strategy and trying to sell total cost of ownership over the long run, it's a sophisticated sale generally done by very technical people and we have been it for a long time. And that's something that's very difficult to replicate and something we always invest in that capability. That's a big part of the secret sauce, I guess, of the business.","Andrew Obin","Thank you very much.","Operator","And that's all the time we have for questions today. I will turn the call back over to Zac Nagle for closing comments.","Zac Nagle","I like to thank everyone for joining on today's call and to remind everyone that we will be available for questions as always today and in the coming days and then we look forward to connecting with you soon on the road, in upcoming conferences and roadshows. Thank you very much.","Operator","That concludes today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Janet Pfeffer, Vice President of Strategy, Business Development and Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Janet Pfeffer","Good morning. Thank you, Sean. Welcome to our Second Quarter 2013 Conference Call. We released earnings at 7:00 this morning, and the release is posted on our website. We'll be broadcasting, in addition to this call, through our website at ingersollrand.com, where you can find the slide presentation that we'll be referring to this morning. This call will be recorded and archived on our website.","If you please go to Slide 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated. This release also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release.","A couple of things to note before I turn it over to Mike. Similar to last quarter, we will be talking to adjusted margins during our commentary, which exclude restructuring and spin-related costs. Our news release and tables give you the reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted margins. And this is consistent with how we gave guidance in both February and in April.","And to remind everyone also, earlier this year, we transferred a business line from Security Technologies to residential security. That was about $20 million of revenue in the quarter, and it's about $80 million for the full year 2013. There is no impact at the consolidated levels. In the charts and comments, we'll focus on the year-over-year change in revenue and orders for those businesses on a comparable basis, so as to best represent the underlying performance.","Now to introduce the participants on this morning's call: Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO; Steve Shawley, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Joe Fimbianti, Director of Investor Relations.","With that, please go to Slide 3, and I'll turn it over to Mike.","Michael W. Lamach","Okay. Thanks, Janet. Good morning, and thanks for joining us on today's call. We delivered growth and profitability above our earnings commitment in the second quarter, with solid operational execution across the company. On top of this, we completed several key milestones related to the security spin, as well as a successful debt offering. I'm proud of all the great people in our company for these accomplishments and thank them for their personal and collective commitment to the success of Ingersoll Rand and ultimately, in the successful launch of the new security company, Allegion.","Our revenues for the second quarter were up 3% versus last year, both on a reported basis and excluding foreign exchange, reflecting top line performance just above the top of our guidance range. Revenues were up in Climate, Residential and Security Technologies, but we saw a decline in Industrial. Orders were up 2%.","Adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.14. That's $0.06 above the midpoint of our guidance range of $1.05 to $1.10. Better performance from operations essentially delivered all of the upside to guidance.","Adjusted margin increased 20 basis points. Operations with 4 corporate unallocated costs increased adjusted margins by 80 basis points. Versus 2012's second quarter, adjusted operating margins were up in 3 of the sectors. Residential delivered a 330 basis point improvement, Climate margin was up 90 basis points and Security margins were up 50 basis points. Lower revenues were a headwind for Industrial. Corporate costs were higher in the quarter as expected due to higher benefit costs and increased investments related to our IT transformation.","This marks our ninth consecutive quarter of a positive GAAP between pricing and direct material inflation. Our lean focus again showed significant results in the implemented value streams. And we continue to invest in the future of the business, funding significant new product development, investing in the new IT platform and building our services footprint.","Spin-off and restructure costs were $0.11 in the quarter. We continued our share repurchase program, repurchasing approximately 9 million shares in the quarter. We still expect to spend the current $2 billion authorization by the end of the first quarter of next year.","We continue to be on track with the spin and have completed several key milestones. We filed a Form 10 in mid-June, right on schedule. We named 5 excellent outside directors, as well as the Chairman and CEO, Dave Petratis. And we announced the name for the new company, Allegion.","In June, we completed a successful debt offering for Ingersoll Rand, securing $1.55 billion at attractive interest rates and maturity profiles. So it was a quarter with many accomplishments and milestones to take note of.","And now, Steve will take you through the second quarter results in more detail, and I'll be back with an outlook for the third quarter and full year.","Steven R. Shawley","Thanks, Mike. Please go to Slide #4. Orders for the second quarter of 2013 were up 2% on a reported basis and up 1%, excluding currency.","Climate orders were up 4%. Global commercial HVAC bookings were up low-single digits. Transport orders were up mid-teens. Industrial orders were flat, with order growth in the Americas offset by lower bookings in Europe and Asia.","Residential bookings were down 3% on a comparable basis. We believe the residential bookings performance could be a result of the significant improvements made in the HVAC product delivery cycles over the past year. Improved lead times have allowed customers to place orders much closer to required delivery dates, which is creating a temporary shifting of orders to later dates compared to last year. Commercial security orders in the quarter were up 3% on a comparable basis.","Please go to Slide #5. Here's a look at the revenue trends by segment and region. Top half of the chart shows revenue change for each sector. For the total company, second quarter revenues were up 3% versus last year on both a reported basis and excluding currency. Climate revenues increased 5%, with HVAC revenues up low-single digits and transport revenues up high-single digits.","Industrial revenues were down 3%, Residential was up 7% on a comparable basis. Commercial and Security revenues were up 3% on a comparable basis. I'll give you more color on each sector in the next few slides.","On the bottom of the chart, which shows revenue change on a geographic basis, revenues were up 4% in the Americas, while Europe and Asia were each down 1%, excluding foreign exchange.","Please go to Slide #6. This chart walks through the change in adjusted operating margin from second quarter 2012 of 12.8% to second quarter 2013, which was 13%. Negative mix and foreign exchange collectively created a 50 basis point headwind in the margins. Our pricing programs continued to outpace material inflation, adding 70 basis points to margin. Productivity, offset by other inflation, was 50 basis points accretive to margins. Year-over-year investments and other items were higher by 50 basis points.","In the gray box at the top of the page, overall leverage was 21%. Leverage in the sectors was 40%, partially offset by higher corporate investment spend. The box in the middle of the page shows the revenue and adjusted operating margin by sector and in total. Operations, excluding corporate, increased adjusted margins by 80 basis points. Corporate costs were higher in the quarter due primarily to higher benefit costs and increased investments related to our IT transformation.","Please go to Slide #7. The Climate Solutions segment includes Trane commercial HVAC and Thermo King transport refrigeration. Total revenues for the second quarter were $2.1 billion and is up 5% versus last year on a reported basis and up 5% excluding currency.","Global commercial HVAC orders were up low-single digits. Orders were down in the Americas but up in Europe and Asia. Trane commercial HVAC second quarter revenues were up low-single digits. HVAC revenues were up in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Asia.","Commercial HVAC equipment revenues were up mid-single digits; while HVAC parts, services and solutions revenues was down slightly versus prior year, impacted by lower contracting revenues, which had a benefit of a large contract in last year's second quarter.","Thermo King orders were up mid-teens versus 2012 second quarter, with Americas trailer orders up over 40%. Thermo King revenues were up high-single digits.","The adjusted operating margin for Climate Solutions was 13.4% in the quarter, 90 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2012 due to volume, productivity and pricing, partially offset by inflation and higher investment spending.","Please go to Slide #8. Industrial Technologies second quarter revenues were $763 million, down 3% on a reported basis and 4% excluding currency. Air and Productivity revenues were down mid-single digits versus last year. Revenues in the Americas were down slightly, while Europe and Asia are each down low teens. Air and Productivity orders were down low-single digits. Higher orders in the Americas and Asia were offset by lower orders in Europe.","Club Car revenues in the quarter were up mid-single digits, and orders were up mid-teens versus prior year. Industrial's adjusted operating margin of 16.3% was down 100 basis points compared with last year. Pricing and productivity were more than offset by lower volumes and inflation.","Please go to Slide #9. In the Residential business, second quarter revenues of $713 million were up 9% compared with last year. Adjusting for the product line move, comparable revenues were up 7%. Residential HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits versus last year. Revenues for the residential security portion of the sector were up low teens on a comparable basis, with increases in the new builder channel in South America partially offset by lower big box revenues.","Sector operating margin of 11.2% was up 330 basis points compared with 2012, as pricing, volume and productivity more than offset inflation and adverse mix.","We continue to execute our deliberate strategy to improve product depth and channel performance while increasing margins. As the second quarter margins would indicate, we are pleased with the progress and the team's ability to balance those objectives.","Please go to Slide #10. Revenues for Security Technologies were $399 million, down 3% on a reported basis and up 3% when adjusted for the product line move. Americas revenues were up mid-single digits. Revenues were down mid-single digits in Europe and up double-digits in Asia. Bookings on a comparable basis were up low-single digits.","Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 21.6%, up 50 basis points from last year, as productivity, price realization and favorable mix were partially offset by inflation and higher investment spending.","Please go to Slide #11. We finished the second quarter with working capital of 3.5% of revenues. Working capital and cash flow levels are consistent with our historical seasonal performance. Year-to-date, available cash flow is $100 million higher than last year's first half.","With that, I'll turn it back to Mike to take you through the guidance.","Michael W. Lamach","Okay. Thanks, Steve, and please go to Slide 12. As a reminder, for purposes of giving guidance for 2013, it's on an as-is basis. It assumes the current Ingersoll Rand with the current 4 operating sectors is in place for the full 12 months of 2013.","As we announced in December, we expect the security spend to take place in the fourth quarter. But to be clear, the guidance does not reflect the spend. Consistent with our April guidance, we've broken out spin and restructured costs from the core EPS guidance in order to give you the best representation of the company without the impact of the impending spend.","To give you an update on our market views, let's start with U.S. nonresidential. Construction starts and Put in Place trends have shifted a little since our prior guidance, with total Put in Place outlook was slightly lowered and the mix changed. Commercial and industrial expected growth got a little stronger, more than offset over by a lower institutional outlook.","Institutional markets are expected to be down for the year by 5% versus down 3% in the prior market forecast. The 2013 outlook for commercial and industrial Put in Place was raised from 8% to 9%. Increases in bank and office buildings and retail support our view of a stronger second half versus first half in unitary HVAC.","Over the Applied forecast, it's lower base on the lower institutional outlook, so our overall Trane commercial outlook is just slightly lower than it was last time.","We continue to expect low single-digit growth in North American commercial HVAC overall, and flat to a low single-digit decline in North American commercial security. We expect North American truck trailer markets to be fairly flat on a unit basis in 2013.","U.S. residential new construction market continued to show good growth. We expect industry motor-bearing unit shipments for the year to be up high-single digits for 2013, driven largely by new constructions. We expect to see R-22 to be a lower percentage of the market, probably down over 20% versus last year.","Asian HVAC markets are expected to be fairly flat in 2013. China HVAC is expected to be up low- to mid-single digits. We saw good HVAC bookings progression in the quarter, which, as we said, was needed to underpin the balance of the year forecast in Asia and specifically, China HVAC.","Industrial Technologies saw a softening in most markets in the quarter. In China in particular, we have spoken about the need to see acceleration in industrial bookings in quarter 2 to support the prior forecast. That did not occur as the government has tightened credits to support to address overcapacitized industries, so we adjusted our second half outlook accordingly.","Our Asian security business, which is more influenced by the timing of large infrastructure projects, should be up high-single digits for the year. And overall, the outlook for Europe, Middle East and Africa, taken together, should be up slightly across the company.","Based on our results in the second quarter and our visibility through the remainder of the year, we are updating our revenue outlook and tightening our earnings guidance range for the year. Our revenue outlook for 2013 is now $14.2 billion to $14.4 billion, which is a $100 million reduction to the midpoint of our prior guidance, which equates to 1% to 3% growth versus 2012.","Translating that to our outlook by sector, we expect Climate Solutions revenue to be up 1% to 3%, which is the same as the prior guidance. We're adjusting our outlook for Industrial Technologies. Industrial revenues are now forecasted to be in the range of up 1% to down 1%. Residential is still expected to be up 8% to 10% on a reported basis and up 4% to 6% on a comparable basis. And for Security Technologies, we're adjusting the top end of the revenue range down slightly to reflect the lower upside forecast in the second half. We expect Security to be down 3% to 4% on a reported basis and up 1% to 2% on a comparable basis.","Please go to Slide 13. We are maintaining our full year EPS midpoint but tightening the range of our guidance for full year EPS from spinning operations to $3.50 to $3.60. The full year tax rate forecast for 2013 is still expected to be 23%. This excludes onetime costs and restructuring of $0.65 to $0.75, updated to include $0.15 for the cost of early retiring the 2013 and 2014 debt, which was not in the prior forecast, and bringing up the bottom end of the range for spin-related costs and restructuring based on our latest estimates. We'll continue to update our estimates as the spin date gets closer and we finalize the remaining restructuring plans.","To focus on the third quarter guidance, refer to the right-hand column on this chart. Third quarter 2013 revenues are forecast to be $3.65 billion to $3.75 billion. That translates to a range of up 2% to 4% versus the third quarter of 2012.","Adjusted third quarter earnings per share are forecast to be $1.07 to $1.12. We're assuming a share count of 295 million shares and an ongoing tax rate of 23%. Onetime costs are expected to be about $0.25 in the quarter, and that includes $0.15 for the cost of early retiring the 2013 and 2014 debt.","For the full year 2013, we still expect to generate available cash flow of about $1.1 billion, excluding onetime and restructuring costs.","In closing, we are pleased to deliver a solid second quarter. We continue to feel good about our progress. Our focus is on positioning our company to continue to grow earnings and cash flow, with or without help from markets. We've implemented a consistent and shareholder-focused capital allocation program. We've proactively worked to reduce cost and improve productivity while still making prudent investments for the future. We continue to invest in new products and service offerings in our IT infrastructure and further developing our people and our operating capabilities.","The spin of Allegion is on track, and I'm pleased to have Dave on board as of August 5 as its leader. I'm proud of the progress we've made and the results we've delivered, and I'm optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead for us.","So now, Steve and I would be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. So just looking at the EBIT bridge and if you sort of look at the productivity, net of other inflation, that was running at about a 50 bps tailwind to margins in Q2. That's lower than the sort of 90 bps affecting Q1. What do you think is the full year there? Is there just something on the timing of projects quarter-to-quarter and the run rate is more like sort of a first half blended number? Or how are you thinking about that for the second half?","Steven R. Shawley","Yes, I think so, Julian. The -- we said right along that we expect to see about 50 bps coming from a difference between -- you're talking about pricing versus direct material inflation, I assume, right?","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Well, productivity.","Steven R. Shawley","Productivity in general?","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, the productivity net of other inflation line.","Steven R. Shawley","Okay. We'll address that. The...","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess that was a 50 bps contribution, I think, in Q2, and it was more like 90 in Q1. Just -- is that just lumpiness in the full year is going to be somewhere between the 270 or so?","Michael W. Lamach","Actually, yes, if you look at the second half, it's more of a blended rate, the second half compared to the -- if you look at the first 2 quarters and the blended rate, that's lower than you have in the second half. You can see a little increase in productivity, gross productivity in the back half of the year. You do have a little bit of sort of that tame inflation environment. So you do get a little bit better in that productivity to other inflation in that regard. But Steve was kind of going down the path of also answering the pricing question, which has been good to us halfway through the year. And I think as we look at the back half of the year just to kind of maybe ramp the question there, I think we'll see something in the order of 40 to 60 basis points in Q3 and Q4. I mean, that price to material inflation component as well. So I do think that it supports Q3 forecast. The Q4 forecast would put our operating leverage between 40% and 50%, kind of in the mid-40s. And that supports, I think, what we've done in the past and also supports the forecast that we have for both productivity and pricing.","Steven R. Shawley","And the other thing about the other inflation, that includes all salary increases. And we have -- we're on a pretty much of an April 1 salary merit increase schedule. So the first quarter is always going to look a little better than the rest of the year because of that factor, Julian.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then just on the -- mix was a big issue in Q1 that you highlighted in the 3 of the 4 segments. You said it would get better in Q2. Clearly, it's got a lot better. How are you thinking about mix to the second half?","Michael W. Lamach","Well, I think mix for the second half is going to be generally better than what we've seen in the first. A couple of reasons. One, the residential mixdown of SEER seems to be leveling out. We're definitely seeing sort of a bottoming of the average SEER rating there, which was a big, big factor in our mix issues up through the first quarter. We're also seeing a good mix of Thermo King business through the middle part of the year here, which is going to help the mix certainly in the third quarter. And I would say that we still have the mix problem. It's probably somewhat in the industrial sector, because in addition to this general volume issues in the industrial sector, it's shifting away from tools to more complete air compressors. So we have a little bit of a negative mix there, offsetting some positive developments in some of the other sectors.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Casey with Wells Fargo Securities.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","First, on the EU commercial HVAC order commentary, that's consistent with what some other companies have said kind of recently. But it's still kind of surprising what's going -- that order commentary against what seems to be going on over there. What do you think is driving that? And is there any regional concentration that you're seeing?","Michael W. Lamach","Well, we play across the entire region, including the Middle East as well. And so I think we have low expectations for Western Europe, and they're better than what we have thought. We're continuing to see good growth and solid bookings coming out of the Middle East as well, which is in those numbers. Our Unitary business in EMEA is really up nicely. And that has to do, in some regards, with new product. And a plant now producing yellow [ph] products of course [ph] in Eastern Europe as well, and I think we're more competitive on that product. But yes, I mean, Western Europe is a little better than we would've thought, coming off a little low. Middle East is pretty strong. And India, which is in that number as well, is about what we expected.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on the Climate Solutions in general, the segment margin performance, specifically the strong 36% incremental contribution surprised me, and it was very positive. Is that what we should expect from this segment with top line benefit or was there something special going on this quarter?","Michael W. Lamach","Well, I'd say what's special for the last 3 or 4 years is Trane commercial just made new and new sort of leverage highs. In fact, if you go all the way back through the related history of American Standard and Trane, back as far as we can really look back, we've probably added 10 to 12 points to the average operating leverage in that business. And I think that's got to do with a lot of hard work around bank consolidations, the co-location of some manufacturing with our Industrial business, a lot of new product development, product and higher margins coming out of the business, focus on the service business and what we've been able to do there. So interestingly, when you look at the operating leverage between Trane and TK in the quarter, both businesses were over 30%. So I would actually expect Trane to continue a good run. I think that we're wanting to obviously have to give a new normal at Trane. And last 3 years, they've proven that they can do that. And then we would expect a little bit better operating leverage actually coming out of TK in the back half of the year, again, supporting more of that fourth-quarter stretch that we have.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes. So I just wanted to dig into your Climate outlook for the full year, Mike. You gave some good color in terms of expectations by Applied and Unitary, et cetera. But the 1% to 3%, that's a decel from what you did in 2Q. Comps get a little bit easier, orders increased sequentially. So I'm just trying to understand why we wouldn't be at the high end of that range or even a little bit better, maybe just add a little bit more color in terms of the second half outlook versus what we saw in 2Q?","Michael W. Lamach","Yes. Well, I mean, let's first talk about kind of where there's strength and where we need to see it. We were placing a bet on China, and that was rewarded. So unlike the industrial businesses where there -- it's really more of a government policy reaction, the commercial and businesses that we're playing in, health care, hotels, the non-overcapacitized industries in China, we saw the nice bookings growth there and a nice revenue relationship there. So that was good for us. And we've talked about Europe, and we've seen strength there. Really, it's all about the applied market now in North America, taking another notch down and a lot of the readings that we're getting. And although we are seeing great performance coming out of the Unitary business and bookings and growth in share, it's just not enough, the mix growth, the common institutional days. So now it only really drops a little bit. When we think about the $100 million drop from the midpoint to the midpoint revenue guidance, bulk of that comes out of the Industrial business. Small piece comes out of Trane, largely the Applied business in North America and a small piece comes out of our Security business, largely in Europe. But for Climate Solutions, we need to have second half growth of 3% versus first half growth of 1.2%. So it really is an acceleration first half -- back half to first half.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then the percent you just referenced in China and Asia HVAC, it stands in contrast to what we saw in Security. I'm just wondering, do you view the bulk strength in HVAC in Asia as a good lead for security? Or are there different mixes that we should take into consideration there?","Michael W. Lamach","The biggest businesses that we have in China are very infrastructure-related. They're going to be airports, rail stations and so on and so forth. The fastest-growing business that we have is the hardware and more traditional mechanical electronic security business. So we'll be talking about sort of order growth in China, and that being lumpy, it's always associated with the timing of the large infrastructure projects. But we're happy with the progression of growth in our, I would say, our core mechanical and electronic security hardware business there. That's growing nicely. And we're still relatively optimistic around the book of business yet to close for the balance of the year that would support our larger integration business there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you maybe just talk about the absolute price that you got and then maybe just price\/cost by the segments?","Steven R. Shawley","Yes. So price was just about 1 point for the company, 90 basis points. So from there, we would have lost, say, 20 basis points to inflation, so that was in that 70 there.","Michael W. Lamach","It was across the board. We actually have a positive relationship across the board in each of the businesses. So probably on the side of residential, typically, that's kind of -- I know you're very focused on that. We would've seen price there in the 0.5 [ph] range. Material inflation there actually would've been very sedate, so we got good pricing happening in residential. Security, it's probably the lowest price increase, but still at a margin impact of 30 basis points and a slightly positive spread there to material inflation. Climate was right on the average, about 1 point, with 20 points negative material inflation. In industrial, we had about 70 points to price, a little more inflation there, 50, 60 basis points there. So all businesses were positive across the board.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes. Just a question on Climate Solutions margin outlook. A little bit more color given how strong TK orders are, and that's very good for the mix, I'm just wondering, are you being overly conservative here? Or how conservative are you being for the second half?","Michael W. Lamach","Just a comment about TK, first, Andy. The first half is really being influenced by this Tier 4 engine conversion. So if you look at the Act, the trailer market forecast for North America for the year, Act is saying that the market is going to be up about 8%, if I remember correctly. So the market would suggest that the trailer activity is going to slow down in the second half, and that's what we've got reflected in our forecast. Our North American trailer forecast is that we would maintain kind of historical market shares, and we would see sort of up or single-digit-type growth there for the year. So it's definitely skewed forward because of the Tier 4 engine conversion. I think if you look at TK outside of North America, we were surprisingly strong in the trailer -- truck trailer in Europe in the quarter. We're expecting that to moderate a bit in the second half. And everything else, bus and container for Q2 was fairly flat. If you look at the second half, based on everything that's going on in worldwide shipping, container for sure is expected to be actually negative comps in the second half. So there's a moderation of the TK revenue growth in the second half built into our forecast.","Steven R. Shawley","You're looking -- just color-wise, if you look at what we've got left to do for the back half of the year, I mean, clearly, industrial here, we're looking to see sort of what's going to happen, looking to the next couple of quarters and particularly the booking turn business. So it's a place where we would apply more risk to that with the industrial. And if you look at a place or 2 that we assigned, perhaps more in that opportunity, it would be Residential, maybe Climate just because they're executing so well. In Security, it should come in right about on the numbers. I don't see much risk in what we're reporting there. So I think in aggregate -- and that's after like the forecast we've got with probably a bit more concern around industrial, momentum and a bit more optimism around Res and Climate.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I got you. And just -- I understand you sort of highlighted that operational deit [ph] in the quarter, and congratulations on that. But can you just put it into buckets for us, was it better-than-expected pricing versus productivity versus you guys controlling investment? What went well in the quarter relative to your expectations?","Michael W. Lamach","Well, we had more volume than we expected, and we converted on it, right? So nothing that would drive you more crazy than actually seeing volume and not getting leverage on the volume because you weren't prepared to execute against that. So if you look at the sort of incremental leverage on the gap -- the positive gap between actual and midpoint of guidance, we had very nice operating leverage on the incremental. And that really, to me, is encouraging about our ability to deal with additional volume, should it present itself here by the end of the year. But I would tell you, look, really nice job around price, real nice job around productivity. Investments are launching. Generally, we're getting all we wanted out of that in terms of on time and impacting the marketplace. More to come in Q3, Q4 within no curtailment investments. In fact, Climate continues year-over-year to be a net investor -- incremental investor year-over-year as well because of the climate in particular. So they're really firing on all cylinders here.","Steven R. Shawley","Yes. And I would just want to reiterate the investment side. If you look at the corporate spend, it was up in the quarter versus prior year, primarily due to the fact of investments going on with the IT technology transformation we're going through. So we did not skimp on investments in the quarter. And just to add to Mike's commentary, the thing that's probably going a little better than we expected, and it's very pleasant to have it going this way, would be the leverage we're seeing on the Trane commercial business. That I think it's a truly remarkable achievement that we've seen now, starting late last year and really showing up here in Q2. With any kind of volume, you'd expect to see that type of leverage to continue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Volkmann of Jefferies.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I think most of the core questions have probably been answered. I'm curious, I guess, as you look out sort of post the spin and you've had a chance to get a lot of that together now, have you changed or evolved your expectations for the segment margins for the remaining companies in the sort of 2- to 3-year timeframe, assuming we have some kind of reasonable recovery?","Michael W. Lamach","Well, certainly not for Industrial. In fact, I've commented multiple times now that Industrial I'll tell you that the margin potential is greater than what we originally thought, and I think they're executing well against that. With our Climate business, as it's organized today TK and Trane, no, I think we get there as well. The issue we've had and we're clearly addressing it has been the Res business, and we're showing great, great progress there. But we've got a long way to go to get to that target. And so we're going to try to update you more on kind of what we think the potential is based on outcome ranges for growth when we're together late this fall and perhaps be more specific about where we see it. But certainly not on Climate, not on Industrial. In fact, it's up. Res, we're working on and great, great progress there. We'll see that continue.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then can you just remind me the sort of the elevated investment spending, IT, et cetera? What's the timeframe on that? When does that sort of normalize again, or does it?","Steven R. Shawley","It's going to a bit of a pattern throughout the year. If you look at what happened this quarter, in April, we went live with the first phase of the transformation to the common systems across the company. So the whole team, the whole -- the cost structure we have employed to make this transformation work really fell on to an expense category because they were in an implementation mode in Q2. What goes on -- because of the accounting rules, we have to expense all that money when they're in an implementation mode. As we move into the third quarter, we shift back into design phase for the Phase 2. So some of the expense in Q3 will be capitalized and then amortized later once the systems come up and running. So you're going to see a spiking throughout the year depending on when we go live in the various phases. I would say that if you look at 2014, we expect the spend to peak out in '15, some slight incremental increases in '14 and '15 from this point. But certainly, start to abate in 2016.","Michael W. Lamach","And you've got depreciation from the first systems going live in 2013, all the way through the last systems going live in 2016. So then we're going to be looking at some higher depreciation and amortization. But look, net-net, by the time you get past 2016 and into '17 and '18, we ought to see a pretty remarkable decline in what we're spending in IT, but more importantly, as it relates to the G&A across the company and the value of information that we're putting across the company and the speed by which we're acting on it, I think, would be remarkably different.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with MKM Partners.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to dig in a little bit on the Residential business. Clearly, some great operating leverage there. And Steve, I think you talked a little bit about mix in your prepared results. And then, Mike, I think you followed on with the price cost commentary. I just want to understand more how much of this is mix and then how should we think about the margin potential in that business as we shift more towards those higher SEER units? I think both yourselves and some of the other guys in the business out there have been talking about some of this meaner version away from 13 SEER, away from R-22, into some of that more premium product, which obviously is more of your wheelhouse?","Michael W. Lamach","Yes. I mean, Josh, I think this is why this is a good business going forward. I mean, everything from the basics of pent-up demand at some point in time, working its way over multiple years through the system, through to regulations and regulatory requirements around efficiency and the fact that we get somewhat more expensive systems moving into the market, are all very positive. Competitively, for us, broadening the product range and really working on the consumer and the dealer experience, everything from the improvements we've had and our ability to order and ship and fulfill, I mean, I think these are really getting to be sort of industry best-in-class at that level showing up across the board. So I think that when you think about the structural parts of the business, coupled with the improvement opportunities that we have playing across the full range of the product, new product development and really taking the whole value stream to the dealer, and that's with the consumer, is a lot of opportunity. So again, I think for us, getting to a double-digit op margin, getting to a 15% EBITDA margin are in the cards for us in the next couple of years. And so from there, we'll figure out where it goes. But look, we like this business structurally going forward in this part of the cycle.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","I assume you mean that double-digit op margin x Res and Security?","Michael W. Lamach","Yes. Yes, absolutely. And what we also do -- and this is a little bit of an important detail. But we analyzed that residential HVAC, but it's a little bit, because all our light units here, if you think about it, really is looking up through -- the majority of that through our commercial HVAC business. Really nice margins on that. And all of our parts business fundamentally flipped up to the Climate business. So what you're looking at really is a provision of residential HVAC without light commercial, without parts coming into that. So if you really start to do a benchmark in an apples-to-apples against res competitors, these op margins are pretty much in line and should get a lot better.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","That's helpful, actually. And then one follow-up there. How much of your business is 13 SEER today?","Michael W. Lamach","Let me see if I can try to get that for you, Josh. And if I have to come back, I will do that, maybe in the answer to another question, okay? So let me think about that and come back.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Just a couple of things, a lot of ground has been covered. I wonder if you could, just on the HVAC Climate side, commercial specifically, address a little more what's going on in parts and service? You talked about the comps. But how does kind of energy retrofit and upgrade look into the back half? Do you have any visibility on that and any geographic color around that?","Michael W. Lamach","Really, it's a great question, Jeff, because when we talk about the service and parts business, the service business have lots of tentacles to it. If you think about services being scheduled and unscheduled service and parts, that business is growing nicely. If you think about the part of this which is lower, it's actually the performance contracting and the turnkey contracting business, which makes sense just at a macro level because what you're finding is just a lot more customers opting for more traditional approaches procuring equipment, which we're seeing in the unitary results for sure, as opposed to using financing or guarantees to purchase the equipment. And the performance contracting, and to some extent, the turnkey contracting business, often runs in verse to sort of sentiment. To put a more negative around their ability to finance, they need to do capital improvement, performance contracting goes up. People feel a bit better about it. You'd see it kind of shift more towards traditional avenues to fulfill it.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Interesting. Okay. And then just on industrial margins, Mike, you expressed confidence on kind of the out-year look. Near term, obviously, you've got some pressure. Can you give us a view on how industrial margins actually play over the balance of the year? And do you have any restructuring or other actions aimed at addressing that?","Michael W. Lamach","Well, I mean, we're actually bullish on what's going to happen here. Year-over-year, if you look at a full year of Industrial compared to 2012, I would still be looking for margin improvement. Some 50 basis points would be, I think, really doable, in light of and including sort of all the discussion we've had around slowing markets. So we will get great leverage. So your question about restructuring and so on and so forth, that is so much a part of what's going on here. Just day-to-day lean productivity, constantly thinking about the cost structure of the business, thinking about pricing, new product development. So they're looking within the Industrial business for ways to sort of protect that 50 basis point margin expansion. We've evaluated those plans, and I think it's a good plan. And I think that as you look at sort of protecting the company in terms of EPS plan, we clearly have opportunity in Climate and Res to fill that risk potential.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Sullivan of RBC Capital Markets.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a quick follow-on on the performance contracting. Is that still around 1\/3 of the service business? Curious how big that business is.","Michael W. Lamach","Yes. I'd probably have to come back and answer that one as well. But I can tell you, Josh, regarding your question about 13 SEER, it's about 60% of our mix today. And if you put 13, 14 SEER in there, it's about 75% of our mix. So if you think about the evolution of what we've been able to do and to be competitive at that low end, where it's now 75% of our business, we're pleased with the team's opportunity to navigate that. Coming back to your performance contracting business, it would be down year-over-year. At the mix percentage, we'll try to get you a number here. If you ask Janet, Janet's just got 1\/3, about as good an estimate as we've got.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Sure. And then on -- I think on Thermo King, you mentioned margin expansion in the back half of the year, I think, but growth also slowing due to a number of factors there. Just wondered if you could speak to that dynamic a little bit, whether there's some mix benefit or how we should think about it?","Michael W. Lamach","We've got great bookings coming through the production here. So in terms of the basics of factory absorption and the fact that we'll continue to tune the line for the new product line, we're optimistic that sort of that's the leveraged days are ahead in 2013 in that business versus the first 6 months, which haven't been bad at all. In fact, TK's overall margins are going to be up year-over-year no matter what.","Operator","Our next question comes from Deane Dray of Citi Research.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I had some cleanup questions on the residential HVAC business. And I know you guys have been praying for hot weather, but you just ought to be careful on what you wish for here. And on this topic, if you have any color on the sensitivity the business has to degree cooling days, because we've obviously had a huge spike there and maybe some comments on inventory in the channel.","Michael W. Lamach","I'm the one that's -- look back 25, 30 years on this, and I can tell you that the normalized is over a relatively short period of time quarter-to-quarter. I guess, you can certainly see a spike at the end of the quarter, but pretty tough to recommend a trade stock on that. I'm sure some people pay attention to that. But in our business, it's not going to move the needle all that much around really hot weather at a different point in time. So I'm not the right guy to get on the track of telling you that this hot weather is going to create some huge upside for the company in quarter 3.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Inventory in the channel?","Michael W. Lamach","This is a good story. Inventory is down by design. We are surveying dealers from order to receipt, 33% last year, faster than we were last time with this year -- this time last year. That's by design. So strategy has been -- have our dealers need to sort of inventory less. That's down. We think it makes it more competitive for our dealers, more competitive for us. So we're purposely working that down and working on speed and fulfillment, thinking that all good things lead to higher profitably and share when cycle times and fill rates are higher, and we're really doing a great job on both of those.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Belfiore with Nomura Securities.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","It's Shannon O'Callaghan. In terms of this restructuring and spin costs, what's the split between, I guess, the spin costs and restructuring? I don't know if you can separate that but I'm trying to get a sense of how much of that is restructuring that you feel like you're going to have to continue to do post-spin.","Michael W. Lamach","Yes, placeholder, maybe $50 million would be the restructuring that we would need to do, that would not be related to all the other fees involved and costs [indiscernible] to do this. And we're going to adjust that as we need to. I mean, we're really committed to getting a go-forward cost structure right, and a placeholder now of $50 million seems like a decent placeholder to put out there.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Across the 2 entities essentially, right? Combined?","Michael W. Lamach","Well, no. This would be sort of what we think we need to do from an IR go-forward basis.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","For the Remain-co, okay. And how about Security or, I guess, would you speak to that or no?","Michael W. Lamach","Well, what we're doing is you're designing something ultimately from scratch, right? I mean, you're designing a standup company, so you're creating an organizational model there that you think would work going forward. And when you think about standalone company being set up, it's an incremental add to the structure and headcount there. So they're looking about how to do that in a lean way. But clearly, they're going to be adding people and necessary functions and capabilities to run a standalone company. But I don't think that's any more than the cost being allocated from the company to them. We've managed to sort of work that down now, so that I think that'll be fairly neutral allocated cost to standup cost.","Operator","Our next -- our final question comes from Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Securities.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Just a couple of clarifications. One, with the refinancing of the debt, you said there's a $30 million into the savings. When will we begin to start seeing that flow through the income statement? And two, you updated a little bit on margins for the year. You said you still expect 50 basis point improvement in Industrial. Can you give some guidance about the rest of the group, certain changes in what you're thinking?","Michael W. Lamach","Well, let me take the first part of the question. The -- we actually paid off the 2013 and '14 securities this past week. So we'll start to see the improvement in the interest expense through the second half here, in late July through the end of the year. So it's a small impact in 2013.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And as far as operating profitability, I think you still indicated 50 basis points attractive improvement you still expected in Industrial despite the volume change. Have you got any changes in the outlook for any of the 3 groups or you want to update us on what you're thinking at this point?","Michael W. Lamach","Yes. I mean, so Industrial, we talked about 50 bps. Security, I think, the goal there is to grow the business and remain relatively flat. Actually, we could have improve margins, but that's not the -- so much of the issue there is around growth, so look for flat margins there and investment around growth. And I look at the Res business and see that they're on track and they're expected to get 2 full points. I think we'll do that. And in Climate, no reason. Even with the modifications we've made with some of the mix between Industrial and Commercial that we wouldn't see 50 basis points improvement there again. Just I think a steady improvement, sustainable improvement, I think done the right way with the right investments, and I feel good about 50 basis points there.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","You're talking about Residential?","Michael W. Lamach","Both Climate and Industrial, 50; Residential, 2; Security, flat.","Operator","I'm not showing any other questions at this time.

The call will begin in a few moments with the speaker remarks and then a Q&A session. All callers are on mute. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Zac Nagle, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Zac Nagle","Thanks, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Ingersoll Rand's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. This call is being webcast on our website at ingersollrand.com, where you'll find the accompanying presentation. We are also recording and archiving this call on our website. Please go to Slide 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law.","Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from our anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. Joining me on today's call are Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO; and Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO. With that, please go to Slide 3 and I'll turn the call over to Mike. Mike?","Mike Lamach","Thanks, Zac, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on today\u2019s call. I'm proud of our team's performance in the second quarter. Once again, we delivered strong revenue growth, margin expansion and EPS growth. We welcomed our new Precision Flow Systems team into Ingersoll-Rand and we\u2019re well underway towards a separation into two standalone businesses and our proposed strategic combination with our Industrial segment and Gardner Denver. With that backdrop, let's get started.","Please go to Slide 3. I'd like to start with a brief overview of the global business strategy that we're executing to deliver consistently strong financial results for our shareholders. Fundamentally, our strategy is at the nexus of environmental sustainability and impact, which are strong secular tailwinds for our business. The world is continuing to urbanize while becoming warmer and more resource constrained as time passes. We excel at reducing the energy intensity of buildings, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing waste of foods and other perishable goods, and we excel in our ability to generate productivity for our customers, all enabled by technology.","Unless you think the world is getting cooler, less populated, less resource constrained as time passes, these strong secular tailwinds will continue to provide opportunity for shareholders and purpose for our vision. As we continue separation, integration planning and business transformation activities related to our strategy and combination of our industrial segment with Gardner Denver and move towards creating the premier pure play climate business in 2020, our aggressive pursuit of excellence in delivering solutions to mitigate the impact of these secular trends only intensifies. Our climate business squarely focuses 100% of our portfolio at the nexus of sustainability and global environmental impact where our products and services can reduce the impact of these mega trends and create a platform for the company to grow above average global economic conditions.","Moving to Slide 4, I'll spend a few minutes discussing how 2019 has progressed through the first half of the fiscal year and what we're expecting to see through the balance of 2019. The key takeaway is that we remain bullish on our strategy, our end markets broadly and our ability to execute using our business operating system to deliver against our organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS guidance ranges for fiscal 2019. In fact, today we're raising EPS guidance by $0.05 to approximately $6.40. We expect to deliver top-tier financial performance again in 2019.","Commercial HVAC globally and particularly in North America and Europe has continued to be very strong for us and our backlog, incoming order rates and sales pipeline give us confidence this business will continue to deliver strong results in the second half of 2019. Our residential HVAC business had strong mid single-digit growth in the second quarter and we expect this business to continue to deliver strong performance for the full year supported by a solid residential replacement market.","In our Industrial segment, we saw healthy order growth and long cycle projects in our Compression Technologies business in the second quarter and we have a favorable outlook for continued long cycle growth in the second half of the year. Conversely, the short cycle market softened in the second quarter primarily impacting revenue growth in our core Compression Technologies and Tools businesses, which are both down low single-digits. We expect short cycle markets to continue to be challenging throughout 2019. The positive impact of healthy long cycle markets presents a positive setup as we move into 2020 when these orders convert into revenue and operating income given the long lead times associated with these projects.","Price realization has been outstanding across our businesses and we're effectively managing all inflation and tariff-related costs with an 80 basis points spread in the second quarter. As we've highlighted before, we have been effective in managing inflation and we expect to continue to maintain a positive spread and our target range of 20 basis points to 30 basis points in the second half of the year when we begin to lap the strong price realization in the third and fourth quarters of 2018 and when we began to see the full impact of the increase in List 3 tariffs on Chinese imports moving from 10% to 25%.","Lastly, we continue to expect strong free cash flows in 2019 of equal to or greater than 100% of net income, which will further strengthen our balance sheet and enable us to maintain good optionality. We've deployed significant capital on dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases over the years and again in the first half of the year. We'll continue to follow our dynamic and balanced capital allocation priorities and we expect to deploy 100% of excess cash over time.","Please go to Slide 5. We've delivered solid bookings and revenue growth in virtually all businesses and regions in the second quarter. On the booking side, our largest HVAC businesses continue to lead the way and delivers strong growth with North America and Europe HVAC up high single digits in the second quarter. China was also healthy with low single-digit growth against the very tough comp of low 20s growth in the second quarter of 2018.","We also drove strong bookings growth of 8% in our Industrial Segment versus a tough comp of 8% in the prior year led by Compression Technologies and Small Electric Vehicles. Compression Technologies growth was driven by strong growth in long cycle partially offset by softness in the short cycle markets. Small Electric Vehicles growth was driven by successful execution of our consumer vehicle strategy. Transport refrigeration had a significant decline in bookings against very tough comps in 2018 for reasons we've discussed in detail on prior calls.","However, as we've said before, these declines don't impact or negate a strong growth in our other transport businesses or impact their ability to grow revenues in 2019 and 2020. The transport refrigeration business had extremely strong bookings in 2018 and is returning to historically normal levels of bookings in 2019, but with backlog that is more than two times the historical levels with a strong backlog and solid bookings we're seeing in 2019. We expect this business to deliver solid revenue growth in 2019 and the prospects heading into 2020 continue to look promising. On the revenue side, our largest HVAC businesses continued to deliver very strong growth with North America, Europe and residential all up mid to high single digits in quarter two. Transport refrigeration also delivered strong revenue growth.","Bringing all the pieces together, we're pleased with our organic bookings and revenue growth performance through the first half. We expect organic revenue growth rates to increase heading into the second half based on healthy backlog, deliveries and incoming order rates and remain confident at our 5% to 6% organic enterprise revenue growth target for the full year. Please turn to Slide 6. We've outlined a number of takeaways for each major business on the next two slides.","Commercial HVAC continues to be very strong, particularly in North America and Europe. Our backlog, incoming order rates and pipeline of projects are driving confidence that we'll continue to see solid growth in the second half of the year. Residential HVAC had solid mid single-digit growth in quarter two and we head at end of the second half of the year expecting 2019 will shape up to be another good year led by a healthy replacement market. I've talked at length about transport refrigeration, which continues to be led by North America trailer, truck, APUs and aftermarket. Based on our record backlog and healthy incoming order rates, we remain confident that our transport business will deliver another solid year in 2019.","Please turn to Slide 7. In our Compression Technologies business, we're seeing a healthy growth in long cycle markets and softness in short cycle markets. The long cycle business strength positions us well for good growth in late 2019 and in 2020 as these orders convert into revenue. Small Electric Vehicles is having a great year driven by successful execution of our consumer vehicle strategy.","And now, I'd like to turn it over to Sue to provide more details on the quarter. Sue?","Sue Carter","Thank you, Mike. Please go to Slide #8. I'll begin with a summary of a few main points to take away from today's call. As Mike discussed, we drove strong financial results in the second quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $2.09, an increase of 13% versus the year ago period. Our Q2 performance gives us confidence in our ability to execute against the full year growth in margin targets we provided in our guidance in the beginning of the year. As a result, we are raising our full year adjusted continuing EPS guidance to approximately $6.40 up from approximately $6.35 that we communicated last quarter. Second quarter organic revenue growth was strong, particularly in our climate segment. We also saw strong organic bookings across most of our major businesses. When excluding our Transport business that saw outsized order growth in 2018, organic bookings were up approximately mid single digits for both the enterprise and our climate segment.","In our Industrial Segment, organic revenues were up 2% compounding on a tough comp of 9% organic growth in the prior year. Strong revenue growth in CTS services and small electric vehicles offset the weakness in the industrial short cycle market Mike mentioned previously. Industrial organic bookings were strong, up 8% and compounding on an 8% growth rate in Q2 2018 fueled by long cycle compression technologies growth and small electric vehicle demand. Despite ongoing trade and tariff negotiations, CTS China bookings growth continued to strengthen in Q2 providing cautious optimism going forward.","During Q2, we expanded adjusted operating margins 80 basis points and delivered 37% operating leverage, which is ahead of our full year expectations. We continue to leverage our business operating system across the enterprise to manage direct material, tariff related and other inflationary headwinds. As we look to the back half of the year, we anticipate we will continue to realize price to effectively manage material inflation and tariffs including the recent increase in List 3 tariffs on Chinese imports from 10% to 25%, but this spread should narrow as we lap the 2018 mid-year price increases.","As Mike mentioned, we continue to expect strong free cash flows in 2019 of equal to or greater than 100% of net income. We exit the second quarter with working capital sufficient to support our ongoing cooling season demands and we expect working capital requirements to approach the long-term target of approximately 4% of revenues by the end of the year. Importantly, we continue to deliver on our dynamic capital allocation strategy. So far this year, we have completed the strategic acquisition of Precision Flow Systems for approximately $1.45 billion, deployed approximately $259 million in dividends and approximately $250 million on share buybacks. Looking forward, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time.","Please go to Slide 9. We delivered organic revenue growth of 4%, adjusted operating margin improvement of 80 basis points and adjusted earnings per share growth of 13%. Organic revenue growth was led by strong broad based growth across our Climate segment. Continued disciplined focus on pricing and productivity actions enabled us to effectively manage inflation and tariff related headwinds and drive margin expansion across the enterprise.","Please go to Slide 10. Our Climate segment delivered another strong quarter of operating income growth, enabling us to drive solid year-over-year EPS growth in the quarter. Our Industrial segment delivered solid results. Our full year industrial margin outlook remains intact. In addition to good segment performance, second quarter corporate costs were lower than prior year impacting results by approximately $0.05. The cadence of corporate expenses is lumpy in 2019 driven primarily by the timing of stock-based compensation that is not linear as well as the timing of a number of other functional spending items. The full year corporate cost guidance of approximately $250 million remains unchanged.","Please go to Slide 11. In Q2, strong execution drove 80 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement, price versus material inflation was positive for the fifth consecutive quarter. Pricing net of material inflation expanded margins by 80 basis points reflecting strong carry over price from 2018 and incremental pricing actions in 2019. We delivered solid margin expansion from volume growth in the quarter. Margin expansion was tempered by softness in short cycle industrial revenues, which tend to have higher margins. Consistent with our full-year expectations we continued to deliver productivity in excess of other inflation. We continue to heavily invest in our business. Incremental Q2 investments of approximately 40 basis points were fairly evenly weighted between growth and operating expense reduction projects.","Please go to Slide 12. Our Climate segment delivered another strong quarter with 5% organic revenue growth and adjusted operating margin expansion of 50 basis points. Consistent with our expectations we delivered strong volume growth, price realization and productivity.","Please go to Slide 13. Our Industrial business delivered solid organic revenue growth of 2% against a tough comparison of 9% growth in Q2 of 2018. Industrial leverage was impacted primarily by the inclusion of the PFS acquisition midway through the quarter. PFS acquisition revenues lever at operating income margin rates instead of gross margin rates for the first year under our ownership.","Additionally, as I mentioned previously, margin expansion was tempered by softness in short cycle industrial revenues, which tend to have higher margins. Excluding these factors leveraging the industrial was north of 30% in the quarter. Looking at EBITDA margins, the PFS acquisition was an immediate contributor to our EBITDA margin expansion of 60 basis points in the quarter.","Please go to Slide 14. We remain committed to a dynamic capital allocation strategy that consistently deploys excess cash to the opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. We maintain a healthy level of business investments in high-ROI technology, innovation and operational excellence projects, which are vital to our continued growth, product leadership and margin expansion.","We have a long-standing commitment to have a reliable, strong and growing dividend that increases at or above the rate of earnings growth over time. We continue to make strategic investments in acquisitions that further improve long-term shareholder returns like the PFS acquisition completed during the quarter.","Earlier this year, we secured an additional $1.5 billion in senior notes taking advantage of the current favorable interest rate environment. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continuing optionality as our markets evolve. We continue to see value in share repurchases when shares trade below their intrinsic value and we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time.","Please go to Slide number 16. The integration of Precision Flow Systems with our existing ARO business is underway and is progressing according to plan. We expect PFS to contribute approximately $400 million in revenue on an annualized run rate. That equates to approximately $250 million of incremental revenue in 2019 with approximately $50 million already delivered in Q2.","EBITDA margin expectations for PFS remain unchanged with percentages in the high-20s and adjusted operating margins are expected to be in the mid-teens for 2019. PFS is expected to be cash flow creative consistent with the EBITDA attribution in 2019. For your reference, we have also included estimated non-GAAP adjustments related to PFS for the year.","Additionally, we completed a senior notes offering in March, which we anticipate will add approximately $60 million in interest on an annual run rate basis, $47 million incremental to 2019. For 2019, we expect the adjusted operating income of PFS to essentially offset incremental interest from the senior notes offering.","Please go to Slide number 17. I want to take a moment to further clarify the impact of PFS on our full-year 2019 revenue guidance. As you can see on the chart, adding approximately $250 million of PFS revenues to our prior revenue guidance range increases our industrial reported revenue growth rates by approximately 7.5 points and our enterprise revenue growth rates by approximately 1.5 points. There is no other change to our revenue guidance ranges for 2019.","Please go to Slide number 18. When we're on the road, we often get questions about the status of the strategic announcement we made at the end of April to combine our industrial segment with Gardner Denver. We continue to be excited about the prospects of creating a premier industrial company as well as a leading pure-play Climate solutions company focused on HVAC and transport refrigeration. I\u2019ll give you a brief update today.","One of the transaction closing conditions was recently satisfied. The HSR Act waiting period expired. We will continue working through the remaining regulatory and other closing conditions. We anticipate approximately $150 million to $200 million in separation and transaction related costs, including the estimated cost of separating legal entities. We also expect to mitigate the approximately $100 million in stranded costs by the end of 2021, this is unchanged from what we communicated last quarter.","In preparation for closing, we have begun three separate work streams. The first work stream is focused solely on the separation of our Industrial segment. After years of leveraging across our Industrial and Climate segments we have tasked the separation team with separating Industrial segment business processes, systems and functions. This includes technical and financial operating processes, including taxed and systems, manufacturing operations and supply chain services, real estate, along with all business regulatory filings. There is a lot of work to be done and the team has a methodical roadmap to work this out.","The second work stream center is on integration planning with Gardner Denver, given that we continue to operate as two separate companies and compete in the marketplace until the close of the transaction. The integration planning work must be managed under clear rules and anti-trust protocols. While integration preparation is underway and will continue over the coming months in compliance with these rules much of the work to integrate the two companies will take place after the expected close.","The final work stream is focused on the transformation efforts of our Climate segment. As we plan and execute within the transformation work stream, we have the advantage of building on an incredibly strong foundation with great businesses, engaged and talented people and a distinctive winning culture and core values.","Our strategy focus on reducing the world's energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions remains unchanged. We are focused on developing a new climate structure that allows us to better serve our customers and unlock value for shareholders. At this point, this work is early on and we will give more updates at a later date. All in we're well underway on this strategic transaction and we believe we are on track for closing in early 2020.","And with that I'll turn the call back over to Mike.","Mike Lamach","Thanks, Sue. Please go to Slide 19. In summary, we're pleased with our first half performance and we expect to deliver strong revenue and EPS growth and free cash flow in 2019. Looking forward, we continue to believe that company is extremely well positioned to deliver strong shareholder returns over the next several years.","Fundamentally, our strategy remains at the nexus of environmental sustainability and impact. Today 15% of the world's carbon emissions come from heating and cooling buildings and transport refrigeration creates another 80 million metric tons of CO2 emissions annually, which can be eliminated through electrification over time.","We are bending the global warming curve by changing the way the world heats and cools buildings and moves refrigerated cargo. New technology we've developed can reduce up to 99% of the emissions that come from heating and cooling of commercial building. And this doesn't include the substantial environmental benefit of increasing system energy efficiency to reduce both power generations at the source and storage requirements.","We're continually working to innovate in this way to electrify heating, electrify diesel engines used to cool trucks and trailers that transport perishable goods and reduce the energy intensity in greenhouse gas emissions and residential and commercial buildings. We recently announced our 2030 ESG commitments to meet the challenge of climate change, while increasing access to air conditioning, perishable foods and medicines, and improving the quality of life for people and communities where we operate and serve.","We are committing to reduce our customer carbon footprint by 1 gigaton of CO2 through our HVAC and transport refrigerant products and services. We believe this is the largest customer climate commitment made by any B2B company, and our math shows that this reduction could equate to 2% of the world's emissions. The size and scale that\u2019s equivalent to the annual emissions of Italy, France, and the UK combined.","We continue to transform our supply chain and operations to have restorative impact on the environment including achieving carbon neutral operations and giving back more water than we use in water stressed areas. We are committed to increasing opportunity for all strengthening economic mobility and bolstering the quality of life of our people. This includes gender parity and leadership roles, workforce reflective of our community populations, maintaining a livable market competitive wages and broadening community access to cooling, comfort and healthful foods.","We've been investing heavily for years to build franchise brands and to advance our leadership market position to enable consistent profitable growth. We have an experienced management team and a high-performing culture that instills operational excellence into everything we do. We remain committed to dynamic and balanced deployment of capital and we have a strong track record of deploying excess cash to deliver top tier shareholder returns over the years.","Lastly, we're extremely excited about the proposed transaction and the strategic combination of our industrial segment with Gardner Denver. Combining two of the premier complimentary industrial companies offers the opportunity to drive significant innovation and growth with meaningful revenue and cost synergies supported by secular growth trends and diverse end-market exposure.","We're also very excited about creating the premier pure-play HVAC and transport refrigeration company with our existing Climate segment businesses. We have a tremendous opportunity to leverage a simplified business model and structure and sharpen our sustainability focus with our investments. Our climate businesses have clearly differentiated performance and we see significant opportunity as a pure-play to build on this performance for our employees, customers, and shareholders.","And with that Sue and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Steve Tusa","Hello.","Mike Lamach","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Tusa","So just wanted to ask on HVAC? What are you seeing in resi so far in July? And also on the commercial unitary front, how are trends in that part of the business this quarter and what do you expect for the rest of the year there?","Mike Lamach","Resi was strong in the quarter, bookings and revenue. While we think it continues for the balance of the year. We think the market might be low-single-digit, mid-single-digit. Steve, we think we'll be mid-single-digit for the year there, so that\u2019s progressing. Again, as you know it\u2019s 80% replacement. We're heavily indexed there and anything we do incrementally with new construction is actually an add. That\u2019s growth for us. So we feel like we're in a great position.","With regard to commercial North America, we\u2019re seeing strengths in unitary, we seeing strength and applied and services. We are seeing particular verticals like K12 Labs and data centers that are growing nicely. So they'll let up there and then just to anticipate some questions, I think that people may ask, if you think about our backlog today across the globe from an HVAC perspective, we're up 21% year-over-year and even up sequentially from quarter one to quarter two. So that is, I think indicative of just continued strong markets and a solid pipeline going forward.","Steve Tusa","Okay, great. And then so you think you guys are taking share, it sounds like some of the other guys that put up numbers that are obviously not as good as that?","Mike Lamach","Well in the markets that we get really good data, third party which is the easiest to look at absolutely, that\u2019s a fact, yes.","Steve Tusa","And then lastly, just third quarter. Can you just talk about seasonality? You expect normal seasonality here in the third quarter, I know things are moving around in the global economy and also orders. Do you think orders are going to take out another step down or how do that compares look so that maybe were more stable here in the low-single-digit type of number for climate? I know you don't like to guide that, but there's obviously a lot moving around in the economy. I was just curious as to how you guys see that playing out?","Mike Lamach","Well, I don\u2019t see any changes in sort of HVAC globally. I think we've got a pretty good read on the global landscape. Most markets are strong and there's pockets for this weakness, but surprises where markets are strong. Example of that would be Mexico has gone through a couple quarters of negative GDP. It's a pretty big market for us. So that's a newer information but we\u2019re relatively strong in an equivalent market in the southern cone of Latin America. So it's that sort of thing on the edges that we're looking at, but the market's remained strong. There's a lot of focus on Thermo King and I think we've done a decent job explaining the constraints that exist in 2018 at Class 8 tractors and how customers lined-up in advance really to pull on that supply capability. It translated down to trailers and of course that all translated it those customers ordering either APUs or refrigerated trailers. The actual tab time of how the heartbeat of a plant runs and we match trailers and units to actual tractors or trailers, it\u2019s very smooth and that backlog generates just mid-single-digit revenue growth that's been pretty consistent.","So the noises around the TK bookings, but again I think you just have to separate that from the 28 constraints with our customers, and think more about the HVAC market being strong and transport just generating solid revenue growth and good backlog and generally healthy markets. And we're still seeing good order intake rate at Transport. So it's not as if things are drying up even on the order input side there, just tough comps.","Steve Tusa","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Mike Lamach","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Your line is open.","Julian Mitchell","Thanks, good morning. So maybe just sticking to the two question rule. My first question would just be around the industrial division. It looks like on Slide 17, you're still assuming maybe 5% organic growth this year. That seems to imply a step-up from the first half. So maybe just help explain why you think industrial organic growth should reaccelerate in the second half please?","Mike Lamach","Yes, I think we've got our eyes wide open on the short cycle and we've accommodated that in our forecast. We had strengthen longer cycle, some of which we expect to shift in the fourth quarter a lot \u2013 we\u2019ll shift in 2020. We've had excellent growth and our consumer strategy related to a small electric vehicles. So \u2013 and Julian we just finished the five plus seven forecasts not even a month ago. We've had the opportunity to update that last month with risks and opportunities. I think that we feel pretty good about that forecast. When I look back at the beginning of the year relative to guidance, I would say that climate markets are trending toward maybe the upper end of that. And industrial markets may be \u2013 would be trending to the lower side of that, but not that we feel like great, where we need to be in terms of the guidance that we gave.","Julian Mitchell","Thanks very much. Then my quick follow-up would be around the climate division. You had about 7% profit growth in the second quarter, a bit of a step down from Q1 and then you're sort of guiding for a pick-up in the second half? Similar question I guess. What drives you think that slightly better EBIT growth in the second half? Maybe it\u2019s actually with the resi versus commercial versus transport or something on the margins around price material. Any color at all on that aspect?","Mike Lamach","Yes. Juliana, I mean when you look at leverage, first of all in the quarter we actually had really good leverage. We had leverage above gross margins there north of 30% and we were able to be right about 30% for the first half of the year. So the question probably relates to what you're thinking to be a step down in the revenue. But again here, when you look at 21% year-over-year backlog and sequentially improving backlog from quarter one and quarter two, no deliveries and service business being about half the business. The amount of book in turn we need to do is actually is small as I can remember it. So again, feel pretty good about the revenue number and I think that segment in general leverages pretty close on the full-year at the 25% rate we guided to originally. So I'm not seeing a lot of weakness there.","Julian Mitchell","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Davis of Melius Research. Your line is open.","Scott Davis","Hi. Good morning, Mike, Susan.","Mike Lamach","Good morning.","Scott Davis","Sometimes when you are executing kind of a deal like this of the size, there tends to be a little bit of a letdown ahead of the closing and some companies we say they have to adjust compensation plans and such to prevent that. But have you guys \u2013 did you feel the need to do anything. Have you done anything? Is there a risk that there's a little bit of a distraction amongst the operating heads, walking into the back half of the year here?","Mike Lamach","We've got over the years a wonderful operating system that in terms of the metrics and any of the early warning indicators that we would get, Scott feel good about seeing that. Of course we're seeing none of it today. The more important thing we're doing though is organizing ourselves in a way that we can compartmentalize, what needs to happen and then think about the interdependencies between things.","So as an example, our Number 1 priority is to run the business and run it well every day and execute on the commitments we've made. The second priority is the separation itself. Of course, there is no integration without the separation. So there's a separate team focused on separation that does not involve the integration team, which is the third priority. Third priority around integration is to the extent we can under the rules of engagement is to support GDI\u2019s lead in that effort and so that continues.","And the fourth thing that we're doing is using the opportunity, the value stream map, much of the company and core process to customers and use the opportunity to think about those core processes in a way that we can make sure that the maximum value added to customers is being delivered and how we might structure from that output and what that might mean of course with the cost structure and maybe speed the market in some cases, it's pretty exciting. But we've tried to make sure that the teams, our different people, to the extent we can. Of course a group like tax is going to be related to all four of those activities but we're doing a pretty good job of compartmentalizing that and running it and using the metrics that we've always used to run the business.","Scott Davis","Okay, that's helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up and at this, I know this is always hard to answer a question around market share on the HVAC side. But sometimes, I mean it\u2019s clear that you're gaining share, but sometimes that's due to geographic mix or the types of projects that are growing. I mean, is there a \u2013 is there kind of a no-BS answer to that question of why you think you're winning not the usual or better than the rest kind of stuff. But is there any other explanation that you can give to be helpful in that regard?","Mike Lamach","We've really designed \u2013 really our technology and go to market strategy around sustainability and around eliminating both emissions and reducing efficiencies. So this passion around having the most energy efficient commercial systems out there in the world today using the most responsible refrigerants that we can put into these systems of leveraging the analytics, the data, the controls around that to put more sophisticated service offerings together.","The belief that on that commercial side, we need to be doing that ourselves. Not through independent distribution because of the complexity of what it takes to model cell, service, deliver against those plans, that's been our strategy and we've been consistent about that and just executing hard against that. I think from a goal deployment perspective, again another core part to the operating system, there's no mystery in the company as to what our goals are, what's expected, what we're measuring, so that \u2013 it just coming together in a way that has worked, Scott over a long period of time.","Scott Davis","Yes, clearly. Well, good luck to you guys. Thank you.","Mike Lamach","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Walsh of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","John Walsh","Hi. Good morning.","Mike Lamach","Good morning, John.","Sue Carter","Good morning.","John Walsh","So, I guess just going back to the price cost spread you talked about the 20 basis points to 30 basis points here in the back half. I guess I understand the tariffs, but just kind of looking also at recent price increases and I realize they're not all created equal. It does look like you've pushed through some kind of another round of healthy price here across the commercial parts of your portfolio. I mean, is that \u2013 should we view that as kind of a conservative placeholder for the back half or is \u2013 there's something else that would kind of make that decelerate further?","Sue Carter","Well, wait John would \u2013 a right John what I would say is when you think about how we called price cost for the year, we're basically in line with how we called it. So we knew then we were going to have some great price comparisons on a year-over-year basis in the front half of the year. And we knew that in the back half of the year we were going to lap some comparisons to last year. So price is going to actually be \u2013 it's not a deceleration at all but the comparisons to pricing the back half of last year are going to result in a little bit less of a spread than in the first half of the year.","But in terms of expectations, that's exactly what we would have expected. The prices are going through, they are sticking, they are actually being realized in the business and material inflation is actually doing approximately what we thought it would do for the year, which is we've gone the tariffs covered, we've got all of the elements of costs covered and we're seeing a little bit of material stabilization but again, stabilization to our expectations in the back half of the year and a little bit of deflation, but given the way that we buy materials, probably more of a 2020 impact.","So when I think about the whole price cost sort of put it in a basket, I think the price comparisons are more difficult in the back half of the year than the front half of the year. Material inflation is doing about what we expected and that gives us roughly the 20 basis points to 30 basis points of spread for the entire year on price cost. I mean, maybe its [indiscernible] conservative, but it looks about like we thought it would look, which is the really good part of that.","John Walsh","Okay. Thank you. And then I guess just as a follow-up. If we could maybe look at the Americas or maybe actually drill down into the U.S. versus China, just what you saw in terms of service versus equipment growth in the quarter?","Mike Lamach","Yes, both are progressing well there, John. I'm always surprised at the degree of service penetration in China, how quickly that's maturing. So there is really no surprises there and from a service perspective we continue to do well there, so not much more to say. Obviously the U.S. and Europe are the gold standard around penetration and linkage and then China is quickly over the years coming to that point and over the next five years, I think it'll be at the same level as our North American European penetration.","John Walsh","All right, thank you.","Mike Lamach","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nigel Coe or Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Nigel Coe","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Mike Lamach","Good morning, Nigel.","Nigel Coe","I want to turn it back to Industrial and the \u2013 that the long cycle bookings growth that you call outs and, I mean I think rules sort of thinking CapEx kicked down the road, perhaps some of these projects push out. But where are you seeing the bookings strengths that would you call it any end markets in particular? And then switching to the shorter cycle pressure you're seeing? Would you say that's mainly inventory reductions or genuine end market weakness?","Mike Lamach","Yes, Nigel, I would call it Asia on your first question, probably to be what we're seeing the long cycle bookings and here you are seeing a chemicals manufacturing energy? Their separation would be another for sure, so that will be the \u2013 what I point out there. With North America, with the U.S. in particular, there was a slow down. It seemed after there was a flurry in the U.S. MCA discussions between Mexico and the U.S. and the possibility of the U.S. imposing additional tariffs, if Mexico wouldn't secure the border from the Mexican side.","Roughly after that we saw a slow down. I think it was certainly an end user demand and that obviously effected sell through of distribution short cycle products there. And it bounced around a little bit but off kind of that lower level. So hopefully all that I get cleaned up permanently and I think that'll have a restorative impact on short cycle and it does. I think it will be a nice bounce up when there's certainty around that.","Nigel Coe","Okay. That's great. Thanks Mike. And then digging back to the North American commercial as a quick follow-on, I think some of the peers saw weakness within the commercial unitary markets and [indiscernible] on the replacement side and what impacts we call out there? Did you see there as well? Would you call out the light commercial as weaker in North America?","Mike Lamach","No, I know exactly it was exceptionally strong for us. So, no, I would say it would be a highlight of the quarter as opposed to a weakness.","Nigel Coe","Okay. That's great.","Mike Lamach","I can't tell you why it would be different, but I can tell you it was a standout in the quarter.","Nigel Coe","Thanks Mike.","Mike Lamach","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Jeff Sprague","Hey, thank you. Good morning everyone.","Mike Lamach","Hi Jeff.","Jeff Sprague","Hey, Mike you never like to mention whether Nigel threw it out. I mean, anything in the resi business that you thought was discernible and you run your inventories pretty lean, but is there anything kind of in the early set up in the third quarter that overhang from that \u2013 that would be of note?","Mike Lamach","No, it was a little bit last year of some pre-buy; I think they got pulled in the second quarter. That's really the only kind of \u2013 it wasn't a big number, but it was a little bit of a compare \u2013 difference there. I think the number of companies had that happen, so no, not really Jeff that answer your question, I think it's just fundamentals remain strong. I think that consumer genuinely still feels pretty good \u2013 pretty healthy and we're not seeing any changes to that?","Jeff Sprague","Then bigger picture, Mike. I was wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more on what you mean by transformation, right. I think the idea may still be kind of coming into view, but it seems like you've got a relatively crystallized view of where you want to take things. It'd just be interesting to get a little bit more perspective now kind of three months hence making the announcement, kind of what you're thinking about kind of pure-play transformation?","Mike Lamach","Yes, the starting point, just to be clear, is something that we're all very proud of over 10 plus years. And so transformation does not mean, if there\u2019s something bad, it's something good that it means there\u2019s an opportunity here to really go think every \u2013 I mean obviously from a name and a brand all the way through to simplification of legal entities. The way that we might look at the way support services are performed across the company.","We will apply the same value stream mapping that we would do in a manufacturing process to the way record to report or procure to pay or any kind of order the cash process would work. We'll look through our field organization and understand how that would pan out in terms of incentives and some of the metrics that are out in the field. And just to make sure that those are we want them to be. There is likely different structures that will evolve when you answer those questions.","And I think with a goal toward customer focus, a goal towards simplification, being tighter on some of the investment focus on our core sustainability themes. All those things I think are exciting to people inside the company because we're building off a piece of a strong foundation.","Jeff Sprague","Great, thanks.","Mike Lamach","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gautam Khanna of Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Gautam Khanna","Thanks. Good morning guys.","Mike Lamach","Hi, Gautam.","Gautam Khanna","Hey just a follow-up maybe on Jeff Sprague's question. You mentioned the year-over-year on orders with the pull forward last year, but just speaking about Q2 2019, did you see any difference on the resi HVAC side between your indirect and direct channels? And maybe if you can speak to \u2013 Lennox, on their call, talked about being over-indexed to some of the swing regions in the U.S. where it can be hot or cold, and so weather was particularly uncooperative given their exposure. I mean how does your footprint kind of contrast with that, if at all?","Mike Lamach","Yes, I can\u2019t really contrast it to anybody else, but I can tell you, we're about 50:50 direct and indirect. We really didn't see any difference in order rates there at all. I guess in 45 or so earnings calls \u2013 I can't remember, I don't think I've ever used weather as a strategy or as an excuse. I can tell you weather normalizes very quickly often within a year, with a bias toward a warming planet. There's more degree days in the future, not fewer. So it's a great place to be, and we like the footprint that we've got. Our focus is on market share and margin expansion as it is for every product growth theme we have inside the company. So those are two clear goals that we have, and that doesn't change.","Gautam Khanna","That\u2019s helpful. And then just as a second question, maybe can you give us some color on your expectations for Thermo King growth next year, given what we're seeing in the truck market and what you have as offsets with the APU penetration, and like you said, the backlog running into next year? Any preliminary view on that?","Mike Lamach","Yes, it\u2019s too early on that. I mean we'd like to see the update that's coming out around Class A. We'd like to see the updates coming out around refrigerated trailers to know that. My sense is there's no way to burn off all of the backlog we've got in 2019. I know we're into 2020, as it stands. Order rate is still healthy. So just a really early view, which was the same view we gave last time, is when you normalize the 2018 bookings over a 2019 and 2020 revenue cycle, I think you get kind of the steady tact coming out of the business of mid-single-digit growth rates. So I would have no reason to deviate from that at this point.","Gautam Khanna","Thank you, guys. Good luck.","Mike Lamach","In fact, Gautam, I hope, depending on how sort of Brexit really unfolds and unwinds, that next year, we're sort of getting through this low point in Europe. And potentially, we're seeing strength in Europe, which has been markedly slower than North America as a result of just what's happening with the broader European economy.","Gautam Khanna","I appreciate it. Thank you.","Mike Lamach","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Andrew Obin","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Mike Lamach","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Obin","Just a question. There's been a lot of articles. I think the Wall Street Journal had an article how the Europeans are still reluctant to embrace HVAC even despite sort of climate change and the heat wave that you're seeing in Europe. What kind of conversations are you having with customers in Europe regarding HVAC? And are you seeing any structural changes in adoption rates?","Mike Lamach","Yeah, I think you\u2019re largely talking about what consumers might think. But if you think about any institutional building, any data center, any industrial building in Europe, they've got the same requirements that you've got all over the world. And I would say the booking rates there, for us, for multiple years have been extraordinary. We've said, I think in 2016, that we would double the business by 2020, and we're going to definitely do that.","So I look at economy there, that even though it's modeling around kind of flattish, we've had bookings growth and revenue growth that's been in that high teens, low-20s range now for multiple years. But we're not focused on the consumer there per se. Although there is an extraordinary opportunity, I think going forward around the electrification of heat in Europe, as you'll see more of that application as opposed to the problems of boilers in Europe over time. When that happens, I do think we've got a business and a product portfolio that will benefit from that regulatory conversion in Europe to electrification of heat.","Andrew Obin","No, I think I was referring more, if you visit office buildings in Europe in August, they certainly have a different idea of what HVAC is versus North America So I was wondering if requirements are changing. But we can take it off-line. Another question is on supply chain. Are you guys rethinking where and how you're spending CapEx, given all the uncertainty that's taking place?","Mike Lamach","Are you meaning uncertainty in the economy? Uncertainty where?","Andrew Obin","No, I am thinking about \u2013 I am thinking trade uncertainty. And are you thinking \u2013 are you changing where are you spending CapEx globally? And are you sort of having conversations with your supply chain about moving some sources?","Mike Lamach","Yes, when we think about our CapEx, there's been a little difference to how we think about it because we want to make things where we sell things, and that's generally what we've always done. And I would say there's even a stronger concentration of that than it was five years ago. That's been our strategy. As it relates to the supply chain, it depends. Where there is an easy answer, yes, we'll look for an opportunity there if we can, and we've made some movement there. So the answer to your question is, from our own footprint perspective, we're continuing to do what we do from a supply chain perspective. Around the edges, there's things that we do to move supply where we can.","Andrew Obin","Great. Always nice to have an HVAC company that doesn't blame weather. Thanks a lot.","Mike Lamach","Yes, Andrew, just a bit on your question. I'm just going to follow up, I know you're off the line here. But it's interesting a, lot of the Chinese customers that we have that we're looking to move production away from China to maybe avoid some of the U.S.-China tariffs. We're thinking about Mexico as well. I think that some of what they've done and decided has changed over time, and I think we're seeing more in areas like Vietnam, as an example, as opposed to Mexico. So there are changes with our customers in terms of how they're working their footprint for sure. I will take the next question, Chris.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nathan Martin from Seaport Global. Nathan Martin from Seaport Global your line is open.","Mike Lamach","There is no Nathan on the call queue. I think you\u2019ve got the wrong person.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Joe Ritchie","Thank you. Good morning, guys.","Mike Lamach","Good morning, Joe.","Sue Carter","Good morning.","Joe Ritchie","All right, so maybe my first question, Mike, just focusing on Climate operating leverage for the quarter. And so, obviously, like price cost came through well. It seems like the leverage is maybe a little bit lighter than we expected. Was there anything that like just impacted Q2 just from a mix perspective on the Climate side? Anything out of the ordinary?","Mike Lamach","So, Joe, I've got 32%. Were you expecting more than that in the quarter?","Joe Ritchie","Yes, and then my assumptions on price\/cost must be slightly different.","Mike Lamach","Okay, I am just taking $40 million of operating income on a $124 million revenue rise, and that's what I'm looking at.","Joe Ritchie","Okay, all right. Well, I can take it offline. I was trying to sort out the price\/cost component and trying to really determine what the volume leverage was, and it seemed like it was a little bit lower than anticipated. But that's okay. And then I guess maybe just kind of sticking on the commodity, the price\/cost question and see your comments earlier on it being [indiscernible] conservative in the second half of the year. I guess as you're thinking about commodity inflation in 2H, if you look at copper, copper still are going to be pretty depressed. You guys typically will buy ahead of it. And so I guess where were you locked in for copper for the second half of the year? And I guess, what are the kind of \u2013 what are the offsets, potentially, to a copper tailwind in the second half of the year?","Sue Carter","Well, Joe, if you remember, we actually \u2013 when we gave our original guidance for the year, we had actually planned on both copper and steel perhaps having less inflation in Q3 and Q4, and that's basically coming true. So if you think about copper specifically that you asked about, we're about 75% locked for the back half of the year, which is typical for us. Where you'll see the benefit of those spot rates on copper that really have come down is really in 2020, as I said.","So we're doing buys every month for whether it's for 2019 or for 2020, so you'll see the advantage of that appearing in the 2020 numbers. And pretty much the same thing on steel. We know what we're paying for steel about six months in advance. And with either one of those commodities, the highest spot prices were in Q1. They started to come down in Q2, and they'll \u2013 the spot rates that we see right now are down in Q3 and Q4. But again, that's more to our expectations. I don't expect that to be a huge tailwind in the back half of the year. On the other hand, the good news is, is it's not actually a headwind like we've seen for the last couple of years. So like I say we\u2019re taking advantage of it with our buying processes and with our supply chain each and every time we buy the commodities, but it actually is performing about like we expected and called for during the year.","Joe Ritchie","Got you. Thank you both.","Mike Lamach","Thanks, Joe.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citi.","Andy Kaplowitz","Hey, good morning guys.","Mike Lamach","Good morning, Andy.","Andy Kaplowitz","Mike, just following up on China HVAC. Last quarter, you basically were flattish in terms of order growth, and this quarter, up modestly against the tough comps you mentioned. As in last quarter, you were seeing China related demand improved throughout Q1. So did you see that improved demand level of at all in Q2 as other industrial companies are seeing, or do they generally stay steady or even improve in the quarter?","Mike Lamach","I would say, in both Climate and Industrial, from March, forward, bookings have steadily improved in China, specifically. And \u2013 but the markets have shifted. As an example, electronics would be down, say, 15% as a market, but you're going to find other markets that have been compensating for that and some of the heavier industries that would have compensated, and steel would be an example there, something that's \u2013 or power generation, where there's a market both for Industrial and for process cooling in those markets. So that's been good.","Yes, we're stacking quarter one and quarter two of 2019 against plus 20s kinds of comps in quarter one, two of 2018, so the stack in that is sort of still mid \u2013 kind of low to mid-teens growth over the two-year period. So we're happy with kind of what's going on in terms of the strategy there that we had around the direct sales force that we've put in place. And then we're happy with the linkage, the service there. China is slower than it was historically, but still a pretty good market. And there's a focus not quite as strong as Europe around sustainability, but certainly, as I've talked in the past, much more of focus in China around clean air and clean water. That's having a positive impact on what we do.","Andy Kaplowitz","That\u2019s helpful, Mike. And then Mike, you gave us a good clarity on PFS. But could you give us more color on how it's doing as it entered the Ingersoll portfolio? Obviously, a fair amount of industrial and, obviously, more oil and gas exposure there. So have you seen any slowdown in that business versus your initial expectations? It will be helpful if you could just talk about how it's going in so far.","Mike Lamach","Yes, let me start by saying, first of all, from a cultural fit and a performance mentality, from our goal deployment process, from \u2013 I feel like these guys have been here for years, which is fantastic. It's a great fit inside the company. And in terms of achievement of their management plan, they're on track with that. So the mix has changed a little bit, and you see that in some of the shorter cycle, but like the rest of Ingersoll-Rand, they've got kind of measures for how they're dealing with changes. So frankly, it's been positive. Sue, do you have any color on that?","Sue Carter","Yes, it is actually a refreshing type of business because they do have several different brands that they operate under and several different end markets that they go to, and the management team is excellent at finding a real balance between the opportunities in the portfolio and the risks in the portfolio. And they are operating to the management plan that we use when we bought the business, which is great news, both revenue, operating income as well as cash flow.","Mike Lamach","Yes, Andy, maybe some \u2013 just I give you one point of specificity here to the bookings growth in the quarter against if you think about sort of all the food management peers that are out there, that I think are booking negative. We are proud of that.","Andy Kaplowitz","Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.","Mike Lamach","Thank you.","Operator","And I will now turn the call over to Zac Nagle for closing comments.","Zac Nagle","I would like to see everyone \u2013 thank you everyone for joining on today's call. And we \u2013 Shane and I will be available for questions over the next day or two and then in the coming weeks. So if you are interested in having a call, please give us a call and we will schedule sometime. And we look forward to seeing you soon on the road.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Janet Pfeffer, Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relations. Ms. Pfeffer, please begin.","Janet Pfeffer","Thank you, Janine. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Ingersoll-Rand's First Quarter 2013 Conference Call. We released earnings at 7:00 this morning, and the release and slides are posted on our website. As Janine said, this call will be recorded and archived on our website.","If you could please go to Slide 2. Statements made on today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor Provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated. This release also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release.","A couple of things to note before I turn it over to Mike. We will be talking to adjusted margins during our comments this morning, which exclude restructuring and spin-related costs. Our news release and tables give you a reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted margins. This is consistent with how we gave guidance in February.","Also, earlier this year, we transferred a business line from Security Technologies to residential security. There was $18 million of revenue in the first quarter and about $80 million for the full year in 2013. There's not a meaningful impact on margins and no impact at the consolidated level. But in the charts and comments, we will focus on year-over-year change in revenue and orders for those businesses on a comparable basis, so as to best represent underlying performance. The move is also now reflected in our sector revenue guidance for Residential Solutions and Security Technologies.","Now to introduce the participants on this morning's call, Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO; Steve Shawley, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Joe Fimbianti, Director of Investor Relations. With that, please go to Slide 3, and I'll turn it over to Mike.","Michael W. Lamach","Okay. Thanks, Janet. Good morning, and thanks for joining us on today's call. We're pleased with our ability to deliver above our earnings commitment in the first quarter, with solid operational execution. Our revenues for the first quarter were down 1% versus last year, both on a reported basis and excluding foreign exchange, reflecting top line performance pretty close to our view that the demand environment will start out tepid and improve somewhat as we move throughout the year. Orders were also down 1%. At $3.1 billion, revenue was towards the bottom of our guidance range, which was $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion. We saw a slight decline in Climate and Industrial. Residential revenues were up 6% year-over-year on a comparable basis, and Security Technologies revenue was down 3% on a comparable basis.","We increased adjusted earnings per share from continuing ops by 14%. Adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter were $0.42. That's about $0.04 above the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.35 to $0.40. Better performance from operations were about $0.02 above guidance assumptions, again, on a revenue base which was at the lower end of our guidance range.","The tax rate, at 18.5%, was about $0.04 positive to guidance. These were partially offset by the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar, which occurred after we gave guidance. The bolivar devaluation resulted in a $0.02 negative impact on earnings, which was booked in other expense on the P&L.","Adjusted margin decreased 10 basis points. Operations before corporate unallocated costs increased adjusted margins by 30 basis points. Versus 2012's first quarter, adjusted operating margins were up in 2 of the sectors. Residential delivered a 390 basis point improvement and Industrial margin was up 110 basis points despite slightly lower revenues. Lower revenues and mix were a headwind for both Climate and Security. Corporate costs were higher in the quarter due to the higher benefit costs and increased investments related to our IT transformation, which had the first of 6 phases go live earlier this month.","This marks our eighth consecutive quarter of a positive gap between pricing and direct material inflation. Our Lean focus again showed significant results in the implemented value streams. And we continue to invest in the future of the business, funding significant new product development, investing in the new IT platform and building our services footprint.","Spin-off and restructure costs were $0.11 in the quarter. You may recall that in our February guidance, we had also called out a potential non-U.S. discrete tax charge of $0.10, which did not occur. Finally, we initiated our share repurchase program earlier this month and still expect to spend the current $2 billion authorization by the end of the first quarter of next year.","In sum, good operational results in the quarter against a muted demand environment, which we had expected in the quarter. And now Steve will take you through the first quarter results in more detail, and I'll be back with our outlook for the second quarter and the full year.","Steven R. Shawley","Thanks, Mike. Please go to Slide #4. Orders for the first quarter of 2013 were down 1%, both on a reported basis and excluding currency. Global commercial HVAC bookings were down low-single digits. Transport orders were up mid-single digits. Industrial orders were down 1%, with order growth in Europe offset by lower bookings in Americas and Asia. Residential bookings were up low-single digits on a comparable basis. Commercial security orders in the quarter were down mid-single digits on a comparable basis.","Please go to Slide #5. Here's a look at the revenue trends by segment and region. The top half of the chart shows revenue change for each sector. For the total company, first quarter revenues were down 1% versus last year on both a reported basis and excluding currency. Climate revenues decreased 3%, with HVAC revenues down slightly and transport revenues down mid-single digits. Industrial revenues were down 1%. Residential was up 6% on a comparable basis. Commercial security revenues were down 3% on a comparable basis. I'll give you more color on each sector in the next few slides. On the bottom chart, which shows revenue change on a geographic basis, revenues were up 1% in the Americas while Europe and Asia were down mid-single digits.","Please go to Slide #6. This chart walks through the change in adjusted operating margin from first quarter 2012 of 7.5% to first quarter 2013, which was 7.4%. Volume, negative mix and foreign exchange collectively created a 130 basis point headwind to margins. Our pricing programs continued to outpace material inflation, adding 90 basis points to margin. Productivity offset by other inflation was also 90 basis points accretive to margins. Year-over-year investments and other items were higher by 60 basis points.","In the gray box at the top of the page, you can see that lower revenue is deleveraged at 11% in the quarter. That was good performance given the mix of revenue, as well as higher incremental investments. The box in the middle of the page shows the revenue and adjusted operating margin by sector and in total. The operations, excluding corporate, increased adjusted margins by 30 basis points on lower revenues. Corporate costs were higher in the quarter. This increase in corporate costs is mainly due to a favorable stock-based compensation adjustment, taken in Q1 2012, that impacted corporate costs by $6 million and had a total impact on operations of $13 million or $0.03. The remainder of the corporate cost increase is related to our IT transformation.","Please go to Slide #7. The Climate Solutions segment includes Trane, Commercial HVAC and Thermo King transport refrigeration. Total revenues for the first quarter were $1.6 billion. That is down 3% versus last year on a reported basis and down 2% excluding currency. Global commercial HVAC orders were down low-single digits. Orders were down in the Americas and in Asia, but up in Europe. Trane's commercial HVAC first quarter revenues were down slightly. HVAC revenues were down in all major geographic regions. Commercial HVAC equipment revenues were down low-single digits, while HVAC parts, services and solutions revenue was up low-single digits versus prior year. Thermo King orders were up single digits versus 2012's first quarter, with North American trailer orders being up 30%. Thermo King revenues were down mid-single digits. The adjusted operating margin for Climate Solutions was 6.1% in the quarter, 20 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2012 due to lower volumes, unfavorable revenue mix, inflation and higher investment spending, which were largely offset by productivity and pricing.","Please go to Slide #8. Industrial Technologies first quarter revenues were $680 million, down 1%. Air and Productivity revenues were down low-single digits versus last year. Revenues in the Americas were up mid-single digits, but were more than offset by declines in Europe and Asia. Air and Productivity orders were down low-single digits. Higher orders in Europe were offset by lower orders in Americas and Asia. Club Car revenues in the quarter were up mid-single digits, and orders were flat versus prior year. Industrial's adjusted operating margin of 15.4% was up 110 basis points compared with last year despite lower revenues. Pricing and productivity more than offset lower volumes, inflation and higher investment spending.","Please go to Slide #9. In the Residential business, first quarter revenues of 640 -- I'm sorry, $464 million were up 10% compared with last year. Adjusted for the product line move, comparable revenues were up 6%. Residential HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits versus last year. Our HVAC unit shipments in the first quarter were up high-single digits versus the prior year. Revenues for the residential security portion of the sector were up low-single digits on a comparable basis, with increases in the new builder channel in South America partially offset by lower Big Box revenues. Sector operating margin of 1.5% was up 390 basis points compared with 2012, as pricing, volume and productivity more than offset inflation and adverse mix.","Please go to Slide #10. Revenues for Security Technologies were $352 million, down 7% on a reported basis and down 3% on a comparable basis. Americas revenues were down low-single digits. Revenues were down mid-single digits in Europe and flat in Asia. Bookings on a comparable basis were down mid-single digits. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 18%, down 150 basis points from last year, as productivity and price realization were more than offset by inflation, lower volumes, adverse mix and higher investment spending.","Please go to Slide #11. We finished the first quarter with working capital of 4.3% of revenues. Working capital and cash flow levels were consistent with our historical seasonal performance.","With that, I will turn it back to Mike to take you through our guidance.","Michael W. Lamach","Okay. Thanks, Steve, and please go to Slide 12. Just as a reminder, for purposes of giving guidance for 2013, it's on as-is basis. It assumes the current Ingersoll Rand with the 4 current operating sectors is in place for the full 12 months of 2013. As we announced in December, we expect the security spin to take place in the fourth quarter. But to be clear, this guidance does not reflect the spin, given we do not yet have the carve-out financials and the specific date of the spin won't be known for several more months. Consistent with our February guidance, we have broken out spin and restructuring costs from the core EPS guidance, in order to give the best representation of the company without the impact of the impending spin. But there is no change or update to the information we gave you last on the spin. It's proceeding according to our time line, and we won't have pro forma financials for a couple more months. We expect to file the Form 10 in the June time frame.","Based on our results in the first quarter and our visibility for the remainder of the year, we are reaffirming our consolidated outlook. Our revenue outlook for 2013, therefore, is unchanged at $14.2 billion to $14.6 billion, which equates to 1% to 4% growth versus 2012. U.S. nonresidential construction starts and Put in Place trends have not changed significantly since our prior guidance. Institutional markets are expected to be down for the year by 3%. The 2013 outlook for commercial and industrial Put in Place is unchanged, up 8%. Increases in bank and office buildings and retail support our view of a stronger second half versus first half for the unitary HVAC business. We continue to expect low-single digit growth in North American commercial HVAC and flat to low-single digit decline in North American commercial security. We expect North American truck trailer markets to be fairly flat in 2013. Asian HVAC equipment markets are expected to be fairly flat in 2013. China HVAC is expected to be up low- to mid-single digits. Industrial Technologies expects markets to be fairly flat, slightly down in Asia in 2013. And our Asian security business, which is more influenced by the timing of large infrastructure projects, should be up high-single digits for the year. Overall, we expect revenues from Europe, Middle East and Africa, taken together, to be up slightly.","Translating that to our outlook by sector, we expect Climate Solutions revenue to be up 1% to 3%. Industrial Technologies revenues are forecasted to show more moderate growth than the past couple of years, with growth of 1% to 4%. Residential is expected to be up 8% to 10% and that compares to prior guidance of 4% to 6%, and the change there is truly due to the product line transfer that Janet mentioned in our opening. And Security Technologies to be down 2% to 4% on a reported basis, again reflecting the impact of the product line transfer. On a comparable basis, Security would be up 1% to 3%.","Please go to Slide 13. On the basis I discussed earlier, our guidance for full year EPS from continuing operations remains at $3.45 to $3.65 per share, and this includes onetime deal costs from restructuring of $0.40 to $0.60. The full year tax rate forecast for 2013 is still expected to be 23%.","For the focus on second quarter guidance, please refer to the right-hand column on this chart. Second quarter 2013 revenues are forecast to be $3.8 billion to $3.9 billion. That translates to a range of down 1% to up 2% versus the second quarter of 2012. Adjusted second quarter earnings per share are forecast to be $1.05 to $1.10. Security spin-off and restructure costs are expected to be about $0.06 in the quarter. We are assuming a share count of 300 million shares and an ongoing tax rate of 23%. For the full year 2013, we still expect to generate available cash flow of about $1.1 billion, excluding onetime and restructuring costs.","In closing, we're pleased to have delivered a solid first quarter. We continue to feel good about our company and our progress. Our focus is on positioning Ingersoll Rand to continue to grow earnings and cash flow with very little help from markets. We've implemented a consistent shareholder-focused capital allocation program. We proactively work to reduce costs and improve productivity while still making prudent investments for the future. We continue to invest in new products and service offerings and our IT infrastructure and further developing our people and our operating capabilities.","In sum, I'm proud of the progress we're making, results we've delivered, and we're looking forward to delivering on a successful 2013 for our shareholders, customers and employees.","Now Steve and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So just wondering on the share repo you've -- you stated in the press release you started that off in April, which was a bit sooner than we expected, yet I want to reconcile that to your share count assumptions, which are, I think, 300 million for 2Q and 300 million for the full year, which suggests that you've taken baby steps in the repo in 2Q. I'm wondering if you just have some thoughts in terms of $2 billion, how much would be pre-spin and post-spin.","Steven R. Shawley","We haven't changed that view, Nigel. It's going to be around $900 million pre-spin through the end of the year. We're stretching it out a little further, starting a little sooner in Q2 than we thought about before. So we haven't changed the total profile, $900 million this -- pre-spin and then $1.2 billion or so post-spin.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And obviously, you're still looking through the documentation. But do have any more intel in terms of the tax domicile of the spin co?","Michael W. Lamach","We -- Nigel, in the announcement, we intend for it to be an Irish domiciled company. We won't have anything back on that yet for a couple of months relative to SEC filing, conversations with the IRS, et cetera.","Operator","The next question is from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","The -- I think in a couple of your segments, the year-over-year revenue change on the low end was tweaked down by 1%. You guys didn't change your -- the revenue, the $14.2 billion low end of range. I mean, is that just rounding and stuff like that?","Steven R. Shawley","Pretty much, Steve. It's just a rounding issue.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, there's no change to your share count even though you're kind of starting the stock buyback a little bit earlier than expected?","Steven R. Shawley","Not significantly, no. It's still around 300 million for the average for the year.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, on -- I guess, any commentary on resi HVAC kind of into April here, in the first few weeks of April?","Michael W. Lamach","Steve, added [ph] for the new quarter, I wouldn't view that as the most important quarter of year. But no comments on second quarter as of yet.","Operator","The next question is from Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","It looks like your segment guidance is, overall, not really changing. I just want to maybe -- if you can give us a sense of shading, where you kind of feel better or worse within the businesses versus your internal expectations as you kind of leave 1Q into 2Q, and maybe just kind of talk about trajectory into 2Q versus kind of how you were originally thinking about it?","Michael W. Lamach","Yes. I mean, we're seeing really strong execution in our industrial businesses and that's really an emphasis on the long-term approach we've had towards product development and Lean really coming to fruition there, so a great margin in the quarter. I think it's a record, actually, for us in the first quarter, the margin in the industrial business well on track. Also seeing good margin improvements in the residential business. Of course, Q1 is the smallest and almost a meaningless quarter in the grand scheme of the year there, but good execution coming into the year. I think from an inventory position perspective, they've done much to ensure that we've got the right product at the right time for our customers there. So good momentum, I think, with that business going in. Security actually had a pretty good quarter. But there's a bit of a mix shift going on there, whereas the climate business, Trane, would be a bit indifferent as to applied or unitary institutional versus commercial. I mean, it has a little tougher impact on the security business in North America. We see much higher commercial activity, banks, office buildings and such, versus institutional, so that mix hurts a little bit. We also closed a factory in Q1 in China and merging that into an existing plant that we have in Mexico. And so the costs associated with that and the opportunity later in the year to sort of deal with the landfill there, are other opportunities for us. I think the margins there will certainly shape up to the back half of the year to be as what we forecasted all along, and that's roughly to be flat for the year. And then, really, from the climate side, the TK bookings were good, particularly in North America, that related to trailer. So it's a solid sign going forward for us, that the new product acceptance has been great. We're ramping that up as quickly as we can to make sure we take advantage of it fully. And in HVAC, it's a bit of a mixed bag. We see growth in North America, growth in China. We see it certainly in North America to be on the office and retail side. And institutional markets will still be down about 3% in North America, so the growth will come mainly on the unitary side of the business. And in China, we're kind of seeing what we expected there, which is recovering book to bill. I want to say book to bill in China for the quarter was about 1.26. So we need that to continue, but it's a good start.","Operator","The next question is from Shannon O'Callaghan of Nomura Securities.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Hey, Mike, just maybe a little more color on how you see these verticals playing out in the commercial HVAC side. I mean, the bookings were down mid-single, but it sounds like you're seeing some encouraging indicators on the noninstitutional part. Can you just maybe give a little more color on how you see that playing out?","Michael W. Lamach","Yes, in fact, Shannon, I'll probably back you up to quarter 1 last year. Interesting, quarter 1 of last year in our unitary portfolio throughout the company was up 29% quarter-to-quarter. It was just a phenomenal start to last year, so we're really coming against a less pretty tough comp there just for comparison. It was a pretty good applied quarter too. We're up 13%. So equipment orders were up 20% in quarter 1 last year. Now in the year, what we're seeing is that we'll continue to see applied institutional, particularly K-12, and down negative 10 mid-digits, health care may be a little bit better than that but still negative. But the real growth will come from office and retail and actually from bank buildings, and we do fairly well there. In fact, we're the market leader there as it relates to share for unitary product that goes into that market. So -- and that's something, again, if you look at the places that volume will hit us, it will hit us in places that we've had ongoing Lean efforts and ongoing product development efforts over the last couple of years. So I feel pretty good about our ability to convert on that volume at relatively strong incrementals.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then just on the resi side. I mean, I know it's early here. But in terms of what you've seen so far there, new versus replacement, any change in sort of consumer behavior?","Michael W. Lamach","Well, new is up about 30%, replacement up high-single digits, maybe 10%. So clearly, the market is still sitting at 85% replacement. There's no real mix shift there. The only shift within that, I would say, continues to be the decline of R-22 in the portfolio. And as we said all along, that's a good thing.","Operator","The next question is from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Just wondering if we can get a little more color, Mike, on price costs going forward. You indicated you've got 8 quarters under your belt now. But just how do you see the rest of the year playing in the context of maybe where your hedges are on copper and other raw mats and what kind of benefit you may have on the cost side relative to price pressure that you're expecting in the back half, if any.","Michael W. Lamach","Yes. Sure, Jeff. In the first quarter, we saw price cost positive 90 basis points, and I think that the material inflation environment will continue to be fairly tame, not only sort of the market but what we've locked in. So we've actually been lapped most of our larger price increases. So for the year, I think price will just be under -- maybe just under 1%. So I would expect the gap to material inflation to be closer to 40 to 50 basis points, which is a little bit better than we thought we would have at the beginning of the year. We actually -- I'd have to check this, but I think we're probably now a larger buyer of aluminum than copper. Again, a multiyear effort to move away from copper to aluminum. So copper is becoming less important to us there. We hedged out in Q2 about 3\/4 of our demand and for the full year, about 2\/3 of our demand. And then for aluminum, here, we're typically buying that through finished product with suppliers, and so we're buying that not directly but through rep purchases.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And just wondering on the share repurchase. You hit it a couple of times already and no apparent big change in your plan. But relative to kind of what you ultimately plan to do with leverage ratios, it does seem like you really could and perhaps should do more earlier. Just your thought process on that and why kind of soft pedal it.","Steven R. Shawley","I think that really what we've said the strategy this year was, Jeff, to devote pretty much all of our available cash after dividends to share repurchase. That's roughly the $900 million. I think that when we talked about that, we said, \"Look, we feel pretty comfortable about doing that from operating cash flows, worst case.\" So if we didn't -- are able to complete the spin this year, we'd still be able to at least do that. And that's what comprises our current guidance. I think that as we go through the rest of the year, we'll try to take advantage of whatever we can, timing of refinancings, et cetera, to try to continue to pull this thing up further, as far into the year as we can. It's pretty tough when you start, even in April and May, to get a big impact on your average, but we'll certainly be opportunistic and take advantage where we can there.","Operator","The next question is from Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a question in terms of looking at your outlook for the remainder of the year. Given where the first quarter played out, where you're guiding for the second quarter seems to hit the high end of your revenue outlook. We need to see some pretty good acceleration in the second half. Could you just talk us through the markets? What needs to happen to get to the upper end of your guidance?","Michael W. Lamach","Yes, you're correct, Andrew. We need second half revenues to be about $375 million or about 5% higher than the first half of the year so -- I'm sorry, than the second half of last year. And so we were looking at it this way, about 1 point, we should get from price. Residential's growth rate from the first half to the second half is only about 1 point higher in the second half. And then given the momentum in housing, it seems pretty reasonable. On a dollar basis, the large increase would be in commercial HVAC. And within that, the majority of that growth will come from North America and Asia. In North America, in particular, we project good growth in unitary equipment and in contracting parts and services. And we've made investments in contracting parts and services and had more feet on the street there than we've ever had in anticipation of being able to drive that business. For unitary, we believe the growth in equipment is going to be in the retail and office and bank building verticals in particular. That's, of course, the growth outlook we've got for the second half of the year there. With TK, revenue goes from negative in the first half to a positive in the second. It will end about flat, but most of the swing is in North America and we feel good about that given the bookings we saw in the first quarter. The commercial security outlook has always called for a stronger second half for nonresidential construction in our key institutional markets. And so we need for that to improve in the year. With that being said, the other actions we're looking at there to make sure that we're protecting the profitability of the business in the event that those markets don't recover. As an example, the integration of a plant in China into Mexico and the benefit that we should see in the back half of the year there. So we ultimately [ph] all of Asian businesses to accelerate as we go through the year. Again, the book to bill was good in quarter 1. We've seen that so far in our bookings, but we'll need to see traction there continue in that region to support the second half forecast.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got you. And just a follow-up question. On security revenue and profit, you had very good fourth quarter and we've seen a sort of decline in sequential performance. Could you just give us more color as to what happened on a sequential basis on that business?","Michael W. Lamach","Well, you're going to see fundamentally the shift we're talking about in office and retail markets. And so they're typically in the security business. We're not selling the premium brands. We're selling sort of the next tier down and it's a more competitive environment. So when that business grows there -- I was commenting earlier about the institutional markets are more important in the security business. As those commercial markets grow, it's not the same effect that we have in Trane, where we're clearly comfortable watching applied or unitary grow. In the security business, it's much more beneficial for us to see institutional markets grow.","Operator","The next question is from Steve Volkmann of Jefferies.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Curious if you have any comments about -- I know this isn't a particularly important quarter, but some of the competitors seem like they had some positive order rates in HVAC, both commercial and resi and I know the mix is always an issue. But just curious if you think there are any trends with respect to market shares that we should be cognizant of?","Michael W. Lamach","When we look at commercial unitary and you look at that from large all the way down to widest [ph] , remember that we sell the bulk of the white[ph] through our climate business there. Again, reflect back on the quarter 1 last year, it was a plus 29% growth rate. I don't think anybody was close to that last year. I think one might have been 20%, one was 6% and one didn't report it even so, it was a really good quarter last year for us there. When you look at the res business, you don't want to draw conclusions here on any one month or any one quarter for sure, particularly not the first quarter, which, as you said, is the most unimportant quarter of the year for us. So our 23 -- our 2013 forecast doesn't show share loss in any of the SEER ratings or efficiencies in the marketplace, any portion of the market. Just executing our multiyear product strategy, a channel strategy, we're extremely cognizant of the interaction between price and share and fixed cost leverage. And so we're going to make decisions there based on this type of analysis and doing what we think the optimal outcome is for the business based on that mix. So long story short, we're not forecasting a share loss in '13. We saw a nice share gain in 2012, kind of recovering from 2011. We see the continuation of that, particularly with all the 13, 14 SEER products really now in the portfolio coming into the season.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. And just maybe to finish up the same question on TK. Obviously, pretty strong orders there.","Michael W. Lamach","Yes, North American trailer revenues were actually right on for the first quarter. Market acceptance for the new Precedent product was a lot stronger than our original expectations. We had truck orders up 30% in the first quarter. I think the industry was down like 2% for total industry based on the ac [ph] volumes, so good success there. We're ramping up on production of the new products to meet the increased demand, saw actually a nice growth in marine although it's a very small business for us. Yes, all in all, I think it supports the back half of the year forecast for us.","Steven R. Shawley","So a quick correcting comment here, it was the trailer business in North America that was up 30%. I mean, we do define [ph] it between truck and trailer, but the trailer was the piece that was up 30%.","Operator","The next question is from Julian Mitchell of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, if I look at the EBIT margin bridge on Slide 6, the 130 bps headwind you had from volume mix and FX, FX, I guess, doesn't really do a lot for the rest of the year based on spot rates. Volume-wise, you've talked about an acceleration in some areas being built in. If you think about mix, you called that out as a headwind in 3 of the 4 segments. Security, I guess, carries on because of the institutional markets being weak. But if you focus on resi and the resi HVAC and also climate tech, I mean, climate tech, you should see mix become a tailwind, I guess, as Thermo King revenues recover. Is there any reason why mix therefore wouldn't snap back in subsequent quarters?","Steven R. Shawley","Yes, if you take a look at what we're expecting, really, the Thermo King story is a positive mix story, Julian. If you look at the contracting service and parts stories on the Trane commercial business, that's a positive mix story for us in the second half of the year for sure. So the thing that may be a little bit tough will be the security mix through maybe even the second quarter because of the vertical market dynamics that Mike just went through. But there's no reason why we shouldn't see mix come back to a more normal profile for, certainly, the second half. The other thing that Mike mentioned, the expectations for China. And what happened with our China bookings in the first quarter was we're -- actually book to bill in China was well over 1, like 1.2. We get great margins out of both the commercial HVAC business there and also the industrial business. So that should also serve us well from a mix standpoint in the second half, Julian.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then just secondly, if we think about Security specifically, you talked a little bit about sequentially Q4, Q1 and so on. Cameron [ph] , obviously, had pretty bad numbers and cut guidance yesterday. What is it that's changed exactly or changed in your outlook? Is it simply just the institutional side coming down and you're not yet seeing a pickup on commercial to offset it? Is there anything going on competitively or pricing-wise? Or is it just institutional volumes in the U.S. and Europe are a bit worse?","Michael W. Lamach","Institutional volumes are down. Where we've seen actually growth in the HVAC business in Europe, we have not seen growth in the Security business in Europe. And so I hope there is -- that's a bit of a lagging effect in the back half of the year before Security Actually shows a bit of an increase in Europe as well. So that should help us in the back half of the year there. But Europe was below our expectations. The mix in the Americas was a bit more skewed towards the commercial sort of brands as opposed to institutional brands there. But again, there's also a lot of activity spent in the quarter moving a very large plant, closing it down and then the process of moving that to Mexico, and the benefit of that really shows up in the third quarter and fourth quarter relative to margins. So I think the top line makes sense. I don't think there's a lot of shifts going on there at the top line. And then from a margin recovery perspective, I feel pretty good about Security continuing to work to flat by the end of the year.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then lastly, just residential mix. What are you expecting on resi HVAC mix for this year?","Michael W. Lamach","Well, our unit volumes were actually up close to 10%. So you can tell from the reported numbers that the volume numbers gave you, that we're continuing the mix as well in the opening price point section of the market. We'll continue to see that happen throughout the year, taking a large share in that full product range as well. So that's sort of what the volume is, Julian. It's going to take us another year, 1.5 years, a couple seasons probably before I would tell you that, that mix shift down wouldn't impact the res business. But the [indiscernible], the combination of price, volume and fixed cost leverage really is the analytics that go into that decision. And any time you can run the business with an improvement of 390 basis points, it feels pretty good going into the next quarter. And we're going to continue what we're doing there and improve business from there.","Operator","The next question is from Jamie Sullivan of RBC Capital Markets.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So just to follow on, you talked about the mix in Climate a little bit. Can you just remind us what the mix of equipment versus services is in that business?","Michael W. Lamach","For Trane, call it, say, maybe 35%.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Is services?","Michael W. Lamach","Actually, closer to 60-40, 40% services.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Great. Okay. Great, that's helpful. And what are you assuming this year for growth from those 2 pieces? Can you give us a little color there?","Michael W. Lamach","Yes. I think from a services perspective, we're going to continue to see services growing mid-single digits. And for us, it's a function of technician support, service dollars, kind of covering the market, building out the footprint. So we have been able to track to sort of headcount additions like clockwork in terms of volume growth. So I would consider mid-single digit growth to be in the cards there for us.","Operator","The next question is from Steve Winoker of Sanford Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just first specific question, margin impact of the product line transfer. I know you talked about the top line. What was the specific margin line impact for the 2 units?","Michael W. Lamach","Joint venture. So we were consolidating it and it was -- we reported a very low sort of number there. So almost negligible, maybe a 5% operating margin or less on the shift itself.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then could you maybe speak to -- you mentioned it's the first of 6 phases on the ERP or the IT system to go live and the corporate cost impact. But if you sort of look at that relative to your productivity expectations and benefits, maybe talk about how that is playing out, both through the rest of the year and into -- as you see going forward.","Michael W. Lamach","Yes. I think, if you're talking specifically on corporate cost structure, Steve kind of gave you a little bit of reconciliation between the $42 million unallocated this year and $32 million last year, and part of it was the stock-based comp that he talked about a second ago. But we would think 2013 would be about $180 million. Last year, it was $163 million. And the largest investment we're making there is really around common systems. And we really don't get the benefit of that common system work until they sort of cross at least the midpoint of the implementation, kind of the fourth to the sixth phase, before we start to lap the costs. So we've got another 1.5 years or so, maybe a bit longer, worth of hill to climb before we get the recovery there. And we have no changed expectations. We believe it's a significant item in getting our overall IT costs down to, what we believe, are world-class levels and that there's as much as 50, 80 basis points of improvement when we're done, just on the cost of systems, let alone the cost of supporting the systems and of course, the benefit of the information you get from better systems.","Operator","The next question is from Deane Dray of Citi Research.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I was at the ISC West trade show last week in Las Vegas and there was a lot of new products for Ingersoll Rand security, and was hoping you could comment on what the underlying drivers should be, especially regarding education. A lot of products on the lock side and doors and so forth. And how meaningful could that be for the business over the near term?","Michael W. Lamach","It's probably the #1 growth driver in that business, really is the electronification of mechanical locks. And I would say the #1 market for that would be of all education, K-12 and higher ed. And it's really partially attributable to the unfortunate things that we're seeing around the world. And the thing about that lock is the ability to do that in a relatively -- that whole system, a very inexpensive way of implementing a system in a wireless way, with lockdown ability inside of 10 seconds. And I think some of our competitors would have that capability twice a day versus every 10 seconds. And so there's a real advantage to that. We've got excellent organic capability for product development. We're working on, of course, channels to market there and have had great success with particularly colleges and universities adapting the system you saw, the electronic lock you saw, the wireless lock as well as the aptiQ card system.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, that's the system that uses the smartphones, correct?","Michael W. Lamach","Well, it's one of the options that they can use with aptiQ is using a smartphone. But yes, near-field communications would certainly be one of the potential options that you could take, along with the ability to format with any other credential.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And then just to switch over to the Trane residential side. Was hoping to get some context about how this cycle could be playing out and how might it differ. So there's not any efficiency SEER 13 type of change going on. Maybe there's some of the equipment that's in the field has been fixed repeatedly as opposed to replaced. But just take us through in a normal -- what -- how the cycle may play out in terms of within that context, no regulatory boost. Maybe what's out there is a bit more aged.","Michael W. Lamach","Yes, I mean, we can get into the algorithm to do that. And actually, that's really going to be useful for us here. But clearly, the systems that are there are aging and we're seeing less repair than we would have seen from 2 years ago. And that trend continues toward system replacement. R-22 is down 20%. So when we are seeing replacement, we're seeing full [ph] replacement itself. Without sort of trying to model it totally out for you on the phone here, it lends toward, I would say, a slow release of the replacement demand over a 3- to 5-year period.","Operator","I am showing no more questions in the queue, and I would like to turn the conference back for any further remarks.","Janet Pfeffer","Thank you, Janine. Thank you, everyone, and Joe and I will be available for follow-up questions later today. Have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's program. This does conclude the conference, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a good day."],"11178":["Ingersoll-Rand Plc (NYSE:IR) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 31, 2018 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Zac Nagle - VP, IR","Mike Lamach - Chairman and CEO","Sue Carter - SVP and CFO","Joe Fimbianti - Former Director of IR","Analysts","Steve Winoker - UBS","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo","David Raso - Evercore ISI","Joel Tiss - BMO Capital Markets","Zac Nagle","Thanks, Operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Ingersoll-Rand's Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call. This call is also being webcast on our Web site at ingersollrand.com, where you'll find the accompanying presentation. We are also recording and archiving this call on our Web site.","Please go to slide two. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from our anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. The participants on today's call are Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO, and Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO.","With that, please go to slide four, and I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike.","Mike Lamach","Thanks, Zac, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. As I've said a number of times since we held our Analyst Day in May of 2017, I am more bullish about Ingersoll-Rand's position to execute on our strategy to deliver strong shareholder returns over the next several years that I've been at any other time in my tenure as CEO.","Please go to slide four. I'd like to start this morning by reviewing the fundamental elements of our business strategy, because in the midst of any busy earnings season, it's easy to move directly to microtrends and quarterly pluses and minuses and to lose sight of the larger fundamental picture and trends that really drive value for long-term shareholders.","First, our underlying strategic objectives continue to be to deliver profitable growth through leadership positions and durable markets underpinned by global megatrends such as sustainability and the need to dramatically reduce energy demand and resource constraints in buildings, homes, industrial, and transport markets around the world. We focus on innovation and delivering the most reliable energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly products and services available, enabled by digital and other exponential technologies. We excel at delivering energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing food waste, preserving natural resources, and generating productivity for our customers. We maintain a healthy level of investment in our businesses to sustain leading brands which are number one or number two in virtually every market in which we participate. It's important to highlight that we continue to invest to maintain the portfolio with superior breadth and depth in nearly every major product category in which we compete.","In 2017, we continued our product growth team efforts, launching approximately 70 new major products throughout the world. We continue to strengthen our digital capabilities and creating value with customers and achieving competitive advantage. We launched TracKing, Thermo King's new asset management system through [ph] remote connectivity, best-in-class mobile apps, and data gathering, customers make their fleets more predictable and traceable, without taking assets off the roads, removing perishable goods. This ultimately strengthens their control and creates efficiencies.","This month, we introduced the Club Car Tempo Connect, the first car available with standard digital technologies that enhance the experience for golfers and course owners. We also applied breakthrough digital technology such as Trane GO to strengthen our residential HVAC connection with consumers and help them make more informed purchase decisions. This has resulted in a 2017 increase of 30% in our lead in closure rate with consumers. In 2017 alone, we doubled the size of our EcoWise portfolio of products, significantly ahead of regulatory requirements. These are products that reduce the impact on the environment and meet regulatory requirements for the use of next-generation low global warming potential refrigerants without compromising efficiency and operating performance.","This month, we introduced the latest addition to the EcoWise portfolio, the Trane Agility, a new water-cooled centrifugal chiller product line ideal for retrofitting existing commercial buildings. In Compression Technologies we continued to expand our products and service offerings. In 2018, we'll significantly expand our market coverage for contact coolant [ph] compressors to meet growing customer demand. On the services side, we'll be adding remote connectivity to rotary and oil-free equipment service offerings across North America.","Our pipeline of innovation that solves complex customer problems is as exciting as ever, and we have no intention of slowing down. Second, our business model is designed to excel at delivering strong top line incremental margins and free cash flow through our business operating system over the long-term. Our business operating system underpins everything we do, and it enables us to consistently generate high levels of free cash flow which fuels our dynamic capital allocation strategy. In 2017, our business operating system enabled us to deliver free cash flow of $1.3 billion, which was 118% of adjusted net income.","While the leverage in our Climate business we below our historical and long-term objectives, we overcame a number of headwinds during 2017, including persistent rising inflation, and more pronounced success in penetrating underserved HVAC markets in China than we had anticipated. We expect our Climate segment to return to historical leverage levels in 2018 and beyond. 2017 capital allocation was dynamic and balanced with healthy investments and organic innovation, and new acquisitions and partnerships in key strategic channels and technologies. We also continued to substantially increase the divided during the year, and repurchased over $1 billion of our outstanding shares.","And finally, over the years we've built an experienced management team and a high-performance culture which gives me confidence in our ability to deliver strong results consistently over the long term. I hope this provides further insight into why I've never been so excited about the next few years for Ingersoll-Rand. We are extremely well-positioned to deliver strong shareholder returns going forward.","Moving to slide five, and turning our attention back to 2017, we met or exceeded the commitments we made in January, 2017, when we gave our full-year 2017 guidance. We exceeded the top end of the range on the core financial metrics; revenue growth, adjusted EPS, and free cash flow. Importantly, we also delivered against our capital allocation commitments, deploying $1.9 billion between dividends, share buybacks, and acquisitions. We met the lower end of our guidance range on adjusted operating margins. As we move through the presentation we'll spend time discussing our path to delivering improved operating margin leverage in 2018 as this is a key area of focus for us.","And now I'd like to turn it over to Sue to provide more details on the quarter and our market outlook and guidance for 2018. Sue?","Sue Carter","Thank you, Mike. Please go to slide number six. I'd like to begin with a summary of main points to takeaway from today's call. As Mike discussed, we drove solid operating and financial results in the fourth quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.02, an increase of 21% versus the year-ago period. We delivered high quality earnings which helped drive 2017 free cash flow to $1.3 billion or 118% of adjusted net income.","Organic bookings and revenue growth was strong in both our Climate and Industrial segments. In the Industrial segment we delivered low-teens bookings growth in all three industrial businesses. We also delivered the strongest organic revenue growth quarter of the past three years. Additionally, the business continues to make steady improvements in its overall operating performance.","On the Climate side, organic booking were up high single digits in Commercial HVAC, with low-teens growth in North America and solid growth in all other regions, except for Latin America. Organic revenue growth was also strong, up 6%, and was broad-based across all of our Climate businesses. Our Industrial business continues to strengthen its operational performance ahead of our expectations, with 160 basis points of improvement in adjusted operating margins on 5% organic revenue growth. Organic revenues were up low single digits in Compressor Technology and low-teens in Club Car and Industrial Products.","Importantly, we also delivered balanced capital allocation results while meeting the commitments we laid out for investors in our guidance in January of 2017. We deployed $430 million on dividends, and increased the dividend 12.5% during the year, consistent with our commitment to maintaining a strong and growing divided over the long-term. We deployed $1 billion on share buybacks as the shares continued to trade below our calculated intrinsic value. To date, we've also deployed or entered into commitments for approximately $460 million in strategic value-accretive technology and channel acquisitions, two of which we announced in January of 2018.","Please go to slide number seven. The focused execution of our business strategy underpinned by our business operating system enabled us to drive solid year-over-year financial performance. We delivered organic revenue growth of 6%, adjusted operating margin improvement of 20 basis points, and an adjusted earnings per share increase of 21%. Strong gains in volume, productivity, and positive price more than offset headwinds from material cost inflation.","Please go to slide number eight. Organic order growth was robust in the fourth quarter. In fact, it was the fastest organic order growth for the enterprise in over three years, with broad-based growth in nearly all businesses. Commercial HVAC bookings were up high single digits. Commercial HVAC bookings in North America were up low-teens, and EMEA grew high single digits, while Asia grew low single digits. Our Transport business continued to demonstrate its diversity and resiliency, posting modest growth in EMEA, Latin America, and Asia, and strong growth in APUs, truck, air, and in the aftermarket business. These gains nearly offset expected weakness in the North America trailer market, netting a low single-digit decline in total transport orders.","Industrial bookings were strong, up 12%, with low-teens growth in all three of the businesses. Regionally, North America, Latin America, and Asia all posted strong gains modestly offset by softer markets in EMEA.","Please go to slide number nine, in our Climate segment organic revenue was up mid single digits in North America, up high single digits in Europe, and basically flat in Asia, where low-teens growth in China was offset by softness in other countries in the Asia Pacific region. In our Compression Technologies business North America was up low-teens in equipment and high single digits in parts and services. Industrial Products, which includes our Tools, Fluid Management, and Material Handling businesses, and Small Electric Vehicles were both up low-teens. Overall, North America and international revenues were up mid single digits, netting a 6% organic growth rate for the enterprise.","Please go to slide number 10. Q4 adjusted operating margin improved 20 basis points primarily driven by strong volume, productivity improvements, and positive price, partially offset by material inflation, investments in products and services, and lower margin business mix from our continued success penetrating underserved markets in China HVAC. We discussed the impact of China business mix on our third quarter call, but we'll spend some more time discussing our underserved market penetration strategy in our Topics of Interest section towards the end of our prepared remarks.","Please go to slide 11. Our Climate segment delivered strong broad-based revenue growth across the business. Operating margins were impacted primarily by material inflation and our mix of business from underserved markets in China.","Please go to slide 12. As previously noted, operating performance in our Industrial business continues to steadily improve across the board. In the fourth quarter, the segment delivered low-teens organic bookings growth, 160 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, and 5% organic revenue growth. Our continued focus on improving the fundamental operations of the business is making industrial a stronger, more resilient business which should allow us lever up nicely as the industrial markets continue to gradually improve.","Please go to slide 13. Strong execution of our strategy and our business operating system continues to deliver powerful free cash flow. We continue to grow earnings, manage working capital to the right levels including having inventory to meet growth and on-time customer delivery and invest in capital expenditures to support our businesses. We delivered $1.3 billion of free cash flow in 2017, which enabled us to maintain our strong balance sheet and retain optionality as our markets continue evolve. It also enabled us to execute against our balanced capital allocation priority and commitments to drive long-term value for shareholders.","Please go to slide 14. In 2017, we executed a balanced capital allocation plan and delivered against the commitments we made out at the beginning of the year employing capital where it earns the best returns. We maintained a healthy level of business investments in product, technology, and innovation to extend our market leadership and to help customers solve their most complex challenges.","We made strategic investments in value accretive technology and channel acquisition that further improved long-term shareholder returns. We maintained a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve and retain a BBB credit rating. We executed against our longstanding commitment to a reliable, strong, and growing dividend.","We also raised the dividend 12.5% which is ahead of the rate of earnings growth. Additionally, we deployed approximately $1 billion on share repurchases as the shares continue to trade below their intrinsic value. As we look forward to 2018 and beyond, we want to be very clear about how we are thinking about capital allocation. We are committed to a dynamic capital allocation strategy that consistently deploys excess cash to the best return on investment opportunities.","Our overarching strategy and priorities remain the same as I just outlined and that we executed in 2017. We have a strong balance sheet and good optionality, and we don\u2019t anticipate a need to add cash to our balance sheet for the foreseeable future. We are excited about the future and the opportunities that are ahead to deploy excess capital to the best RIO investments, whether that be investment in the business, raising the dividend, repurchasing shares, or making value accretive acquisitions.","Please go to slide 15. Let me take a moment to discuss the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In December, we booked the impacts of U.S. tax reform through the P&L on a provisional basis. We booked in largely non-cash benefit from revaluing our deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new rate of 21% versus the prior 35% rate. We also booked a liability for repatriation tax of approximately $160 million, which is payable over the next eight years.","We also booked a few other tax related entries in Q4. And all tax reform and other entries are in the non-GAAP tables presented with the press release. We have had access to our cash through our tax efficient structure for many years. We have utilized our cash to invest in our business in energy efficient and sustainable products and have returned cash to shareholders through our competitive and growing dividend and share repurchases. Our actual cash repatriation is expected to be between 10% and 20% of our year-end cash balance. We will continue to utilize our tax efficient structure in the future. And our projected tax rates are expected to remain in the low 20s.","Please go to slide number 17. I would like to begin our guidance conversation with some color around what we are expecting from our end markets. Overall, global economic activity was helping in 2017. And a majority of economic indicators point to a continuation of this trend in 2018.","With a positive economic backdrop and our strategic product portfolio focused on global megatrend such energy efficiency and sustainability, we see positive momentum in the majority of our market in 2018. The setup for North America commercial and residential HVAC market looks positive. And we are expecting a mid-single digit growth in these core markets.","In North America, approximately half of our commercial business is services and parts where we had good growth throughout 2017 and where the nature of the business generally tends to provide a more stable and recurring annuity stream than put-in-place equipment which would be associated with things like new building starts. We have also had strong demand for upgrades to connected buildings and for energy retrofits to capture the energy efficiency savings from new equipment, controls, and diagnostics.","In the residential market, replacement units make up approximately 80% of the total market. And as you can see from our bookings and sales growth in the fourth quarter, this market remains healthy. We expect to see continuing growth in both replacement and new construction in 2018. Outside of North America, commercial HVAC markets are not expected to be quite strong with EMEA and Asia expected to be flat to up slightly.","We expect Latin America markets to be up low single-digits. Transport markets in the Americas are expected to be roughly flat compared to 2017. Low teens declines for North America trailers are expected to be offset by growth in trucks, auxiliary power units, and aftermarket parts. Transport in Europe is expected to be up based on growth in truck and trailers sales and bottoming of the marine container market.","Asia-Pacific transport continues to show significant opportunity with the challenges of getting fresh food in and around densely populated cities. This business was up low teens last year, and we expect continued momentum in 2018. Global industrial markets generally continue to improve gradually as economy stabilizes and CapEx budgets expand. We remain cautiously optimistic about demand and expect global industrial markets to continue to show modest steady growth in 2018.","We had solid improvement in order growth in North America and Europe in our short cycle industrial businesses. The markets in Asia modestly improved during the fourth quarter, and we expect continued modest improvement in 2018. The large long cycle compressor market started to improve in 2017 due to stabilization in the energy and heavy industry markets. Large long cycle bookings were up a high teens per cent in 2017 and ahead of our initial expectations, which is encouraging.","These orders tend to have a cycle time of roughly 12 to 18 months. Golf utility vehicles and consumer vehicles combined are generally expected to be flat to slightly up across the globe. Our consumer vehicle continues to grow at a nice clip. And utility vehicles are also expected to have good growth in 2018. We expect the golf market to remain roughly flat. Letting this all out, we are forecasting mid-single digit growth in commercial HVAC in total, mid-single digit growth in residential HVAC, and low-single digit growth from our diversified portfolio in transport. We expect our compression technologies business and our industrial products business including the power tools, material handling, and fluid management businesses to be up mid-single digits overall. Small electric vehicles are expected to be up mid-single digits.","Please go to slide 18. I will spend a few minutes walking you through the details for our 2018 guidance. Given the backdrop discussed on the previous slide, we expect total reported revenues to be up 5% to 5.5% in 2018 with both segments positively contributing. The difference between our reported and organic revenue contemplates about 1 percentage point of positive foreign exchange and about 1 percentage point from 2017 acquisitions.","For the enterprise, we expect to see solid leverage from higher volumes, improved price, and continued high levels of material productivity and other productivity more than offsetting material inflation. At the midpoint of our guidance, we would expect to see approximately 50 basis points of margin expansion for the enterprise.","Please go to slide 19. We expect continuing adjusted earnings per share for 2018 to be in the range of $5 to $5.20, excluding about $0.20 of restructuring. We have modeled approximately $500 million in share repurchases into our guidance, which translates into approximately 250 million diluted for 2018.","As I outlined earlier, we are committed to dynamic and balanced capital allocation that consistently deploys excess cash over time. Net the actual allocation of excess cash will depend on where we see the highest ROI opportunities over the coming quarters. Our target for free cash flow is equal to or greater than 100% of net income. The tax rate is estimated to be between 21% and 22% after including anticipated impacts of the December 2017 U.S. tax legislation. This is consistent with our prior long-term structural tax rate, so our puts and takes, the bottom line result is that we are not expecting a change for Ingersoll-Rand.","For modeling purposes, we also offer the following guidance. Corporate expenses are expected to be approximately $250 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $300 million, up from approximately $220 million in 2017, primarily driven by factory consolidation and localization initiatives.","Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Mike to cover key investor topics of interest, and to close with a summary of key points.","Mike Lamach","Thanks, Sue. I'm going to spend the balance of our prepared remarks discussing the topics of interest we\u2019ve received from many of you ahead of the call, and then do a quick wrap up summary before we open the floor for questions. Thanks to all of you who provided feedback to help us improve our focus on the issues that matter most to you in the section.","Please go to slide 21. The first topic I\u2019ll cover is our China strategy. It's one of the topics that have garnered a lot of interest from investors. So we want to spend some time providing more detail in strategy and expected impact going forward. First, it's important to note that our strategy in China for Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities is a proven strategy we've been successfully implementing in Tier 1 markets and the applied space as we first entered the market. Our strategy is to enter underserved geographic and vertical markets by using a direct sales force selling the product the way we do in most mature markets at the total cost of ownership basis versus the way you would sell an undifferentiated commodity. This takes a talented network of sales people, and other infrastructure investments to deploy, which we've been doing for the past 18 months.","Once the customer has experience with our systems and sees the value in the total cost of ownership equation, we aim to become the basis for design, whereby we are advantaged with system reliability, energy conservation, and greenhouse gas emission reductions. We fundamentally transform the market landscape to compete on total value terms and are rewarded for our quality, technology and innovation, and service support. Margins improve as they would in any market where a product or service is differentiated and has a unique value proposition customers are willing to pay for.","With applied equipment comes the opportunity to rapidly grow our service business, which further enhances long-term margins. This strategy has been very successful for us, particularly in 2017 as we accelerated investments. The negative price versus material cost impact is primarily the mix impact of entrance into these new markets, compounded by material inflation which has been persistent in the region. It's resulted in an impact of more than half of our total negative price versus the material cost spread in 2017. So it's important to understand the strategy, the temporary impact from the shift in our mix in China, and the long-term end game.","We expect a few things to improve in 2018. First, pricing should improve in these markets as we move through the year. Second, we expect a less inflationary environment in 2018 as we begin to lap 2017 inflation. Third, we've largely completed the necessary infrastructure investments to complete execution of our strategy in 2018. We believe investment should become less of a headwind versus 2018. And lastly, we are focused on growing our services mix in these markets which should enhance future margins. In summary, for the reason stated, we expect China to be EPS accretive in 2018, and believe our investments here will help build shareholder value for years to come.","Please go to slide 22. Looking at 2018, we expect to deliver improved operating leverage through the P&L based on a number of factors. First, we expect to drive profitable volume growth based on the continued health of our core markets, as Sue detailed earlier. We also expect to see higher pricing in 2018 versus 2017, and have already put through price increases to cover expected inflation in many parts of our business which should improve our price versus material cost equation. In 2017, we had a negative price versus material inflation spread of approximately 60 basis points. We expect to narrow this GAAP considerably, which in and of itself would be a tailwind of margins in 2018. Additionally, we continue to drive material and other productivity through the P&L, which is always an important driver of margin improvement in our business operating system.","Looking at the positive price we've seen, combined with the positive material cost productivity we've driven, which is a component of our productivity bridge. We had a positive spread versus material inflation of 70 basis points in 2017, and would expect similar performance in 2018. Additionally, we will see a reduction in headwinds from our China strategy, as I detailed earlier. And lastly, as discussed at our analyst day, we see good opportunity to deliver significantly higher levels of profitability in our large engineered-to-order compressor technology, and increasing demand for our higher-margin tools, fluid management, and material handling products, along with continued mix shift from golf to consumer, small electric vehicles.","Please go to slide 23. This has been a key topic of interest in the past, so we wanted to include it in our prepared remarks as we close out the year. The bottom line is that our Thermo King business is resilient, and our 2017 performance bears this out. During 2017, we achieved a low-single-digit increase in total Thermo King revenues in the face of the North American trailer market decline, and we maintained relatively flat margins for the business at the same time. Our diversification strategy yielded results, with growth in worldwide truck, auxiliary power units, aftermarket, and with particular regional strength in Asia. Looking at 2018, we're expecting similar performance across the business.","Please go to slide 24. As previously discussed, we have spent or committed approximately $460 million over the past 12 months on strategic acquisitions or JV partnerships. In January, we announced our JV with Mitsubishi Electric, which is pending regulatory approval. Once completed, the new joint venture will include marketing, sales and distribution support, a variable speed mini-split, multi-split, in variable refrigerant flow, heating and air-conditioning systems in the U.S. and select Latin American countries.","We also announced our acquisition of ICS Cool Energy. ICS Cool Energy is one of the largest temporary HVAC rental businesses in Western Europe. ICS Cool Energy also sells, installs, and services high-performance temperature-controlled systems for all types of industrial processes. With a strong fit with our HVAC business, expands our sales and service channel in key Western European markets, and strengthens our growth plans.","Turning to slide 25, I'll close our prepared remarks where I began. I've never been more excited about the future prospects in Ingersoll-Rand in my tenure as CEO than I am right now. The company is extremely well-positioned to deliver strong shareholder returns over the next several years. Our strategy is firmly tied to attractive end markets that are healthy and growing profitably, supported by global megatrends such as energy efficiency and sustainability. We've been investing heavily for years to build franchise brands and to advance our leadership market positions to enable consistent profitable growth. We've experienced management and a high-performing team culture that breathes operational excellence into everything we do.","And lastly, we are committed to dynamic and balanced deployment of capital, and we have a strong track record of deploying excess cash to shareholders over the years. 2017 was a good example. We had balanced execution of capital deployment across a number of high-priority, high ROI areas, including investment in the business, a strong and growing dividend, value-accretive M&A, and significant share repurchases as the stock continues to trade below its intrinsic value. Going forward, these priorities remain the same, and our commitment to the deployment or excess capital is unchanged.","And with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Steve Winoker from UBS. Steve, your line is open.","Steve Winoker","Thanks, and good morning all.","Mike Lamach","Good morning, Steve.","Sue Carter","Good morning.","Steve Winoker","Hey, just first on guidance. Just want to understand again the relationship between the bookings that are trending, 8% organic and the 3% to 3.5% organic guidance on growth. Obviously there's a lag time on order to delivery in the industrial side, but maybe help us understand that. And also on the free cash flow conversion, I guess the CapEx increase. As there are inventory bill or are there other things that are kind of forcing that step-down versus prior year?","Mike Lamach","Steve, I'll do the first one, which the bookings came late in the fourth quarter, and so the exact timing of some of the larger compressor and applied shipments would still be a question mark. So whether that's a fourth quarter '18 or first quarter of '19 delivery it's TBD, and we'll update that throughout the year. But the bookings were definitely much stronger, and that was a surprise really from where we thought we would be at the end of the year. Backlogs were up about 12% going into the year. So we'll update shipments as we go further into the year. And Sue, on CapEx?","Sue Carter","Yes, so, on CapEx, Steve, as we look at it, so we guided $300 million for 2018. When we started out the 2017 guidance we gave you about $250 million, we came in at about $220. So in other words, $30 million was really CapEx that we didn\u2019t spend in 2017 that we're going to move over into 2018. So you have just a slight amount of increase. The other thing that I would say is when you think about the $300 million. The $300 million is primarily going to be new product introductions. It's going to -- the capital associated with that, it's going to be on factories for increasing productivity and increasing cost reduction ideas in our factories. So those primary objectives, when you think about them, are very clear with our growing operating margin and operating leverage. So we think that that $300 million is a good use of capital for 2018.","Steve Winoker","Okay. And Mike, just at a higher level, if we go back to the time that you took over and all the changes that you've made, particularly in the product development and introduction front, you've clearly run ahead on share of a number of HVAC competitors over this timeframe. But now we're seeing some of these other guys actually stepping up their own product introductions, very aggressively stepping up their own channel investments apparently more aggressively. Do you see the competitive environment getting more intense at all? Any forward thoughts on how that might impact the broader environment pricing, et cetera?","Mike Lamach","Steve, thanks. It's hard to look back now over nine years. It seems like it's a long time to look back. But one thing that we've been consistent about is just the level of investment that we've been pounding through every year on good ROIC projects. As Sue mentioned, stepping up on capital in those areas, the innovation pipeline looks solid. We had a lot of introductions, and 17 more planned for '18. So I think we do have a positive gap in the technologies and systems that we're putting out in the marketplace. And we've always known that we've got large competitors out there that are capable as well. So we intend to just continue to keep the drumbeat moving and keep innovation out in front.","So we know where the competition is at relative to current launches, and we know what our pipeline looks like. And I would imagine that we're going to be able to maintain technology positive gap for some time.","Steve Winoker","Okay, great. Thanks. Good luck.","Operator","And your next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Jeff, your line is open.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you. Good day everyone. I had just a couple of things if I could. Also, Mike, just on the sales outlook. You addressed Industrial, it also seems like it has the same question about Climate given the way you're exiting here. Is there anything particular in the tone of orders or the forward look that gives you some pause in the top line in Climate for 2018?","Mike Lamach","Jeff, when you say some pause, just tell me what you're referring to there?","Jeff Sprague","Well, I'm just looking at order rates that we seem to support maybe more than 3% organic growth in the business for 2018.","Mike Lamach","Yes, I mean the thing we don\u2019t know, Jeff, is really the timing of fourth quarter and first quarter, whether it's '18 or '19. And these large bookings come in very late in the year, and we're really trying to assess at this point in time exactly when customers are going to need them. So it's difficult to predict. I mean clearly carrying 12% increased backlog year-over-year is a great thing relative to the revenue guidance that we've given. These are longer lead, large projects that we just need to work through a little more time to understand the exact timing.","Jeff Sprague","And could you elaborate a little bit, Mike, just on your confidence on better China price in 2018. Does that reflect just the outright price increase initiatives or is it something that's happening in the mix of the business, a little color there to understand how that plays off?","Mike Lamach","Yes, so Jeff, we've been increasing price throughout Climate globally including Climate throughout 2017, in the back-half of the year in particular. And so I'm confident that pricing increases, because we've in some ways priced those projects coming through to shipment in 2018. I think competitive dynamics there would point to rise in prices in China as well. So I think that markets there are recovering in commodities has been something that's been felt by all competition. So you're seeing pricing coming through in the marketplace. And I think we've got a pretty good handle on what's happening, at least early in the year from a commodity perspective.","So I feel like that gap is certainly going to close across the company and China. Beginning in the first quarter, frankly the gap closes, and then throughout the year. It's not really a hockey stick at all. I mean it's not a first-half second-half equation. I think that the leverage frankly is fairly linear through the year for us.","Jeff Sprague","And just a quick one for Sue, if I could, repatriating 10% or 20% of your cash, so are you suggesting that although you're on a Irish territorial system before some of your cash was stranded, and you're now pulling that back or was there some other nuance in that comment?","Sue Carter","No, there was no nuance in the comment, Jeff. What that really is, is some of our international entities that roll up under the U.S. structure, so the entities report into the U.S., and where as previously we had access to our cash through intercompany loans and through other mechanisms. We've going to use the tax reform and the repatriation tax that we're going to pay over the next eight years to bring back a small portion of that cash to the U.S.. And so you can obviously calculate this is roughly about $300 million. And the only reason really to signal that is we did not have a lot of cash that we did not have access to or that was a big part of the repatriation. So I was just trying to give you context on what the amount would be. And the reason it's an approximation is we have to go through all of the detailed works now that we've figured out the amount of tax with what the in-country rules are, how you would go about doing that timing of doing that, et cetera. So it was nothing more than a nuance to give you an idea of how much cash would come back to the U.S..","Jeff Sprague","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Steve, your line is open.","Steve Tusa","Hi guys, good morning.","Mike Lamach","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Tusa","Can you just give us a little bit of color on what kind of price you're assuming in the guide here year-over-year, just roughly for the company?","Mike Lamach","Yes, Steve I'd really tell you that -- I'd start by saying that nothing changes around how we target and think about the operating system of the company trying to get a 20-30 basis point positive spread off material inflation. So, all the internal plans and all the incentive plans, if you will, are set to be able to achieve that. We've essentially thought about the year as being relatively flat in terms of price and material inflation. And we've set in place or in motion productivity ideas on a contingency basis that you could even handle, say, a negative 30 and still be able to achieve the midpoint of guidance. So we're really set for kind of a minus 30 plus 30 with spread roughly at zero is how I would think about that.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And again, you're not assuming flat price, you're assuming some price to offset the commodity, just to be clear on that, right?","Mike Lamach","Those absolutely priced, and on that of that there's absolutely material productivity on top of that, so absolutely priced.","Steve Tusa","Is most of that material productivity, is some of that coming from copper to aluminum or has that kind of already run its course? I know you guys were kind of ahead of the game on that front, in resi at least, or is it just blocking and tackling around product design?","Mike Lamach","No, so a number of things, but it's supplier consolidation to the preferred supplier program helps. That would be a driver. Material usage, so the quantity and gauge of material used. Material change, as you mentioned, would be another one. And then there'd actually be product design as well. So, all of that will contribute to a material productivity number.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And then just one last one, you mentioned that in the press release it sounded as if the China headwinds would be with you here in the first-half, although remedied pretty well for the full-year. You just mentioned that basically you're going to be linear on price cost over the course of the year. Should we think about the year as being any different from a seasonality perspective? And I think in the past you've said 45%-ish of earnings in the first-half, I think 10% to 12% in the first quarter. How should we kind of think about, at a high level, the seasonality of the year with these dynamics?","Mike Lamach","Sequentially, on your first question, really around pricing material cost inflation, we improve Q4 to Q1. It improves dramatically. You could think about maybe 50 basis points would be something that we would be thinking about in terms of that. So there's an immediate improvement I think Q1 to Q4 from that point of view. As it relates to the seasonality, I think you're right. If you go back over our four or five-year average it runs, say, 10.5% to 12.5%. I would tell you that at least initially I would be guiding you toward the lower end of that as it relates to just making sure that we've got this all contained around price to inflation, and it flows through the way that it should. So we feel good about what we're doing, but clearly we fully understand the burden of proof is on the first quarter, and so we're prepared for that.","Steve Tusa","Yes, well in the past you guys have smartly set a low bar and beat it, so kudos to you guys for keeping things reasonable here and not seeming to stretch. So thanks for the answers.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Andrew, your line is open.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Good morning, guys.","Mike Lamach","Hi, Andy.","Sue Carter","Good morning.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Mike, in the past you've talked about having good visibility into North American commercial HVAC markets. And it looks like bookings accelerated again in the quarter. Was that just easier comparison, did you see any pickup from hurricane-related work, and can you talk about any differences you're seeing in applied versus unitary markets?","Mike Lamach","Remember, quarter 4 last year for us was -- and in '16 was really strong. So I think that this strong quarter 4 that we booked is coming back-to-back really off combined healthy stack of bookings, so that, there's no easy comp there at all for us. There's larger projects that we have not planned in '18 that would dramatically change '18, and that would create a comp, obviously an issue for '19. But there are really no comp issues other than tough comps, '17 to '18 from that point of view. The visibility really hasn\u2019t changed much. Institutional projects take longer. They're something that we work on with customers to help design and specify, and then move through the process of tendering, and awarding, and executing. So we tend to have more visibility on that, and that continues.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay, that's helpful. And then you mentioned the Industrial team is doing a good job on margin. But if I look at the income at the margin it was mid-30s in 4Q. It looks like you're only guiding to sort of mid-20s in '18. You talked about the large engineered-to-order compressors starting to ramp, which you know have been a bit of a drag on margins, so. And we know you've taken a lot of costs out of business. So again, is it just kind of conservatism, you've got to wait to see how this ramps up. But you could have pretty strong incremental margin growth in '18 if all things sort of step up the way they could?","Mike Lamach","Well, we feel good about the variable cost leverage. And it really depends on how much of the shipments come through in the year and how much fixed cost leverage do we get on that volume. So it really is something that'll play out through the year for us. But clearly great 2017, and more confidence kind of going into '18, '19, and really confidence around the 2020 outlook that we gave some time ago, that this business is really ahead of schedule on that front, and performing well.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","And your next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Joe, your line is open.","Joe Ritchie","Great. Good morning guys.","Mike Lamach","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Ritchie","Mike, maybe going back to that commentary you made on price cost with plus or minus 30 basis points this year. If you think about the major inputs, typically you guys hedge copper ahead of the year. So I'd be curious to get any details on that. And then, last year, clearly Chinese steel was a huge negative impact, being, I'd call it, 40% last year. Seems like where we are today, it seems like that's a lot more manageable. And so I guess my question is, first, maybe some more details around your assumptions. And then secondly, what are the biggest swing factors in your mind to maybe even getting positive price cost this year?","Sue Carter","Joe, let me start out on the material inflation side and what we're seeing in 2018. So one, there's obviously the Tier 1 commodities that are inflationary, Tier 2, and then there's also other components. So what I want to point out is that refrigerants are going to be inflationary in 2018, and let's call that about 10% of our overall inflation. We've also got some led that goes into the Club Car product that will be inflationary. After that, as I break it down, what we expect to see is inflation in Tier 1 commodities is going to be about half of the inflation that we see spread between copper, steel, and aluminum. And so when I think about copper, we do lock copper as we go forward. So we're going to enter any given quarter with about 70% of that locked. And we're entering 2018 just under 70% locked on copper for the year. But we do expect that to be an inflationary component.","You're also correct, Joe, that when you think about the globe in terms of commodities and what happened in '17, and what we also expect to see in 2018, is that Asia is performing differently than prior expectations. So before 2017, i.e., they did take some steel capacity offline. They've done other things that have kept some of their material inflation actually pretty high compared to what you'd normally see. And then in the U.S., not having options for steel purchases offshore, and using what's happening is another large part of that. So we do expect to see inflation in copper, aluminum, as well as some steel perhaps in the later part of the year. But I also point out the refrigerant and some of the other components.","Mike Lamach","Joe, I'd think about it as, and I've said before, that the nature of 2018 inflation seems more manageable to us than 2017. Some of that's got to do with the fact that copper is easier for us to take a look at and lock appropriately. And steel you get a little bit longer view, and it's sort of at a level right now where unless there's any trade policy shocks again to the system we feel that it's a more appropriate environment. So just in general, the nature or the profile of where the inflation is, is a bit easier for us to maintain, including refrigerants.","Joe Ritchie","Got it, that's helpful. And then maybe just kind of switching gears, going back to Industrial for a second. I mean you're starting the year in such a better spot than you were last year just with your longer-cycle backlog, and clearly short-cycle trends remain good. When you look at the performance that you got this year from a margin perspective, it seems like you're being very conservative with your margin assumptions for 2018. And so to the extent you could comment on that, and then specifically around what are you getting from a pricing perspective as well on these orders, because it seems like your competitors are also putting through decent pricing increases.","Mike Lamach","Yes, industrial pricing has been really good. It's been great, and so our productivity there has been less of a factor too. So you're dealing with good price, and material inflation is a bit more predictable than it's been on the climate side. That's all really positive. Restructuring that we're doing in '18, roughly let's call it, say, $60 million in restructuring there. Two-thirds of that really is completed early now in January. And it's about two-thirds of the total. And it's really geared in the industrial area. So really thinking about how that'll flow through during the course of the year, and what the paybacks might look like when complete, there's an opportunity there.","I'd like to say there's an opportunity more than there's a risk there. But there's an opportunity there perhaps for us to maybe to do better. So I'm really optimistic about what's happened with bookings there, what's happened with the margins being ahead of schedule, and the fact that we've got an early start toward the productivity requirements that we need to have in '18 and '19 there.","Joe Ritchie","Got it. If I can sneak one more in, Sue, ending share count for the year?","Sue Carter","For 2018?","Joe Ritchie","2017?","Sue Carter","2017, the average diluted shares was about 253.","Joe Ritchie","Okay, average. So what was ending for 12-31?","Mike Lamach","Joe, we'll come back and grab another call. We'll find the number and\u2026","Sue Carter","Yes, I don\u2019t know off the top of my head.","Mike Lamach","- another question.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo. Rich, your line is open.","Rich Kwas","Hi, good morning everyone. Mike, on institutional projects you've talked about a couple or three projects that you thought could come online in '18. Is that embedded in the revenue forecast or are those pushed out a bit?","Mike Lamach","No, they're not. They're not in the \u201818 forecast. That would be the upside of the forecast, but they are too big to throw in the number in forecast. I mean if they had done, they are going to be delivered really some in \u201818 but \u201819 and \u201820. They are going to be multi-year projects.","Rich Kwas","Okay, all right. And then on M&A, with regards to the stuff done in \u201817, is there profit number or EPS number we can think about contributing the guide?","Sue Carter","Yes, Rich, here\u2019s how we look at the M&A. So we talk about it, it would be about one point of revenue. We also are factoring in about mid teens EBITDA on those, which would equate to about $0.06 in 2018 and increasing in 2019 to $0.15 to $0.16 EPS increase.","Mike Lamach","An EBITDA sort of in the higher teens closer to 20, really the difference in \u201818 is just a step up, but really good businesses.","Rich Kwas","Right, okay. And then, last one on if you have some high cost that -- relatively high cost that\u2019s maturing in \u201818. I assume that\u2019s not factored into the guide, but are your kind of thoughts around refi-ing that, like you would be able to refi that at a pretty attractive rate at this point?","Sue Carter","That\u2019s exactly right. So, our intention is to refinance the 2018 notes that come due in August 2018. You are also correct, it\u2019s at 6.75%. And obviously rates are much lower than that at this point. So, we do intend to refinance. We are watching the market and also being very conscious on any early break premiums and making sure that we have got the right mix there, but we do intend to refinance those.","Rich Kwas","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Raso from Evercore ISI. David, your line is open.","David Raso","Good morning. On the price cost, it hasn\u2019t been positive year-over-year since 3Q \u201816. But, we are seeing for \u201818 given the first quarter, I suspect there is a quarter coming up within the base case that you see it turning positive again. Can you give us some sense of the cadence? How we think about? Is that kind of a post-China sell through? And then, it\u2019s more of a third quarter back half or to that even be on the table for as soon as 2Q -- at least as your base case guidance.","Mike Lamach","Yes, I mentioned, Dave, that quarter four, quarter one, sequentially it\u2019s 550 basis points better in for the full year that gets flat. Quarter one would still be a negative relationship. So, it does imply sort of second, third, fourth quarter improving. You will see that improve throughout the balance of the year as shipments were made in Q2, Q3, Q4, and pricing already established and material cost that hopefully we have got a handle on the inflationary number. So, they sequentially get better throughout the year.","David Raso","And just so we understand get comfort with the 50 bps improvement from 4Q to 1Q, so basically 4Q is down 80 bps. You are thinking of first quarter call it 30, how much of that improvement is what\u2019s happening in China, or how much is it your price actions you took to start this year and sort of what you are seeing year-to-date on price cost and the backlog?","Mike Lamach","Well, it\u2019s all of the above, but it\u2019s a 50% of the whole price cost relationship with China. And if you throw the Middle East in there, you can say it\u2019s closer to 70% as China and the Middle East. And I would tell you that the China element really proportionally improved throughout the year as with the rest of the world. Pricing environment in China, we assume is getting better at that\u2019s been our experience so far. And as we have highlighted here earlier, we felt the material inflation part of that now is somewhat under control with capacity really being now rationalized in the marketplace and we feel better about that.","David Raso","And not to push a little bit, but again of that improvement how much is that something you have sort of see in the backlog today domestically? And why it\u2019s still deteriorating, right? We have gone from 50 bps, 50 bps, 70 bps, now 80 bps. Even second derivative improvement will start to add some credence to, \"Hey, we are maybe getting to the worst of price cost.\" So I think your first quarter comment is significant, that\u2019s bps positive if it can develop. I am just trying to understand exactly the line of side on that. I mean how much is it\u2026","Mike Lamach","Of course, sure.","David Raso","- so with the orders coming in today have a better price cost.","Mike Lamach","Yes, in a commercial space, quarter one, we are shipping what we\u2019ve already booked. So, we feel like the price scenario is pretty well established at this point. There is book in turn. But where there\u2019s book in turn, it\u2019s typically dealt with by list prices. So talking about unitary product, it\u2019s going to have more list price than applied which is going to be very project specific. Well, the applied project specific was then quoted third quarter, fourth quarter, and shipping in the first and second quarter. The unitary had price increases going through as did our competitors.","David Raso","Yes, it just seems that the unitary market is seeing a little bit of price realization to start the year.","Mike Lamach","Yes.","David Raso","And the applied as you said is already been booked. So I am just trying to make sure what framework here looks like. There clearly should be a second derivative improvement. No doubt price cost 1Q versus we just saw, but the line of sight, given you have to apply the unitary fields like what it's doing in the channel, China has had wildcard. We really should see hopefully this is a full 50 bps, right. I mean this doesn\u2019t feel like that\u2019s fake guesstimate. But it seems like something you have a good line of sight for the first quarter. That\u2019s fair assumption?","Mike Lamach","Yes, David, something that really have to change in the first quarter here in the last couple of months for that to really change my guidance here.","David Raso","Okay.","Mike Lamach","And I don\u2019t know what that would be at this point.","David Raso","Just real quick, on Thermo King domestic, I see you have North America trailer down for \u201818. Lately, you have seen -- I know they are lumpy -- but lately you have some better orders at the domestic market. Is Thermo King\u2019s trailer backlog right now not seeing any of that? Is there a bit of a tick up, but it\u2019s just too large a hole to kind of dig out of to be flat to up for the year. Just trying to understand that guide versus what we have seen of late?","Mike Lamach","Yes, as we become less dependent around growth and margin for North American trailer, we are really just utilizing the ACT data here. So, we are not going to try to guess anymore than ACT on that. And it always comes down to which customer is ordering from who. And so, it\u2019s too hard to predict at this point, but ACT is calling the market down and we are just reflecting what they are saying.","Operator","And your next question comes from Joel Tiss from BMO. Joel, your line is open.","Joel Tiss","Snuck on there, I wanted to ask sort of a little more structurally about the enterprise initiatives in I guess my thought is maybe that\u2019s running out of steam a little bit. But, I wanted to ask it more about the flexibility. Is there a way to increase the flexibility when you see changes in the market? And I am just kind of thinking about in the future maybe we are going to see some headwinds just from the cycle.","Mike Lamach","Joel, there is a no quick that we are losing steam on the productivity idea that we\u2019ve got across the company. In fact, we are attacking parts that we hadn\u2019t attacked in the past. Warehousing, logistic, G&A cost where the profile of the company has changed over the years. Now we are catching up on some of those areas. So I don\u2019t -- in a short time we have got here. It will be difficult tell you about the all the areas we have got. But I have got confidence that we are not running out of any steam here at all in productivity.","Operator","And I would now like to turn the call back over to Zac Nagle for closing remarks.","Zac Nagle","We would like to thank everyone for joining us today. We\u2019ll be around in the coming days and weeks to take any questions that you may have, and I think Mike also wanted to make one closing comment as well.","Mike Lamach","Yes, just one last comment.

Thanks, Janet, and good morning and thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call. In the second quarter, we delivered earnings per share of $1.13. There was a small amount of restructuring in the quarter less than a penny. This quarter\u2019s reported and adjusted EPS are identical. That\u2019s at the top end of our adjusted earnings guidance range and a 22% increase versus the second quarter of 2013. Revenues were $3.5 billion, up 4.3% versus last year. Leverage were consistent with our guided revenue range of up 4% to 5% for the quarter.","Orders were up 5% in the second quarter with Climate up 6% and Industrial up 2%. Adjusted operating margin which excludes restructuring from the prior year was up 150 basis points. Climate margins increased 150 basis points and Industrial margins were up 30 basis points. Pricing exceeded direct material inflation as it has each quarter for more than three years.","Operating leverage was about 50% with 43% leverage at the segment. We repurchased 4 million shares in the second quarter. Overall a very good quarter with revenues about where we thought they would be, and excellent operating leverage on the revenue growth, particularly in HVAC businesses, both residential and commercial.","Now Sue will walk you through in more detail on the second quarter. I\u2019ll then take you through the third quarter and 2014 outlook.","Sue Carter","Thanks Mike. Starting at a high level, our bookings for the quarter were up 5%, revenues were up 4% and our operating margins without restructuring were up 150 basis points year-over-year. Reported earnings per share were $1.13 versus midpoint guidance of $1.10 we were little bit better on price and mix and a penny lower in restructuring.","Let\u2019s move to Slide 4. Orders for the second quarter of 2014 were up 5% on a reported basis and excluding currency. Climate orders were up 6%. Global commercial HVAC bookings were up low-single-digits. Transport orders were up mid-teens. Orders in the Industrial segment were up 2% on both, a reported basis and excluding currency.","Let\u2019s go to Slide 5. Here\u2019s a look at the revenue trends by segment and by regions. The top half of the chart shows revenue change for each segment. For the total company, second quarter revenues were up 4% versus last year on a reported basis and excluding currency. Climate revenues increased 4% with commercial HVAC revenues up low-single-digits and transport revenues up high-single-digits. Residential HVAC revenues were up high-single-digits. Industrial revenues were up 4% on a reported basis and excluding currencies. I\u2019ll give more color on each segment in the next few slides.","On the bottom of the chart, which shows revenue change on a geographic basis, revenues were up 3% in the Americas, 16% in EMEA and Asia was down 2%, all excluding foreign exchange. The lower revenue in Asia was mainly driven by geography outside of China. China was about flat excluding currency.","Now let\u2019s go to Slide 6. This chart walks through the change in operating margin from second quarter 2013 of 11.4% to second quarter of 2014 which was 13.1%, an increase of 170 basis points. This chart is on a reported basis. We\u2019ve clearly strained down the impact of restructuring cost for you which was 20 basis points of tailwind year-over-year.","Volume mix and foreign exchange collectively were 60 basis points positive versus prior year. Our pricing programs continue to outpace material inflations adding 50 basis points to margins. As Mike said, we\u2019ve been consistently positive on this measure for more than three years.","Productivity versus other inflation was a full margin point positive impact in the quarter. Productivity ramped up in the quarter as we got passed all the weather-related impacts of the first quarter and saw benefits from the restructuring done in late 2013 and earlier this year. Year-over-year investments and restructuring were higher by 40 basis points in total.","In the box, you can see that that was comprised of 60 basis points of headwind from investments, mainly in IT, channel expansion and new product investments, and there was a 20 basis point benefit from lower restructuring cost. So if you prefer to look at this on an adjusted basis, adjusted margins increased a net of 150 basis points versus 170 basis points on a reported basis. Leverage in the quarter was excellent and almost 50% excluding restructuring from last year and 43% in the segment. Climate\u2019s leverage at 48% was led by the HVAC businesses particularly in North America.","To Slide 7. The Climate segment includes Trane commercial and residential HVAC and Thermo King transport refrigeration. Total revenues for the second quarter were $2.7 billion. That\u2019s up 4% versus last year on a reported basis and excluding currency. Global commercial HVAC orders were up low-single-digits. Orders were up in the Americas and Europe and Asia.","Commercial HVAC revenues were up low-single-digits. Revenues were up high-single-digits in Europe, up low-single-digits in the Americas and down in Asia. Commercial HVAC new equipment revenues were down slightly, while HVAC parts, services and solutions revenues were up mid-single-digits versus prior year. Growth in worldwide unitary equipment revenues was more than offset by lower applied revenues.","Thermo King orders were up mid-teens versus 2014 second quarter led by increases in truck trailer and bus. Container orders were slightly lower in the quarter. Thermo King revenues were up high-single-digits with truck trailer revenue up low-single-digits and marine container revenues up significantly.","Residential HVAC revenues were up high-single-digits versus last year. Unit volumes were also up high-single-digits and mix was positive in the quarter. The adjusted operating margin for Climate was 14.2% in the quarter, 150 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2013, due to volume and productivity, partially offset by inflation.","Now let\u2019s go to Slide 8. Second quarter revenues for the Industrial segment were $794 million, up 4% from last year\u2019s second quarter. For the Industrial segment excluding Club Car, revenues were up mid-single-digits and orders were also up mid-single-digits versus last year. Excluding Club Car revenues in the Americas and Asia Pacific were up while revenues in Europe, Middle East and Africa were up over 20%, part of which was positive currency impact.","Revenues in the air compressor business were up mid-single-digits with strong gains in oil free products and parts and services. Club Car revenues in the quarter were down low-single-digits while orders were down mid-single-digits versus prior year as golf markets were down in the quarter. Industrial\u2019s operating margin of 16.4% was up 30 basis points on higher volume productivity and pricing, partially offset by inflation and investment spending.","Turn to Slide 9. Working capital as a percentage of revenue was 4% of revenue in the quarter. The increase versus prior year is from higher receivables in inventory, partially offset by higher payables balances. Days sales outstanding is up mainly due to mix of business. Delinquency is unchanged from prior year.","On inventory, we have been intentionally increasing stock inventory levels of key assemblies in order to ensure supply, particularly in the higher selling season. Year-to-date June free cash flow was $98 million. Working capital will come down in the second half to a level closer to 3% of revenues based mainly on timing of revenues. May and June are our highest two month sales volumes and given our DSO is about 60 days. That drove higher working capital balance at the end of the second quarter.","And let\u2019s go to Slide 10. We\u2019ve repurchased 4 million shares for approximately $200 million in the second quarter. Year-to-date June, we have spent $1 billion in share repurchases and repurchased about 17 million shares. Our forecast for the year remains to spend between $1.375 billion and $1.475 billion on repurchase with $400 million to $500 million of that coming from free cash flow.","And with that I\u2019ll turn it back to Mike.","Mike Lamach","Great. Thank you, Sue. And please go to Slide 11. Before we review the forecast, I want to take a few minutes to mention some very important new products in Trane commercial introduced in Europe at the end of June. This is a milestone for Trane since we\u2019re introducing five new chiller products at the same time. Products included centrifugal air-cooled and screw chiller designs and cover a broad range of sizes and market applications including education, healthcare, lodging, large commercial buildings and fastest cooling in Europe.","All these new systems are available with advance controls and designed for cost effectiveness and optimal energy efficiency for both full load and part load performance. The chiller in the upper right side of the slide, Series E CenTraVac is truly a breakthrough technology. These products are designed for cooling large commercial buildings and are up to 10% more energy efficient than the next best chiller available in this tonnage range. The true innovation is that the E Series is the first commercialized chiller used in ultra-low global warming potential HFO refrigerant. The new refrigerant allows the E Series chillers to continue to utilize Trane\u2019s highly reliable and efficient direct drive and low-pressure designs that have may Trane chillers the global leader in centrifugal chillers.","I believe we are gaining momentum and capabilities to introduce new products tying all of our businesses this will help to improve our growth rates as we see the slow recovery of our commercial construction in that market began.","Now let\u2019s move to the forecast, please go to Slide 12. In the aggregate markets we\u2019re about where we thought they would be, some a little better and some little weaker, but second quarter revenues were in line with our guidance. Dodge has put in place forecast for 2014. Did that change much in the latest update? In total, the 2014 Dodge forecast is still up about 8%.","Relate this to our North American business commercial and industrial buildings tend to use more unitary equipment, while the institutional markets use more applied equipment. The commercial and industrial forecast is unchanged at up 18% versus 2013, while the institutional forecast still is forecasted to be down 1% for the year.","Within commercial and industrial, the vertical of largest growth is still warehouses that are over 30%. They have little HVAC contact. Key verticals for Trane are office and bank, retail and manufacturing which are all up but at a more modest rate. Within institutional, government is expected to be down over 20% while education and healthcare are forecast with slightly down in 2014.","The only vertical in institutional forecast is to be up 2014 is amusement which is not a key vertical for Trane. We expect Europe, Middle East and Africa to be up mid-single-digits for the year. Asian HVAC markets are expected to be up low-single-digits overall with China up low-to-mid single digits. Remainder of the region will be fairly flat. We\u2019ve seen impact for example in Thailand from the political unrest there.","The full year outlook for residential HVAC markets is still for mid-to-high single digit growth in the unitary volumes, industry volumes. Transport markets had a good start for the year, particularly in Europe and in Marine. Bookings growth has been front-end loaded for both trailer and container. We expect booking rates to moderate in the second half.","We expect the full year North American trailer market to be flat to slightly up on a news basis but up high-single-digits on a dollar basis due to mix of car compliance products. Industrial markets were somewhat improved in the quarter. The latter half of course with some recovery in China.","Based on the first half results, our outlook for the second half, we are raising our full year revenue. We see revenues up about 4% from the prior guidance of about 3% to 4%. It\u2019s really not much change in the aggregate to our Climate revenue outlook.","The changes in Industrial where we are raising revenue expectation. Our updated forecast is for Industrial to be up 2% to 3% versus the prior forecast with flat to up 2%. The increased outlook within our core Industrial businesses, the golf markets are expected to be flat down for the year.","Please go to Slide 13. The third quarter guidance refer to the middle column on this chart, although we\u2019ve included quarter four on the chart to show you some math. Third quarter 2014 revenues are forecast to be up approximately 4%. We expect growth to be stronger in Climate than in Industrial but both should be in the low-to-mid single digit range.","Third quarter GAAP continuing earnings per share are forecast to be in the range of $1.00 to $1.04. Restructuring costs are expected to be about $0.01 in the quarter. So on an adjusted basis the EPS range is $1.01 to $1.05. The currency situation in Venezuela is evolving. We are continuing to evaluate the impact but of inclusive about $10 million or about $0.03 per share foreign exchange losses related to Venezuelan currency in the third quarter forecast.","We\u2019re assuming an average share count of 273 million shares at tax rate of 25%. There is an EPS bridge versus last year\u2019s third quarter in the appendix for your reference.","For the full year, as I said, we see revenue growth of about 4%. We are raising our full year 2014 earnings outlook to a range of $3.13 to $3.21 on a reported basis. Prior comparable range was $2.95 to $3.10 which includes $0.10 of restructure.","For the full year, we\u2019ll now expect to spend about nickel in restructuring. So a nickel of a change in guidance is from change of restructuring outlook. Recall, the $0.03 foreign exchange that we have in for Venezuela in Q3 guidance which flows through to the full year. The core earnings forecast was going up by about $0.13 at the midpoint.","There is no change the full year average share count guidance of 275 million shares at a tax rate of 25%.","So in closing, we\u2019re pleased to have delivered above our earnings commitment in second quarter with excellent performance in the segments. I continue to feel good about our positioning and are focused we had in the latter half of the year.","With that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi. Thank you. I guess I had a quick question on the margin guidance by segment for this year. You\u2019ve obviously updated the revenue assumptions. You talked about Climate 4% up, about 40 to 80 bps Industrial, flat to up 20 basis points. How do those look now to you?","Sue Carter","So Julian, when we look at those, we\u2019re leading the industrial segment at flat to up 20 basis points. And then on Climate as you pointed out, we were at 40 basis points to 80 basis points, and it now looks like about 80 basis points to 110 basis points. So we did take that up with the guidance increase.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thank you. And then just within the margin bridge, sort of in aggregate, the productivity number was very good in Q2. Do you see that as kind of a good, sort of ongoing rate balance of this year when you look out into sort of \u201815 and \u201816, just because I think you\u2019re only half way covered on the value streams of the cost base and so on?","Mike Lamach","Julian, the thing that is important there is the pipeline that we measure. And as I\u2019ve in the past, we\u2019ve tried to keep that pipeline between 110% and 150% of what\u2019s required understanding that there is timing issues and some things don\u2019t work that were planned. So to help the pipeline looks like it\u2019s still in fact both materials perspective as well as direct and indirect labor perspective. So I would say that we\u2019re not forecasting any real changes in productivity, however it\u2019s always subject to the pipeline timing of what project actually has.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America.","Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America","Yes. So very pleasantly surprised on Industrial growth revision. Can you give us a little bit more detail as to what\u2019s really happening by region and North America, Europe?","Mike Lamach","Well, the core Industrial markets which is non-golf are doing better than we anticipated. Europe clearly is better than we anticipated across the board. As Sue mentioned, we\u2019re up 20%. In EMEA in the quarter and the orders booked there was looks great. North America, a little bit stronger but again stronger parts and services as well. China, which showed a little bit more strength in the later two months in the prior quarter has a decent outlook for the balance of the year in terms of the pipeline, but there frankly Andrew, it\u2019s a large equipment orders and typically that become more of a timing issue as to whether its fourth quarter or first quarter of next year, but all in all we\u2019ve developed the core industrial businesses is bit of a fresh look.","Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America","And then just a follow-up. How sustainable is the EMEA strength, and what\u2019s driving the strength? Is it market share gain or any particular market because that looked very strong?","Mike Lamach","Yes, it\u2019s actually mostly in Western Europe as well too. So it\u2019s combination of other things, Andrew. I wouldn\u2019t just to pick one but clearly we\u2019ve done well with the efforts to invest feet on the street in the region. We\u2019ve got I think great product with a good price point in the region. I think that oil free, it\u2019s been a significant gainer for us there as well, and for that matter across the globe. So no, I don\u2019t think that 20% growth rates are something to plan on when you are going forward, but we are pleasantly surprised to see that we have a great quarter.","Sue Carter","And Andrew let me just add one thing on there. For 2014, we\u2019re expecting revenues in EMEA to be mid-to-high single digits for the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hi, good morning everyone.","Mike Lamach","Hi Joe.","Sue Carter","Good morning.","Joe Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs","So good quarter. It seems like pricing clearly has been strong for quite sometime, but may have surprised the upside this quarter. Europe was good but you didn\u2019t really take up your growth expectations significantly. It seems like a lot of the guidance range is driven by the margins, particularly on the Climate side. And so I guess just what gives you the confidence at this point in raising the guidance for the back half of the year?","Sue Carter","So Joe, as we think about the guidance and what we\u2019re seeing in the markets in our performance, we\u2019re obviously pleased with what we\u2019ve seen through six months and we\u2019ve seen actually gives us some confidence for the year. As you pointed out, we\u2019re still in a low to moderate growth environment. And so as we looked at the revenue, the outlook is only a little bit higher, and most of the earnings guidance is from higher operating performance. The enterprise leverage is in the mid 40s and the segment leverage in the mid 30s for the revised guidance.","And again as we looked across the businesses, the performance that we have, what we see on enterprising versus material inflation, productivity, etcetera we thought this was the right place to land.","Joe Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I guess one follow-up on the cadence for 3Q and 4Q, particularly as it relates to the incremental margins. It seems like there is a step-down implied in your guidance for the incremental margins for 3Q and then a step back up in 4Q. I just want to make sure I am thinking about that the right way, and if so, what\u2019s causing that 3Q versus 4Q?","Sue Carter","So I think as you look across the quarters, I think we\u2019re still seeing in the third quarter that prices is going to offset direct material inflation but at a lower rate, also same for the fourth quarter in terms of the overall businesses. And then one of the other things that you see in terms of that leverage is the amount of corporate expenses that are in the fourth quarter.","Mike Lamach","That corporate last year as we were really truing up half spend, there was stock-based comps, benefit changes that came out really in the fourth quarter higher than the normal run rate. So there is a pickup in the fourth quarter. We also had a flood in China in our Industrial businesses which hopefully won\u2019t repeat again this year, so that would be another reasons why the fourth quarter leverages looks so much higher than the normal.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc.","Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Hi good morning guys.","Mike Lamach","Good morning, Jeff.","Sue Carter","Good morning.","Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Just wanted to kind of focus on the applied market. And I think you said that the Dodge date is still being pretty choppy but I am just wondering what you\u2019re seeing in the quoting activity, any signs of inflection or accountability momentum into \u201815? And then what\u2019s in that \u2013 if you could just kind of update us on your VRF strategy relationship with Samsung and how do you think VRF competes or doesn\u2019t compete with the chiller-based systems?","Mike Lamach","Lot there Jeff as always. So when you look at the applied markets in general, the market in quarter one, this is the North American market which is for the latest most available was down about 3%. Last year, it was down 4% total of the market. Second quarter was down a little bit lower. The market was down 4%, but the market expectation third-party prognosticators here think that it will come back to zero for the full year, which implies a pretty sizable third and fourth quarter pickup.","Conversely on unitary, the market last year was about 5%. First quarter was strong at 7%. Second quarter was actually 5% again the prognosticators will call that down to 4%. I think it\u2019s more likely that you\u2019re not going to see the \u2013 you\u2019re going to see a ramp up and improvement in applied markets in the back half of the year, probably not to the extent that is being prognosticated. And I think on the unitary side, those are very strong. If you even take the first two quarters for us, our bookings in unitary were up double-digits for the first two quarters.","And the momentum there certainly will slow, but not to the extent to bring it down to where the market is calling it. But I think that you will see more gradual turning it unitary and applied as we go forward.","Now specifically VRF, remember our strategy is multi-fold. We produce some VRF in our own factories. We have an arrangement with Samsung as well as two other VRF manufacturers that we utilize for components. So all-in our unitary business was doing well across the world which includes VRF, and of course our VRF growth rates are going much faster than industry VRF growth rates because the fact that we\u2019re working off smaller numbers there, but just has the ductless growth rates are increasing, so too is the ducted component globally for us.","So from a unitary perspective, we had really good growth across the world in unitary through the first two quarters both in ducted and ductless.","Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay, great. And then just, I don\u2019t know if I missed this. Can you give us an update on what you think corporate is and just maybe what the run rate is exiting \u201814, and is that kind of how to think about the go-forward run rate?","Sue Carter","So Jeff, what we\u2019ve talked about for corporate spending was a range of around $200 million for the year. When we\u2019re talking about today and what we\u2019re thinking about is a range of around $200 million to $220 million, depending on how some of the things that Mike referenced earlier like the stock-based comp. The benefit planned true-ups and investment spending comes in for the year, so that gives you sort of $50 million to $55 million quarter range for corporate expenses, but as we look at that and I talk about $200 million to perhaps $220 million, I want to be clear that the restructuring spend and the stranded cost that were taken off from the Allegion spin were taken out in late 2013 and early 2014, if the number was above the $200 million range, it would be \u2013 because we had decided to do more investments or we had items again in not stock-based comp or in benefit planned true-ups.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann from Jefferies & Co.","Steve Volkmann \u2013 Jefferies & Co","Hi, good morning. I am wondering if we\u2019re getting any better visibility into the next iteration of SEER requirements here in States, and how that might impact your business, whether we might see some pre-buy or perhaps an issue, just any update on that?","Mike Lamach","Well, I think that your point has probably gotten more murky as opposed to less to more clear. The standards really at this point in time as you\u2019re probably are aware are bit up in the air again. We\u2019ve got activity happening in the next couple of quarters, where DOE will lead some panels to go through the enforcement of changes to the standards in 2015, but those really won\u2019t become rule sometime in 2015, so it\u2019s very difficult to tell what the impact would be.","I would say probably what you won\u2019t see is a quarter or two ago, thought those rules would be in place, you might see some last manufacturing of 13 SEER systems, and I think that that probably will not be the case, so it will be that you\u2019ll see 13 SEER systems manufactured and sold throughout the country sometime into or through 2015. That\u2019s a bit more speculation on my part.","Steve Volkmann \u2013 Jefferies & Co","Okay, great. Thanks. And then can you just comment on where you think channel inventory is, and whether it might need to be adjusted going forward?","Mike Lamach","Are you talking about residential HVAC or what part of the business? Just assuming you\u2019re on mute at this point, I am going to assume that\u2019s residential HVAC. And they are at about normal levels at this point of time. We\u2019re running higher bookings in the first quarter, shipped a lot of those bookings in the second quarter towards fairly low at the beginning in the second quarter. So fairly normalized levels for us, which tends to be a little bit lower than some of what our industry competitors sold. And if you go back over a long period of time, largely we\u2019ve been trying to do better job on cycle times from the factories to the dealer to allow distribution to actually hold less inventory at different times during the year.","So the answer to your answer, in short form, fairly normalized.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andy Casey from Wells Fargo Securities.","Andy Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Good morning everybody.","Mike Lamach","Hi Andy.","Andy Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Just a couple of follow-ups, a lot has been asked. Within the Industrial order improvement, asking I think it was Andrew\u2019s question a little bit different, are you seeing any specific pockets of strength like type of customer as opposed to region?","Mike Lamach","Well, yes, we do see some. I mean even in China as you look through, as an example you wouldn\u2019t see strength in areas like some of the heavy metals businesses in China, but you would see some in some of the verticals that we would play more into. So of course food and beverage and nuclear would be a big market right now in China where we\u2019re doing well in those markets, but staying away from a lot of the sort of heavy industry over capacity size places that China has outlined would be an example.","And the UA [ph], it\u2019s a bit broader based than that. And then from the technology perspective certainly as we said, oil free parts and services are stronger. And frankly the parts and services piece of that is consistent with some of the investments that we made earlier in the year, where I am putting some additional feet on the street both in terms of selling capability but also in terms of technical service strengths and filling some pockets out there.","Andy Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, great. Thanks Mike. And then returning to your prior question again, I think last quarter you called out some improvement in the applied unit order growth within the Climate orders. Did you see that continue? I know what you said about the industry forecast, but I am just wondering within your orders, did you see that continue?","Mike Lamach","Yes, we have and we actually have what we believe is the much more reliable part to review that which is a pipeline view which goes all the way from early conversation with the customer or the identification of the project, all the way through to following it through a pipeline percentage estimate of flow and so and so forth. So you do see a large pipeline going through, but again I don\u2019t see that there is sort of an immediate inflection point in applied that some of the third-party market data points would suggest I think some more gradual improvements through 2015 with some more gradual moderating in the unitary business in 2015, but yes, we\u2019re seeing that as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research","Thank you. Good morning.","Mike Lamach","Hi Jeff.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research","Could you just give a little bit more granular first on kind of the price side, Mike. Is there any real distinction where you\u2019re seeing it, I would guess resi versus unitary and applied, but can you just put some perspective around what\u2019s going on in pricing in general?","Sue Carter","So let me give a broad overview on pricing and what we\u2019re seeing. So from the perspective of being overall, we still expect the pricing environment to be fairly modest in 2014, so about 50 basis points of price. We still expect to be able to more than offset material inflation, but we think towards back half of the year, as I said earlier that the positive gap will look more like what we saw at the end of 2013, which is more in the 20 basis point to 30 basis point range as opposed to the 50 basis point range that we\u2019re seeing. And I think that across the segment we are seeing favorability, and but to your point resi was a little \u2013 was part of the stronger piece of price.","Mike Lamach","Jeff actually we had across the board, so if you put Climate, both resi and commercial and then split up, commercial by region, by product. We actually have positive price in all areas that as we did industrial as well. So there weren\u2019t any big gaps and that Sue just alluded to clearly one of the biggest surprises was the residential was actually price leaders for us in the quarter.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research","Great. And then, Mike, could you just address kind of the comment or perhaps Sue on inventory running higher to meet demand. It sounds a little counter to what we\u2019ve been hearing on better flow to the factory and better reaction times and the like. Are you hitting some diminishing returns there or is there something in particular in the outlook that you\u2019re trying to prepare for?","Mike Lamach","Well, it\u2019s a very inexpensive insurance policy right now with working capital rates where they are in a company, and areas where we got long lead items. Great example might be a diesel engines for TK would be a perfect example. That was a really strong bookings backlog. And although we expect it to moderate, but still I don\u2019t want out of engines which can take 12 weeks to come across the water to get here. That would be a good example. And it\u2019s selective throughout the business.","So if you go to our tools business, there is 25 tools that we just absolutely will not stock out of, and there has been great activity in that business particularly around some of the new product launches with our electric power tools that actually have electronic interface into customer production system, that\u2019s been a big winner for us and that\u2019s something we\u2019re going stock out of. So again it\u2019s really building advance.","And also campaigns that we\u2019re running certain areas of product growth team are spearheading, so we talked about the six product growth teams but in areas where they\u2019ve got a deliberate plan, its spearhead, something into a particular vertical market or particular region, we\u2019re making sure that to tie our order plans consistent with what we\u2019re trying to do. In other words, we\u2019re trusting that those product growth teams are going to be able to action out what it is trying to do. The worst thing we want to do is have them do that not be able to support the product.","So it\u2019s selective, not across the board. It got nothing to do with the value stream. It has got to do with where they are pockets of growth and where there is the unique opportunities, it is being able to take advantage of that. And certainly and really lead, 12 to 16 weeks items that commence from suppliers that we want to make sure that we\u2019re not running out of those.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Raso from the ISI Group.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","Hi good morning. Ex the corporate expense year-over-year, the incremental margins this year are \u2013 you are targeting around 30%, 31%. Can you give us some puts and takes to how to think about the incremental margin moving forward? Just trying to look out to \u201815. Just think about further productivity improvements. I was happy to see the compressor business which is usually better incremental starting to show some life. Then also maybe Thermo King in North America, just trying to run up against some tough comps. So just maybe just big picture get your thoughts on how we should think about the segment incremental margins moving forward?","Mike Lamach","Yes, David, for five years we\u2019ve been running somewhere in this 40% to 50% incremental margin range. I haven\u2019t calculated likely but I don\u2019t think we wrote it much last year. And at some point in time, logic prevails that you\u2019re going to be normalizing back towards something that looks like gross margin of company. Of course we\u2019re trying to drive gross margin of the company up and of course we had higher rentals, but any time we do above 30%, we\u2019re truly digging in beyond variable costs, we\u2019re digging into the fixed cost base of the company.","So we guided initially the 25% along with some breakage in the business, and pipelines that may not materialize. In the first two quarters, the pipeline did materialize and we were able to take advantage of the opportunities and manage away the risks, but that\u2019s not always the case, that\u2019s why I caution you and listeners on the call that good number tends to be the gross margin of the company. And really the safer number is the gross margin of the company less the breakage that normally is involved in these sorts of things.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","Just trying to think a little bit that you have the lower share count exiting the year than your average share count. When it comes to things like the tax rate for next years, still think of it 25 as a good base case?","Mike Lamach","Yes, actually I\u2019ll pass to Sue because I was talking specifically about segment operating leverage.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","Sure. No absolutely I was as well. I was just trying to think of the other puts and takes.","Mike Lamach","Okay.","Sue Carter","All right. So David as I think about share count and I think about tax rate is we\u2019re looking at the \u2013 I\u2019ll give you an example. We\u2019re for the second quarter, we got about $0.10 benefit coming out of the share count and a headwind out of the tax rate of about $0.15. And for the full-year, you\u2019re going to have the same story. You\u2019re going to have more of a headwind coming off of tax than the benefit from shares. So as I look to what happens next, I mean obviously we need to go through and do our operating plan. We need to look at the areas where our income is going to come from in \u201815 and beyond, but I think from an overall basis, there isn\u2019t a reason to think that it would be a lot different than sort of the mid 20s type of range which is sort of where we\u2019ve been at for a while.","So again in \u201814 you\u2019re going to have less benefit from shares than the headwind on taxes at around 25% for the year.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","And in that same spirit, thinking about the repo for the next year, just again I know it\u2019s only July but framework. This year roughly a $1.4 billion. Just trying to think of a normal framework for \u201815 just given your cash flow and balance sheet? Is $800 million, $900 million kind of number the right way to think about, just framework for continuing repo going forward?","Sue Carter","I think as we think about it, I would say let\u2019s hold on to somewhat about 2015 until we get later in the year, see more of the activity and continue to evaluate where we are.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker from Sanford Bernstein.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein","Hi, thanks. Mike, nice quarter. Good morning. Could you comment on M&A Mike and consolidation? We\u2019ve talked about it lot in the past. What\u2019s your current thinking on that and where we are at this point in time?","Mike Lamach","Yes, well we always have the mirror we hold up which is share buyback. You can do something that\u2019s more accretive on EPS, margin, ROIC. We probably do it, if it fits right into the core business, meaning that it\u2019s new technology, inter-related business that we can use our consistent distribution to do or vice-versa, we might have a gap in distribution and the distribution actually do more of what we do today.","So quite frankly if we found those things, we would them Steve, and I think that\u2019s the key is there being selective as we have been and not paying [indiscernible].","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein","Okay. And then just to follow-up your answer to the other question on incremental and fixed cost reduction, it looks like your restructuring opportunity evidence ebbs and flows here, but given how much of the cost base you still have to address on the lean side as well. Can you describe the sort of longer term restructuring these run way that\u2019s left inside the existing portfolio?","Mike Lamach","Yes, as it relates to factory utilization, just think as a bit where you\u2019re going with lean. You could think about the fact that we\u2019ve taken so much that physical footprint out which has given us that 40%, 50% operating leverage over these past five years, we feel pretty good about the factory footprint at this point in time. And although it\u2019s always a thing or two we might consider doing, it\u2019s not like we\u2019re doing any wholesale changes to that where we\u2019re very well utilized across the business.","And so lean at this point in time, more about making sure that as we see business pick back up we have the capacity, we have the ability to handle more throughput through the fixed cost base, and that again will help ensure that we\u2019re getting operating leverage at least equal to gross margins of business which would be the plan. That\u2019s how we think about it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi good morning.","Mike Lamach","Hi Steve.","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","Just on HVAC first. What percentage of your sale this year do you think are going to be 14 SEER and above, and using kind of rule of thumb, I don\u2019t know, 15% to 20% higher priced 14 versus 13 SEER. Is that fair? And then just on HVAC, the commercial stuff you talked about the applied markets. It doesn\u2019t sound like anything in Climate is going to get worse in the second half or it actually sound like maybe things could get a little bit better, but you have a consistent growth rate there, maybe just talk about that dynamic as well?","Mike Lamach","Yes, Steve, the first part of your question. 14 versus 13 SEER, the industry price is somewhere between 19% and 21% difference between 14 and 13 with the expectation I think that 13 saw decline probably more cost reductions on 14. And therefore probably a lower differential from what was 13, so what will then be 14. I don\u2019t have a breakdown in front of me Steve on 14 through. We had nice sure gain there, so it plays to our strong suit because we are seeing a mix up particularly as you\u2019re looking at 16 and above for being nice actions there for us.","And then to your point, we\u2019re mildly optimistic. Our forecast for applied, unitary or commercial HVAC in general would tell you that we expect stronger back half than first half. So it\u2019s marginally strong but it\u2019s a better second half than the first half. That\u2019s again going back to this point that the market prognosticators show that happening. We see that happening. Albeit we think that not be very steep inflection point that are more forecast to the industry data.","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","In any way to quantify that pipeline comment you made whether it\u2019s bidding activity or any numbers, high level numbers to quantify that and help us understand how \u2013 because I think JCI made the same comments about how optimistic they were maybe carrier this morning as well in North America but it\u2019s kind of hard for us to get our hands around it. And any kind of high level data around that pipeline?","Mike Lamach","Yes, Steve, actually interesting for us because there is two things going on. One is the pipeline is improving but the second activity here is making that a little bit difficult to give you an exact answer which is that in most of our climate businesses, there is a market coverage initiative on your way which is looking to make sure that whether it\u2019s by ZIP code or by country or by region or places we get our hands on it, what\u2019s our coverage ratio of the market, how many projects are we finding, what\u2019s the density of our revenue per available square foot of HVAC content. And what that\u2019s doing is driving investments into these markets, additional sales people for market coverage.","So you\u2019ve got a combination of market coverage and improved pipeline giving you a larger number than I think what\u2019s actually going to be reported by some of our competitors. So I don\u2019t want to give you a wild number on that. A year from now, I think we\u2019re bit more normalized there. That would be the number that I hope we could report to you bit more would be bit of a leading indicator on pipeline, but I would not be comfortable to throw out a big number at you today.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from Citi.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citigroup","Thank you. Good morning everyone. Mike, if we could stay in that residential mix topic. We did a survey earlier this quarter shows a pretty interesting demand characteristics, cluster demand both at the very low end, the 13 SEER but also a lot of intercept at the high end, and you just mentioned that the 16 SEER and above. So how are you positioning the portfolio today towards that higher end? You have all of the SEER levels represented, and how do you expect that demand for both the highest and lowest end to play out?","Mike Lamach","Yes, Deane, it\u2019s mixing up which is good always for Trane and for American standards, good for us. Our strategy is always been to make sure that we\u2019re shoring up sort of the13 and 14 which I kind of see as one bucket. And then really however you play 15, but 16 and above would be higher efficiency systems that always has been a strength. It continues to be of strength, both in dealer base but also in the product portfolio. So the key there is we want to continue to have that historical Trane strength, American Trane strength in the higher SEER systems but we\u2019re making a lot \u2013 we\u2019re making a lot of progress in the 13, 14 as well and so it\u2019s really playing both.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citigroup","That\u2019s helpful. And in showing us these five new chiller products makes the question. What type of growth investment have these chillers \u2013 just broadly in terms of new product introductions, what type of growth investment has this involved and where do you stand on your product vitality?","Mike Lamach","Yes, that set of investments there would be somewhere north of $100 million is what you\u2019re seeing on that page [ph] there. That\u2019s been part of what we\u2019ve been talking about for four or five years. We started on that ECTV [ph] project I think when I was still running Trane commercial in 2009. So it takes four, five years to be something like that, now they come out much faster than that, which is a good sign but vitality is good.","The vitality for the Trane applied portfolio really kind of the off the charts in the next five years, won\u2019t make any sense. It won\u2019t be meaningful, it will be almost a complete transition of the product portfolio.","Unitary, we\u2019ve been at that and kind of cycling through, so it\u2019s a more normalized kind of 20% to 30% number that must be there, but applied will be 50% to 100% probably over the next say three to five years.","Operator","Thank you. And we have time for one more question today. Our final question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks for letting me in guys. Good morning. So I just wanted to switch to acquisitions. You addressed that question a little bit earlier, but obviously I\u2019ve seen sometime since you did an M&A deal. And obviously the bias is still towards buyback, but are you actively pursuing acquisition opportunities both on opportunities at this point, and if you are, what are you seeing in terms of pricing opportunities?","Mike Lamach","Yes, Nigel, same old broken record with me. I can tell you it\u2019s well over 100 things that we looked at in the five years since I\u2019ve been here, in this job. I think it\u2019s been three years maybe five tops that we\u2019ve had a real interest in for various reasons. So it\u2019s not as if we haven\u2019t been looking at exercising that muscle all this time. It\u2019s just the longest time simply was not as good as the share buyback was. So we\u2019ve made the right decisions there. So as we look in the future, we\u2019re going to continue to hold up that mirror and understand which is more accretive and over what period of time. And that\u2019s the same old answer I am out with.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then just switching back quickly to Industrial, the ad business. I know we\u2019ve kind of \u2013 I had a few questions upon that already, but just approaching it from a different perspective, you\u2019re clearly outperforming Atlas Copco. And I\u2019m wondering, you mentioned share gains in air free and particularly in Europe but \u2013 sorry, oil free, but if we look at small systems versus larger systems, do you think that this outperformance was primarily in mix shift issue or do you sense you\u2019re gaining the share in both smaller and larger systems?","Mike Lamach","It comes back to basics. The feet on the street in the right places. It\u2019s been a constant drum beat on the portfolio innovation there on change, as that continues it\u2019s a similar story as our applied HVAC business in terms of what that roadmap looks like or a product portfolio going forward. And when we launch those products, we in fact launch them feature that are superior to competition at margins that are superior to what the replacement product was. So the double effect when we launch products that we should have margin expansion and growth. That\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re seeing there. So there is no magic there. It\u2019s been \u2013 that group has been hard at it for five years like the Trane team has. They had a earlier market recovery when HVAC of course had much more supporting incremental margins for the first three or so years of that. And hopefully that\u2019s what we\u2019ll see in the HVAC business going forward.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question and answer session for today.

In the third quarter, we delivered earnings per share of $1.10. There was a small amount of restructuring in the quarter, it was less than a penny so reported and adjusted EPS are identical. That\u2019s a 21% increase versus adjusted earnings per share in the third quarter of 2013. Revenues were $3.4 billion, up 5% versus last year on a reported basis. Revenue growth was about a point higher than our guide which was to be up about 4% for the quarter. We saw somewhat stronger revenues in transport particularly in auxiliary power units and marine equipment and in commercial HVAC equipment in both North America and Europe.","Revenues were up 6% excluding currency. Orders were up 7% in the third quarter and up 8% excluding currency. Climate orders were up 9% led by auxiliary power units, marine units and commercial HVAC equipment orders. Industrial orders were up 3%. Adjusted operating margin which excludes restructuring was up 90 basis points.","Climate margins increased 120 basis points; industrial margins were headwind of 110 basis points. For the company pricing exceeded direct inflation that has each quarter for more than three years.","Operating leverage was 31% on an adjusted basis. On the year-to-date basis we have delivered 110 basis points of margin improvement. We repurchased 2.6 million shares in the third quarter. We have narrowed the range of our full year forecast the midpoint of guidance for adjusted EPS of $3.22 is unchanged and now includes diligence and transaction cost related to the Cameron acquisition that we were not in our July guidance. I\u2019ll give you some more detail on the fourth quarter and the year in a few minutes after Sue walks you through more details on the third quarter. Sue?","Sue Carter","Thanks Mike. Starting at a high level again, our reported bookings for the quarter were up 7%, revenues were up 5% and our operating margins without restructuring were up 90 basis points year-over-year. Reported earnings per share were $1.10 versus midpoint guidance of $1.03 the $0.07 fee came from a few areas. ","As Mike said revenue growth was about a point higher than mid-point guidance which would be about $0.03 earning. The currency exchange impact from Venezuela which we have point out as an estimate in our third quarter guidance of $10 million cost or about $0.03 did not occur in the quarter. So that was three of the $0.07 difference plus the revenue. However, the risk in Venezuela remains and we\u2019ve rolled that now into the fourth quarter guidance. The tax rate and share count were each about a penny favorable. FX excluding the Venezuela item was about a penny unfavorable to guidance. So that gives you the full $0.07.","Now if you'll go to slide four. Orders for the third quarter of 2014 were up 7% on a reported basis and up 8% excluding currency. Climate orders were up 9%. Global commercial HVAC bookings were up mid-single digit. Transport orders were up over 20% and as Mike said led by auxiliary power unit and marine unit orders. Orders in the industrial segment were up 3%.","So if you can go to slide five. So look at the revenue trends by segment in regions, the top half of the chart shows revenue change for each segment. For the total company third quarter revenues were up 5% versus last year on a reported basis and up 6% excluding currency. Climate revenues increased 6% with commercial HVAC revenues up mid-single digits and transport revenues up mid-teens. Residential HVAC revenues were up low single digits. Industrial revenues were up 3% on a reported basis and excluding currency. ","I\u2019ll give more color on each segment in the next few slides.","For the bottom chart which shows revenue change on a geographic basis, revenues were up 6% in the Americas, 9% in EMEA and Asia was down 2% all excluding foreign exchange. Within Asia, China revenues were down mid-single digits in the quarter with climate revenues down low-teens and industrial revenues up slightly.","Now go to slide six. This chart walks through the change in operating margin from third quarter 2013 of 11.8% to third quarter of 2014 which was 13% for an increase of 120 basis points. This chart is on a reported basis. We\u2019ve clearly spiked out the impact of restructuring cost for you which was 30 basis points of tailwind year-over-year.","Volume mix and foreign exchange collectively were 80 basis points positive versus prior year. Our pricing programs continue to outpace material inflation adding 10 basis points to margin. We have been consistently positive on this measure for more than three years although we\u2019ve foreshadowed in each earnings call this year the gap has narrowed as we move through 2014.","Productivity versus other inflation was 60 basis points of positive impact in the quarter. Year-over-year investments and restructuring were higher by 30 basis points in total. ","In the box, you can see that was comprised of 60 basis points of headwind from investments, those are the new product investments, channel expansion and also IT. There was a 30 basis point benefit from lower restructuring cost. So if you prefer to look at this on an adjusted basis, adjusted margins increased a net of 90 basis points versus the 120 basis points on a reported basis. Leverage in the quarter was 31% excluding restructuring from last year and 27% in the segment. Climate\u2019s leverage at 34% was strong across both the HVAC and transport businesses particularly in North America and Europe.","Now if you'll go to slide seven. Let\u2019s talk about the climate segment. The climate segment includes Trane commercial and residential HVAC and Thermo King Transport refrigeration. Total revenues for the third quarter were $2.6 billion that is up 6% versus last year on a reported basis and excluding currency. Global commercial HVAC orders were up mid-single digits. Orders were up mid-single digits in the Americas and Asia.","HVAC orders were up more than 20% in Europe, Middle East and Africa with strong increases in both applied and unitary products.","Commercial HVAC revenues were up mid-single-digits. Revenues were also up mid-single digits in Americas, up low-single digits in EMEA and down in Asia. Commercial HVAC equipment revenues were up mid-single digits. HVAC parts, services and solutions revenue were also up mid-single digits versus prior year. Growth in worldwide unitary equipment revenues more than offset lower applied revenues. ","Thermo King orders were up over 20% versus 2013 third quarter led by increases in marine equipment, auxiliary power units and North American trailers. Thermo King revenues were up mid-teens with truck trailer revenue up low-teens. Bus, APU and marine equipment revenues were all up over 20%.","Residential HVAC revenues were up low-single digits versus last year. Unit volumes were also up low-single digits and mix was positive. The adjusted operating margin for climate was 14.3% in the quarter, 120 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2013, due to volume and productivity, partially offset by inflation.","Now let\u2019s go to slide eight. Third quarter revenues for the industrial segment were $741 million, up 3% from last year\u2019s third quarter. For the industrial segment excluding Club Car, revenues were up low-single digits and orders were also up low-single digits versus last year. Excluding Club Car revenues in the Americas and Asia Pacific were up mid-single digits while revenues in Europe, Middle East and Africa declined. ","Club Car orders and revenues in the quarter were up slightly, growth in utility vehicles offset a decline in Gulf markets in the quarter.","Industrial\u2019s operating margin of 14.8% was down 110 basis points due to inflation in investment spending partially offset by higher volume, productivity and pricing. We have increased investment spending in industrial versus prior year product development and advance of upcoming regulatory changes and infrastructure investments to support channel and services.","Let\u2019s go to slide nine. Working capital as a percentage of revenue was 4% of revenue in the quarter. The increase versus prior year is from higher receivables in inventory, partially offset by higher payables balances. Day sales outstanding is up mainly due to mix of business in higher terms in certain geographies such as China.","On inventory, we have been intentionally increasing stock levels, inventory levels of key assemblies in order to ensure availability of supply. Year-to-date September free cash flow was $417 million. Our full year cash flow forecast is 800 million to $850 million versus prior guidance of $850 million to $900 million. The change mainly reflects investment we are making in inventory to support key stocking levels and support the regional standards change in residential HVAC that translates the free cash flow of 90% to 95% of net income. ","Please go to slide 10. We repurchased 2.6 million shares for approximately $160 million in the third quarter. Year-to-date September we have spent $1.2 billion in share repurchases and repurchased about 20 million shares. Our forecast for the year remains to spend 1.375 billion on repurchase. ","And with that I will turn it back to Mike. ","Mike Lamach","","Great, thanks Sue. Please go to Slide 11. In August we announced our agreement to purchase the Centrifugal Compression division of Cameron; this chart was shown during the webcast we held of the day of announcement. It\u2019s great fit with our compressed air business it generates value for our shareholders, and it\u2019s decretive to all of our key metrics. It adds to our core compression capabilities and it adds throughout the range to our compressed air business. ","Please go to Slide 12. There are no updates to the timing of the closure. Everything is progressing according to schedule; we still expect to close in the fourth quarter. The forecast I will go into next does not include any operational results for Cameron. We will update you once we know the closing date. ","Please go to Slide 13. Our full year revenue forecast for growth was about 4% is unchanged. There has been some movement within the climate segment, where transport is going to come in somewhat stronger given the orders we have in hand for marine containers and APUs that will ship this year which is offset by somewhat lower HVAC revenues in Latin America and Asia and the impact of negative foreign exchange.","Please go to Slide 14. For the full year as I said we still see revenue growth of about 4%. We are adjusting our full year 2014 earnings outlook to a range of $3.17 to $3.21 on a reported basis. For the full year we now expect to spend about $0.03 in restructuring versus $0.05 in our prior guidance. So on an adjusted basis in a range of $3.20 to $3.24. This includes absorbing some transaction cost related to the closing of the Cameron acquisition which again were not in the July guidance. There was no change to the full year average share count value to 275 million shares the tax rate of approximately 25%. ","Fourth quarter 2014 revenues are forecasted to be up approximately 3% to 4%. We expect mid-single digit growth in climate and low single-digit growth in industrial. Fourth quarter GAAP, continuing earnings per share are forecasted to be in a range of $0.68 to $0.72. Restructuring costs are expected to about $0.01 in the quarter, so on an adjusted the EPS range is $0.69 to $0.73. The difference between the prior fourth quarter guidance and current guidance is from a negative Venezuelan currency impact estimated of $0.03 to a timing moving from Q3 to Q4 to as Sue discussed, some timing of shipments between Q3 and Q4 versus the July view and transaction cost related to the closer of the Cameron acquisition which were not included in our prior guidance. We are assuming an average share count of fourth quarter of 270 million shares and a tax rate of about 25%. ","So the EPS bridge versus last year\u2019s fourth quarter in the appendix for your reference.","So in closing we are pleased to have delivered above our earnings commitment in the third quarter with solid performance against the macro headwinds. I continue to feel good about our positioning and our focus as we head into the final quarter of the year. ","With that Sue and I will be happy to take your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague of the Vertical Research Company. Your line is now open. ","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Company","Mike can you give us a little bit more color on what's going on in the applied market, whether you are seeing any signs of churn there. And maybe if there is any geographic color to put around that is kind of the first part of the question. ","Mike Lamach","","Sure. Applied equipment revenue was down closed and ubiquities, but applied revenues were actually up in North America kind of mid-single digits. So we saw that the weakness really in all regions except North America. And so that really Jeff I think is the first quarter that we have seen kind of mid-single digit growth. And I think if we were to see another quarter or two of that we feel better going into 2015 as there would be moderate recovery in institutional construction. ","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Company","Then secondly, just on industrial can you give us some color on the investment spend and maybe more importantly how does it continue going forward, obviously there is some slide down in your log but maybe give us some color on where that lays geographically between the segments. And do we see that tapering off into the new year. ","Sue Carter","","Let me give that a shot Jeff and talk a little bit about industrial and I will kind of broaden the question a little bit and talk about some of the things that that we were doing. So when we think about industrial and we think about where we are and where we are with the third quarter results, there is a piece of this that says that as we have gone through 2014 and we've looked at this. The first quarter created a quite a hole for us and we knew that and we knew it was going to take some aggressive actions to get back to the target on operating income margins for the year. ","In addition to that as we have gone through the year we have been looking at these businesses sort of the new structure and we\u2019ve been looking at growth and the businesses and prioritize, good payback investments that are going to support growth, they\u2019re going to support product development, service infrastructure investments, channel investments like I talk about in the script. So as we were going through the third quarter we looked at where we were again climate has been over achieving. We did accelerate some of the investments in industrial and again looking at new products to prepare them for the upcoming technology efficiency standards, investments in channel and services and in addition to that as we thought about the back half of the year, we were expecting perhaps more recovery in Club Car than what occurred. So Gulf markets have really remained down as we\u2019ve gone through the year.","And so when we think about industrial then going forward nothing that we\u2019re seeing in the investments that we\u2019re making is not going to change our longer term margin opportunity for industrial and we expect them to have margin improvement in 2015.","Mike Lamach"," ","Jeff I probably add on here little bit and say when you back up and look at the longer term guidance we\u2019ve given around 15% to 20% EPS growth in \u201814, \u201815 and \u201816 we\u2019re tracking at about 21% at the mid-point of the guidance we\u2019re giving right now. And with bookings being so strong in the third quarter and really setting up well for the fourth quarter in 2015 there is no reason when we see a good idea here not to act on it pull it forward and really build and protect against the 15%, 20% EPS growth in '15 and '16. So I think that there are no surprises here and I want to emphasize there is absolutely nothing wrong with this business, these are investments that we fully expect to have a return in \u201815 and \u201816 and we\u2019d expect that business to return to normal incremental margin expectations of \u201815 and \u201816. ","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","","Yes, thanks good morning guys. I just wanted to follow up on Jeff's point on the industrial margin and I just want to -- you thought of two points, one was the investment spending which you just went through, that sounds like that\u2019s going to taper in 4Q in \u201915. But you also called that inflationary pressure as so maybe if you could discuss that and Mike just I couldn\u2019t help but reiterate that you put out that 15%, 20% for \u201815, do you still feel comfortable with that target for \u201815 right now?","Mike Lamach","","Yes, Nigel first of all we\u2019ve laid out a 15%, 20% \u201814 \u201815 and \u201816, \u201814 happened about how we bought relative to growth in the market leverage per share count tax and buyback all being factors that are yielding a year that should be just a bit up top of that range and again we\u2019re looking at this thing a little longer term, and that just quarter-to-quarter and there is some opportunity particularly in the industrial segment where we think that we can accelerate growth much like to see that acceleration right now and find it is going to take just a little bit of investment and want to be smart about that but I have no reasons to have any different expectation than 15%, 20% EPS growth \u201815 and \u201816 as we see about.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay.","Sue Carter","","And then to repeat Nigel on your question on the inflation that we referenced in the press release. So there is a bit of material inflation that happens on the industrial side of the business, again it\u2019s not something that is unexpected but it is inflationary pressure. There is also inflation that occurs from our businesses with people, with compensation and different pieces of just year-over-year inflation again, none of that would be an unexpected event for the businesses, what you balance that which is that sometimes in the businesses and this in particular occurred with the industrial side is that the productivity is a little lumpy which means that we had some productivity that was better in Q2 versus Q3 but the inflation numbers were a little higher in Q3 than they were in Q2. So you got some flips and puts and takes between the couple of orders but again there is not an inflation that was something we wouldn\u2019t expect for this unusual for the business and these are normal things that occur.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Douglass of Longbow Research. Your line is now open.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research","","Good morning everyone. Can you discuss, you talk about applied but unitary must have been at least up high single digits, can you discuss what\u2019s going on in commercial unitary?","Mike Lamach","","Yes, actually a very successful quarter for us worldwide unitary equipment was up high-teens in the third quarter so that was a success. Train, commercial, unitary revenues were up by low-teens in the third quarter that was certainly a positive for us as well. High-single digit in Americas, a very strong growth in Europe, and a decline in Asia. So again high-teens unitary orders and then good revenue flow through in the quarter across the inventory business again low-teens. Good continued success in the Americas high single-digit. EMEA was really outstanding again sort of a high mid-teens in Europe, Western Europe I should say, a little bit higher than that in the Middle East. And all that brought down by the events of what was happening in Eastern Europe. So a good quarter. ","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research","","Thank you. And then can you talk about how you are approaching the regional standards in the U.S. and Brazil. Are you anticipating a significant pre-build but not necessarily pre-buy in fourth quarter? And how are you seeing that play out with your distributors in 2015?","Mike Lamach"," ","Yes I would say Mark as of today the impact is going to be very different for each OEM depending on what their channel structure is. So I think you are going to see different results that are going to phase in over the year and actually you are seeing some volatility in order and shipments rates between OEMs in the res business. As you probably know we own part of the distribution and part of its independent. We have been talking to our distributors and our dealers and even among them it's not one size fits all, it depends on their liquidity, their stocking capacity and the strategy that they want to employee themselves for management transition. But as we see it today we will have some pre-buy and we will certainly have some pre-build in the fourth quarter and as we are following the situation closely. We have plans in place for both. And we are flexible enough to adjust accordingly as it evolves within the quarter. ","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. ","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","","Hi, thank you. I just wanted to follow-up on the overall segment incremental margin. So I think you talked in July that it should be in the mid-30s this year. And if that\u2019s still the case that would imply maybe mid or high-20s for Q4. I just wanted to check that was still correct? And then related to that should we see that number pick up into next year more akin to the gross margin level of sort of 30%-31%. ","Sue Carter","","So I think Julian when we look at the full year of 2014 at the midpoint level for the full year, what you see is an incremental leverage of about 33%. And then in the fourth quarter what you have is a segment leverage of about 30%. So overall when you look at first half, second half they are pretty evenly weighted. And again I think as we talk about going forward we would continue to expect that sort of the threshold would be at the gross margin level for its leverage expectations. ","Mike Lamach"," ","Yes that\u2019s right Julian. I think really in your prudent modeling would probably have us telling you something more like 25% along breakage when things go right for us, like they've done a lot this year. We might see something closer to gross margins; in fact depending on where that business is coming into us, there could be some leverage against fixed assets depending on what we have done there at the time. So 30% is probably a good more aggressive number, 25% more prudent. And there will be some volatility I think in quarter-to-quarter but again over the full year and then over a long period of time now four years or five years we have been able to pretty consistently have those top quartile incremental margins and that\u2019s a pretty important part of our commitment strategy how we run the business.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks. And then just on the industrial business. I just wanted to clarify that; price mix for you was about zero in that business in Q2. Was it around zero in Q3 or it went negative?","Sure Carter","","No it was around zero in Q3 also. ","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Great, thank you. ","Mike Lamach"," ","Yes Julian price would have been just a touch higher material emplacement but so close that it rounding correctly is about flat.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Winoker of Bernstein Research. Your line is now open. ","Steven Winoker - Bernstein Research","","Thanks and good morning. I just wanted to get a little more clarity on the $0.07 you called out for the Q4 reduction versus last guidance. So $0.03 on Venezuelan currency. And then is it fair to say the other $0.04 is all revenue related and some mix of that's FX and something else. Because it sounds like you are calling out continued strength in margins. So maybe just a little more clarity in terms of how you broke that or how you are thinking about that. I am looking at the bridge but the bridge is just year-on-year and not your change in thinking from last quarter to this quarter.","Sue Carter","","Right. So what you would end up with Steve is you would have the Venezuela as we called it out. We also called out having some of the Cameron cost that were in there. And as we have said in August when we announced the transaction about a penny or two on the cost for the Cameron fees. And then as you think about it and as we talk about it today we may have had some revenue that was holding to Q3 versus Q4. So nothing again other than really sort of those raw components but the biggest two pieces being Venezuela and also the addition of the expected Cameron transaction cost.","Mike Lamach","","Yes simply for me Steve, three pretty much coming out of Venezuela a couple coming out of Cameron one currency maybe even.","Sue Carter","","Yes, yes.","Mike Lamach","","And the balance of that is just being a little bit more sensitive to the volatility of what we\u2019re seeing with some of the order rates and China is a great example where you\u2019re seeing volatility one strong booking this quarter followed by a weak bookings quarter and lag of course to a revenue quarter and so on so forth. So the volatility here in Latin America is weaker and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to change for the balance of the year in addition to China. So it\u2019s a little bit of market but I would say the market is probably a penny exchange on the balances just Cameron and Venezuela.","Sue Carter","What I would also state though\u00a0for those on this call is we take Venezuela at $10 million as we went through the mid-point of the year which is what we had in the third quarter numbers and we rolled that into the fourth quarter numbers, that\u2019s an extremely volatile situation. The number could be different than the $10 million but we weren\u2019t going to play with making any changes in our overall guidance for what that might be doing because we just simply don\u2019t know. I mean it is just going to continue to move and if there is a negative impact from that we\u2019ll balance it off of the $10 million but that\u2019s not a known number, that\u2019s the piece that we put into the guidance and we\u2019ll continue to monitor that with things down there. ","And I just want to make sure that clear that, that\u2019s the number that we write that and put into the guidance.","Steven Winoker - Bernstein Research","","Sue is that -- which exchange rate did you use to get to that?","Sue Carter","[indiscernible] the normal rate wasn\u2019t the CCAB [indiscernible] one or two rates.","Steven Winoker - Bernstein Research","","And then for my second question if I could, just the VRF, what do you think on VRF penetration and how that\u2019s affecting you good and bad through the quarter?","Mike Lamach","Can you repeat that?","Steven Winoker - Bernstein Research","","Yes, Variable Refrigerant Flow, VRF penetration in the quarter?","Mike Lamach","That's a really good growth in the quarter Steve, really good growth in the quarter all regions of the world and as always point out continued penetration of ducted and ductless markets as well. So it\u2019s a good balanced approach but good success with VRF excellent growth coming in all regions with the line.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","On the resi stuff so should we just basically think about the difference in free cash flow as kind of your best estimate of the type of inventory you\u2019re going to build for this transition?","Mike Lamach","There is puts and takes in there Steve, see we normally have without a pre-built sort of a laying down and lower working capital we got to add back on top of that. So it\u2019s not completely in that number but the change in thinking certainly I think will be attributable largely to our thoughts around pre-built.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Okay. And then when you think about the transition, do you expect it to have, there are a lot of moving parts here and do you expect it to be kind of a net impact next year? Do you think about the kind of mid-single digit industry trend line that we\u2019re in right now? I mean given this is more of a pre-build than a pre-buy, any kind of impacts around margins or growth that you want to call out that you guys kind of planned for this thing here?","Mike Lamach","No, it\u2019s little too soon; Steve it happens with certainly \u201814 to your pricing and then just in terms of dynamics as it plays out in each OEM in its own strategy, it's how much inventory that we're rebuilding and holding and again that\u2019s a factor of how quickly those \u201814 comes balancing push against \u201813 and I would say that overtime possibly relatively short period of time you\u2019re going to see some focus on cost reductions coming into the \u201814 so you\u2019re going to cross the competitive space. There is a lot of play there for us to make a call on that now. ","The other point I would make that\u2019s the capital question there was some other selective areas where there is quite of bit of order volatility as an example marine container, auxiliary power units even the TK unit that go on trucks. So the vehicle power self-powered truck units, lot of volatility in the order rates there, those are nice businesses for us so you got us holding and bringing in more component inventory as long lead items be able to build against that demand. And it\u2019s really a fine tuning of the working capital for the upside to ensure that we\u2019ve got the ability to take advantage of really good progress and order rates across those businesses.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","What is your mix now -- the last question, what is your mix now of just the baseline \u201813 here, what will mix of \u201813 here be the shares of percentage of your volume?","Mike Lamach","Even though if I have that handy Steve, I'll say what, we\u2019ll look for it, take the next question and I'll answer that as we go here.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Berry of Susquehanna. Your line is now opened. ","Robert Berry - Susquehanna","","Hey guys good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick follow-up first on the Resi HVAC impact. How much are you factoring from that in the 4Q outlook?","Mike Lamach"," ","Well for the industry our view of units in the industry has been something to the neighborhood of five points of normal growth and probably a couple of points of growth associated with pre-build. So we end up with sort of a mid to high single-digit residential environment. That\u2019s the environment we think we are playing into and our plans would be commensurate with that. ","Robert Berry - Susquehanna","","That couple of points is that for just the fourth quarter or is it for the year will be higher in the fourth quarter?","Mike Lamach"," ","I think in the industry it's started already, competitively one large OEM that had a ERP system conversion and put about 30 days of extra inventory into the channel. We've had a couple of other OEM competitors that have had more aggressive campaigns against moving into the channel. So some of that\u2019s happened in Q3. I think more will happen in Q4 but in total I think it\u2019s a couple of points probably to NBU volumes which would put us somewhere in the neighborhood of a range of a low-end of 700,000 and high-end maybe a million units in market and pre-built. ","Robert Berry - Susquehanna","","And then just finally, could you just update us on what you are seeing changed in Europe since the last quarter in particular industrial I know was particularly strong in 2Q. I think it ended up being down a little bit in this quarter. I know that\u2019s lumpy but. And then in TK in particular just what you are seeing in the Europe environment? Thank you. ","Mike Lamach"," ","Yes, thanks. In industrial it is choppy. And so I think your question, I have the answer in it as well. It\u2019s absolutely, it's been choppy large centrifugal air compressor orders are going to be a big swing factor there and that was a difference for us well. With TK it's been again strong growth in Western Europe of course marine container is strong but very, very slowly growth in Eastern Europe probably no growth. I mean there is really no businesses that\u2019s really dry it up until things normalize there. And then with smaller vehicles again small truck, that\u2019s moderated somewhat as well. So TK is slowing down a little bit in Europe but we are picking it up in other areas like in marines. And industrial I would expect to see some choppiness but it ask us to be able to continue to move towards that kind of 1% to 3% sort of growth rate for the year and probably after a couple of quarters I don\u2019t see any big shots happening there.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Buckingham Research. Your line is now open. ","Josh Pokrzywinski - Buckingham Research","","Hi good morning guys. Just first on the applied side. You talked about strong revenue growth there. I think you have a really tough order comp from last year on a new product line. Can you talk about what orders did? And then I guess prospectively how those are coming along either any log or conversations with your customers?","Mike Lamach"," ","Well you have got one solid quarter I think in North American growth. And if you recall we said last quarter that we thought like we are seeing an inflection point. And so you had the inflection point off the bottom, we had one quarter of good growth. We don\u2019t really describe to the Mcgraw Hill data view as of there is 10 point happening in 2015 institutional construction. I think that we are more likely to see a multi-year mid-single digit in a given quarter or two it may touch high single-digit applied rate. And there's many, many reasons for that, some of which include the availability of field trades and labor to work on these projects for institutional customers. And that\u2019s very consistent with what we are seeing for inquiries and we are seeing in the pipeline of projects that we are looking at. So I'd like to see another quarter or two Josh before we say that kind of is an inflection point but it\u2019s a trend that we would feel good about calling for 2015. But I think it's pointed in the right direction for moderate year. And again a stronger but more moderated recovery than what Mcgraw Hill was projecting. ","Josh Pokrzywinski - Buckingham Research","","What were orders in applied in the quarter?","Mike Lamach"," ","Well I think you are mostly thinking about North America applied because that\u2019s where we would see typically the institutional recovery that we -- that was mid-single digit. ","Josh Pokrzywinski - Buckingham Research","","Okay. And I do recall right that it was a tough comp from last year from than new product. ","Mike Lamach"," ","That\u2019s right. ","Josh Pokrzywinski - Buckingham Research","","And then just a follow-up question. As you raw mats playing out here obviously the war on copper has this taken down exposure that overtime. How do you feel about that that price cost after this has been narrowing through the year. As we get into next year should that staying narrow, is there an opportunity for that to widen out or could actually go negative if demand stays choppy?","Mike Lamach"," ","It stays fairly narrow and we've had very good success for some three or maybe more years now driving price in in excess of petrol inflation. It could invert quarter or two. Don't see that happening, but it could happen. But I would expect that over time, over three or four quarters of time rolling you would see a slight premium to petrol inflation and that\u2019s just what we built in to the operating system and into the expectations of product management and in the way that our people can compensate it that self. ","Josh Pokrzywinski - Buckingham Research","Got you. And I guess just underneath that if I can squeeze in one more on the 13.0 pre-built well there would be any change in your view on industry pricing for that 13.0 product versus what its price at today?","Mike Lamach","If anybody has got on that it\u2019s a the wild west I think as it comes to expectations around what really happens on that. But if you look at some point it\u2019s not the richest margin product that anybody is selling so I think sensitivity around price cost is narrow enough that there is not going to be really anything crazy happening there. Why go through the operative pre-building if in fact you are going to give it away as part of the 2014 equation. So I don\u2019t really see that as being a significant problem. ","And then Steve back to your question I think it\u2019s about 60% on the 13.0 mix cross. ","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America","Hi. Just a question on restructuring we\u2019ll lowered it from $0.05 to $0.03. Are we doing less? Are we changing the timing, are we being more effective?","Sue Carter","I think as we have looked at our restructuring for 2014 Andrew we started out with a forecast that said we had a lot of plans that we actioned in the fourth quarter of 2013 and sort of a normalized levels would be in the $0.05 to $0.10 range in 2014. And as we\u2019ve gone through the year what we\u2019ve done is a natural part of the business as we looked for opportunities that made sense. But we did do some pretty heavy lifting on restructuring in the fourth quarter and so as we\u2019ve gone through the year we sort of led this naturally fall out with things that we needed to do and things that fit the construct of how we were running the business and it just happens to be $0.03 this year that is in day predictor of what the future will be but we have put in basically a placeholder that said what was normal and given the work that we did at the end of last year and actually first couple of months of 2014 just wasn\u2019t as necessary throughout 2014 so were at $0.03.","Mike Lamach","And the maintenance Andrew I think is sort of if you look back over a long period of time sort of the maintenance that we view around the footprint probably get you some sort of a nickel that we put into recruiting every year but it\u2019s not the big story. We\u2019re generally always looking at, but generally happy with where the footprint actually is, what utilization is and what the available capacity is, hopefully going into some growth coming into \u201815 and \u201816 particularly in the HVAC commercial businesses. ","Andrew Obin - Bank of America","And just the follow up question on the industrial, as you\u2019re pushing into oil free compressor stays with more capacity, should we be concerned that one of your European competitors would push back and will somehow impair the structural profitability of the market space?","Mike Lamach","Well, I'm sure if they did they'd be impairing their own profitability so I\u2019m not sure that wins anybody\u2019s sort of affection in that regard. I would say that the investments that we\u2019re making are few fold, one is, there has been some efficiency rules put in place in China for air compressors that\u2019s moving to Europe and I think it will adopted soon and it eventually in early conversation with DOE it will come to the U.S. and other countries as well. And so it\u2019s really getting in front of a lot of these 2017, '18, '19 efficiency requirements. Our belief is that the grand promise that's been around energy efficiency and around reliability and so what we want to be able to do is to able to continue to sell the most efficient, most reliable product in the marketplace and that\u2019s really what the investment is, certainly it\u2019s not indicative of some oil free pressure that we\u2019re seeing around the pricing, it\u2019s not the story that we had in Q3 or Q4 around the compression in margins, it really is we have not the gulf recovery although our orders were up a little bit we certainly haven\u2019t seen shipments improve across gulf, that\u2019s hurt and then we pull forward a number of NPD and channel investments and set ourselves up in \u201815 and \u201816 particularly well across all of the industrial businesses as quicker.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Volkmann of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Steve Volkmann - Jefferies ","","Good morning. Just a quick follow up on Thermo King I know guys got some new product there. it seems like its going fairly well, kind of what\u2019s going on, what\u2019s driving the strength? is it an upgrade cycle do you think you\u2019re taking any share and then I\u2019m curious if there has been any move in the margins in that business with the new product as well.","Mike Lamach","Well last question first, the incremental margins have been right at expectation and pretty consistent with past performance when the business is growing and leverage there is something unique or really remarkable about the leverage that we\u2019re seeing there. in fact the climate segment the remarkable leverage that comes from the commercial and residential trends in particular. The growth that we are seeing is certainly highest in APUs. When you think about what our truck customers faced, the number one issue that they have is the availability of drivers. A couple of large customers told me that drivers only last about nine months in that business but some of the larger companies have found that by installing APUs in their cabs they were able to significantly increase driver retention. And so that\u2019s one of the reasons we are seeing APUs really expand dramatically even though fuel prices have dropped and it used be that APUs increased as fuel prices increased but this is a disconnect, fuel prices are dropping and the drivers really around driver retention more than anything. Marine container has been good, particularly gen sets, the inter-marine containers have been very strong for us and we continue to leverage new products which is more expensive but with the Tier [indiscernible] new carbon requirements coming into play and that\u2019s driven a lot of -- obviously the revenue upside for us as well. ","Steve Volkmann - Jefferies ","","Great, thanks. And then Mike any thoughts as we get into 2015 about sort of capital allocation. I know you are in the process of obviously big acquisition here but how do we think about things like share repurchases next year or your appetite for further M&A?","Mike Lamach","","Nothing's changed in terms of wanting to be smart and practical and pragmatic use of capital in terms of how we are thinking it. We have said that the dividend needs to be 30% to 35%, and we are going to continue to keep pushing on that. And make sure that we are competitive in peer group. We are going to control any share dilution so share buybacks will continue be a harden story. Then depending on what\u2019s starts from there which would probably toggle between share repurchases and acquisitions that are accretive to us accretive in the short term. And we will see where that goes. But we will guide more in 2015 on that but wouldn\u2019t expect anything different than what we have been saying on the last couple of few years. ","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open. ","Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Hey just to follow-on Josh\u2019s question on pricing. It looks like in late September you put through a 2% to 5% price increase in North America commercial. Can you just talk about what\u2019s driving that and what are you seeing from your competitors? ","Mike Lamach"," ","Mostly what\u2019s happening is freight prices are really increasing particularly flat bed. So where you are moving really large pieces of equipment. So chillers or extremely large rooftop units, which I think you know we have got a very high share of, those are moved typically over one or more flat beds as opposed to closed body trucks. And the theoretical utilization of flat beds like 106% right now in the marketplace which isn\u2019t even possible other than if you look at what\u2019s happening you got prices going up and trucking companies not really investing in new fleet because they can\u2019t find drivers. So that\u2019s primary driver there is freight for us. And I think that our competitors are seeing the same thing. We probably as a mix have a higher degree of that just due to the mix of applied versus unitary and even the large unitary mix that we have versus their unitary. Some of our competitors only go up to 30 tons to 40 tons and of course we go up to 150 tons of unitary which can take two or three semis to move. ","Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just like the Europe commercial HVAC orders being up 20. Is there any kind of good lumpiness in there as their share gains it just seems kind of an outlier versus what we are hearing in Europe?","Mike Lamach"," ","Well we had that outlier happening now for a while. So I probably can\u2019t hide -- can\u2019t look past the results there. We are doing really well in Europe. New product launches have gone extremely well we have got a great management team on the ground that\u2019s very energized and I don\u2019t know how long it will persist but we are enjoying it for the time being.","Operator","","Thank you. And our last question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. ","Joe Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs","So my first question is really around the I guess the elevated investment that you talked about in industrial. Clearly it seems to make a lot of sense given that you are tracking ahead of your 20% EPS growth target. And you are looking to protect your investment in coming years. I guess my question though is, how much of that incremental spending increased this year? I think you guys were talking about like a $60 million plus type rate for \u201914. So I am just wondering how much that\u2019s changed?","Sue Carter"," ","So Joe, if I look at where we are in a full year now, we are probably adding $9 million to $10 million to that $64 million so it now looks more like 74-75 on the incremental basis. ","Joe Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful Sue. And then just my one follow-up is really on just industrial margins. I think when we most recently spoke I think the expectations were to at least kind of try to hold those margins flat. Fully understanding you are investing more in that business today. But what\u2019s the expectation now embedded in your 4Q guidance for industrial margins. And then the corollary to that is how do you think about those margins moving forward into \u201915 on an organic basis? Clearly Cameron is going to change things but it would be helpful to hear your thoughts there as well.","Mike Lamach","So one thing in particular. Sue gave you an absolutely true and actual corporate number which is around circa $10 million of investment but even if you look at the mix change of that 10 million it\u2019s shifting much more toward industrial than it is at the climate has been very efficient with the plans and so we shifted actually more of that then we tend to industrial in a little less in climate so that\u2019s a bigger impact of the climate margin just the absolute 10 million for the company. ","Incremental margins there should look to recover in 2015 probably certainly at the gross margins but then depending on weather in Q1 and Q2 of next year meaning we don\u2019t have multiple ice storms and the severity that we had in Club Car we should not have a repeat of Club Car in gulf environment Q1, Q2 and that was I guessing $20 million impact to us probably in the first quarter. So if you don\u2019t repeat that and get back to the normal incremental margins in the business hopefully with little higher growth rate which is something we\u2019re looking to it to, is what can we do to these investments to drive a little higher growth that what we\u2019re thinking.","We should get incremental margins at or above gross margins for area in 2015. As we enter into that planning process and enter into guidance with you when we talk to you soon in the first quarter we\u2019re going to tune that but that would be a pretty good indictor of what at least my expectation and Sue's expectations would be going in.","Joe Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Okay, that\u2019s helpful.

This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. So participants on this morning\u2019s call are Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO, and Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO.","With that, please go to Slide 3 and I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike.","Mike Lamach","Thanks, Zac, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I\u2019ll start this morning by discussing our focused execution of our strategy, underpins our ability to deliver sustainable high levels of performance overtime. We also provide comments on how we\u2019re thinking about our business and our end markets broadly, as we close out solid performance in 2017 and move into what we expect to be another strong year in 2018. So, we\u2019ll discuss our third quarter performance in more detail and address some key topics we know that are on minds of investors. And I\u2019ll then close the brief summary before we take your questions.","As I said on prior calls, our overall strategy remains straight forward. We believe our business operating system, people and culture are source of competitive advantage. For us, our business strategy is grounded and anticipating and addressing global trends that positively impact many of world\u2019s most pressing sustainability challenges. We focus on delivering the most reliable, energy efficient and environmentally friendly products and services in durable growing markets.","In our case, it\u2019s an orientation towards the importance of sustainability which is enabled by digital, another exponential technologies, growing at dramatic rates that are enabling new business models and sources of productivity in the world that will increasing value the conservation of resources.","We excel at delivering energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing food waste, preserving natural resources and generating productivity for our customers. It\u2019s what we do and it\u2019s what we\u2019re known for. We maintain a healthy level investment in our businesses to sustain leading brands, which are number one or number two in virtually every market in which we participate.","Second, we excel at delivering strong top line incremental margins and free cash flow through our business operating system. Our business operating system is continuously improving and underpins everything that we do. It enables us to consistently generate high levels of free cash flow, which powers our dynamic capital allocation strategy. One example of our capital allocation strategy is the acquisition we entered into this week that strengthens our telematics portfolio, an important component of our connected technology strategy. Sue will cover this within topics of interest later in our call.","Our year-to-date results continue a strong track record of performance and position us well for a solid finish 2017 and strong momentum going into 2018 Sue will discuss the details of the quarter in a few minutes. So, I\u2019d like to turn my attention to discussing where we are at this stage in the year and how we\u2019re thinking about key aspects of our business going forward.","Moving to Slide 4, we\u2019re going to follow the format we started last quarter and discuss how 2017 is shaping up relative to our expectations, so you\u2019ll get a feel for how the landscape is evolving. I\u2019ll touch on some of the areas that may read through to 2018, as we are in the midst of our 2018 planning now, but I want to be clear upfront that will get 2018 guidance with our Q4 earnings call. So I\u2019m not going to go into any specific detail on targets at this time.","I know 2018 is on many investors minds, but it\u2019s important for us to complete our planning process noted provide you with the high quality of discussion on 2018 that we all expect. The key areas that are most important to investors in order to keep the discussion focused, so if we don\u2019t hit something here, we\u2019ll cover it in the Q&A session.","The first point I\u2019ll make is probably the most important. We are on track to deliver against the revenue, adjusted EPS, free cash flow and capital allocation guidance that we set out at the beginning of the year. We're using all the tools in our business operating system to get there, and given evolving market dynamics, it is a bit different than what we envision when we gave guidance back in January. I\u2019m proud of the way our team has pulled together in some challenging market conditions to achieve these goals, which should yield strong revenue growth of about 4.5%, 9% EPS growth, and free cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion.","In 2017, orders and revenues have been consistently strong. Our end markets on balance have been solid. The outlook for the market continues to be healthy looking into 2018. Our HVAC businesses are performing well with strong order and margin expansion in 2017. Our transport business is demonstrating the resiliency we expect with the modest decline in revenues and margins despite challenging markets.","Our industrial business is recovering nicely with order growth in margin expansion ahead of our expectations. There are a lot of things working well for us. One area that we\u2019re not satisfied with and we expect to improve on in 2018 is our operating leverage. Our business model is rooted in our ability to drive margin expansion in low growth environments and we did not make enough progress expanding our incremental margins for the enterprise in 2017.","We were negatively impacted by a few key factors in 2017 including higher than expected and persistent inflation, mix of business as we\u2019ve penetrated underserved commercial HVAC markets most notably in China, which at present carry a lower gross margins in our portfolio average but still are accretive to our EPS.","This business is particularly accretive when you add in the highly profitable service tails from applied equipment sales in the mid-to long-term. The way our bridges and price versus class are compiled, the impact of moving into these newer markets shows up its price although some would probably categorize this as business mix. Rather than to confuse anybody, we\u2019ve kept the designation in price consistent for all of 2017, but I believe it is worth noting this distinction as it has a pronounced impact in how our price versus cost spread shows up in the bridge.","We\u2019re seeing better than expected success in these markets in China with approximately 20% order growth year-to-date and low 30s order growth in the third quarter. This is for the increased pressure on climate and enterprise margins as China is experiencing impacts of both negative price and inflation rather than the majority of our businesses are seeing positive price. We\u2019re in the process of developing our 2018 operating plan and we\u2019re focused on accelerating productivity initiatives to drive higher leverage in 2018 and beyond. Increased focus here will drive more direct controls of the margin expansion irrespective of market conditions.","We also see inflation moderating in 2018, as we begin to lap the inflation we saw throughout 2017, so we should see reduced headwinds here. Similarly on the China market penetration strategy, we begin to lap the lower gross margins for those markets in 2018, so we anticipate the pressure on leverage in the region moderating as well.","Moving through the update, year-to-date our end markets continue to perform well with strong broad-based orders and revenue growth. Our outlook is for end markets to remain healthy to at least 2018. Execution across the business continues to be solid. The tragic unprecedented natural disasters in the third quarter took a toll on our 750 associates in Puerto Rico, our customers and more broadly on our markets. Our thoughts are with our employees, their families of all lives that are impacted by these terrible tragedies.","Financially, these natural disasters had an impact on us in the third quarter. We estimate that the impact was between $0.04 to $0.05 of EPS, when we take into the account downtime at out Thermo King Puerto Rico manufacturing facility, the disaster release funds we provided to our sister employees, and the three days of lost sales in productivity in two of our large HVAC markets in Florida and Houston.","Slide 6 lays out the main impacted areas and Sue will cover these in more detail in a few minutes. We think we\u2019ll see some recovery in the fourth quarter and in 2018, and likely it will be additional market activities over the next one or three years as building occurs in the effected geographies.","So as laid out earlier, the impact of our strategy to compete in new markets in Asia and the Middle East is driving exceptional growth for us in these markets, but the impact to leverage the price versus cost equation was significant in the quarter. Again, we see these areas improving as we move into 2018, that\u2019s we lap 2017 inflation and gross margin headwinds. We are also driving aggressive productivity plans for 2018 to expand margins.","The next topic is on price versus cost, as we see at this stage in the year. Things are shaping up fairly consistent with what we expected coming out of the second quarter earnings call, pricing remains positive in both climate and industrial. The areas that are impacting our price versus cost equation across both climate and at the enterprise level are predominantly emanating from Asia into lesser extent to Middle East, as we previously outlined. With regard to our industrial segment, this segment has been performing well in 2017 and ahead of our expectations. We\u2019ve seen strong bookings growth and margin expansion in the segment.","In the last topic, there is an update on our climate businesses broadly. Commercial HVAC equipment businesses remain strong with high single-digit order growth in Q3. Our commercial pipeline and outlook continues to have healthy markets going forward. Our Residential and Transport outlooks are also on track with our expectations. Focused execution of our strategy will deliver strong performance overtime and we\u2019re excited about the opportunities that lie ahead in 2018 and beyond. So, hope that this is giving you some important insights into how our outlook has evolved through this point in the year.","And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Sue, to discuss the third quarter in more detail.","Sue Carter","Thank you, Mike. Please go to Slide number 5. I\u2019d like to begin with the summary of main points to take away from today\u2019s call. As Mike discussed, we drove solid operating and financial results in the third quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.44, despite business disruptions from natural disasters in the quarter negatively impacting results by approximately $0.04 to $0.05 per share. Our adjusted tax rate was 17.7% driven by the timing of the number of tax planning related discrete items that hit in the third quarter that were expected in the second half of 2017.","We continue to expect our full year 2017 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 21% or the lower end of our previous range. Bookings growth was strong with growth in both segments and in every strategic business unit. On the climate side, organic bookings were up mid single-digits in both commercial HVAC and Transport and up low single digits in residential with another quarter of share gains.","We also drove high-teens commercial organic bookings growth in Asia and Europe, Middle East and Africa. Climate organic revenues were also higher, up 3% in the quarter. Our industrial segment continues on the path of steady improvement and is actually performing a bit better than our guidance with strong organic bookings growth of 5% overall.","Compression Technologies had growth across small and medium compressors and particular strength in large compressors. We also drove a 90 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margins on essentially flat revenues. Flat revenues were also better than our expectations given to compares versus Q3 of 2016 as we discussed on our second quarter call.","In January, we laid out our capital allocation priorities for 2017 including spending approximately $430 million on dividends and an additional $1.5 billion on a combination of share buybacks and acquisitions, and we\u2019re on track to achieve those priorities. We also discussed our objectives to grow our dividend at or above the rate of our earnings growth.","In August, we\u2019ve raised our dividend by 12.5% to an annualized rate of $1.80 per share. Year-to-date through October, we\u2019ve spent $1 billion on share buybacks and $318 million in dividends. We also spent or entered into commitments for approximately $200 million in acquisitions","Please go to Slide 6. During the third quarter, we saw positive and negative financial impacts from natural disasters, primarily the hurricanes that hit the Caribbean, Florida and Texas. We saw increased commercial rental activity and increased part sales in the third quarter, offsetting the positive financial impacts shipments for transport in our Puerto Rico facility, residential and small electric vehicles were also delayed and our businesses were down for several days resulting in low absorption productivity and other additional costs.","We expect to regain some of the deferred business in the fourth quarter and we are currently assessing the potential impacts for 2018. If the recovery from these storms follows past experience, we\u2019d expect to see an overall strengthening in the underlying markets in the impacted overtime whether that a spike of activity in any given month.","Please go on to Slide number 7. The focused execution of our business strategy underpinned by our business operating system enabled us to drive solid year-over-year financial performance. Organic revenue and adjusted earnings per share increased 2%. Adjusted operating margins declined 40 basis points year-over-year, impacted by the $0.04 to $0.05 earnings per share headwind from natural disasters.","As Mike discussed earlier, our strategy of penetrating very large underserved markets in China in commercial HVAC is resulting in strong bookings growth with China commercial HVAC up low 20% year-to-date and up low 30% in Q3. In the short term, the negative impact of this growth is approximately 55 basis points of margin contraction at the enterprise level in Q3, although still accretive to our earnings per share year-to-date and it is expected to represent 75% of the negative price cost spread for the full year 2017.","Please go to Slide number 8. As we\u2019ve discussed, organic orders were strong in the third quarter with increased activity in both our Climate and Industrial businesses. Organic Commercial HVAC bookings were up mid single digits. Q3 2017 North America bookings were up low single digits. Outside of North America Commercial HVAC bookings were broad-based with high-teens growth in EMEA and Asia and mid-teens growth in Latin America.","Transport organic bookings were up mid single digits with gains in North America, Latin America and Asia. Bookings growth span the product portfolio with gains in trailer, truck, bus, aftermarket APU and marine. Industrial organic bookings were up 5% in the quarter with growth to cost all industrial businesses, regionally North America and Asia bookings gains were offset by declines in Latin America and Europe, Middle East and Africa.","Please go to Slide number 9. In our Climate segment, organic revenue was up low single digits in North America, up mid single digits in Europe, and up low teens in Asia. Globally, equipment was up low single digits and aftermarket was up mid single digits. In our Industrial segment, organic revenue was down 1%, we have large compressor shipments in Q3 of 2016 that did not repeat this year.","Regionally, we saw a low single digit growth in North America and Latin America. In our compression technology business, North America was up low single digits in parts and services. Industrial products were up mid single digits and Club Car had high single digit growth with continued success in on more personnel vehicles. Overall, North America and international revenues were up low single digit, netting a 2% organic growth rate for the enterprise.","Please go to Slide number 10. Q3 adjusted operating margin declined 40 basis points primarily driven by volume, productivity improvements and positive price more than offset by natural disasters as previously discussed and material inflation including the negative impact of price versus cost largely driven by our penetration of underserved markets in China and competitive pricing in the Middle East.","The impact of China and Middle East were greater than we anticipated earlier in the year driven by high volumes and forecast and higher than expected material inflation, which widened the negative price cost spread. Outside of these markets, the price versus cost spread was largely in line with our expectations.","Please go to Slide 11. We covered the main points from this slide on prior slides. Performance in the quarter was strong on bookings in revenues. Excluding the natural disaster impacts in climate, margins would have been roughly flat. Margin declined largely attributable to our China strategy and the negative price versus cost spread in the Middle East which combined or approximately negative 65 basis points.","Please go to Slide 12. We\u2019ve also covered the highlights of this slide on prior slide. Our industrial business continues to outperform our expectations and deliver strong improvement in bookings and margins un-relatively flat revenues. Our continued focus on improving the fundamental operation of the business is yielding as a result.","Please go to Slide 13. Free cash flow was $408 million for the third quarter driven largely by strong profits. Working capital as a percentage of revenue remains on track to our expectations for 2017. Our guidance for free cash flow remains unchanged at $1.2 billion. Additionally, our balance sheet continues to strengthen which provide optionality as our markets continue to revolve.","Please go to Slide 14. Continued strong cash flows in 2017 is powering our dynamic capital allocation strategy, employing capital where it earns the best returns. In January, we made out our 2017 capital allocation priorities and they remain unchanged. Our first priority is making high ROI investments in our business to drive productivity and to maintain our product leadership position.","The second area is maintaining a strong balance sheet with BBB ratings and healthy optionalities as our markets evolve. The third quarter areas are commitment to paying a highly competitive reliable dividend that grows at or above the rate of earnings growth overtime. The fourth priority is strategic acquisitions and share repurchases. In January of this year, we committed to spend $1.5 billion between these two areas and we\u2019re on track to achieve these commitments.","Year-to-date, we\u2019ve spent approximately $1 billion on share repurchases and approximately $200 million has been spent or committed to acquisition. By the end of 2017, we expect to have approximately $400 million to $500 million spent or committed for acquisitions. As we look forward to 2018 and beyond, our overarching strategy and priority remain the same.","Please go to Slide 15. For 2017, we\u2019re maintaining our revenue, earnings per share and cash flow guidance. For modeling purposes, we also wanted to provide tax rate guidance which should come in at the lower end of our previous range or approximately 21%. For the full year, we expect fully diluted share to approximate 258 million based on share repurchases in 2017.","Please go to Slide 17. We\u2019ve received positive feedback on the section covering key topics we know of interest to you in our prepared remarks. So, I\u2019ll cover a few of these topics on the next couple of slides. The first topic is HVAC order growth in the third quarter. Our HVAC markets remain very healthy. In the third quarter, orders were higher in all of our major geographic regions. We had especially strong order growth in overseas markets up by high teens.","North America commercial HVAC continued to see good order growth against difficult comparisons with 2016. Residential HVAC order also improved compared with record activity last year and the business continues its steady market share improvement.","Please go to Slide 18. The last topic for today is the acquisition pipeline. As previously discussed, we\u2019re expecting to close on or have signed agreements on approximately $400 million to $500 million in acquisitions in 2017. We are focused on channel and technology investments that add to our existing core businesses.","Most recently, we entered into an agreement a telematics company. This acquisition will complement our 2015 acquisition of Celtrak and allow us to expand our expertise in telematics in addition to the many services it already provides for our small electric vehicles business today.","Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Mike.","Mike Lamach","Thank you, Sue. So on closing on Slide 19, we expect to deliver our 2017 plan for revenue growth, adjusted EPS and free cash flow, utilizing our business operating system and building a thriving, more valuable Ingersoll-Rand.","To summarize, our Climate segment remains strong, led by our Commercial and Residential HVAC businesses which have focused on growth areas with equipment, controls and service. Our Transport Refrigeration business is diverse and agile and is executing their strategy and delivering against the high expectations in a challenging market. Our Industrial business is improving ahead of our expectations for growth and margin expansion.","75% of our negative price versus cost spread in 2017 is expected to come from very strong growth in Asia from merely China. We expect both the inflation and pricing headwind to moderate heading into 2018. The balance of the markets should see moderating inflation in 2018 as well, as they lap 2017 inflation.","Nonetheless, we\u2019re accelerating our 2018 productivity initiatives to drive more directly control over margin expansion irrespective of market conditions. We\u2019re also on track to achieve the capital allocations priorities we laid out at the beginning of 2017. We expect to deploy roughly $1.9 billion of cash in the form dividends, buyback and acquisitions.","We have a tremendous depth of talented people and our culture remains strong as ever. And taking together, I\u2019m confident that with this formula we'll continue to deliver top tier financial and operating performance.","And with that, Su and I will now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Your line is open.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Mike, you gave a lot of color on your price versus cost issues and you talked about how most of the issues were emanating from China and the Middle East. I know you don\u2019t want to give detail on 2018, but as you kind of shift the overall company to little more these longer cycle applied HVAC orders especially in international markets. How difficult do you think it will be to get your arms around price versus cost? And what could you do specifically on these regions where competitions are significant and inflations still reasonably high?","Mike Lamach","Andy, I think maybe it\u2019s best for us to start with what is our China strategy historically and how we're evolving. And I think that will answer a lot of questions for you. First of all, China is a country and Asia is a region would have some of the highest operating margin that we have across the HVAC space still today even this quarter. Historically, we\u2019ve been a Tier 1 and Tier 2 city focus company and largely on applied equipment, and we\u2019ve been very successful there. We\u2019ve penetrated those markets with very high share and often train as a basis of design in many of these projects.","What we\u2019ve done over the last two years and you\u2019re seeing it this year in space as we\u2019ve extended to Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities. We\u2019ve also launched both localized ducted and ductless unitary product nationally. We\u2019ve penetrated and are penetrating larger infrastructure projects in subways and airports, and the electronic verticals specifically which is applied. And those three things in Tier 3, Tier 4 cities help drive train as a basis of design in those cities as well. It\u2019s been a formula that we follow for years and it\u2019s been very successful for us.","We know that that grow as a large service tail and we know that we grow our margins by leveraging the SG&A and manufacturing base around that. So, to put into context, the strategy has been very successful. We put a PGT in place about two years. We fully localized product portfolio. In unitary duct to ductless, we\u2019ve been there and applied sometime. We added a 178 selling and marketing people onto the street over the last 12 months. And a 165 of those, we put in just since January.","So, the project pipeline we\u2019re seeing in China is up 211%, so just speaks for clearly it\u2019s three times larger than what it would have been last year at the same time around that pipeline. So year-to-date, we\u2019ve seen bookings growth in unitary, it\u2019s actually been 40% plus. We\u2019ve had mid 20s revenue growth unitary. Unitary is now 25% of the mix that we have in the equipment in China. We\u2019ve also then able to grow the apply business of twice the market margin rate year-to-date and we\u2019re seeing excellence service growth.","So, again, it\u2019s become so successful that it really is -- we classified as price, but we\u2019re growing this accretively to the Company. And long-term is the right and most successful strategy that we know how to conduct. By the way, we would have a similar strategy -- there are nuances to what we will be doing in Europe or Latin America. But every region of the world, it's got a unique strategy and China has just been very successful for us.","Andrew Kaplowitz","That\u2019s helpful color. And then just shifting gears to the North American Commercial HVAC booking. They were up low single digits against a tough comp as you talk about it. I think it's going to result compared to last quarter, but can you give us a little more color regarding what you\u2019re seeing in the overall North American HVAC market? It's been slowing like unitary. When you talk about applied HVAC improving there, do you still see a good runway in applied HVAC so North American Commercial HVAC booking should be up low single digits are better moving forward?","Mike Lamach","Yes, I would say first to the starting point, nothing has changed that would make us less bullish in the end markets than we were five years ago when we talked everybody at Analyst Day. Outlook continues to be very positive that we see continued five months ago. Low single digits to mid single digit growth in North America commercial and that we\u2019re going to drive share gains. Our project pipeline is actually stronger today than it was last year at the same time. We also think inflation in 2018 is fairly consistent with what we expected five months ago.","We think it's going to be much more copper related which is much easier for us to set pricing and costs into the factories about how to price and the cover that as opposed to steel, which is very difficult on the longer lead items. So, we think that would be more manageable for us. So saying with where we\u2019re five months ago, the CAGR of 4% to 4.5% that was a three year period, 11% to 13% EPS growth over that period would still very much encourage for us. We\u2019re very confident about that what they\u2019ve done in the fourth quarter.","But a lot of that\u2019s underpinned that we\u2019re seeing strength not only in North America but across the globe and you\u2019re seeing that in even Latin America. Sue pointed out, mid teens growth rate in Latin America finally seeing some recovery there. And don\u2019t forget that\u2019s an important market for us too, that\u2019s a $0.5 billion in revenue in the climate space for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Nigel Coe","Hey, Mike. I just want to go back and visit the price cost. So, the 55 bps impact from Asia and Middle East you called out, so just give me your comments on China. Is that more accurately a mix impact as opposed to price cost impact?","Mike Lamach","Yes, Nigel, it\u2019s a very specific definition we use and we say that if it's equipment coming out of the factory using, the same machine and assembly processes, that we mark that as price. But clearly what you\u2019re seeing in Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities is even more discontented product, and you\u2019re seeing that generally those have done some of the local players that have done that market. So, it is max more than its price, but again for consistency of what we\u2019ve been talking about, we classify on the bridges prices just to keep it sort of straight for everybody at this point in time. But it is something that if you move past China, you look at say res for example.","On the residential North American business, we grew margins considerably, we grew share considerably and we\u2019re managing that. If you go to the balance of the commercial business that\u2019s excluding the Middle East and Asia, but largely covering inflation there, and of course from the industrial side we\u2019re covering inflation there completely. So, it is really isolated to this penetration we\u2019re seeing in China. Middle East is a bit different. Here you've just this fact that you\u2019ve got the same number of competitors fighting over fewer projects there. And so, you\u2019re going to have a bit more competition there as well.","Nigel Coe","Okay.","Mike Lamach","In 2018, I think that we\u2019re clear that we\u2019ve got a moderating steel environment. We\u2019ve got a copper environment that we can lock a good portion with understanding at the beginning of the year. We feel like generally speaking, it\u2019s a more manageable year in terms of the global material inflation, pricing scenario. And specific to Asia, it\u2019s really a matter of just getting scale on some of these, Tier 3, Tier 4 cities, getting additional service density in these cities. And we know how to grow margins from there. So, again it\u2019s a long-term view towards China. I think we\u2019ve seen improvement in 2018 in China leverage.","Nigel Coe","Right. Okay. But, if you have to think about maybe just moving away from China because obviously that\u2019s -- it\u2019s kind of good problem to have, if you go into that kind of rates. But, if you think about North America, Europe, if you think about the pendulum of the competition and pricing, is it becoming more competitive, less competitive about balance? I mean, how would you say that pendulum is shifting?","Mike Lamach","Yes, there is nothing structurally different about the competition in these markets. We\u2019ve had high-teens growth before in Europe. We\u2019ve had substantial growth in Europe over the last few years. It\u2019s really about new product introduction around next generating refrigerants, building out of controls portfolio or wireless portfolio or double-digit growth there, more digital involvements in connecting our businesses remotely, more service feet on the street.","So, it\u2019s always been a competitive environment, but you are able to differentiate that business on total cost of ownership which is 90% of that equation is not the initial cost, it\u2019s -- the energy efficiency in the maintenance and the liability to product over the long haul, and nothing has changed about our value proposition there at all.","Sue Carter","And Nigel, it's Sue. Let me add a little bit of color on the pricing to that, I think it is important and it really doesn\u2019t come out in all the detail that we\u2019ve got. So, we talked about the prices actually positive in both of the segments which it is. The other piece there is that the pricing that we have achieved in the year eventually higher than last year.","Again, we know the inflationary pressures that we\u2019ve got, but we have really been able to build positive pricing in the areas of the world. And in total, it is positive in a dollar terms on a year-over-year basis and it\u2019s fairly significant. And it does have the headwind and there aren\u2019t price from Asia. So, I don\u2019t want anyone to think that the pricing is actually not strong and that we haven\u2019t achieved pricing in 2017, we acutely have and it\u2019s actually stronger than it was in 2016.","Nigel Coe","That\u2019s an important point, thanks Sue. And just to follow on SG&A, you talked about G&A as an important area of productivity improvement. And Mike in the PR, you talked about ramping up productivity to offset some of these price material pressures. If we delineate between the S and G&A in that 5% inflation, are we starting to see the G&A good news coming through? But they're masked by some of the sales investments, so is that on the come?","Mike Lamach","Yes, relatively to 2018, Nigel. I will tell you that we\u2019re going to generate $300 million plus in productivity like we do every year. It\u2019s going to be direct material, it\u2019s going to be PGT led with engineering and product management and operations, that will be both direct and indirect in that regard. I think what\u2019s going to be different for us as we spent a couple of quarters in excruciating detail understanding the G&A and sort of benchmarks and ideas around reducing G&A across the Company, which will show up strict on the G&A line overtime between 2018 and 2020 over a multi-year period, certainly starting in 2018 will have an impact.","We also see opportunities with a lot of what we\u2019ve done around automation in lien around things like warehouse consolidations and logistics opportunities that we are able to take advantage. I think, yes, we\u2019ll start to see those in 2018 as well. So, what I\u2019m saying in addition to the normal high levels of productivity that we'd expect in the operating system, there are couple of projects that literally we\u2019re having to build program offices, and [succumb] very talented people into the program office to be able to drive, what\u2019s likely to be hundreds of projects that roll up into these two bigger ideas. But I think that we get more leverage in \u201918, \u201919 and \u201820 from those things. and I\u2019m pretty excited about it. We talked about at your conference in fact and I\u2019m glad you asked me the question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Steve Tusa","On the commercial side, last quarter you had mentioned the unitary markets on that slide as growing. What are you seeing in those markets? And ahead of this kind of regulatory transition in 2018, do you expect any kind of pre-buy? And then just what\u2019s your outlook for kind of the core unitary markets going forward?","Mike Lamach","Yes, growth again in North America, you know in the quarter nice growth in the quarter there. So, I don\u2019t anticipate a pre-buy there for say. There could be some, I mean it will be great if there was, but we don\u2019t anticipate much of one at this point in time. But we are going to be sure that we\u2019ve built inventory and that we\u2019re talking to customers about what is stackable and in fact if they want to take that on.","Steve Tusa","Okay, great. And then in residential, you guys also mentioned for the first time channel at least relative to last quarter. What do you -- I\u2019ve heard from the channel that you guys are kind of building out a bit of these store fronts like Lennox has. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s kind of an ongoing strategy that you\u2019ve been just doing under the radar that you haven\u2019t talked about a lot. Maybe if you could give us some clarity on what exactly you\u2019re doing in the channel outside of the digital stuff that you\u2019ve already mentioned maybe different relative to last year and the year before that?","Mike Lamach","Yes, thanks Steve. We\u2019ve got about 260 part stores today. Generally speaking, we\u2019ve got them where we want them. We were adding up through last year but we\u2019ve got the coverage we generally need, and we\u2019re finding opportunities to transition some of that digitally. So, it doesn't all have to be brick-and-mortar but there are 260 brick-and-mortar stores that are out there. What you\u2019re finding on unitary books rather than commercial now is, there is this past year in particular much more of a bias with customers replacing than repairing. So, I do think that, that's put a little bit of pressure on mix. But for the right reason, you\u2019re really seeing people at this point in time doing wholesale replacements.","Sue Carter","And Steve, I would also point out that in the context of our parts stores, the 260 that Mike mentioned that stores both commercial and the residential markets for as. And in fact, the commercial is a little heavier than residential in terms of overall sales for those parts stores.","Mike Lamach","And as you know, Steve, a lot of contractors don't identify themselves as one or the other.","Sue Carter","Right.","Mike Lamach","So, it makes sense that we'd say one presence to our customers.","Steve Tusa","That makes sense. And how fast this one last question -- how fast did that grow like over the last couple of years? What was -- how many I guess did you add in 2016 just a reference point?","Mike Lamach","Yes, a 1,000 maybe and see, we\u2019ve been working at that for a long time. That\u2019s not -- this hasn\u2019t been something that you'd pull out of our company is being the large mover and shaker around the business. But, they are an important part of the business and we\u2019ve got a 260 to coverage we think we need.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Rich Kwas","Mike, just want to just get your thoughts on, as we big picture as we think of mix within climate for next year. You\u2019ve had very strong growth on the order side in China, you\u2019ve talked about the price that the mix headwind there that brings lower growth in the developed markets. How does that shape up as we think about a normal incremental margin for climate particularly in comparison to this year? Do we get -- do you think you get back into that 25%, 30% on a year-over-year basis with some of the initiatives you in place and given the mix changing?","Mike Lamach","Yes, I have no doubt Rich, but the planning we'll do for 2018 will have us coming back to more normalized leverage in that business. And we\u2019ve built a portfolio that should be agnostic to the product specifically. I mean as you know applied has got a little lower margin, but great service base over the long period of time. And unitary gives you a little bit of the margin pop sooner, but this is not happening in the world and an up growth in the world that I expect again good growth in 2018.","The pipeline supports that. We think we\u2019ve got a more manageable mix of inflation moving from steel to copper, easier to get on top of that from a pricing perspective. So -- and then the question I answered to the Nigel last, if we can do a bit more around some of the rooftop consolidation a bit more around the G&A leverage in the Company, no doubt that will get back to where we\u2019ve historically been.","Rich Kwas","And then just on, as we think about the institutional given you\u2019ve seen some path micro wise, some moving numbers here with regard to forward indicator given Dodge and ABI et cetera. But generally moving in the right direction, I know you've emphasized no change versus five months ago earlier in the call, but just within the mix of the business. How do you think about that shaping up this year in terms of higher growth rate potentially for 2018 versus 2017 and the impact on the margin? I think you've touched on applied being lower margin, but is that meaningful enough to impact overall incrementals and how much would it be offset on the top line with regards to\u2026","Mike Lamach","Yes. So, one of the issues in top I know from an analyst to investors perspective is to take that Dodge where ABI data. And about it you can do is to take that phase value. But, I\u2019ve always said that Dodge data would really account for about 50% of what we consider to be the market, the visible market would be would Dodge is reporting about 50% -- frankly for the good 50% is the negotiated piece of that -- the negotiated retrofit of the performance contracting side of that. And that\u2019s where we\u2019ve got the added benefit of looking at a pipeline and those pipelines are well done. It\u2019s a process that we\u2019ve been running in our company for a long time. It\u2019s a high level of confidence about what gets reported in there and how we assign close rates and probability to those projects.","And so, when I look at, what I see for 2018, I see a good runway and good projects. There is a number of very large projects that have the possibility of going in 2018 for us, that we generally wouldn\u2019t put into a forecast. We generally wouldn\u2019t even put into our guidance. But similar to what happened in 2016, we\u2019re at historic \u201917 a little bit for us, we\u2019re going to have a little bit of that 2018 as well. These projects will range from $50 million to $200 million apiece, and so they\u2019re going to move the numbers a great deal up in fact they hit. But excluding those, we see a strong pipeline including those, there is a very strong pipeline.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Julian Mitchell","Maybe just switching to the industrial segment for a change. So compression tech you had pretty good equipment orders growth in the last say three quarters. The sales though have been down substantially in the equipment year-to-date. So I just wondered within compression tech, how we think about the conversion of that order number into different revenues and when we should start to see the equipment revenue line accelerate?","Mike Lamach","One really good data point for us that I\u2019ll tell you on this call is that you know we\u2019re very indexed towards very large compressors. We\u2019re number one is centrifugal compression technology in that space. And of course you know that that carries 40 to 50% pull-through on service along with that overtime. And that has grown in the mid-20s, booking growth during the year, and it grew in the mid-20s again in the third quarter. So we\u2019re feeling good about what that means for 2018 shipments and even beginning to formulate early 2019 shipments around some of the larger compressors. So that\u2019s an exciting change for us as it relates to backlog being built in large compressors, and it's exciting that it relates to the kind of leverage we expect to see from that.","Julian Mitchell","Understood. Thank you. And then just circling back on the productivity and other inflation line in your margin bridge. You know historically in years when that have been good, it was about a 100 basis points tailwind 2012 or 2014, 2015 when you\u2019re talking about more aggressive measures on productivity for next year. Is that the type of tailwind you think that we should expect about a 100 bps from that line?","Mike Lamach","Julian, without setting guides being carefully here. That\u2019s sort of the general theme about how we think about setting plans would be to have about 100 bps of positive spread there. And then I take you back to my boxer analogy and that works great sitting in November and December, and then as you get into January and take a punch to figure out how do you use all the tools at your disposals to win the fight. So that would be our sort of going in idea, and then we want to make sure we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re putting some additional levers in place around ideas like rooftop consolidation in G&A that would be additive to that. Our in the event of that inflation, our pricing wouldn\u2019t behave the way we expect it to. We\u2019ve got some additional counter measures in place.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Jeff Sprague","Mike, I want to come back just a little bit again to China and just the maturation as its Tier 3 and Tier 4 strategy. Just a couple of points I\u2019m interested in. Where are you on product development for those companies -- for those cities? I am sorry. You mentioned de-contenting product to serve those markets. You have a product refresh or product redesign that needs to happen that kind of effectively address this. And also I\u2019m just wondering, you\u2019ve talked about the opportunity for service capture. What kind of service capture are you actually seeing in those markets?","Mike Lamach","Yes. And to be clear, Jeff, we\u2019ve got all of the product now in the market place, the ducted and ductless and applied and controls in the marketplace. So, we\u2019re fully functional there. What will happen is, we'll get certain feature sets there are often specified by others into the Tier 3, Tier 4 cities. You got and you try to explain the value and the total cost of ownership around that and overtime, we\u2019re pretty successful with that. But initially, you tend to find feature side that carry lower margins and perhaps something you'd find in Beijing and Shanghai typically.","In fact, the product development going on now around the unitary space, if you take the unitary product that we have and actually go the other way with that, which is some high efficiency unitary coming back in Tier 1, Tier 2 cities around that. And again this is all in the commercial space, not on the residential space at all. So, it\u2019s a very thoughtful strategy overtime about putting manufacturing product management operation in place, product growth teams, feet on the street, incrementally quite a few as a result of all this. And then excellent execution on the ground by the team there, to the point where you just don\u2019t forecast for 40% plus growth rate as you\u2019re doing your plans.","You set goals and objectives around those sort of things, but you don't sort of plan those things, but the team has generated sort of -- they\u2019ve been on top of even though stretch goals, which to me is really solid execution. In the long run, it\u2019s building out a strong base and it\u2019s not changed, but half of the world\u2019s chillers and the last five years have gone in the China, half the world is chillers going to go in China in the next five years. And it makes sense like it does everywhere for us to have a full unitary, applied, controls, service and digital footprint and for that to be direct on the commercial side. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.","Jeff Sprague","And on the service capture side of thing, how is that playing out?","Mike Lamach","Yes. When I look back to 2008, 2009, it would have been in that 10% range compared to North America or Western Europe 50%. Today, it\u2019s in that 20%, 25% range, and it will continue to move up, and over the next say 5 to 10 years look alike Western Europe and North America no doubt about that.","The equipments get more sophisticated, customers expectations around energy efficiency and around sustainability goals in China much more stringent than they have been in the past. All those things really lead more towards the OEM having the advantage in maintaining the equipment.","Jeff Sprague","How much actual physical capacity are you needing to add to accomplish this? I mean there is certainly concerns that there is just excess manufacturing capacity in the space fairly your winning orders and growing your business and therefore they need some. But, how do you balance that risk reward?","Mike Lamach","Yes, we don\u2019t have to need to build the additional factories in Asia. We\u2019ve got a substantial footprint today and we continue to lien it out. So, we\u2019re -- lines are running are faster and less space. And the more scale we get the faster we can run the lines and hypothetically the less space per dollar of margin we\u2019re going to need. So, I don\u2019t have the plan thus needing to build the factory in China at any point in the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Joe Ritchie","So maybe going back to price for a second. We heard from Watsco this morning that some of its vendors were starting to advertise the pricing increases in the fourth quarter. Are you guys trying to pull forward price in 4Q? Or should we think about that as being like typical like 1Q type event?","Sue Carter","No, I mean, Joe, I think we follow our normal cadence some of which might be in the fourth quarter and some in the first quarter, but there is no discussion that we\u2019re having about pulling any of that forward on a different schedule than normal.","Mike Lamach","And Joe just to confirm, price and res is exceeding material inflation, and we grew margins again in the quarter. The hurricane impact to us was not in the res space, and in res space, we were able to move inventory into the market and we\u2019re well positioned there. The impact for us was really losing three weeks of time in Puerto Rico at the manufacturing facility.","And they are just to skip to it, it wasn\u2019t the factory itself, we had the factory up and running with our own temporary power with plenty of diesel, plenty of water. It was the fact that it was so difficult for our employees in the market that many of them who lost the home, lost everything, will just enable to come to work or didn\u2019t have the means to come to work to be able to build products.","So we\u2019re back up, we've been back up for couple of weeks, we\u2019re running at rate where we haven\u2019t missed a beat in terms of customers there. We plan ahead to build for hurricanes in advance and so we have stock there just waiting for the ports to open up a little bit to shift them back out. But just to skip to that, it really wasn\u2019t our res business for us and it\u2019s largely in the thermochem business.","Joe Ritchie","That\u2019s helpful color, Mike. Maybe my follow-up here and this is just perhaps refreshing my memory, but I thought you guys were targeting investments in the second half of the year that were roughly two times out of the first half. So, we were thinking it was going to be closer to like call it $40 million of spend in the second half. I think you did about 11 this quarter, so should we think about the fourth quarter as being pretty highly loaded with an uptick in investments or you\u2019re pulling back on spend a little bit?","Sue Carter","Joe, that\u2019s an interesting area. We are pulling back a little bit, but let me tell you how that\u2019s actually coming about because this is not Mike and I going out and saying, we need to cut investments. So, I would expect the fourth quarter to be a little higher than the third quarter, but no more near what the math would tell you that you would pull in, it's not 30 by any stretch. But our businesses as we closer to actually going through the projects that are in the investment.","And again our investments are mostly in new products development channel, and some IT type of investments are actually looking at the projects, and then return on those projects are not coming to the conclusion that the returns are not at the expectations that they have and we have as a company. And so, they\u2019re the ones pulling them off the table and perhaps going back to do some additional work on those business cases and maybe they'll show up again in 2018, but it\u2019s really SPU driven pulling down those investments in the back half of the year and we\u2019re very supportive of that on for those reasons.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Andrew Obin","Hey, just a question on sort of management succession. You\u2019ve had some recent changes at the top. I think some has been scheduled like Didier and Robert, but I think Gary Michel was probably not expected. Could you just tell us as to what this means about sort of operational directional of the Company this transition at the top? And what\u2019s happening with Gary\u2019s role? Thank you.","Mike Lamach","Yes, thanks Andy. It\u2019s a good probably opportunity to step back and talk about all the changes, some of which you mentioned and some that there\u2019ll be a good catch up on. Robert and Didier have been great partner to this company for a long time, both had plans for 2018 retirements, we begin to put pen and paper on January 2017, and we\u2019ve got Robert who will step out in January of 2018 and Didier in September of 2018. So, we\u2019re able to benefit from their involvement for some time yet.","At that point, we begin to plan and then early September, the 5th of September, we actually pointed Dave Regnery as the EVP combining those two roles. And really what\u2019s happened here is we\u2019ve had very strong consistent leadership at the SP level for now long time. We\u2019re not at the same place we were five years ago and so the role has changed and I\u2019ve got a lot of confidence in Dave and Dave\u2019s capability, 30 years for the Company, and obviously doing a great job with the HVAC business in North America and EMEA. Lived in different parts of the world and managed about every part of the Company at one point there or another.","At the same time, we put Dave in that role. We moved Donny Simmons into Dave\u2019s role. Now, Donny, you all would have met at our Investor Day. Donny was leading fluid, material, handling, power tools. He led a large part of the commercial North America and trained organization before that. Before that, he was in finance both the climate segment and going all the way back TK. So, Donny stepped into that role.","A couple of weeks later, Gary had announced his intention to retire from the Company at the end of September. Concurrent with Gary\u2019s announcement, we\u2019ve appointed Jason Bingham. Jason is the President for HVAC and Supply. He also spoke at the Analyst Conference, if you recall. Jason was running our controls contracting and digital business. It\u2019s been built into a $1 billion plus business for us overtime, and he\u2019s got a 26 years tenure with the Company going back to 1991, strong commercial, strong residential background. So, he is a fish in water, really in the res business.","And then, we had also the planned retirement of Marc Dufour. Marc runs our Club Car business and Marc is going to retire in January of 2018. So, we announced Marc's retirement around the same time, 36 years with us over that period of time. And Mark Wagner who you would have all again met at [indiscernible] Conference, Mark was one of the speakers there is running our Club Car for us.","So, it\u2019s really leveraging very strong total talent, very good communication by the senior executives in the Company around their succession plans and timing. The tremendous willingness with them to work with us around dates so that it could work for everybody and have a good continuity. We\u2019re very excited about the changes that we\u2019ve got and these guys have been in place now for a couple of months, good month at this point and its pretty exciting.","Andrew Obin","And just a follow-up question on cost and I apologize I\u2019m sort of beating the dead horse here. Just so we have slightly lower spent in the quarter, slightly lower investment spent than we\u2019re planning on. I would imagine that China and Middle East strategy, you know you\u2019ve had that for awhile. So I\u2019m just still sort of a little bit missing, why you\u2019re going with this earnings shortfall? Is it because sort of China and Middle East and that up being more expensive than we\u2019re expected? Or is there something else on top of that below the surface that was weaker than we expect? And I apologize if I missed it.","Mike Lamach","Yes, and if I put it really simply I would say that the Tier 3, Tier 4 strategy and some of the larger infrastructure projects are caring about five points lower gross margin. Let\u2019s say then the Tier 1, Tier 2 cities, historical applied market. And the fact that we\u2019ve grown that at a rate twice the rate of the other business has just put margin mix pressure there. And that again adding a 178 people into the mix, it takes awhile for those people to ramp up. But you know again 40 plus % growth rate sets the ramping up pretty quickly.","Sue Carter","And the other element, Andrew, is that. Asia, China specifically has had material inflation that has escalated throughout the year. So when we talk about that being persistent, it is very persistent in fact if I look at where biggest impact occurs, it\u2019s a commercial HVAC and North America followed by Asia Pacific followed by residential. So, they\u2019ve also had that headwind that was bigger than what we thought earlier in the year and that also contributes to that dynamic.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","James Picariello","Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for fit me in. This is James Picariello actually. So just on M&A, you mentioned 200 million commitment year-to-date, it looks like only 60 million has actually been spent. So, is it safe to assume that the telematics asset represents most of that difference? And then also, how do you bridge to this 4 to 500 million range? What\u2019s the timing between an actual agreement and close of the deal, so just trying to get a sense there? Thanks.","Mike Lamach","Yes, James I think we've closed four transaction or will close four transaction by the end of the month. So I wouldn\u2019t assume that all to be in the telematics space and that would have been the largest of the group. But the couple of 100 million is really laid out and will have that close by the end of the month. The balance of that is our best guess of stuff in flight of which I would say between $50 million and $200 million. There is a number of things in flight there that the timing could be off slightly, it could be a quarter off here or there, but those are lining up nicely as well to. And it ranges between, channel and technology being added to the core portfolio.","James Picariello","Okay. And then just last one on the Residential HVAC replacement opportunity. How has -- how have prior storms really pulled through that demand, and then typically over what timeframe? Just trying to get your early assessment of what the opportunity could be next year and maybe even beyond that? Thanks.","Mike Lamach","Yes, the commercial is a little easier to predict than res. Commercial, you can -- we can predict a great rental boom and followed by immediate service requirement and we put people into those locations to be able to provide service from out of states. And then depending upon the criticality of what it is that you\u2019re conditioning space for, those things move really quick.","Res, you got everything between the tip of the tail, which is people with insurance maybe a bit more fluent, who are able to step in very quickly without insurance and replace. You\u2019ve got actually the body of the bell curve which is folks are waiting for insurance that can take some time to process and it\u2019s probably at this point 2018 event, I should think about that.","And you\u2019ve got sort of other part of the bell curve, people without insurance that may not be able to step in and buy that as well. So, that will take one year to three years before that happens. So, generally over one year or two years, you see growth as a result of us, so the net of it usually growth, but it usually takes one year to two years for that to show up.","James Picariello","Thanks, guys.","Mike Lamach","On the res side -- on the res side that is, on the commercial side, it\u2019s quicker.","Operator","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Zac Nagle for closing remarks.","Zac Nagle","Great.

Our release also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables that are attached to our news release.","With me on the call this morning are Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO; Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Joe Fimbianti, Director of Investor Relations.","And with that, please go to Slide 3, and I'll turn it over to Mike.","Michael Lamach","Thanks, Janet. Good morning, and thanks for joining us. In the second quarter, our adjusted earnings per share were $1.20. We saw organic revenue growth of 3%, led by strength in the U.S. and European transport in commercial HVAC businesses. Industrial markets were weaker in the quarter, as distributors delayed restocking and some customers deferred purchase decisions. As a result organic revenue in industrial is down 4%.","Industrial revenue trends started out weak in quarter two, but strengthened in the last few weeks of the quarter. Not enough to fully recover within the quarter, but giving us some more positive trends going into the second half. Similarly, organic order rates softened in some markets, but remained healthy overall in the second quarter at 4%.","Adjusted operating margins were slightly down, but increased 50 basis points, excluding the impact of currency and the accounting impact of bringing Cameron and Frigoblock results into our financial statements for the first year. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was at our guidance midpoint, but there were some puts and takes and we did not perform to our expectations in terms of operating leverage and margin.","Revenues were approximately $100 million lower than the midpoint of our guidance forecast. On a percentage basis, we are looking organic growth of 5% to 6% as compared to the actual 3% growth rate for the quarter. Climate came in right on our revenue outlook, the difference was on industrial.","For industrial, organic revenues in Europe were down low-single digits, excluding currency. Asia continue to be weak. The U.S. seem to have taken a pause in April and May, and showed some signs of stabilization in June. North America was down 6% on an organic basic in industrial.","The earnings impact to the lower volume was offset by corporate spend controls and lower compensation and benefits as well as favorability and other income. We'll talk more about it in the outlook. We're taking aggressive and targeted cost actions, where we see volume weakness.","U.S. industrial trends improved in June and have continued thus far in July. So we are partially reflecting that stabilization in our outlook.","Before I turn over to Sue to take you through the quarter, we did reach an agreement with the IRS in mid-July to resolve all disputes related to intercompany debt and similar issues for the period 2002 to 2011. The details are in the 8-K, we filed a week ago, and Sue will take you through that in more detail today.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Sue. And then, I'll come back to take you through the outlook.","Susan Carter","Thank you, Mike. Before I go into details on the quarter, I wanted to take you through the reported versus adjusted results, given a larger difference due to the impact of the tax agreement.","On a reported basis, our continuing EPS was $0.31. To get to adjusted earnings per share, we're making three adjustments totaling $0.89, which we think are appropriate, given the nature of the items. First, the tax agreement resulted in a charged income tax expense equaling $0.84.","Second, as we guided all year, we are adjusting the inventory step up component of acquisitions. This now includes both Cameron and Frigoblock, but the great majority is Cameron. In total, that adjustment is $0.04 this quarter. And finally, we had $0.01 of restructuring in the second quarter. So that's the breakdown of the $0.89 to get you from reported continuing of $0.31 to the adjusted earnings per share of $1.20.","Now, let's go to Slide 4. Orders for the second quarter of 2015 were up 2% on a reported basis and up 6%, excluding currency. On an organic basis, which excludes both currency and acquisitions, orders were up 4%. Climate orders were up 3% and up 6%, excluding currency.","Orders in the industrial segment were down 1% on a reported basis and up 5%, excluding currency. Organic orders for industrial were down 1%. We saw organic orders decrease by low-single digits in the air and industrial product and improve by high-single digit in Club Car.","Let's go to Slide 5. If you look at the revenue trends by segment and region, the top-half of the chart shows revenue change for each segment. For the total company, second quarter revenues were up 2% versus last year on a reported basis and up 3% on an organic basis, which excludes both foreign exchange and acquisitions.","Climate revenues increased 2% on a reported basis and 5% on an organic basis. Industrial revenues were down 1% on a reported basis and down 4% organically. I'll give more color on each segment in the next few slides. The bottom chart shows revenue change on a geographic basis as reported and organic. Organic revenues were up 4% in the Americas; up 3% in Europe, Middle East and Africa, both led by strong HVAC and transport performance; and Asia was down 4%.","Let's go to Slide 6. This chart shows the change in operating margin from second quarter 2014 of 13.1% to second quarter 2015, which was 12.6% on a reported basis and 13% on an adjusted basis. Volume, mix and foreign exchange collectively were a 70 basis point headwind to operating margin versus prior year. Within that, about 40 points was from constant currency and about 30 points was from volume and mix.","Price and direct material inflation contributed 20 basis points to margin, with positive price and very little direct material inflation. Productivity versus other inflation was positive 90 basis points Year-over-year investments and other items were 90 basis points. That breaks into three pieces.","This is the first year in which Cameron is included in results, and as expected, impacted margins by 50 basis points due to inventory step-up and intangible amortization. In the box, you can see 30 basis points of headwind from investments and 10 basis points from higher restructuring costs. In the grey box at the top of the page, overall leverage on an adjusted basis was 10%. Backing out currency and acquisition, organic leverage was approximately 30%.","Now, let's go to Slide 7. The climate segment includes Trane commercial and residential HVAC, and Thermo King transport refrigeration. Total revenues for the second quarter were $2.8 billion. That is up 2% versus last year on a reported basis and up 6%, x currency.","Climate bookings were up 6%, excluding currency. Global HVAC orders, excluding currency, were up high-single digits with growth in all geographic regions, except Latin America, led by double-digit growth in North America. Thermo King orders were down slightly versus 2014 second quarter, excluding currency. Organic orders increased in North America and were down in Europe, Latin America and Asia.","Second quarter organic HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits, led by a mid-teens increase in the North American applied business. Excluding currency, HVAC revenues in North America increased by mid-single digits in the quarter compared with last year, and increased by a high-single digit percentage in Europe and Middle East.","The North American residential HVAC market continued an orderly transition to the new regional SEER standards. Weather impacted end-market demand in part of the quarter, but we saw positive trends in June and have been continuing in July. HVAC revenues, excluding currency, increased by a mid-single digits percentage in Latin America, as revenues in Asia were down by a low-single digit percentage in the second quarter compared with last year.","Thermo king revenues were up high-single digits, x currency, with strong gain in North American truck trailer and auxiliary power units. In Europe, organic revenues were up low-single digits. The adjusted operating margin for climate was 14.4% in the quarter, 20 basis points higher than second quarter 2014 due to productivity and volume mix, partially offset by other inflation, currency and higher investment spending.","Now, let's go to Slide 8. Second quarter revenues for the industrial segment were $785 million, down 1% on a reported basis and down 4% organically, which excludes the Cameron acquisition and currency. Air systems and services, power tools, fluid management and material management organic revenues were down mid-single digits versus last year.","Organic revenues in both North America and overseas market were down mid-single digits. As Mike noted, order and shipment trends in the U.S. were unfavorable in the first two months of the quarter and strengthened in June, with the push outs in customer request moved some revenue out of the quarter and impacted results.","For the balance of the year, based on the backlog and order trends over the past several weeks, we see some recovery, but are reducing our revenue and profit outlook for the second half in industrial to reflect the lower volume.","At the consolidated level that volume is essentially offset by an improved volume outlook for climate, we are also taking appropriate actions to increase productivity in the impacted businesses to mitigate as much of the profit impact as possible. Mike will take you through the entire forecast in a few minutes. Club Car organic revenues in the quarter were down slightly. Organic orders were up high-single digits versus prior year.","Industrial's adjusted operating margin of 13.3% was down compared with 16.4% last year. The Cameron acquisition, including non-purchase accounting impact and negative currency, account for 180 basis point of the decline. The remainder was due to lower volume, inflation and investment, partially offset by price and productivity.","Let's go to Slide 9. We took a few minutes to walk you through the agreement with the IRS. On July 17, we signed an agreement with the IRS to resolve all disputes and litigations surrounding the treatment of intercompany debt. The agreement encompasses the years 2002 to 2011.","We previously disclosed, the IRS had asserted Ingersoll-Rand out approximately $774 million in taxes plus additional amounts for penalties and interests during the 2002 to 2006 tax years. And the company expected the IRS to raise similar claims for the 2007 to 2011 period.","We believe that this agreement is in the best interest of the company and our shareholders. Once, final, it will provide greater certainty around the company's tax structure, effective tax rate and financial position going forward; and avoid the risk, expense and time commitment, inherent with litigation in a complex multi-year matter.","The agreement covers all aspect of the dispute before the U.S. Tax Court, the Appeals Division and the Examination Division of the IRS. Under the agreement, no penalties will apply with regard to any of the tax years 2002 to 2011. The company will pay $230 million in withholding tax, plus interest with respect to the 2002 to 2006 years. And no additional tax will be owed with respect to this intercompany debt and related matters for the years 2007 to 2011.","The next step is for the agreement to be reported to the Congressional Joint Committee on taxation or the JCT for review. The agreement cannot be finalized until the IRS considers the views, if any, expressed by the JCT about the agreement.","In connection with this agreement, we recognized a charge of $227 million to income tax expense in the second quarter of 2015. And expect to have a net cash outflow in the second half of 2015 of approximately $375 million, consisting of the $230 million in tax and $145 million of net interest. We will fund the payment from cash flow and commercial paper.","We've gotten some questions regarding how this will impact our capital allocation for the year and in the future. First, the amount of the payment is manageable within our current leverage targets. We expect no impact to our ratings. We still plan to repurchase $250 million of shares in 2015, as we've guided all year.","What has changed is that based on the pipeline we currently see, our M&A spend for the second half of 2015 will be pretty minimal. If opportunities emerge over the next few months, we'll evaluate them. But as of today, I don't see much usage of cash for M&A in the back half.","You may recall that we had a $350 million placeholder for M&A. That reduction in essence funds the majority of the IRS tax payment. For the future, this does not change our balanced capital allocation strategy, which includes investing in the businesses, paying out a competitive dividend, share repurchase to at a minimum offset share creep and value accretive M&A.","Now, let's go to Slide 10. For the second quarter working capital as a percentage of revenue was 5.8%. The increase versus prior year is primarily inventory. This include some incremental inventory related to the regional standards change in residential HVAC with good collections in the quarter with our days sales outstanding and our days payable outstanding, both improving over the prior year.","Our balance sheet remained very strong. We have no debt maturities this year. Our cash balance is at normal level. We continue to expect adjusted free cash flow in 2015 to be in the range of $950 million to $1 billion, which excludes the IRS payment.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Mike, to take you through guidance.","Michael Lamach","Great. Thank you, Sue. And please go to Slide 11. In the aggregate, our adjusted EPS forecast has not changed since last update in April, but within the guide we've made some adjustments based on market and performance trends. Let me walk you through some of the geographic regions that is probably the best way to give you some color.","North American institutional markets continue their recovery in the second quarter, and we are increasing our revenue forecast here. We also continue to see growth in commercial and industrial buildings and retrofit. Based on this, we expect mid-to-high single-digit growth for 2015 in North American in commercial HVAC markets.","The regional standards change in residential HVAC is going as planned. Monthly trends bounce around based on channel stocking levels and weather. At the end of June, channel inventory levels were at normal levels and distributors had begun restocking to maintain those levels.","We expect motor bearing unit shipments for the year to be flat-to-up low-single digits. To round out North America, we expect North American transport markets to be up high-single to low-double digit for 2015, reflecting good trends in trailer, truck and APUs.","North American industrial markets took a pause in the second quarter. Overall, we did see signs of stabilization in June, which continued so far in July in most businesses, but we did bring down the industrial markets growth outlook for the year, based on the trends. This particularly impacted some of our shorter-cycle businesses in Industrial, such as small-medium compressors, power-tools, material handling and fluid management.","Gulf markets are expected to be up low-single digits. We expect Latin American, Asian, European and Middle-East HVAC equipment markets in the aggregate to be up low-to-mid single digits, and constant currency was flat-to-down after considering currency.","Within those regions, Europe and Middle East have been relatively strong for us with flat-to-slightly up expectations in Asia, and a decline expected in Latin America. We expect European transport markets to be down including FX, but up at constant currency. Industrial markets in Europe, Middle East, Latin America and Asia are more challenging and we expect them to be flat-to-down for the full year.","Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect our reported revenues for full year 2015 to be up 4% to 5% versus 2014. Overall, foreign exchange will be a headwind of about 3 to 4 percentage points. We expect our acquisitions to add 2 to 3 points for the year, so for organic growth, we end up back at 4% to 5% range. That's unchanged from the prior forecast at the consolidated level. However, we did update the ranges for both segments.","Based primarily on a stronger outlook in North American HVAC and transport, we now expect climate revenues to be up 3% to 4% on a reported basis and 6% to 7% excluding currency, which was up 4% to 5% in our prior outlook.","In the industrial segment, revenues are forecasted to be in the range of up 6% to 7% on a reported basis and organic revenues to be up 1% to 2% versus 4% to 5% in the prior forecast reflecting softness we saw in the second quarter and continued weakness in overseas markets.","This forecast requires industrial to have roughly 2% to 2.5% organic growth in the second half versus about flat in the first half. We see a path of that based on the activity that we've seen over the past several weeks in our booked backlog.","Also, the Cameron compressor revenue calendarization, that's heavily skewed to the second half and specifically to the fourth quarter based on customer delivery dates that are already in the backlog. The orders are in for about 60% of Cameron's -- 60% of Cameron's revenues were in the back half, and we're focused on the operational execution and coordination, and require the customers needed to deliver on that schedule for those units.","For operating margins, we expect climate to be in the range of 13%, which was the midpoint of our prior guidance. We expect industrial adjusted margins to be approximately 14%. That's about 1 point lower than our prior guide, which was a range of 14.5% to 15.5%.","Slower industrial markets, particularly in some of our shorter-cycle businesses in North America, Asia and Latin America, geographies and markets where we generate higher than average margin, put pressure on those margins targets, and despite aggressive cost actions and the impacted areas, we do not see a path for the prior range. This does not change our long-term view in the larger potential business, but given the demand environment, we accelerated productivity and action to help mitigate the impact from lower volume.","Please go to Slide 12. Transitioning to earnings, our adjusted earnings per share guidance range is unchanged at $3.66 to $3.81, an increase of 10% to 14% versus 2014. That excludes acquisition inventory step-up, restructuring, the Venezuelan currency evaluation and the IRS agreement. Include those items the range reported EPS is $2.59 to $2.74.","We are reconfirming our adjusted EPS range. The forecast for the second half reflects some pluses and minuses versus our prior outlook, which are not netted. It reflects lower material inflation. In fact, it's actually deflation for the second half versus first half. And higher levels of productivity from cost control and reduction action, as well as, prioritization of higher returned productivity projects particularly in the businesses where we have seen some weaker market trends.","We plan to fully use the top end of the restructuring range at $0.05 that we had guided for the year. In parallel, we're evaluating additional actions and we'll trigger those when needed to further adjust the cost base to market conditions.","To focus on the third quarter guidance, see the right hand column on the chart. Third quarter 2015 revenues are forecasted to be up 4% to 5% on a reported basis and 5% to 6% on an organic basis. That compares to on organic growth of 3% in the second quarter. The higher growth rate comes from several areas.","Restocking the res HVAC business, which we are seeing that order rates thus far in July and correlates with channel inventory levels; delivery of the scheduled backlog and longer cycle businesses, such as applied HVAC and centrifugal air compressors; some recovery in certain of the shorter cycle industrial businesses such as Club Car, smaller compressors, and fluid management parts; and at this point we've seen improving order rate from low activity in April, May continuing through July.","For the third quarter, earnings per share forecasted to be $1.13 to a $1.17. We expect about $0.02 of restructuring costs, and adding these back to get some adjusted basis, adjusted EPS range is $1.15 to $1.19. We've provided EPS ranges for the third quarter in the appendix to give you the walk from year-to-year.","I'd conclude by reiterating that although that the midpoint of our earnings guidance from the second quarter, we didn't performed to our own expectation, potentially in terms of operating leverage and margin, we've already taken and we're going to continue to take action to generate the growth in earnings that we have been communicating to you.","Our strategies for growth and operational excellence have delivered a multi-year trend of excellent operating leverage, margin and earnings improvement and there remain the right strategies for the future. So our focus is to continue to grow earnings and cash flow through further implementing these strategies.","And now, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions. Joe, I'll turn it over to you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe","Mike, you sort of answered my first question a little bit in your closing remarks. The 5% or 6% organic for 3Q just feels on face, it's a little bit aggressive, but you talked about the swing on residential, and talked about the shipments and some of the backlog businesses and commercial HVAC business. But there's still some -- obviously you've seen recovery in short-cycle. I'm just wondering, what's the great promise do you have in that 5% to 6%. And if you got to haircut that number, would you be comfortable seeing some acceleration from the 3% we saw in 2Q?","Michael Lamach","I saw your note this morning, because Q2 and Q3 are fairly flat, and there was some question about the normal seasonality of the business, but there are few things that go on here.","First, third quarter North American commercial HVAC bookings, Thermo King, are going to continue at high levels and that really underpins the climate forecast there. We had excellent bookings and growth in second quarter. A lot of that in the schools market, so I'm pretty confident that we're not going to see weakness at North America with HVAC and TK in the quarter.","We also have seen the restocking of the res channel take place in late June and through July and believe it should match results where we had in our direct model. So that goes well. And we had a good quarter in res for Q2 and I think that will continue in Q3.","Now, China is interesting because it's a place you wouldn't expect for us to see a lot of growth, but if you go back to the fourth quarter of 2014 we had bookings of about 33% growth in the fourth quarter in China. A lot of that now ships in Q3 and those projects are being delivered into vertical markets that are growing, so we don't see any real risk in delivering those as planned.","Now, the industrial segment moves from really negative revenue comparisons in the second quarter to really a low-single digit rate and that's based on a couple of things. First, Club Car had a strong June, kind of plus 18% and that's really a delay, if you will, in Club Car business from Q2 to really Q3. So I think that we'll see that pick up.","We're seeing a tickup, an example, June's, our compressed air business was up by 22% in bookings, most of that being in small and midsized compressors, which we feel like we'll book in turn. Then as you look at late Q3, and I know this goes down into Q4, this is where we get into just delivering on the backlog of large machines, whether the Cameron or Ingersoll-Rand, so I think that it's a little bit maybe unusual from a seasonal pattern for us, but I think all the pieces makes sense that we should be able to deliver that.","We have put in place a lot of actions by compressing the productivity schedule, looking at discretionary spend, looking at investments spend, triggering many things now, and in fact things got weaker or they mature up in the top line, we're looking between the third and forth quarter to make sure that we manage the bottomline. So that's probably more than you asked for in your question, but that's the answer.","Nigel Coe","By the way 3% is still isn't too shabby, compared to some of your peers. The follow-on be the headwind from volume mix, the 30 bps this quarter, big swing from the plus 100 last quarter. It sounds to me that that's more of a geographic mix than a product mix. Can you maybe just confirm that and maybe talk about the big swing that we're seeing in Q-over-Q and what's caused that swing?","Michael Lamach","The mix, it's a bit of a worse case mix that we saw, if you set back, as your higher margin, industrial segment that is just down everywhere averaging at the gross margin of the business. And if you unpack that, you end up with a very disproportionate growth rate and deleverage happening in the highest margin businesses, which are going to be tool, fluid management, material handling.","Then if you look at it on a geographic basis, it's particularly weak in Asia and Latin America, which historically have been very good profitable markets. So when you look at that sort of mix challenge, it's squarely into the industrial segment for us, in essence, climate did well and offset mix with extra volume and so really hit expectations both for leverage and topline.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research.","Jeff Sprague","First, just a follow up on industrial, Mike, again, if you could, and then a separate question, but in industrial bookings that strength does sound quite remarkable just given kind of the general tone in industrial land, after this earnings season. Can you give a little color on kind of vertical markets where you're actually seeing that level of activity? And then as part of the industrial outlook, it does look like Cameron is actually coming down quite hard. You mentioned it's typically seasonally backend loaded, but certainly on a year-over-year basis, it looks like it was very weak here.","Michael Lamach","Jeff, actually Cameron is not as bad as you would think. If you go back to the original idea that we had, we thought that it was up $350 million to $365 million of business where based on that depending on which side of that you take, maybe $15 million to $25-ish million wider overall, it's heavily coming across the smaller businesses and smaller compressors, which go into small industrial customers across the board. So it was really sort of a pause in the industrial economy in the U.S., which was quite unexpected.","Most of these things are going to be stock products, they built and didn't turn in the quarter, and so it was pretty tough for that. It's also the business that in June was up 22%, largely in small compressors. We also saw some improvements in fluid business. I mentioned, Club Car was up nearly 20% in June. Haven't seen quite the increase back yet in the tools business, and the material handling for us is really our only oil and gas exposed business and that continues to be very weak there.","So the backlog, as I think about big machines, is at this point in time pretty well in the bag. The catch or the key for us here is being sure to deliver that. I mentioned that Cameron's business is 40% skewed toward the fourth quarter, and so that is actual customer request for delivery on big machines, and so it's more of an execution of the backlog question there for the full year.","Susan Carter","Mike and Jeff, I think we might have confused you just a tad with one of the slides in terms of Cameron. So let me try to add a little bit of color to what Mike has already said. In the second quarter, there were a mix of revenues in the Cameron business, but it was perhaps nearly 10% of the industrial mix, so it wasn't a big part of that and some of that was actually revenue that shifted over to the third quarter and the back half of the year.","On Slide 11 where we talked about organic reported revenues, and we said 2% to 3% for acquisitions and 3% to 4% for FX, our original guidance for the year, as you well know, was that we were going to have about 3% on acquisitions offset by 3% in FX. This a little bit of the rounding puts and takes. I do expect the acquisitions to be right about 3% and FX maybe slightly over 3%, but we won't be at the outer margins of that guidance. So I would say, let's call it back to more of the 3% on acquisitions and maybe just slightly more than that on the FX side.","Jeff Sprague","And just on raw materials. Mike, you touched it a little bit as you were wrapping up your concluding comments. But can you give us a little bit more color on how that plays? Obviously, we're in a pretty severe industrial metal deflation right now. Obviously, you've got hedging and other things, but can you give us a little bit of an update on how we think this should play through? How big of an impact do you see in the back half? And do you see that really undermining anyway your attempts on the other side on the pricing environment?","Susan Carter","So Jeff, let me give that a shot. As we look at commodities, first of all, we've said all year that the commodities would turn to a deflationary environment in the second half of the year. And so if we look at that back half, we've got about 70% of our copper bought, and about 40% of our aluminum bought, so that deflationary environment is going to flow through what we've got in the back half. So I don't see a big risk to that. And it does help us from a first half to second half comparison in terms of materials.","On the pricing side, and what we talked about with pricing, we consider that we still want to have a positive spread between the direct material inflation in price of about 20 basis points to 30 basis points for the year. That's where we were in the second quarter. We were roughly about 20 basis points.","And so I think the back half material deflation is going to give us a little bit wider gap or some more positives there. And we still expect to have some positive price. And the overarched on price and material inflation is that we build our pricing capabilities to get paid for delivering higher value to our customers and to anticipate and react to movements in commodities. And I think that's what we're doing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Berry from Susquehanna.","Robert Berry","A quick follow-up on the price cost. I think it was down 0.2 in 1Q and up 0.2 in 2Q, so call it neutral for the year. Does that imply that to get to the 20 to 30 for the year, it would be kind of 40 to 60 in the back half, is that kind of order of magnitude?","Susan Carter","I think it would be in the 20 to 30 range and a little bit higher than that to get us to in a range, as we said 20 to 34 for the full year, so just slightly higher than that. But again, that's really the material coming down. As you know, we had a slight amount of material inflation in the first quarter, very minimal in the second quarter. So that turns deflationary in back half.","Michael Lamach","I mean, Robert, your rough math works. Fundamentally, as materials coming down fast, price won't come down as fast, and so you get a little bit bigger spread in the back half of the year, unless something happens with pricing and it just is driving the marketplace, I think that that would be a case.","We would see that from a commercial perspective, things have been weak in Latin America and Asia for sometime. So I don't see the pricing deteriorating further there. So I don't think the risk there is great. It does support falling commodities prices sort of moving slower and the spread widening in the back half.","Robert Berry","And then maybe just a follow-up on the productivity actions. If you kind of put aside the price cost on materials, it sounds like those are stepped up. Could you quantify how much kind of incremental productivity you now expect versus what you had been expecting? And maybe in that you can touch on, in particular, corporate, I think that was expected to be kind of 230 basis points to 235 basis points. It looked like it really stepped down in 2Q. How was that tracking?","Michael Lamach","You're right now, Robert. It's probably 30 basis points more productivity in the back half versus the front half. And then, in addition to that, we're really putting together a brief forecast for the balance of the year and reevaluating any sort of investment to the spend and timings.","Even some of the CapEx just to kind of go back through that and scrub it through the back half of the year. So we're looking to not only get the 30 basis points second to the front half, but really get a bit of a natural hedge built in through some productivity actions being built in to protect the guess forecast we're giving it.","Susan Carter","In the unallocated corporate, Robert, we're taking to sort of 220 basis points to 225 basis points for the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell","I just wanted a bit more color on what you're seeing in Asia and China, specifically on the Trane side. I guess your margins in Q2 in climate maybe a little bit less than some people have thought. Was there a mix impact from Asia being down within that? And then maybe just give some color on the bookings you're seeing in Asia now, I think carryover is down very significantly in Q2.","Michael Lamach","Well, any sort of mix in climate maybe to start there first would be that on the res side, we're probably one of the few people that actually mix down the 13% and 14%, sort of the more we pull up the channel and the more we pull the product range. We tend to mix down just a little bit there.","We also mix down a little bit when you look at European transport. And this is really weakness in Eastern Europe that it's kind of pulling down some pretty good results in Western Europe, as an example. So there are minor things happening within there. Latin America has been a really soft market for climate, very profitable market for us. There's really no recovery happening in Latin America as we speak. And so those are the mix drags you see to the climate at present.","Now, China, it's not unusual. I can think about last couple of years, where we get the seesaw happening between strong bookings and weak revenue and so forth. And granted, it might be weak two quarters, strong two quarters. But as an example, the fourth quarter bookings we had last year kind of coming through into strong revenue in Q3 and good revenue in Q4.","When we look at Q3 bookings in China, and this of course is based on pipeline of real deals and real projects, we also expect a strong bookings in Q3 and in Q4 for China in the HVAC business. This happens to be some of the broker markets that we're working in. We'd not be surprised when we find it to be mid-teens, and quarter three is an example in HVAC for bookings. But it's a seesaw there to a certain extent.","I think that industrial in China remains weak. I know the power consumption, as an example, was down 2% in China last quarter. Now, compare that to the reported 7% growth in the quarter, and you get a difference between what's happening sort of on ground with a proxy as power consumption and what's reported in terms of GDP growth. And obviously, the more you're focused on heavy industries, sort of the worse off you're going to be, before you're focused on healthcare, data centers, food beverage, pharmaceutical, probably the better you're going to be in that mess.","Julian Mitchell","And then just my follow-up would be with IRS thing potentially an out of the way, you talked about greater clarity or grater certainty in the release on the future effective tax rate. I just wondered if there could be any mechanism to think about bringing that down a little bit in the long run?","Susan Carter","Julian, I think we keep the range sort of in our 24 to 26 range with sort of that midpoint at 25. We haven't evaluated anything that would change that from a longer term rate basis.","Operator","And our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Buckingham Research.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Just on some of this near-term improvement Mike that you've seen in the industrial business, I guess, the 22% bookings growth in short-cycle industrial. I would imagine that, given some of the push outs you saw in 2Q that there might be a little bit of hedge to the second half. Can you help us maybe outline the difference between what the backlog supports, what the orders are telling you and what you're baking in the guidance?","So I guess maybe the long way around there is that, do you have more push outs baked in? Because I guess from an industrial perspective this doesn't feel like the type of environment, where people are pulling in business and it does seem like there is still a lot of reliance on those fourth quarter bigger projects shipping on time?","Michael Lamach","Yes, Josh, when you look at sort of if you stand a month in front of the next quarter and look at the visibility that we have at that business, it might be somewhere between 45% and 60%. The other 40% to 55% really comes through those short cycles, small compressors tools, fluid management, business like Club Car, material handling, and larger compressors tend to have just a bit more visibility in what we're looking at.","What's a little bit unusual knowledge, as we think about how the Cameron business works, and this is really historical, if you look at the profile of Cameron, they're a big back half, big fourth quarter type of company. If you think about there are top five to 10 customers, their pattern every single year is delivery around that time of the year and so that happens.","It's got the benefit of really improving visibility there, and of course we've always had good visibility on our big machine. So it's a pretty fair forecast kind of looking ahead, because we can see that big machine. We can see the Club Car business to the balance of the year. To a certain extent, you're guessing on the overall economy, as it relates to the tools business and some of the small compressor business.","So if you had sort of handicapped all of this, there's probably, if you want to net it out further, maybe more upside that could happen on the HVAC businesses, maybe a little bit more weakness on the short-cycle industrials. But at the end of the day, I think we've had it really close and fairly.","Josh Pokrzywinski","And then, just a follow-up on maybe the margin into that on the industrial side. Can you dimension out maybe what was more of a surprise factor in 2Q on the margin versus what gets better by managing that in real-time? And how that relates to kind of the better backlog outlook? So how much of the problems in 2Q just go away, because you're now on top of things and more surprises versus the revenue uptick?","Michael Lamach","Let me kind of walk you from 16.4% last year to the 13.3%, just a big piece, and you can tell me, so you'll be having your impression about what it can be more top of and what it couldn't. The biggest piece of what we saw was volume and mix, which was 210 basis points of the difference. The FX piece is 110 basis points negative. And then Cameron it's 70 basis points. But that's more mathematical, Cameron adding revenue in that small OI.","And now moving toward the back of the year with a really over-absorbed Q3 and they've really absorbed Q4, over-absorbed Q4, so you kind of balance that out. You also end up with investments and other, which were about 1 point, and almost actually the majority of that is just a legal accrual on an old item.","So the other way back, you had productivity over other inflation of 120 basis points and price over the direct inflation, which is 60 basis points, for the good guys around productivity in place a 180 basis points. I don't think investments and others is a drag, I think Cameron turned itself around just through absorption in the factories.","And then volume and mix is what we've been talking about. You got to place a bet on some of that, both on short-cycle high-margin businesses and some geographic spread on that. But all-in-all, the plans we've taken to address this really are contingencies around if things remain weak.","And so I would look for productivity, so then significant would be better than other inflation. And for price, this will be better than direct inflation in this fast-reducing direct material environment that we're in, the price material that's deflating basically.","Operator","Next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs.","Evelyn Chow","This is actually Evelyn Chow for Joe. Maybe just returning a bit to your climate margin guide, I understand that these sales channel that impacts mix, but it seems like your second half margin guidance implies kind of a normalization of incrementals. Can you help us thinking that the puts and takes in margins, as it relates mix, investments spending and other items?","Michael Lamach","Well, I mean, leveraging climate just in the quarter, it's pretty good. So it was right around 25%. If you take Frigoblock out, it was right around 30%. Just looking at Q3 and frankly Q4, it starts looking around 30% again. So there's really not much of a difference in the leverage that we're seeing and expecting around the climate business, even with the res mix. So maybe you want to fine tune your question, you're missing a little bit, but it's fairly flat and linear there.","Evelyn Chow","And then maybe just returning to your comment on China HVAC bookings, potentially being up in the mid-teens in the back half, that seems a little bit in odds from what we heard in that region from your competitors. So what's driving the strength in your business?","Michael Lamach","It's really not unusual for competitor A to have bookings in one quarter and debookings in the second quarter, just based on what they're working on, and the customer order profiles for major projects. We see it all the time. When we're up 15%, 20%, and look good compared to a competitor and you're flipping around and it may look bad. But all-in-all, one quarter, two quarter differences in the competition is really what we're talking about.","There is some differences though, depending on what competitors you talk about. Clearly, we don't have much of a presence in the res business in China. And so I think we've been helped by that, somewhat insulated by that. And we tend to focus on markets, again like pharma, healthcare, electronics, the data centers, food and bev, where we've done better.","Evelyn Chow","And then maybe just returning to Cam briefly, could you provide maybe a little bit more color around what you've seen in the three main businesses there this quarter?","Susan Carter","So Evelyn, let me take a look at where we are in the market for the centrifugal compressor business. So first of all, on the processed gas side, we're really more exposed to gas than to oil and gas. So we're seeing a little bit of growth from natural gas and from LNG, and particularly in the U.S. In the Middle East, we do have some project delays that are related more to oil prices, but we see petrochemical doing okay. And we expect power generation to grow for the business.","On the engineered air side, we're seeing some of the industrial gas business, particularly in Asia with air separation declining. That's really due to overcapacity in that area. Lower steel demand also has an impact on the engineered air segment. For plant air, we see a slow recovery in North America. So we've got some good markets in auto, in food and beverage, pharma, electric power. So North America stronger, Europe and Asia is slightly softer in the plant air side.","And then the fourth really piece of the Cameron centrifugal compressors is the aftermarket. And the aftermarket is stable, but we still have some more opportunities in synergies, again, on the aftermarket side of that business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa","Sorry, I might have missed this, but what did you say about the resi, how resi kind of ended the quarter and start in July again on your independent distribution channel again. Did you give numbers around that?","Michael Lamach","Yes, so to go back to the beginning, we saw wholly-owned up double-digits. And in the quarter we had independents down roughly the same, actually down double-digits. And then if you look at that and break it apart further, April and May were incredibly slow, first couple of weeks were frankly a little bit of slow. And last couple of weeks of June were record levels, record levels of shipments, that we have seen, and we're seeing that through July.","My guess is that it's going to look a little bit more like the sell-through that we had with wholly-owned. All that, Steve, gets into kind of maybe flat-to-low single-digit, motor bearing sort of markets for the year. But pretty strong last four weeks, five weeks.","Steve Tusa","So what do you think resi can do in the third quarter, assuming kind of weather is stable in your total resi revs?","Michael Lamach","Yes, great question. I mean, if that's the case, you're probably looking at double-digits, low-double digit.","Steve Tusa","And as far as the margin dynamics there, I mean are you starting see -- I know you guys redesigned your 14 SEER. What are you seeing on the margin front there? I would assume that's not fully reflected yet, because there was clearly some pretty wide dynamic in your number. So maybe just talk about how you can convert that with the new 14 SEERs?","Michael Lamach","Yes, 14 SEER is good, Steve. 13 SEER is what it always has been. And I think if that really comes out of the market, and I would assume for the most part, it would be out of the market relative to HP units by August at that this rate. This is the market that PE pumps in the market live longer than that, but I think that'll you see the margins start to look better and mix back up.","I think that for the res HVAC business this year for us was a good growth, probably shared gain and margin expansion again. So I think that they're playing it right, they're right on cue. Good launches coming in the fourth quarter relative to the heating season, those were on track. I think that that's kind of one more nice sort of arrow that they've got to shoot in the third and fourth quarter.","Steve Tusa","And then lastly on just on your '16 margin targets for industrial, I mean are those kind of off the table here now?","Michael Lamach","No, it's too soon to really tell on this. I think we need to get through and look at the delivery on Cameron for the year, look at the bookings going in, but structurally nothing changes for me. I guess, before coming out and shooting from the hip, I want to make sure that we've had as much of '15 as we can, look at the bookings, and the really big stuff, and just make sure that we're giving a number that we can live with for '16. So it's too early for me to do that.","Steve Tusa","Can you buyback stock here? Sorry last one. Do you have the desire to buyback any stock here in the second half of the year, if the stock kind of stays where it is today?","Michael Lamach","Yes, we're going to buy it all back that we talked about. So it's $250 million.","Susan Carter","The $250 million.","Michael Lamach","Yes, $250 million is what you can expect.","Operator","Next question come from Steven Winoker from Bernstein.","Steven Winoker","Mike, could you comment on the inventory turn number, I guess it came down from 7% to just over 6% in climate versus industrial, what's going on there, a little more detail?","Michael Lamach","When you end up with sort of getting an air pocket come through and you built inventory and its sitting a bit particularly on those quick turning stock business as you get caught a little bit away sitting there. You also get caught needing to pull some production days out, because you've built inventory and so that even compounds some of the margin problems you see when you've over built. So we've got to work that out in Q3.","And then you're going to see obviously the res business start to really move inventory levels down, as you get the independent restocking taking place late June or early July, so no question in my mind that by the end of the year, we'd have turned to the right place at that point. And the teams are working on very detailed plans that they come up by month-by-month on a glide path, certainly by December, and we're doing our best to pull it forward into the third quarter just have a better chance to go and collect it in the fourth quarter.","Steven Winoker","And it's not weighted disproportionally to industrial that the challenge on that one or it is?","Michael Lamach","Well, res HD would be a big part of that. And the balance would be industrial FX.","Susan Carter","Yes, it's about 50-50. It's not over weighted to industrial.","Steven Winoker","And then on the IRS litigation, assuming that that -- sorry, the settlement that that's all finalized, you're just looking through to Q when your exposures that you had called out publicly before looked like just adding all that up, you were closer to, it looked like something like $1.8 billion to $2 billion depending on how you count the '07 to '11, but this gets rid off all of that, and there is nothing else that's pending out there, right, so this completely removes the litigation as called out in the filing, is that it correct?","Michael Lamach","'02 through '11 all of issues and items are addressed, so again a lot of clarity on things. And then if you look at sort of '12 and on, I mean these are just normal open audit that the IRS would normally be working within any company. It's something where if you've gone from '02 through '11 and you have changed the '12 through '15 in terms of how you're sort of looking at managing your taxes, it would be very hard to assume, it would assert anything that was already agreed to between '02 and '11. So my guess would be although that '12 through '15 is not part of writing, it would be logical to assume that you wouldn't see those same issues asserted, since we have sort of settled that already.","Steven Winoker","And then maybe just one last one, on non-resi, one more in-depth there, you guys are really, it sounds like significant strengths, you mentioned, schools, but any place elsewhere that's giving you confidence of really, I guess, long lasting rebound, Mike?","Michael Lamach","Well, it's interesting for us. I would say, Steve, now as that the institutional markets were really strong, but we're pulling that with controls of performance contracting. And the performance contracting projects, we've booked one kind of in the mid-$30 million range for school this past quarter. We've got some very large ones booking and other verticals in Q3 and Q4 larger than that. They're slow burns, 18 months to 2 years in terms of the projects cycle they have to be managed.","They put a little bit of pressure on the gross margin, because you end up a lot of paths through sub-contracts, but they are accretive to the contribution margins, because all of your cost are embedded in those projects, right. Everything down at the commissions for the sales people, if you will, are embedded in the project margin.","So I think you might see some larger numbers start coming out there. I think a nice part about it, these are 10, 15, 20 year yields where its equipment, controls, service all bundled together. And it's a really nice project management business that's helping us from a energy retrofit perspective, just being able to take on and do really large projects effectively for customers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc.","Jeff Hammond","So it looks like you're coming up against some tougher order comps, and I think you mentioned, China up 33 in Q4 and I think you had some really good order growth in back half Europe last year. As you look at kind of quoting activity and thinking about that tougher comp, how should we think about order momentum into the back half?","Michael Lamach","Quoting activity at commercial HVAC in North America is very strong. Performance in Europe in HVAC continues to be very strong double-digits, again strong, continues to go well in Middle East, same thing double digits, teens type of growth there. Low activity is in really Latin America.","Choppy activity as we see really through China, but all of Asia Pacific, and then really an industrial big machines, Sue, kind of highlighted there with strengths, which I won't reiterate that. Probably a little bit more than choppiness, comes back into some of the plant there where you could see some air pockets from once a month, quarter-to-quarter that I think is just indicative of the overall economy.","Jeff Hammond","And then just on residential, I mean you mentioned kind of mixing down, and it seems like the market is kind of going the other way, so can you just talk strategically how you're kind of positioning that business and how you feel like you're doing competitively, it seems like you have a little bit lower growth rates versus some of the competitors?","Michael Lamach","Q2, that wouldn't be the case actually. The data we got from HR would say it was really good quarter for us in Q2 and actually year-to-date, so it's little tough with all the data you get and reporting people do, but the benefit is, at least the North America and U.S with the HR data we're able to see that relative to the marketplace. So we had a really good quarter and it's been good six month period there.","It's hard for our business, Trane, American standard to anything, but mixdown, because historically we only played at one end of the spectrum, so whole strategy has been for years now to build a product line that runs the gamut, so the dealer has the opportunity to use the product line across all aspects of price points customers wants to pay.","So it would not be at all unusual for us to see motor-bearing units going up and obviously as you felt '13, '14 the mix goes down a little bit, nothing unusual or unplanned about that at all. In fact, I would say, reiterate that we're getting more of our channel base and a dealer base to use more of the product across their businesses. That piece of parts business and it sees everything down the road including replacements too so, so it's all good.","Operator","And our last question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","Just had a follow up on the IRS settlement, and Sue, said there would be no change at this time to the tax rate. But would there be any change to how you're booking intercompany debt, is your P&L affect, and would we be able to see that?","Susan Carter","No, Deane, there shouldn't really be that much of a change, and so really that change has already happened. So if you think back to the inversion debt, which was a big part of this settlement that inversion debt was gone at the end of 2011 and then we've simplified the structure even as we went through the Allegion spend in 2013 and we've really been very conscious of making sure that we're using our IRS domicile in the right ways for moving cash around the globe, but not really being aggressive on any of the different items. We've said a number of times that we've been playing it right down the middle of the fairway. And that has been the case for the last few years and so I don't expect any change to that at all.","Deane Dray","Just last question, with copper at a six year low, I know you've always stayed very disciplined in terms of doing your laddered purchasing. You've got 70% already purchased. But with copper at these levels would you ever consider locking in or extending the duration of these hedges or advanced purchasing.","Susan Carter","Yes, I think we have a commodity team that looks at all of these different items and a policy that gives us some flexibility when we do have prices that are at an all time low, and so that's something that we continuously monitor and the sourcing group is doing a good job of making sure that where it makes sense that we take advantage of that.","Deane Dray","Has that happened yet?","Michael Lamach","We got about a quarter unlocked in Q3 and about a-third unlocked in Q4, so there is a little bit more room there than we normally have to go take advantage of the stock rates anyway, Deane.","End of Q&A","Operator","Thank you. I'd like to hand the call back over to Janet Pfeffer for closing remarks, please.","Janet Pfeffer","Thank you, Earl, and thank you everyone. Joe and I will be around if you have any follow-up questions. Have a good day. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day."]}}
